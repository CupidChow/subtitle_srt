1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,240
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,680
We are...

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,410
leaving Korea.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,520
- What?
- What?

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,920
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,920
Leave Korea?

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,920
Tomorrow,

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,690
we leave for Hong Kong.

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,460
Hong Kong?

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,730
What? How random.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
I mean...

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,800
Why are you suddenly saying
we'll go to Hong Kong?

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,670
The police will soon hand over my case
to prosecutors.

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,840
At this rate, I might end up behind bars.

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,440
Behind bars? By that, do you mean...

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,880
you could go to jail?

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,550
Wait, so you're saying
you've decided to run away to Hong Kong...

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,820
because you don't want to go to jail?

19
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,220
Run away, my foot!

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,120
Why would I run away
when I did nothing wrong? You brat!

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,430
This darned country.

22
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,730
I am sick of this place
and can't live here anymore.

23
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,930
They're accusing this innocent man
of a crime.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,170
This country is full of thieves
waiting for a chance...

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,300
to steal money from others.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,240
I really am sick of this place.

27
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,910
Even so, it makes no sense for us
to suddenly move to Hong Kong.

28
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,280
Will that solve this problem?

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,480
I don't know about that,

30
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,250
but until they catch that jerk,
Jang Tae Poong,

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,310
I will not come back to Korea.

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Why must I put up with all this nonsense
because of him?

33
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,820
I'm so angry that
I can't hold myself back anymore.

34
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,130
Honey, let's not do this.
Let's wait, okay?

35
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,200
The prosecutors might manage
to prove your innocence.

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,260
As if.

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,430
I don't trust anyone.

38
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,870
I should...

39
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,370
just leave.
That's the best solution for now.

40
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,310
But I can't even go shopping
because we have no money now.

41
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,540
What's the point of going to Hong Kong?

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,910
Forget it. I won't go.

43
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,740
I won't go either.

44
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,650
Whatever happens, I'll stay here.

45
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,650
And that's that.

46
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,920
If I'm not here,

47
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,250
all the creditors and cops...

48
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,620
will harass you guys
and won't leave you alone.

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,090
Can you really handle that?

50
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,960
If they end up requesting
a travel ban on you,

51
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,770
you won't be able to leave
even if you want to!

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,710
The flight's at 4 p.m. tomorrow.

53
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,680
Meet me at the airport.
If you guys don't come,

54
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,480
I'll leave by myself.

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Just know that.

56
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,770
What are you doing?

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,640
Oh, honey. So I looked into it.

58
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,110
When you have money sitting in a bank,

59
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,080
the bank only protects your money
up to 50,000 dollars.

60
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,010
What? So what if the bank
goes out of business or something?

61
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,810
Then we'll lose everything
except for the 50,000 dollars?

62
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,480
Yes, I think so.

63
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,950
We should split the money
into multiple bank accounts.

64
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,560
Yes, we should.

65
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,790
I had no idea since our account balance...

66
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,890
was never above 50,000 dollars
in the past.

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,900
Oh, right. Did you ask Mr. Choi
how much an apartment unit would go for?

68
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,300
Yes, I did.

69
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,740
But he said even a small apartment unit...

70
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,840
would go for over a million dollars.

71
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,780
My goodness. Average Joes like us...

72
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,050
could never even dream
of owning an apartment unit.

73
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,980
- Oh, boy.
- What? Average Joes?

74
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,950
Why? Did I say something wrong?

75
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,720
Think about it, honey.

76
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,090
What kind of Average Joe...

77
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,260
has over 20 million dollars
in their bank account?

78
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,930
We may still look like Average Joes,

79
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,600
but we're rich now.

80
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,940
My gosh, you're right. We are rich indeed.

81
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,040
Goodness. I still can't believe
I have so much money in my bank account.

82
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,340
I still can't get used to it.

83
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,080
- Honey.
- Yes?

84
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,180
Look at this. This is...

85
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,150
a new apartment complex
going up in the adjacent neighborhood.

86
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,190
I went and checked it out
with the neighbors.

87
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,790
It's so amazing.

88
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,760
What do you think, honey?
Isn't it so awesome?

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
What?

90
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,660
Well, it does look nice.

91
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,330
Take a good look.

92
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,070
Honey.

93
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,970
Let's move here.

94
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,170
What?

95
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,040
To this apartment complex?

96
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,640
You see,
I don't even want to live in Gangnam.

97
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,250
If I could live in an apartment like this,
I'd be satisfied for the rest of my life.

98
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,950
What do you think, honey?

99
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,620
Doesn't it look nice?

100
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,050
Well, yes. It does, but...

101
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,820
Honey, what's with that reaction?

102
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,790
You don't like it?

103
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,090
It's not that.

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,100
Honey, about our plan to move.
Do we really have to move?

105
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,600
What do you mean?

106
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,870
"Do we really have to move?"

107
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,540
Moving is expensive,

108
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,180
and it won't be easy
to find a decent place.

109
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,450
And as you know,

110
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,050
I grew up in this neighborhood.

111
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,650
That's exactly why we should move.

112
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,820
You can't live in the same neighborhood
all your life.

113
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,020
You should try living
in a different neighborhood.

114
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,060
Even frogs that spend their entire lives
in one pond get belittled...

115
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,130
for lacking experience.
You know that saying too.

116
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,930
Well, I know that.

117
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,000
But as you know, the house
where my dad and I used to live...

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,300
was where the Daewoon Building is now.

119
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,100
It hasn't been easy
running a business there,

120
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,410
but I feel as though
my father is embracing me when I'm there,

121
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,510
so I like it there.

122
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,540
The same goes for this house.

123
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,850
It's the closest house
to the Daewoon Building,

124
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,610
and this neighborhood is filled
with so many memories.

125
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,980
Except for the fact
that Mu Chul owns this house,

126
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,950
I feel very comfortable here,
to be honest.

127
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,460
That's how you feel.
I don't feel the same way.

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,130
I am sick of this house
and the Daewoon Building.

129
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,390
I'm so sick of them
that it makes me shudder.

130
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,370
When I was little,
my family stayed with Mi Ja's family...

131
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,900
because my mom worked
as their housekeeper.

132
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
Even as an adult,

133
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,440
I was still poor
and had to rent this place from them.

134
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,910
I want to step out of Mi Ja's shadow...

135
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,340
as soon as possible.

136
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,380
Do you even know what that's like?

137
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,580
Of course, I know what it's like.

138
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,520
But our situation has changed.

139
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,020
Back then, we had to rent from them
because we had no money,

140
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,590
but we have money now,

141
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,320
and we're choosing not to move.

142
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,820
To me, it is the same thing!

143
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,090
I just hate that I have to
keep seeing Mi Ja while living here.

144
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,960
Honey.

145
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,430
Fine.

146
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,830
You can stay here.

147
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,240
I'll buy a new apartment unit
and move out.

148
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,240
Let's enjoy our twilight years...

149
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,710
while living separately in the places
where we each want to live.

150
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,410
Wait, honey!

151
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,920
Goodness. This is nuts.

152
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,020
This punk. What's taking him so long?

153
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,920
Hold on, by the way...

154
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,390
How much will I have left
after paying the hospital bill?

155
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,900
The hospital bill is around
60,000 dollars.

156
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,570
So, 1 million minus 60,000
equals 940,000 dollars.

157
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,570
Okay. We won't have to
worry about money...

158
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,540
for Min Yong's treatment
until he grows up and gets married.

159
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,640
I can earn the rest of the money
by working hard.

160
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,310
By the way,

161
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,480
I heard Mu Chul was scammed.

162
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,180
What if he loses all his property?

163
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,020
Gosh, I doubt it.

164
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,820
That guy is so wealthy.

165
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,990
He won't fall just because of this.

166
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,140
Hey!

167
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,240
Gosh, you scared me.

168
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,610
Why are you so late?

169
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,250
Here is the full amount in cash.

170
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,390
And this is the contract.

171
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,130
Are you going to read it?

172
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,270
Of course.
I have to make sure it's correct.

173
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,940
Punk, isn't that obvious?

174
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,710
Right. Go ahead.

175
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,350
That looks good. Next...

176
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,880
This part is...

177
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,150
Wait! What is this?

178
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,190
Why, you little...

179
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,660
What? Why?

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,430
This clause in the contract.

181
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,800
Why do I have to cooperate
with the repair work?

182
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Take that out!

183
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,740
Oh, okay.
Is that all that needs to be fixed?

184
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,240
I'll take that clause out.

185
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,710
You punk.
I told you to do things properly.

186
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,350
Darn it.

187
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,360
All right. Good.

188
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,930
What about your commission?

189
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,090
Did you take that out?

190
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,230
No.

191
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,360
That's 300,000 dollars. All of it.

192
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,600
What? Why?

193
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,140
I sold the building
for a million dollars less...

194
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,270
than what you said.

195
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,770
Forget about it this time.
I won't take a commission.

196
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,480
But you said you needed money
for your son's surgery.

197
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,080
Why won't you take it?

198
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,180
It wouldn't be enough money anyway.

199
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,950
I borrowed money from somewhere else.
Don't mind me.

200
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,220
Is that so?

201
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,190
Fine, then.

202
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,650
Goodness, man.

203
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,890
I guess you still have a conscience.

204
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,730
But I'm going to take my fair share
next time, and that's final.

205
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,860
Not more, not less. Exactly...

206
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,130
the commission as set by the law.

207
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,300
So, don't ask me to lower my commission...

208
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,710
or anything like that.

209
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,010
All right, man. My goodness. So?

210
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,350
Did your son's surgery go well?

211
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,250
Are you curious about my son's surgery?

212
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
What?

213
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,250
You don't even care.
Why would you even ask?

214
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,390
Whether my son's surgery went well or not,

215
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,660
it's none of your business.
Isn't that right?

216
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,100
Hey, why are you picking a fight again?
I ought to...

217
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,130
Do you want to go? You punk.

218
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,070
The surgery went fine,
so let's stop talking about that.

219
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,440
Also, I registered the transfer...

220
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,270
of the Daewoon Building.

221
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,010
Even registering the transfer
gives me legal rights.

222
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,510
So, they won't be able
to go after that anymore.

223
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,680
Gosh, all right.

224
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,790
I'm so relieved to hear that. Oh, boy.

225
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,950
Then, with this money,

226
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,460
you can pay the transfer tax
for two of your buildings.

227
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,830
Should I take care of these two to start?

228
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,600
No, leave this money.

229
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,870
Ask the buyer when she can pay
the remaining amount.

230
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,230
The remaining amount? Already?

231
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,500
Yes.

232
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,340
I'm going to take this money,

233
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,670
and tomorrow,

234
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,210
I'm leaving for Hong Kong.

235
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,750
Hong Kong?

236
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,580
Why are you going to Hong Kong
all of a sudden?

237
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,050
It's a long story.

238
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,750
I'll stay there for the time being.

239
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,020
Ask for the remaining amount soon.

240
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,060
I'm not sure if that'll be possible.
It's a big amount.

241
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,360
Then, once I get that money,

242
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,460
I can take care of the transfer tax...

243
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,930
and transfer the building
under my name, right?

244
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,570
That's right. My gosh.

245
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,800
By the way, about putting the buildings
under your name.

246
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,670
Don't ever tell my wife about it.

247
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,410
What? Why?

248
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,440
She has been asking to put them
under her name for a while,

249
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,850
but I didn't agree to it.

250
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,310
If she hears
that I transferred them to someone else,

251
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,880
she might get mad,
so keep it a secret, punk.

252
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,090
All right. Don't worry.

253
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,620
Keep that in mind.

254
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,160
No matter what,
the most important thing is...

255
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,230
the Daewoon Building.

256
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,660
No matter what happens,

257
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,330
you must hold onto that one.

258
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,670
Until...

259
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,510
I can get it back...

260
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,310
Hold onto it,

261
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,810
and keep it safe and sound, man. Got it?

262
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,650
Got it, man. Don't worry.

263
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,520
My goodness.

264
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,320
This is so upsetting.

265
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,930
- I'm off.
- Already?

266
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,270
Hey, why are you leaving so soon?

267
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,510
Hey, are you really going to Hong Kong?

268
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,040
That's what I said.
Why do you keep asking?

269
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,610
I'll be going.

270
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,580
Hey, Han Mu Chul.

271
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,120
Take care of yourself.

272
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,680
I'm sorry.

273
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,110
I'll be sure to pay you back
for this debt I owe you.

274
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,080
Why are you both home today, Mom and Dad?

275
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,020
Aren't you going to work?

276
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,760
I was fired from my job.

277
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,930
Really?

278
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,600
Then, will you take me to my lessons, Mom?

279
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,960
Are you so happy that your mom is jobless?

280
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,600
Of course.

281
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,500
All the other kids come with their moms.

282
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm the only one
who comes with my grandma.

283
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,110
Now, I can go to my lessons with you.
Right, Mom?

284
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,310
Come on, Ji Woo. Just go with Grandma.

285
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,350
Your mom is tired.

286
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,580
Her mom is alive and well.
Why should I have to take her?

287
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,320
But Mi Jin does
all the cooking these days.

288
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,990
She's working so hard
to make all of our meals these days.

289
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,920
I just mean, we should all do our parts.

290
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,060
Then you should go, punk.

291
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,390
Her mom does the cooking.

292
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,000
I clean and do the laundry.

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
So you can go.

294
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,730
But I go to my part-time job.

295
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,870
You already know that, Mom.
Why are you complaining?

296
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,970
I'll go, Mother. Don't worry.

297
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,570
Don't be ridiculous, honey.

298
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,610
Thanks for the expensive meal.

299
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,250
Mom.

300
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,380
Keeping your mouth shut
would've been better than this.

301
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,550
Are you trying to make me look bad
or something?

302
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,820
But I was just... Honey.

303
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,030
Why is everyone picking on me?

304
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,900
I'm off to my part-time job.

305
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,640
Stop trying to get off easy
with your part-time job.

306
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,770
You know you have to find
a proper job within a month, right?

307
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,310
I know, okay?

308
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,840
Dad, didn't you see my fortune teller?

309
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,180
The fortune teller?

310
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,450
Your grandma took it.

311
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,450
Didn't she give it to you?

312
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,650
No, Grandma didn't give it to me.

313
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,920
Is that right? That's odd.

314
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,520
She came here and took it.

315
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,960
Did she forget?

316
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,520
That darned fortune teller.

317
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,790
Just get ready to go to kindergarten.

318
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,560
All right.

319
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,430
That's weird. It seemed like
she was in a hurry to give it to Ji Woo.

320
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,540
Why didn't she?

321
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,100
My goodness.

322
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,210
Is this really a hair salon?

323
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,210
My, look how nice the place looks.

324
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,250
It sure is different
from the ones in the neighborhood.

325
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,680
How may I help you?

326
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,320
Oh, I made a reservation over the phone.

327
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,280
My name is Lee Hye Sook.

328
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,250
- Yes, come with me.
- Sure.

329
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,570
- Hello.
- Hi.

330
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,310
How would you like to have your hair done?

331
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,540
- I want to get a perm.
- Of course.

332
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,310
These are the types of perms.

333
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,650
This perm is very popular these days.

334
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,750
Since this one includes hair treatment,

335
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,990
it is on the expensive side.

336
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,690
And there's something like this too.

337
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,690
I don't need that.

338
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,690
The most expensive one, please.

339
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,530
Pardon? The most expensive one?

340
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,100
There must be a perm
that's the most expensive.

341
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,630
I want to get that one done.

342
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,970
Yes, ma'am,

343
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,840
but it will be very expensive.

344
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,410
Well, a perm is still just a perm,
isn't it?

345
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,010
I want to get that one.

346
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,180
I'm sure a perm wouldn't cost
any more than 200 dollars.

347
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,650
How much is it?

348
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,550
Yes, ma'am. This one includes
the silk treatment as well.

349
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,520
It costs 890 dollars.

350
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,830
It's 890...

351
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,300
dollars, I see.

352
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,570
I'm sorry. I'm not a fan of silk.

353
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,830
(Classic Blunt Bob Perm, Wavy Pixie Cut,
750 dollars)

354
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,840
(Layered Wavy Bob Perm, 650 dollars)

355
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,140
I'll get this, the cheapest one.

356
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,310
The 650-dollar perm.
With the shine treatment.

357
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,210
Sure, got it.

358
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,510
One moment, please.

359
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,020
My goodness.
Who pays 900 dollars for a perm?

360
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,990
With 900 dollars, my entire family
can live and eat for two weeks.

361
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,820
My gosh. They're total thieves.

362
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Oh, my.

363
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,390
Ma'am, you naturally look so elegant.

364
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,530
You look like Grace Kelly now.

365
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,570
My gosh, really? Thank you.

366
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,770
- I'll be back.
- Yes, ma'am.

367
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,240
We can cash you out when you're ready.

368
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,610
- Here.
- Your total is 650 dollars.

369
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,610
Would you like to split the payment
into monthly installments?

370
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,850
No, don't bother. That's lame.

371
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,380
Just make that a single payment.

372
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,050
What kind of hair serum
costs over 100 dollars?

373
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,920
I even bought this prepaid package.

374
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,060
I must've been out of my mind.

375
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,460
That woman totally lured me
with her sweet words.

376
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,360
How much did I spend today?

377
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,900
This is not good.

378
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,830
I should go back and get a full refund.

379
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,840
No.

380
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,010
I have 20 million dollars in my hands.

381
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,010
I can totally afford this prepaid package.

382
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,480
I can do these things too.

383
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,880
Who says I have to get 50-dollar perms...

384
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,920
at those tiny hair salons
for the rest of my life?

385
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Whatever.

386
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,290
I'll just use these.

387
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,790
Mom.

388
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,300
Hey, you scared me.
What brings you here at this hour?

389
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,500
And what's this?

390
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,340
I had to come to the area
to drop off the things I made...

391
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,500
for my side job and thought
I should stop by. I'm exhausted.

392
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,410
Side job?

393
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,310
This is what you've been doing at home?

394
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,850
Yes, I should earn as much as I can
to help out.

395
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,080
What can I do?

396
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
I'm a woman, and I'm not young anymore,
so no one would hire me...

397
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,350
even if I want to get a proper job.

398
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,190
Gosh, my arm hurts.

399
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,360
But what's Gwang Sik doing?

400
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,890
He still hasn't found a job yet?

401
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,230
He's been interviewing for jobs, but...

402
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,400
Mom, I'm so worried
that I can't even sleep these days.

403
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,830
What if I can't even raise Ji Woo well
at this rate?

404
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,540
I'm so worried and anxious...

405
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,640
that I feel like I can't breathe
even while sleeping.

406
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,910
Do you have no savings?

407
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,310
Savings? I wish.

408
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,810
I've taken out multiple loans.

409
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,350
My interest
and credit card payments are due soon.

410
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,350
I'm worried.

411
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,320
Goodness. Will I ever get to live
without having to worry about money?

412
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,890
I feel so bad for her.
Should I help her out?

413
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,160
What should I do?
Dae Sik said never to show it to anyone.

414
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,430
Right. Gwang Sik told me...

415
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,660
that you came to my house
to pick up Ji Woo's fortune teller.

416
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,570
What? Fortune teller?

417
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,940
Why didn't you tell me?

418
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,600
I was staying here back then,
but you never told me.

419
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,410
Why should I tell you?

420
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,610
You were already so upset.

421
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,210
Then why did you do that back then?

422
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,050
You knew I was very upset,

423
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,980
but you and Dad hounded me
to go home to get that thing.

424
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,980
Don't you remember that?

425
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,620
Well, I only did that
because I wanted to use that thing...

426
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,120
as an excuse to persuade you
to go back home soon.

427
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,520
Also, do you think I went to your place
just to pick up that fortune teller?

428
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,460
I wanted to see your mother-in-law...

429
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,730
and apologize to her on your behalf
for just packing up and leaving.

430
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,300
You know nothing.

431
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,900
No, that's not what it sounded like.

432
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,440
Anyway, how much longer are you staying?
Don't you have to drop these off?

433
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,970
I still have some time. I'll leave later.

434
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,380
My gosh. Is there anything to eat?

435
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,750
I carried those heavy things here,
so I'm hungry.

436
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,750
So? Your friend told the guy
she'd decided not to go on the trip?

437
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,180
That's right.

438
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,220
And? What did he say to that?

439
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,820
She says he seems very angry,

440
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,530
even though he keeps saying
he's not angry.

441
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,030
What should she do?

442
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,960
What can she do?

443
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,700
She should leave him be.
He'll stop being angry soon.

444
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,470
But you know what's so crazy?

445
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,800
She said he threw a hissy fit
when she told him she couldn't go.

446
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,140
My gosh. It's unbelievable.

447
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,540
How could Tae Hyung do this to me?

448
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm so disappointed in him.

449
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,020
What did I say just now?

450
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,090
You said,
"How could Tae Hyung do this to me?"

451
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,130
Well, the truth is...

452
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,060
I said it was a friend of mine,
but I was actually talking about myself.

453
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,730
- Really?
- Aren't you surprised?

454
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,730
Yes, I am surprised.

455
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,370
Can I ask you why you told Tae Hyung
you couldn't go?

456
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,480
The thing is,
I'm leaving for Hong Kong today.

457
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,910
Hong Kong?

458
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,750
My family is going through some stuff.

459
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,810
Anyway, yes. That's the situation.

460
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,650
Thank you for listening to me.

461
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,450
I'll be off, then.

462
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,930
What? Jang Tae Poong, this punk...

463
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,800
This is...

464
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,470
- Excuse me. What are you doing?
- What?

465
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,470
Oh, sorry.

466
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,070
Sir.

467
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,650
Darn it.

468
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,080
I can't leave like this
because it's just so unfair.

469
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,820
Kim Dae Sik.

470
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,390
I must meet him for one last time...

471
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,330
and put an end to this!

472
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
- Hello, sir. How may I help you?
- Hello, here.

473
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,840
I'd like to send some of my money...

474
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,870
to other banks.

475
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,210
I see. You'd like to do a transfer?

476
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,770
Yes.

477
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,750
One moment, please.

478
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,550
Yes, he's here.

479
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,660
Hello, sir.

480
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,820
Oh, hello.

481
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,190
I'm Kim Eun Soo, the branch manager.

482
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,490
- I see.
- You're our VIP client.

483
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,760
What are you doing here?

484
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,360
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and escort him inside.

485
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,630
This way, sir.

486
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,100
- Please come with us.
- Okay.

487
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,170
- Here, have some tea.
- Here, sir.

488
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,210
I would've stepped out and greeted you
had I known you were outside.

489
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,980
VIP clients like you
don't need to wait outside.

490
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,450
From now on,
just come straight to this office.

491
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,060
So, I don't have to...

492
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,460
take a number and wait anymore?

493
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,990
My goodness. That's right.

494
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,460
Just come straight here,

495
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,170
and my staff
will take care of everything for you.

496
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,970
- I see.
- Go over everything with him.

497
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Yes, sir.

498
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,040
- Oh, my. It was very nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

499
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,610
- I'm Mr. Do, the assistant manager.
- I see.

500
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,510
Well, sir.

501
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,490
May I ask you why you suddenly decided
to withdraw your money?

502
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,720
Oh, yes. I heard...

503
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,630
each bank could only protect
up to 50,000 dollars per account.

504
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,830
So, I want to split my money...

505
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,530
into multiple accounts at different banks.

506
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,600
I see, to protect your money.

507
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,270
But your account balance is very high,

508
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,200
so if you were to split it
into accounts at different banks,

509
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,210
you'd end up with over 100 accounts.

510
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,140
It simply can't be done.

511
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,310
There aren't that many banks
in the country.

512
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,510
Oh, is that so?

513
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,380
Goodness. I hadn't thought of that.

514
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,420
Then what should I do?

515
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,520
Then why don't you just leave your money
with us?

516
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,420
We can offer you
a special premium interest rate.

517
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,290
A premium interest rate?

518
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,630
That's right.
You can find the details here.

519
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,230
Take your time and go over it.

520
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,540
And here.

521
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,010
This is our VIP gift.

522
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,680
And I'm giving you two.

523
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,120
You are our special VIP client, sir.

524
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,250
My goodness. You didn't have to do this.

525
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,630
Well, I'll think about it
and let you know.

526
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,690
Oh, I got these.

527
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,100
But...

528
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,030
Let's go. I'll walk you out, sir.

529
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,030
Okay.

530
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,470
Where did you park, sir?

531
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,870
- Where did I park?
- Yes.

532
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
Over there.

533
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,450
Oh, you biked here.

534
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,410
It must be a vintage bike.

535
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,180
It's nice to bike.
It's good for your health.

536
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,590
Well, I'll be off then.

537
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,590
Yes, sir.

538
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,760
(Jackpot Chicken)

539
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,900
(For VIP Client)

540
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,050
Hey, Kim Dae Sik!

541
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,290
You! We need to talk!

542
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,790
(Jackpot Chicken)

543
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,430
Why, you...

544
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,130
Come here!

545
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,270
Darn!

546
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,140
Gosh, that hurts. Why, you...

547
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,610
Hey, are you running away? Darn you.

548
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,740
That jerk.

549
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,450
Oh, man. That hurts.

550
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,430
- My gosh.
- Oh, dear.

551
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,970
- Dae Sik!
- Goodness.

552
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,200
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

553
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,350
No!

554
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,130
(Good Luck!)

555
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,090
Why would you buy a lottery ticket?

556
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,630
You already won.

557
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,230
About Mi Jin.

558
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,670
She must be struggling financially.
She's doing a side job.

559
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,900
My, I love pumpkin porridge.

560
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,600
There isn't very much food.
Gyu Tae, you don't get to have any.

561
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,670
You're so mean.

562
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,510
What happened to Dad?

563
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,010
You don't think he was caught, do you?

564
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,380
