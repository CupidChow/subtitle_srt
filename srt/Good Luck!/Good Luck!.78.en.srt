(All child actors filmed safely
under the supervision of their guardians.)

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,410
(Animal scenes were directed
and filmed...)

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,410
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

4
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,580
Does Mu Chul know too?

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,880
(Episode 78)

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,750
The fact that
the winning lottery ticket was his.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,890
Does Mu Chul know about it too?

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,660
The winning lottery ticket...

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,600
was mine?

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,200
The winning numbers...

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,930
The Daewoon Building's completion date.

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,070
I always used to buy lottery tickets
with those numbers.

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,340
Did you buy a lottery ticket
with those numbers too?

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,650
No, was that what those numbers meant?

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,780
What?

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
You didn't know?

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,850
Of course not. I didn't know.

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,490
That's so fascinating.

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,620
I just bought a lottery ticket
with automated random numbers.

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,660
I never imagined that was
the Daewoon Building's completion date.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,000
Mu Chul still has no idea!

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,070
My husband completely trusts you.

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,280
He says
he can even give up his life for you.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,650
How am I supposed to say this to him?

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,120
You need to tell him yourself.

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,820
That you stole his lottery ticket...

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,760
and have been living comfortably
until now,

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,130
and that you hid the truth from him
and have been lying to him all along.

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,660
Tell him yourself!

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,560
(Number One Real Estate, Daewoon Building)

31
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,020
I don't believe this.

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,360
How could Dae Sik do this to me?

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,990
No way...

34
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,500
- This is good.
- Isn't it?

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,530
Yes, it's very good.

36
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,270
I like this.

37
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,400
Ji Woo, I see you're enjoying it.

38
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,810
So? How was the beach? Was it nice?

39
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,280
Tell us about your trip, Mom.

40
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,750
Mom, can't you hear me?

41
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,290
What? What did you say?

42
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,130
Was it nice to see the sea?

43
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,190
Mi Jin said
you should tell us about your trip.

44
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,260
Right. Yes, it was nice.

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,960
It was very refreshing.

46
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,470
Mom, did you perhaps change your mind
while you were on your trip?

47
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,000
I mean, about the divorce.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,440
A short getaway to the seaside
can change how you think and feel.

49
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,180
She's right.
Dad likely let you take that trip,

50
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,810
hoping it would lead to that.

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,010
Did it change your mind?

52
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,610
My mind did change.

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,420
"I've been a fool,
living my whole life so cluelessly."

54
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,550
"It's so unfair that it makes me livid."

55
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,060
"Is it even possible to be compensated
after being deceived my whole life?"

56
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,690
During the trip,
I felt these thoughts even more strongly.

57
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,470
I think I want to move out.

58
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,530
- Move out?
- Move out?

59
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,540
Where will you go?

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,570
I'll move out
once we get a divorce anyway,

61
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,270
so I have no reason to stay here.

62
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,910
I want to start looking for a place
tomorrow.

63
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,740
Now, I want to live the life I want...

64
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,210
in a place I love.

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,650
Mom, are you really sure
you want to get a divorce?

66
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,720
Oh, Dad.

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
You're home.

68
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,420
Dad, Mom's home.

69
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,820
Where have you been until now?

70
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,990
Where have you been
that you can't tell me?

71
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,230
Did you have a good trip?

72
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,070
Maybe I should've stayed longer
for your sake.

73
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,070
You must've had a great time
while I was gone.

74
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
What?

75
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,740
You said you'd give me
half of the lottery winnings.

76
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,540
I want it by the end of the week.

77
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,280
I'll find a place to move to
with that money.

78
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,150
Move? Where?

79
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,350
Where would I go?
I'll move to a house of my own.

80
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,480
If I get to live apart from you,

81
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,620
any place would feel like paradise.

82
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,790
So, give me the money you promised me...

83
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,960
by the end of the week. Don't forget.

84
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,840
Is Dad not home yet?

85
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
No.

86
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,780
By the way, are the guests not coming?

87
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,120
It's too late to have dinner.

88
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,690
Oh, dear.

89
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,590
What?

90
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,190
Oh, Dad.

91
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,730
Where have you been?

92
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,600
I thought
you were just going to get booze.

93
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,760
We were all so worried.

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,550
What is it? Is something wrong?

95
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,360
Your friends said they couldn't come.

96
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,730
I think we should clear the table now.

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,830
Mu Chul.

98
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,700
Yes?

99
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,340
Oh, sorry.

100
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,210
I suddenly feel tired.

101
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,910
I want to go to sleep.

102
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
One moment.

103
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,100
You need to tell him yourself.

104
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,800
That you stole his lottery ticket...

105
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,770
and have been living comfortably
until now,

106
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,140
and that you hid the truth from him
and have been lying to him all along.

107
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,640
Tell him yourself!

108
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,490
Come and have breakfast.

109
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
Mu Chul.

110
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,400
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

111
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,940
Mom, are you going somewhere?

112
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,040
I think your dad is sick.

113
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,780
Dad's sick? How?

114
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,250
I'm not sure.
I'll go pick up some fever medicine.

115
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,550
Eat your breakfast.

116
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,350
Oh, no.

118
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,490
- Oh, my.
- Mi Ja.

119
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,000
Geum Ok, are you here for medicine too?

120
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,830
Yes, something for indigestion
and some supplements.

121
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,130
Are you sick, Mi Ja?

122
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,200
It's not me. It's my husband.

123
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,870
Mu Chul?

124
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,340
What's wrong with him?

125
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,640
I don't know.
Maybe he has some aches and pains.

126
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,210
I'm glad I ran into you.

127
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,450
On your way back, can you go to Mr. Kim...

128
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,720
and tell him that
Mu Chul can't come to work today?

129
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,750
Okay, I will.

130
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,920
Right, thanks. See you later.

132
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,660
Is Mu Chul badly ill?

133
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,630
My gosh.

134
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,900
The symptoms that I described...

135
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,240
are clear signs of menopause, right?

136
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,110
Have your periods been irregular lately?

137
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,410
Did you have a lighter flow...

138
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,240
or skip a few months at a time?

139
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,550
Yes, that's right.
I usually have a regular cycle,

140
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,050
but I haven't had one even though
I was supposed to start a while ago.

141
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,660
So, you're certain it's menopause, right?

142
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,730
That could be it,
but there is another possibility too.

143
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,900
Another possibility?

144
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,500
Do I have a growth in my uterus?

145
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,300
Is there any possibility
that you might be pregnant?

146
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,070
What? Pregnant?

147
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,380
Ma'am, you shouldn't joke about that.
Do you know how old...

148
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,530
Oh, my.

149
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,430
My gosh.

150
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,770
Oh, no. I must be crazy. My gosh.

This is fun.

154
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,490
Well... Ma'am.

155
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,600
I've had trouble becoming pregnant
my whole life,

156
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,960
and I am older too.

157
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,970
Could I still be pregnant, though?

158
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,710
Of course. It is possible.
I'll give you a pregnancy test kit.

No, it can't be.

162
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,060
How could that be possible?

163
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,400
Geum Ok, what are you doing there?

164
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,070
Hey, Dae Sik.

165
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,170
Are you going to work now?

166
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,570
Yes.

167
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,570
By the way, I ran into Mi Ja earlier.

168
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,380
She asked me to let you know that
Mu Chul is sick and can't come to work.

169
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,210
Mu Chul is sick? But why?

170
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,450
I guess he has some aches and pains.

171
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,620
Mi Ja told me to let you know.

172
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Then, I'll be going.

173
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,860

176

Does Mu Chul know everything now?

177
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
Hey.

178
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,250
I was wondering what happened.

179
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,580
Did you have a good time last night?

180
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,850
Did you get to talk to Mu Chul?

181
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,050
No, I couldn't tell him.

182
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,760
Why not? I thought
you were going to tell him last night.

183
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,030
Mu Chul's wife already knew
about everything.

184
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,060
How do you know that?

185
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,030
Actually, she came here yesterday.

186
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,600
She asked if I knew anything
about the lottery ticket.

187
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,370
It seemed to me
like she knew everything already.

188
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,340
So, what did you tell her?

189
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,840
I told her I didn't know.

190
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,210
If I told her,
it would only cause a misunderstanding.

191
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,110
It would be better
for you to tell her yourself.

192
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,950
So, did you talk to Mu Chul's wife?

193
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,150
Yes, but...

194
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,790
she told me to tell Mu Chul myself.

195
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,860
I guess it's hard for her to tell him...

196
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,830
since he trusts us so much.

197
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,830
Oh, dear.

198
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,370
Gyu Tae, what am I supposed to tell him?

199
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,130
I know I should tell him,

200
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,970
but I really don't know what to say.

201
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,270
What would you say if you were me?

202
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,880
You have to tell him soon too.

203
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,150
Well, I don't know. I'm not sure either.

204
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,480
On top of that, he's not feeling well.

205
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,280
I really can't tell him now.

206
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,650
What? Is Mu Chul sick again?

207
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,190
I think his body's aching.

208
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,160
He can't come to work today.

209
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,560
You deal with it yourself.

210
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,130
It's not like I'm in any position
to give you advice.

211
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,200
When will you tell him
about the Daewoon Building?

212
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
They say
you should strike while the iron's hot.

213
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,110
Since we're on the subject,
shouldn't you come with me?

214
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,110
No, that might really cause Mu Chul
to lose his mind.

215
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,450
I'll tell him after you do.

216
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,820
That will be less of a shock.

217
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,450
Don't try to weasel out of this
just because I'm busy with my own problem.

218
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,920
Let me make this very clear to you.

219
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,930
Your problem is more serious than mine.

220
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,390
Do you realize that?

(Number One Real Estate)

222
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,630
I'm off.

223
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Oh, dear.

(Pregnant, Not Pregnant)

225
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,330
I'm pregnant?

226
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,330
I'm actually pregnant?

227
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,770
- Geum Ok.
- What? Hey.

228
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,970
Hey, why were you so startled?

229
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,340
Oh, it's nothing.

230
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,010
What brings you by?

231
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,550
Well, I think I was...

232
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,080
way too mean to you the other day,
so I wanted to apologize.

233
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,490
Oh, I see.

234
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,060
It's fine.

235
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,190
I already forgot all about it.

236
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,690
Really?

237
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,560
Yes.

238
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,030
Hey, I heard you rolled down the hillside
when you went hiking.

239
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,700
Are you all right?

240
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,300
Yes, I'm fine now.

241
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,610
Well...

242
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
Hey.

243
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,380
You know, the thing you mentioned
about Mrs. Taylor the other day.

244
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,620
Yes.

245
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,490
I don't know
exactly what you heard about her,

246
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,160
but I'd appreciate it...

247
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,630
if you could refrain
from speaking negatively about her to me.

248
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,300
- Why?
- The thing is,

249
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,770
I've been thinking seriously
about marrying her.

250
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,940
As you know, I've been very lonely.

251
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,110
Now, I want to lean on someone
and spend the rest of my life...

252
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:18,050
with someone I can depend on,
and who depends on me.

253
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,620
So honestly, what she did...

254
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,460
or may have done in the past
doesn't matter to me.

255
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,190
Okay, I understand
what you're trying to say.

256
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,230
You're not upset, are you?

257
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,070
No, of course not.

258
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,210
Hey, what's wrong?
Do you have an upset stomach?

259
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,540
Yes, I think what I had for breakfast
is just sitting there.

260
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
What?

261
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,980
Goodness.

262
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,030
Are you okay?
Should I pick up some medicine for you?

263
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,230
No, I'm okay.

264
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,050
Hey, look at you.

265
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,590
Hey, Dong Min. You're here.

266
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,490
Hey, am I bothering you while you're busy?

267
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,960
No, I'm not too busy right now.

268
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
All right.

269
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,260
So, this is
the famous Farm to Market office.

270
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes, I'd love some.

271
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
All right.

272
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,970
What? You and Ah Jin are dating?

273
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,170
Well, you know. We decided
to just keep it casual for now.

274
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,340
My gosh. Congratulations.

275
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,710
If you make my sister cry,
you will pay for it.

276
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,150
But I can't figure out
how Ah Jin really feels.

277
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,480
- What?
- Well, you know.

278
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,750
Is she seeing me for old times' sake?

279
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,690
Or does she really like me?

280
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,020
Didn't she agree to go out with you
because she likes you?

281
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,430
Yes, I guess.

282
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,230
Hey, do you know Han Tae Ha?

283
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,460
Han Tae Ha? Yes, I know him.

284
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,300
He works part-time at Buddumak,
and he's our next-door neighbor.

285
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
What?

286
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,940
He is your next-door neighbor?

287
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,270
He is my dad's friend's son.

288
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,110
Anyway, what about him?

289
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,740
What? Oh, it's nothing.

290
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,980
What? Aren't you Dong Min?

291
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,820
Oh, Ye Won?

292
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,520
- Hey, it's been so long!
- What's going on?

293
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,990
I heard from Seok Jin...

294
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,120
that you worked for a food company.

295
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,160
Yes. Right, you guys work together.

296
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,660
I told her the other day.

297
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,460
Dong Min wanted to see you anyway.
This is great.

298
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,530
Really?

299
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,830
How long has it been since the three of us
last got together like this?

300
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,830
Shouldn't we organize
a class reunion meet-up?

301
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,340
- Should we really do that?
- Yes.

302
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,740
I know a great fried chicken place.

303
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,810
Fried chicken sounds great.

304
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,440
- Let's go now.
- Okay, let's go.

305
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,520
Thanks for today.

306
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,660
Thanks to you, we had a delicious dinner,

307
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,090
and I had such a great time.

308
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,560
My pleasure. It's nothing compared
to everything your father has done for us.

310
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,950
Why does Seok Jin seem so distant?

311
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,190
Gyu Tae, I had a dream last night.

312
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,760
In my dream,
a pig this big came oinking toward me.

313
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,260
I held it in my arms.

314
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,470
Its hair was silky soft,

315
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,470
and it smelled amazing.

316
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,640
In that moment,
I forgot it was a pig and kissed it.

317
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,170
Come on. That's just a silly dream.

318
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,240
No, it's not.

319
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,910
Hey, what do you think?

320
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,980
A dream about a pig is believed
to bring good luck. It's nothing silly.

321
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,550

Oh, hoping to win, like Dae Sik did?

324
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,020
Anyway, what kind of dream did he have
before he won the lottery?

325
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,860
It was Mu Chul, not Dae Sik.

326
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
What?

327
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,430
Wasn't Dae Sik the one
who won the lottery?

328
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,630
What are you talking about?

329
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,170
Oh, boy.

330
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940

Where did he go?

Are you going somewhere?

339
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,350
Why? Are you stepping out
to meet someone again?

340
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,750
You.

341
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,550
Did you know about it?

About what?

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,190
Your husband's winning lottery ticket.

344
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,530
That ticket was Mu Chul's. Did you know?

345
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,060
Why didn't you tell me?

346

Why didn't you tell me
it was Mu Chul's lottery ticket?

We received it...

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,340
from your husband.
He personally gave it to my husband.

350
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,280
Then you should've told me so long ago!

351
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,150
The lottery prize was
a whopping 35.7 million dollars.

Oh, you must be feeling guilty
about something.

354
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,120
Why should I tell you?

355
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,820
He gave it to us, so it's ours.

356
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,860
Why? You think we're obligated
to tell you or something?

357
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,830
Hey, how could you say that?

358
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,830
After my husband's funeral,

359
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,370
I was left penniless and had to struggle.
Did you see that or not?

360
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,370
On my moving day, I was thrown out...

361
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,940
and had nowhere to go.
Didn't you see that?

362
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,040
You saw how miserable I was,
but you couldn't tell me?

363
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,470
How could you even call yourself
my friend?

364
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,970
You're right.

365
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,410
I am sorry about that.

366
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,580
But be honest for once.

367
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,790
Do you even consider me your friend?

368
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,890
When I was struggling
because I had no money,

369
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,230
did you ever offer a helping hand,
even once?

370
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
What?

371
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,160
We couldn't even afford to pay rent,

372
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,260
but you suddenly demanded
100,000 dollars more for the deposit.

373
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,500
You'd put me down in front of our friends
just because I was your tenant.

374
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,440
You had me make you kimchi
because I borrowed money from you.

375
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,740
Every chance you got,

376
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,810
you looked down on me and belittled me
as you flaunted your wealth.

377
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,480
Fine, let's say I did! But still,

378
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,280
at least I didn't trick you.

379
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,420
Do you know
just how betrayed I feel right now?

380
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,490
"Betrayed?"

381
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,830
Then, what about everything I endured
in high school because of you?

382
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,630
You acted like we were friends
on the outside,

383
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,370
but you treated me like your servant
and had me do everything for you.

384
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,700
You'd make snide remarks
in front of people,

385
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,040
calling me your housekeeper's daughter
to humiliate me.

386
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
What did you say?

387
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,680
That's not all.

388
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,950
You and my husband...

389
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,850
Gosh, what? Friends?

390
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,090
Don't make me laugh.
I'm sick and tired of you!

391
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,660
I wish you'd disappear from my sight!

392
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,160
I must've been very mistaken.

393
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,500
I must've been the only one
to consider you a friend.

394
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Fine.

395
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,040
Since things have come to this,
let's get the math right.

396
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,280
Give us our money.
Give back the money you stole.

397
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,940
Who are you accusing of stealing?
I told you that he gave it to us!

398
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,710
That's stealing. You stole our money!

399
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,710
Give back the 35.7 million immediately!

400
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,720
My gosh.

401
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,450
Did you say 35.7 million dollars?

402
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,150
What do you mean by that?

403
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,660
Mom. What's wrong?

404
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,590
- My goodness.
- Stop right there.

405
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,830
Give us back our money.
Give back what you stole!

406
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,900
Why is that your money?
I said your husband gave it to us!

407
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,440
It's my money! Give it back!

408
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,170
Let go of me! Let go!

409
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,410
- What's wrong with you, Mom?
- Don't do this, Mom.

410
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,010
- Hey!
- She must be out of her mind.

411
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,210
- Stop right there!
- Mom.

412
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,380
- Hey!
- Oh, gosh.

413
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,850
- I told you to stop! Hey!
- Mom, what is going on?

414
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,650
What do you think you're doing?

415
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,190
You can't barge into
someone else's house like this!

416
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,390
"Someone else's house?"

417
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,290
If only you hadn't stolen it from us,
this would still be our house!

418
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,660
It's my house!

419
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,130
We didn't steal anything!
We bought this house!

420
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,200
Who are you calling a thief?

421
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,600
Mom, what's wrong with this lady?

422
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,900
Why is she causing a scene
in someone else's house?

423
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,440
I am causing a scene?

424
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,570
Get out.

425
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,640
Get out of my house right now!

426
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,410
You should be the one to get out.

427
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,910
You're the one who should leave, not me.

428
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,910
This is my house!

429
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,880
It's my house!

430
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,550
Give us back our money, you thieves!

431
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,850
- What...
- Give back our money, you thieves!

432
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,690
Give it back!

433
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,660
Is it true?

434
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,560
Is it really true
that you won the lottery...

435
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,270
with my ticket?

436
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,910
It's true.

437
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,980
You said you bought that lottery ticket
with automated random numbers.

438
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,490
Then, did you...

439
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,520
lie to me?

440
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Tell me.

441
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,430
Say it!

442
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,330
Just say something!

443
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,600
Say it!

444
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,590
(Good Luck!)

445
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,520
I hear you're dating my sister.

446
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,460
Our families are at each other's throats.

447
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,430
Are you sure
you can keep your relationship going?

448
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,730
Quit working at that company immediately
and break up with Seok Jin.

449
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,030
Mom.

450
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,130
Seok Jin and Seo Woo are dating.

451
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,240
- What?
- That's why Seo Woo came to work with us.

452
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,170
- Oh, my.
- Mother.

453
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,480
