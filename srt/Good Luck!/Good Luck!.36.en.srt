1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,070
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,480
(Episode 36)

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,050
Just live here if I tell you to!

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,880
Stop being so full of yourself
and face your reality.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,650
You're no longer
the Lee Mi Ja you used to be.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,160
Your husband died,

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,860
and you have no money.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,530
You're just an old woman
who has nowhere to go!

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,460
Before you married Mu Chul,

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,770
all of us were friends.

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,640
Lee Mi Ja!

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,270
As your friend,

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,980
I am asking you to do me a favor
for the first and last time.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,410
Just live in my house.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,810
Right now,

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,090
that is the best choice you can make.

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,920
Do you understand?

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,610
Oh, boy.

19
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,850
My gosh.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
There.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,860
Are you all right, Grandpa?

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,670
Goodness, here.

23
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,810
Oh, sure.

24
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,310
I'm glad.

25
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,910
Right. Here.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,350
Have some porridge.

27
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,150
My goodness.

28
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,120
You didn't have to prepare this.

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm good at making porridge.

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,860
I've made it lots of times
when my grandma was sick.

31
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,430
All right. Thank you.

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,270
Oh, dear.

33
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,470
Hasn't your friend called yet?

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
No.

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,540
I guess he's not going to.

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
I mean,

37
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,210
I'm sure he can't trust me.

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,650
So? Will you just...

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,290
keep waiting?

40
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,790
My goodness.

41
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,730
Here's the thing about family.

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,000
You don't become one
just because you share the same blood.

43
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,970
You have to share time together.

44
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,210
Share time?

45
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,010
That's right.

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,880
Do you know how important it is...

47
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,380
to spend time as you embrace each other...

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,650
and cry and laugh together?

49
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,990
My goodness.

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,060
I think it's such a waste...

51
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,160
that you're spending
your time here like this.

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,570
Don't regret things later on like I do.

53
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,700
I hope you find your family
as soon as possible...

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,610
and resolve the misunderstandings...

55
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,270
or whatever.

56
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,280
Do it with them.

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Here.

58
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,550
Have lots of porridge...

59
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,490
and regain your strength.

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,590
Open wide.

61
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,190
All right.

62
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,430
Here.

63
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,070
So, about the hair samples I submitted.

64
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,670
Do you have the results?

65
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,670
Oh, is that right?

66
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,210
Then, please call me when you do.

67
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,280
Gosh, why am I so anxious?

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,180
Anyway,

69
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,320
if he really is Mu Chul...

70
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,920
Gosh, what if I get caught for taking
the rent for the Daewoon Building...

71
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,230
and the rest of the money
from selling the Yisan Building?

72
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,800
No, there's no way.

73
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,730
That man can't be Mu Chul. No way.

74
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,640
Gyu Tae.

75
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,210
Hey, what brings you here?

76
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,070
Gyu Tae.

77
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,240
Do you want to go on a blind date?

78
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,910
A blind date?

79
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,950
Yes, she's a friend of mine.

80
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,720
It's been over ten years
since her husband passed away.

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,150
She seemed so lonely lately,

82
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,890
so I was trying
to think of someone nice for her.

83
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,790
Then, I remembered you.

84
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,930
Is that so?

85
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,960
- Is she pretty?
- Well...

86
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,730
She's not as pretty as me,

87
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,230
but she's considered quite pretty.

88
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,430
Hey, if she's not as pretty as you,
she wouldn't even be a woman.

89
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,440
- You're being ridiculous.
- My goodness.

90
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,470
That's not true. She's really great.

91
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,570
You like women who are feminine,
don't you?

92
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,540
She's exactly like that.

93
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,210
She's tall,

94
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,650
slender, and stylish.

95
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,420
And she's cool and outgoing.

96
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,820
Well, I'll think about it.

97
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,490
Okay. Then, give it some thought
and let me know.

98
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,490
Okay.

99
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,560
By the way, Gyu Tae,
why do you have so many cup noodles?

100
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,700
Leave those alone. They're my lunch.

101
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,970
You eat this kind of stuff for lunch?

102
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,970
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm not done eating yet.

103
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,170
Gosh, let's share.
I'll have some for lunch too.

104
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,940
What? Hey, but...

105
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,680
My goodness.

106
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,380
What? Why are you taking so many?

107
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,250
Gosh, you still have plenty left.
Let me have some too, all right?

108
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,690
I'm off.

109
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,690
Hey, wait.

110
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,490
Why, that little...
You're even taking my food.

111
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,460
Gosh, that brat.

112
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,130
Yes, sir. To what do I owe the pleasure?

113
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,770
Pardon? You're interested
in making an investment?

114
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,770
What? An investment?

115
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,210
Yes, I'll see you later. Thank you!

116
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,050
An investment? That's great.

117
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,650
Gosh, I hope it works out this time.

118
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,430
What's this?

119
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,390
Why is he here?

120
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,860
Thank you for calling me.

121
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,130
Then, I'll pour you a glass.

122
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,130
All right.

123
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,130
Pour me a glass.

124
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,930
Good.

125
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,880
Stop being so full of yourself
and face your reality.

126
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,690
You're no longer
the Lee Mi Ja you used to be.

127
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,190
Your husband died,

128
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,960
and you have no money. You're just...

129
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,730
an old woman who has nowhere to go!

130
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Mom?

131
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
What?

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,080
How long have you been out here?

133
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,820
And what is all this?

134
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Mom.

135
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,750
Let's just live here.

136
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,920
Earlier, Mr. Choi came to the restaurant,

137
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,030
and he also said it'd be nice
for us to live here.

138
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,960
Are you saying that too?

139
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,870
I know how you feel, Mom.

140
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,270
Honestly, do you think
I want to live here?

141
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,940
But you know the situation we're in.

142
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,170
We should be glad to have a place to live.

143
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,450
Mom, get up first.
Let's talk inside, okay?

144
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,510
My gosh.

145
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Honey.

146
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,540
About Mi Ja.

147
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,780
It must've been a big shock
since she didn't get to move out today.

148
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,250
She was sitting outside the gate,
all hunched over.

149
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,450
- Is that so?
- I mean,

150
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,090
I felt bad about it all day.

151
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,060
But seeing her like that
made me even more upset.

152
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,490
Gosh, that brat.
She sure has a way of making you worry.

153
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,970
Hey, honey. I've been thinking.

154
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,500
About this house.

155
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,440
Would you not like it
if we asked Mu Chul's family to live here?

156
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,940
What did you say?

157
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,380
Well, it looks like
they have nowhere else to go.

158
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,410
But honey,

159
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,320
you know I don't want to live
in the same building as that brat, Mi Ja.

160
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,580
And yet, are you still suggesting that?

161
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,190
I know that.

162
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,090
But now, you're the owner of this house.

163
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,390
You won't have to feel belittled
like before.

164
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,460
Oh, whatever!

165
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,960
Don't ever bring up that brat
in front of me again.

166
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
My gosh.

167
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,870
- But...
- Oh, my.

168
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,380
Gosh, what's going on?

169
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,850
Let's go for now.
I can't wait out here forever.

170
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,420
Oh, a young lady was here.

171
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,790
- What?
- Yes, come here.

172
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,120
- What? No.
- Come in.

173
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,020
- What? No, why are you doing this?
- Come here.

174
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,230
Let go of me!

175
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,730
- Come on.
- What? Seo Woo.

176
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Why? Do you know this young lady, Mr. Kim?

177
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,840
I'm here with him.

178
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,640
Oh, that's great.

179
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,210
All right. Here.

180
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,240
Pour me a glass.

181
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,850
What did you say?
You want me to pour liquor for you?

182
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,120
Excuse me, sir.

183
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
What?

184
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,920
If you're here with him,
aren't you here to get an investment?

185
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,990
Yes, I am.

186
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,600
I'll pour you a glass of liquor.

187
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,030
In return, please think favorably
about making this investment, sir.

188
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,340
You should've said so in the first place.

189
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,670
Goodness, seeing you from up close,

190
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,780
you're a very pretty young lady.

191
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,780
- Here you go.
- All right.

192
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
Stop this.

193
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,320
What's wrong, Mr. Kim?

194
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,550
I was starting to enjoy the mood.

195
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,690
You know,

196
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,730
you're too rigid.

197
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,600
This woman...

198
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,830
has nothing to do with this investment.

199
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
So, I will be pouring the liquor for you.

200
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,660
Oh, no. My bad. I spilled it.

201
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,360
But you see,

202
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,930
this liquor is very expensive,

203
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,400
so I don't want to waste
a single drop of it.

204
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,970
That said, can you drink that?

205
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,310
I know I spilled it on the floor,
but can you just drink that?

206
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,320
Aren't you here to ask me
to invest in your business?

207
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,890
Then shouldn't you be mentally prepared
for something like this?

208
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,790
I can't believe this.

209
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,530
Are you telling him
to lick it off the floor?

210
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,460
Yes, of course.

211
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,130
I came prepared, sir.

212
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,970
Then would you like me
to go ahead and do it now?

213
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,510
Yes, that's right. Go for it.

214
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
What?

215
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,700
What are you waiting for? Hey!

216
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,910
Did you do it?

217
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,580
The liquor on the floor.

218
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,790
Did you lick it off the floor?

219
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,460
Do you want to...

220
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
go for a drink with me?

221
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,000
No matter how well I did in school,

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,570
all the rich kids got to study abroad
before I could.

223
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,980
No matter how brilliant my idea was,

224
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,750
it was always my rich friends
who started their own business first.

225
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,620
I poured my heart and soul...

226
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,320
into launching my business.

227
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,120
But for my friend,

228
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,460
it only took him a month
to open his business with his dad's money.

229
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
You see, my business...

230
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,310
It was like my life.

231
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,880
But with just one word,

232
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,110
he withdrew the investment.

233
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,580
Even so, this is wrong.

234
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,090
I get that you desperately need
to secure an investment,

235
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,690
but how could you lick that off the floor?

236
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,730
That's just wrong.

237
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,130
Why does that even matter
when my life depends on this?

238
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,500
I could do it a thousand times.

239
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,040
You see,
do you know how hard I've worked...

240
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,170
to ensure success for my business?

241
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,540
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,680
I wanted to help you,

243
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,080
but this happened again.

244
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,890
I feel like I keep ruining things for you.

245
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,890
Don't come to things like this.

246
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,190
You shouldn't have come.

247
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,260
Even today, you saw something
you shouldn't have.

248
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,430
So,

249
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,740
stop minding my business.

250
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,380
How can I do that?

251
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,590
When I think about
how stressed out you must be right now,

252
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,560
it feels like
my heart is being torn apart.

253
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,060
I worry about you all day
and can't do anything else.

254
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,130
So, what am I supposed to do?

255
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,170
I don't know
why I'm being like this either.

256
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,510
I just...

257
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,280
want to spend time with you.

258
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,380
I want to help you and...

259
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,250
I want to give you a hug.

260
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,360
Don't be hurting.

261
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,400
It hurts me to see you hurt.

262
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,080
Hey, Lee Hye Sook. Where are you going?

263
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,450
Are you on your way
to your housemaid shift?

264
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,380
So, I hear your mom works
for Mi Ja's family as a housemaid.

265
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,290
So, you're their housemaid's daughter.

266
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,260
By the way, what happened to your hand?

267
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,990
Did you hurt your hand
peeling potatoes instead of your mom?

268
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Would you come
and work for my family if I paid you?

269
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,260
How much do you charge per month?

270
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,730
I want to hire you and your mom too.

271
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,970
What? Are you done talking?

272
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,840
Is your family loaded?

273
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,050
Hye Sook's mother is an amazing cook,
so my mom recruited her.

274
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,920
How rich is your family that you're trying
to snatch up such a top-class chef?

275
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,120
Is your family that wealthy?

276
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,990
Really?

277
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,490
A top-class chef?

278
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,190
Hey, don't lie.

279
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,030
Her mom is a mere housemaid.

280
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,900
Hey, would you beg a mere housemaid
to please come and work for you?

281
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,640
My mom often has guests over,
so she recruited Hye Sook's mother.

282
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,510
She declined at first.
We went through hoops to bring her in.

283
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
And what? A housemaid?

284
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,280
Who spread such a false rumor?

285
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,850
- Was it you?
- No, she told me.

286
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,850
Hey.

287
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,520
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

288
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,590
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to Hye Sook.

289
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,520
I'm sorry, Hye Sook.

290
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,690
I'm sorry too.

291
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,530
Is this fun for you?

292
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,870
What?

293
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,640
Is it fun for you to pity me like this?

294
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,270
What? A chef? Don't make me laugh.

295
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,010
You are doing this even though you know
my family has nothing and nowhere to go.

296
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,450
A chef, my foot!

297
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,650
It is true.

298
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,650
What?

299
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,450
My mom loves your mother's cooking.

300
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,820
So, my mom practically begged her
to please come and work for us.

301
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,120
Your mother never told you?

302
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,090
My mom...

303
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,230
has never once talked casually
to you or your mother.

304
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Do you know why?

305
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,700
My mom always told me...

306
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,740
that we should be good
to you and your family...

307
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,510
because you help us where we're lacking.

308
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,080
She said, "They're not staying with us
because they have nowhere to go."

309
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,880
My mom told me
she didn't want to let your mother go...

310
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,920
because she's such a great cook
and a wonderful person.

311
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,780
I thought you knew too.

312
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,290
I guess you didn't know.

313
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,720
Also, "chef" starts with the "sh" sound,
not the "s" sound.

314
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,920
You don't even know how it's pronounced.

315
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,410
Oh, hello.

316
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,910
Is your mom home?

317
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,340
Yes, she's in her room.

318
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,030
Hey.

319
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,260
Just move into the unit
where we're living now.

320
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,700
I wouldn't say this if you were alone.

321
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,400
You are a mother.

322
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,340
Don't make your kids suffer anymore.
Just pretend you're giving in...

323
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,010
and move downstairs.

324
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,380
Why?

325
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,980
Do you pity me now?

326
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,980
Are you trying to be charitable?

327
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,450
Back in the day, you said...

328
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,150
my family wasn't staying at your place
because we had nowhere to go.

329
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,560
You said your mom wasn't letting us go
because she was so fond of my mom.

330
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,060
I'm not doing this out of pity.

331
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,000
It's not like you were my only friend.

332
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,370
Your husband was my friend too.

333
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,540
And your mother was...

334
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,580
She was so good to my mom.

335
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,510
If I let you move out like this,

336
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,380
how will I face your mother...

337
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,780
when I meet her again up there?

338
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,950
And my mom...

339
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,750
will scold me like crazy.

340
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,960
So,

341
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,030
just stay here.

342
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,000
We'll get movers
to move the big things tomorrow.

343
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,170
We'll bring in
the rest of your things too.

344
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,300
So, just pretend
you don't know anything...

345
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,510
and live in my house.

346
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,020
Mom...

347
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,220
Mom.

348
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,570
That brat.

349
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,670
If she doesn't live here
after I did all this,

350
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,310
then...

351
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,110
I'm really going to
stop being friends with her.

352
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,810
What?

353
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,950
You asked Mu Chul's wife
to move down here?

354
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,120
So? What did she say?

355
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,360
What do you think?

356
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,930
She couldn't say a word
and just sat there.

357
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,400
Just letting you know,
we're going to move our stuff tomorrow.

358
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,430
You said you didn't want to live
with Mu Chul's wife.

359
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,400
What made you say such a thing?

360
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,200
It's not like she's a stranger.

361
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,100
I've known her for so long.

362
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,740
I may not have said so,
but I felt uneasy about it too.

363
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,410
Right, I'm glad you did.

364
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,810
By the way, do you know that?

365
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,650
It'll soon be the 49th day
since Mu Chul passed.

366
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,050
Oh, my. Has it been that long already?

367
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,920
Gosh, time really flies.

368
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,090
I was hoping we could attend the rite too.

369
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,430
What do you think?

370
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,960
Well,

371
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,730
if that's what you want to do,
let's do that.

372
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,070
Gosh, has it already been 49 days?

373
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,810
Oh, my.

374
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,650
You can go in first.

375
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,420
It's okay. You can go first.

376
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,620
It's fine. You can go ahead.

377
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,830
Then, I'll go in first.

378
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,860
Okay.

379
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,670
Good night.

380
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,750
(Airport, Terminal 2)

381
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:08,220
(Arrivals)

382
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,420
Yes, Mom. I just arrived.

383
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,730
I'll call you later if I have the time.

384
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Bye.

385
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,670
Kim Seok Jin,
you must've had a hard time on your own.

386
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Don't worry. I'm here now.

387
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,940
Park Ye Won, your soulmate, is here.

388
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,680
What? You're moving today?

389
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,010
Oh, okay.

390
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,050
Hey, are Tae Ha and Ah Jin moving today?

391
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,990
Yes, I guess they are.

392
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,590
Hey, that's good.

393
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,020
By the way,
is it okay for you to sit like this?

394
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,930
Well, I can't sit for too long,
but it's fine every now and then.

395
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,790
Right. You should get better soon.

396
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,130
Hey, what are we doing here at home
after buying you a new car?

397
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,570
Triple!

398
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,610
- Triple?
- Triple?

399
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,710
What are you talking about? Triple what?

400
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,480
Hey, Jin Tae.

401
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,680
I told you the other day
that I came into some money, right?

402
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,320
Oh, the money you made
from that investment?

403
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,380
What about it?

404
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,720
I invested that money somewhere else.

405
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,520
And that money...

406
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,060
has tripled.

407
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,930
What? It tripled?

408
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,960
Then, how much is that?

409
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,400
You don't have to know about that.

410
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,740
Gosh, they say money brings in more money,
you know?

411
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,140
That's exactly right.

412
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,010
Then, are we rich now?

413
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,380
Of course, we're rich. We are.

414
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,320
Okay, then. This is the perfect time...

415
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,520
for me to buy a car.

416
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,590
What are you saying? You have a car.

417
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,320
Gosh, that kind of car doesn't suit me.

418
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,090
A man like me...

419
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,360
should drive a foreign-made car, at least.

420
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,490
- A foreign-made car?
- A foreign-made car?

421
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,760
Yes, a foreign-made car.

422
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,910
(Grandpa, thank you for saving me
and taking care of me when I was...)

423
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,410
My gosh.

424
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,210
What great luck this is.

425
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,050
At this rate, it's only a matter of time
before I can pay Mu Chul back.

426
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,560
Oh, right. I wonder if that guy
who looks like Mu Chul is doing okay.

427
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,700
(Han Mu Chul and Han Tae Ha's DNA
is a 99.99-percent match.)

428
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,570
(It is confirmed
that they are father and son.)

429
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,840
Wait, then...

430
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,080
That man is Mu Chul?

431
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,550
Oh, dear.

432
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,660
Mu Chul! Han Mu Chul!

433
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,000
Open up!

434
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,040
Mu Chul! Han Mu Chul!

435
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
That's right.

436
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,980
My family.

437
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,620
The time that I've lost.

438
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,790
I will find them.

439
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,530
(Good Luck!)

440
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,460
I've made some side dishes.

441
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,900
Put them in the fridge once they cool off.

442
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,760
- Oh, no.
- I'm here now.

443
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,370
Let's start things over together.

444
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,500
We'll be able to meet often now.

445
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,240
Should I go to Dae Sik?

446
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,670
Don't give up.

447
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,940
Han Mu Chul. Let's go.

448
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,680
