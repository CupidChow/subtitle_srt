(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,740
(Episode 46)

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,280
The Daewoon Building!
Why didn't you tell me...

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,520
it belonged to me?

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,750
What?

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,590
This building used to be mine!

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,890
Why didn't you tell me?

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,330
You...

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,560
Have your memories come back?

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,840
No.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,540
Geum Ok told me.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,110
My goodness.
I was wondering what happened.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,810
I told you.

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,350
The past is the past, so nothing good
will come from remembering all of it.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,550
I didn't tell you on purpose
because I knew...

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,390
it would only break your heart.
My goodness.

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,720
- And why would I...
- From now on,

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,900
don't do that again.

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,700
Don't do what again?

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,330
I understand that you care about me
and don't want me to be hurt,

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,670
but the fact that
I don't remember anything...

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,680
makes me sadder than losing my building.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,910
So, please...

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,480
tell me everything, the whole truth.

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,620
Okay.

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,390
Understood.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,220
Please do that for me.

28
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:42,510
(Jackpot Chicken)

29
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,210
What should I do?

30
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,720
Should I tell him the truth now?

31
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,050
Honey.

32
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,690
Are you going somewhere?

33
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,820
Yes, I'm going to the bank
to get a replacement for my lost bankbook.

34
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,960
All right. I'll see you later.

35
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,200
No, wait.

36
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,830
What is it?

37
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,970
Let's talk later,
unless it's something urgent.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
My gosh.

39
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,970
Honey, what are you doing now?

40
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,910
I'm sorry, honey.

41
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,480
I'm really sorry.

42
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,310
What?

43
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,510
You don't need to go to the bank.

44
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,380
You don't need to
get a replacement for the bankbook.

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,390
What do you mean?

46
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,750
I don't need to get a replacement
for the bankbook?

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,970
What? Where was this?

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,170
(Withdrawal, Five Million Dollars)

49
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,710
Five million dollars?

50
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,110
Who made this withdrawal?

51
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,880
Honey, did you...

52
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,450
Yes, I did it.

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,590
The investment of five million dollars...

54
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,390
Seok Jin received for Farm to Market.

55
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,360
I withdrew the money
from your account and gave it to him.

56
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,230
What?

57
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,530
Honey, I'm really sorry.

58
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,660
What I did was unforgivable.

59
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,570
What?

60
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,670
Are these orders coming in right now?

61
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,540
I'll check.

62
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,750
- Okay.
- Oh, maybe not?

63
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,750
What is this? Is our server down now?

64
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,250
Mr. Kim, orders are flooding in right now.

65
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,720
- What?
- This is crazy.

66
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,620
- Are you sure it's not an error?
- What is going on?

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,920
We've received 500 orders
in the last 10 minutes.

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,090
Don't we usually get
about 50 orders per hour?

70
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,530
This morning's orders are ten times
the total orders we received yesterday.

71
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,130
I see that!

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,000
Mr. Kim, Farm to Market is currently
the third top trending channel.

73
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,640
Our promotional video
has already received over 500,000 views.

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,540
The word is out!

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,740
Hello?

76
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Yes.

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,150
Okay, got it.

78
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,780
Seok Jin,
Yeongyang Daily wants to feature us...

79
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,720
as the Start-up of the Month.

80
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,920
- What?
- Is this a dream?

81
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,720
My gosh.
I can't believe this is happening.

82
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,660
Okay. We have to process all the orders,
so we don't have time for this.

83
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,700
Let's all calm down and get our work done.

84
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

85
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,810
Anyway, that's the Seok Jin I know.

86
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,120
It may seem like
you've grown closer to him,

87
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,750
but that's it.

88
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,120
The other person may think
they're close friends,

89
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,460
but oftentimes,
Seok Jin is still keeping his distance.

90
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,230
Seok Jin!

91
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,100
Hey, Seo Woo. You didn't say
you were dropping by. What's up?

92
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,340
I ran over straight away
when I heard you were alone.

93
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,970
I wanted to see you.

94
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,280
Have you had lunch?
If not, do you want to share my lunch?

95
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
I'm okay.

96
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,380
I'm going to eat, then.
I have to eat quickly and work.

97
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,550
Okay. Go ahead and eat.

98
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,520
By the way,
I heard you hit a new sales record today.

99
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,190
Congratulations.

100
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,620
It's all thanks to you.

101
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,130
I think the cute pig-head cake
you got us brought us good luck.

102
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,930
Come on. That was nothing.

103
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,840
By the way,
doesn't Ye Won have a boyfriend?

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,070
Ye Won? No, she doesn't.

105
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Is that so?

106
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,040
Come on. Maybe you just don't know.

107
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,510
No, she really doesn't.

108
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,280
How would I not know that about Ye Won?

109
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,650
The two of you must be really close,

110
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,250
seeing how there's nothing you don't know
about each other.

111
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,790
That's right. We've hung out together
ever since we were kids.

112
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,160
I'm going to eat a bit faster.
I have to work.

113
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,960
Okay, go ahead.

114
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,110
Seok Jin was...

115
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,980
being humiliated in front of his clients.

116
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,710
What kind of mother
wouldn't flip out after seeing that?

117
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,780
So, before I knew it, I just...

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
Still, how could you do
something like this behind my back?

119
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,650
It's not just a few dollars.
This is five million.

120
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,490
Didn't you hear a word I said?

121
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,230
I'm sorry.
Honey, please forgive me this once.

122
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,270
My gosh!

123
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,700
What? Isn't that Dae Sik?

124
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,970
Hello?

125
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,470
Hey, Mr. Lee.

126
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,910
There's an apartment available?

127
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,180
Yes, and when is the tenant moving out?

128
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,880
I'm really sorry.
I didn't realize you hadn't agreed to it.

129
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,780
At our bank,
someone else can withdraw money...

130
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,950
if they present your ID card, your seal,
and a family relation certificate.

131
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,120
Then, are you saying that
if someone were to steal...

132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,690
my bankbook, ID card, and seal
and bring those here,

133
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,830
you would give them my money?

134
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,530
No, not just to anyone.

135
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,530
In really suspicious cases,
we give you a call, but...

136
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,670
To put it bluntly,
my friend could pretend to be my family...

137
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,170
and withdraw money from my account.

138
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,010
No, that's not true, sir.

139
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,080
They'd have to know your passcode and...

140
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Forget it!

141
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,850
I'll have to reconsider keeping my money
at this bank.

142
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,180
Give me back my bankbook!

143
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm really sorry, sir.

144
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,090
You should've handled that on your own,
Mr. Lee.

145
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,930
You shouldn't be telling me about that.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's the same thing.

147
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,000
Anyway, I understand. Bye.

148
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,870
(VIP Client Consultation Room,
Meeting Room)

149
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,480
Was I mistaken?

150
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,490
Welcome, sir.

151
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,490
Hi.

152
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,090
So,

153
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,400
about the person
who was in this room just now.

154
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,930
Could you please tell me his name?

155
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,140
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

156
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,970
We can't tell you that
since it's private information.

157
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Is that right?

158
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,080
Then, I'll have a cup of tea too.

159
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,680
I'm sorry, sir. This truffle tea...

160
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,820
is exclusively served
to our bank's Diamond-level VIP members.

161
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,120
Diamond-level?

162
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,120
Then, what level am I?

163
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,560
You're a gold-level member,
which is two levels below that.

164
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,430
Wait, a VIP is a VIP.

165
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,530
Are you telling me
you divide VIP members into levels?

166
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,530
Sorry, sir.

167
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,440
My gosh. I can't believe this.

168
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,010
Seriously.

169
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,940
Transfer 50,000 dollars to this account.

170
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,480
(Jackpot Chicken)

171
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,950
Hey, you're here.

172
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,050
What is it?

173
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,690
Is something wrong?

174
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,630
Here, your pay advance.

175
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,670
I gave you some extra as a bonus,
so take it.

176
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,240
Thank you.

177
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,780
I'll be heading home first.
Can you handle the restaurant?

178
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,210
Oh, okay.

179
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,350
What's up with him?

180
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,500
That man, Han Mu Chul, had already lost
all of his money before he died.

181
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,640
His family was on the run from creditors.

182
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,070
It was a huge scandal.

183
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,480
Then, even if I know that man is Mu Chul,

184
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,780
I won't get anything out of it.

185
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,580
Gosh, I can only rip him off
if he has money.

186
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,490
What? That man...

187
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,010
That's right.
This used to be Mu Chul's house.

188
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,220
I guess he lives here too.

189
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,890
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

190
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,590
The person who owns this house.

191
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,190
Did he live here before too?

192
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,330
This house?

193
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,800
Oh, after the previous owner died,
the tenant who used to live here...

194
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,270
became the new homeowner. Why?

195
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,010
Oh, it's nothing. Thank you.

196
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,230
After Mu Chul died,

197
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,800
one friend became rich
and drives a foreign-made car,

198
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,140
while another became a homeowner.

199
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,770
My, this is going to get interesting.

200
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,460
Whoever peeled all of these
did a great job.

201
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
Now, some greens. Should I prep these too?

202
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,100
Oh, whatever. Why should I do something
she didn't even ask me to?

203
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,300
Darn it.

204
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,310
I'm going to the market.

205
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Again?

206
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,340
I forgot to buy some potatoes earlier.

207
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,210
Did you hide some treasures at the market?

208
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Did you prep these too?

209
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,680
Yes, didn't I do a good...

210
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,690
I'll be back.

211
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,460
What? Not even a word of praise?

212
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,360
Shoot, now I don't want to work.

213
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,430
We should move these over here.

214
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,700
- Here?
- Yes.

215
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,200
Sir.

216
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,570
Hey, you're back.

217
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,600
I forgot to buy potatoes earlier.

218
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,240
I'll take ten dollars' worth.

219
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,570
- Ten dollars? Okay.
- Yes.

220
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,680
Sir, by any chance,

221
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,450
did that employee get fired?

222
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,080
Oh, right.

223
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,850
I've been wanting to ask you.

224
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,290
Why in the world did you pay
for something my son did wrong?

225
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,090
What? Your son?

226
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,490
Hey.

227
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,330
- Hey, you're...
- What...

228
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,930
- What?
- Oh, my.

229
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,540
Hey, you can go ahead.

230
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,370
- But...
- The new employee is my son,

231
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,410
but you even paid me
to make up for his mistakes.

232
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,780
Why did you do that?

233
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,120
Wait, this guy is your son?

234
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,480
But that can't be right.

235
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,550
Me? His son?

236
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,660
Manager Choi.

237
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,020
Do you know this young lady?

238
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,320
Of course.

239
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,860
Wait, Manager?

240
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,130
But...

241
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,270
So, you...

242
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,270
work for Good and Foodville?

243
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,870
Yes.

244
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,470
No way. I thought you were a homeless man.

245
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,210
Gosh, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

246
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,910
No, it's understandable
why you thought that.

247
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,650
Then, why were you dressed like...

248
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,780
Like a total mess?

249
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,790
Yes.

250
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,490
At the time, we were working on
making a sample for the new product.

251
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,120
So, I was going around markets
since dawn and hauling ingredients.

252
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,860
Also, on the first day we met,
I even volunteered at a soup kitchen.

253
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,760
Oh, I see.

254
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,100
I'm sorry for the confusion.

255
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,370
I knew I should explain myself someday,

256
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,440
and we met again like this.

257
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,480
So, can we call it even?

258
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
Sure, let's do that.

259
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,950
May I ask your name?

260
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,920
I'm Ah Jin. Kim Ah Jin.

261
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,850
Ah Jin. Kim Ah Jin.

262
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,960
Anyway, I admit that
I've completely fallen for your cooking.

263
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,860
I'll be honest.

264
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,470
The dishes you make are better
than my mom's cooking.

265
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,470
What?

266
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,170
No way.

267
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,310
I'm just someone who works
at a small neighborhood restaurant.

268
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,040
You see,

269
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,680
anyone can cook,
but not everyone can cook well.

270
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,920
It's not easy to be born
with a talent like that.

271
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,120
I think you're a cooking genius, Ah Jin.

272
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,790
So, you can be more proud of yourself.

273
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,490
Look, you already have a fan.

274
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
A fan?

275
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,860
Yes, a die-hard fan.

276
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,340
What do you mean it's a scam?

277
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,040
That company,
Health Water or whatever it's called.

278
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,210
Apparently, they're a group of scammers
who specifically target seniors like you.

279
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,780
Dozens of people
have already fallen victim to this scam,

280
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,120
and you're one of them, Mom.

281
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,920
What will you do now?

282
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,490
You put up this house as collateral.

283
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,190
Why would you do something like that
without checking thoroughly first?

284
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,230
Gosh, seriously...

285
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,100
Mom! Mom, are you all right?

286
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,600
Mom!

287
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,100
- Mom, are you okay?
- Mother! What happened?

288
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,440
What's wrong with Mother?

289
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,910
Grandma. Mom, what's wrong with Grandma?

290
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,080
Mother, please snap out of it.
Can you hear me?

291
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,380
My money...

292
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,150
Pardon? What did you say?

293
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,190
Money... My money.

294
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Money?

295
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,830
What money?

296
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,260
My money...

297
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,630
- My money. What should I do?
- Mother!

298
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,670
So, you're saying...

299
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,910
Mother fell victim to a pyramid scheme
and lost all her money?

300
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,080
Okay, so? How much are we talking?

301
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,980
How much money did she lose?

302
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,390
That's...

303
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,220
Our house.

304
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,490
What about our house?

305
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,360
Well, she took out a loan
using the house as collateral,

306
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,970
and she lost all of it.

307
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,970
What did you say?

308
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,850
(Account Balance: 2,600,000 Dollars)

309
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,550
It was a good call...

310
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,050
not to dip into the money
I had set aside for Mu Chul.

311
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,080
Considering what happened today,

312
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,820
he could recover his memory at any moment.

313
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,230
Even if he finds out that
the Daewoon Building is in my name now,

314
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,260
I have an excuse for it,
so it won't matter.

315
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,070
Gyu Tae.

316
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,730
Hey, you're here.
Are you done for the day?

317
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,540
Yes. Aren't you heading out?

318
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,170
Yes, I should.

319
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,640
Anyway, what's up?

320
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,880
Let me work here.

321
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,050
What?

322
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,820
Why, all of a sudden?

323
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,420
I want to become rich, like you.

324
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,690
Honestly, I'm struggling to make ends meet
with the pay Dae Sik is giving me.

325
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,490
Why does he suddenly want to work here?

326
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,960
Has he caught on?

327
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,000
Hey, you can't work in real estate
just because you want to.

328
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,200
I know that.

329
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,670
I'll study hard and get the license,
so show me how the real work is done.

330
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,840
I promise I'll work really hard.

331
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,110
I'm sorry,

332
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,040
but I don't need an employee.

333
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
What?

334
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,580
And you aren't young anymore.

335
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,980
Working two jobs a day
would be too exhausting.

336
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,720
Forget it.
If you need money, just tell me.

337
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,820
I'll just give it to you.

338
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,260
No, I'm trying to...

339
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,190
Then get your realtor license first.

340
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,900
Then I'll think about it.

341
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,870
- All right. I'm off.
- Goodness.

342
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,670
Hey, wait. I found a house for you.

343
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,610
A house?

344
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,640
You asked me to find you a place.
They called me today.

345
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,950
It's a two-bedroom apartment
in a low-rise building.

346
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,780
It's not too far from here.
It seemed pretty nice.

347
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,790
The current tenant is moving out
in two weeks.

348
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,260
Think that you'll move there
in two weeks and get ready.

349
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,690
Well, all right.

350
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,460
Thanks.

351
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,270
(Number One Real Estate)

352
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,740
I can do anything
and everything you ask me to.

353
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,980
Oh, boy.

354
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,250
So, I've found a place to live.

355
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,620
Once I move out...

356
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,360
My gosh. What should I do with my life?

357
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,730
- We're home.
- We're home.

358
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,430
Hey, you're home.

359
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,470
Dad, are you going somewhere?

360
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,910
What's the matter with Dad?
Did something happen?

361
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,520
So, Dad found out?

362
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,290
What should we do, Seok Jin?

363
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,020
Your dad is fuming mad.

364
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,530
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

365
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,860
Why is this your fault? Don't say that.

366
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,360
Anyway, what should we do?

367
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,430
I've seen your dad angry before,

368
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,440
but I've never seen him that furious.

369
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,410
My heart is still pounding.
It's killing me.

370
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,850
Here.

371
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,120
The current tenant is moving out
in two weeks.

372
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,450
Think that you'll move there
in two weeks and get ready.

373
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,590
Oh, well. That means...

374
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,560
I don't have much time left
to spend with my family.

375
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,800
Here, have some more.

376
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,770
Tae Ha.

377
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,740
Are you enjoying your job?

378
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,770
It's not too bad.

379
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,310
Never skip lunch.

380
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,780
You work at a restaurant,
so there must be many side dishes.

381
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,780
Don't eat out all the time.

382
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,120
Try to eat meals
that taste like home-cooked food.

383
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,220
Okay.

384
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,420
And you, Seo Woo.

385
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,760
When do you plan to go back to school?

386
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,900
You can go back, right?

387
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,340
I never went to college,
so I don't know how these things work.

388
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,140
Yes, I can go back.
I'm just taking some time off.

389
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,350
I see. There's a right time
for studying too.

390
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,550
I couldn't go to college
because I had to make money,

391
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,350
but you already got in,
so don't let that opportunity go to waste.

392
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,960
Go back to school and study again.
I'll take care of your tuition.

393
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,730
You're going to pay my tuition fees?

394
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,660
Yes. Of course, I should.
Why are you so surprised?

395
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,170
Also, if there's anything...

396
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,770
that requires fixing or repair,

397
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,110
I'll take care of it.

398
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,510
Just tell me.

399
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,680
Okay, will do.

400
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,970
Hey, Gyeong Sim.

401
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,070
A job? What kind of job is it?

402
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,770
It's a server position at a restaurant,

403
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,080
but you can work as a dishwasher
if you prefer.

404
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,310
You're not comfortable
showing your face in public.

405
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,580
At a restaurant? I see.

406
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,950
Is there
a different kind of job available?

407
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,590
Hey, we can't pick and choose at our age.

408
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,260
Besides,
you don't really have any experience.

409
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,130
I had to plead with them
to arrange this for you.

410
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,930
All right. Let me think about it.

411
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,400
Yes, thanks.

412
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,190
What is this?

413
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,460
I got an advance.

414
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,160
Use it for your living expenses.

415
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,540
I'm the kids' father.

416
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,840
At least let me cover their food expenses.

417
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,570
Just take it, please.

418
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,250
I'll continue to cover
the family's living expenses,

419
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,120
so if it's not enough money,

420
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,250
just let me know.

421
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
All right, then.

422
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,710
Right.

423
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,810
I'll do my best...

424
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,980
during the time
I have left with my family.

425
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,450
From now on, let's act like
a proper dad and husband...

426
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,890
with no regrets.

427
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,160
I can do this.

428
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,410
My gosh.

429
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,790
My back hurts.

430
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,960
(Real Estate Sales Contract)

431
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,300
(Account Balance: 2,600,000 Dollars)

432
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Wait.

433
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,670
What if Mu Chul gets his license...

434
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,040
and wants to work here?

435
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,870
Gosh, Mu Chul got better grades
than me in school.

436
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
Right.

437
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
I will...

438
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,580
hide these in here.

439
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,220
And I'll take this home.

440
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,560
My goodness.

441
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,090
There we go.

442
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,760
- Hey, Gyu Tae.
- Hey.

443
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,530
Dae Sik.
What brings you here at this hour?

444
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,600
Let me sleep here for the night.

445
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What?

446
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,170
Why would you sleep here?
You have your own house.

447
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,870
I have my reasons.

448
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,580
- Move aside.
- Why should I move aside? My gosh.

449
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,450
- Give me that.
- Give you what?

450
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,680
Hey, but... Why...

451
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,980
Come on, I need a pillow, don't I?

452
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,720
Wait, but...

453
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,850
You can go home. I'll lock up.

454
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,230
Gosh, that's nice and comfortable.

455
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,800
But that's... My gosh.

456
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,570
(Good Luck!)

457
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,510
Dad didn't come home last night?

458
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,310
Seok Jin,
can you guess what this is about?

459
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,650
Just because you give them some money
and try to win their favor now,

460
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,950
it doesn't mean you can change
how the kids feel about you.

461
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,950
What's your relationship with Mr. Kim?

462
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,960
Me?

463
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,930
But you know, Hye Sook, you...

464
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,130
Oh, my.

465
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
