00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,910
(Episode 28)

2
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,290
Grandma...

3
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,900
Grandma.

4
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,170
Grandma.

5
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,710
What?

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
What...

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
What?

8
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,850
Hey, you woke up.

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,320
Where am I?

10
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,690
Why...

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,390
am I here?

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,400
You don't remember?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,030
You hurt your head...

14
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,500
and was passed out on the street,

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,140
so I brought you here.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,940
On the street?

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,170
Yes, that's right. Do you remember now?

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,080
What time is it now?

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,280
- Oh, no. Grandma, no...
- Hey.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,450
Hey, wait. Your glasses.

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,450
Pardon?

22
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,560
Right.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,160
Oh, yes.

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,260
Thank you.

25
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,660
Thank you for saving me.
I'll never forget your kindness.

26
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,270
- Please!
- What?

27
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,970
Does he not recognize me?

28
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,910
Grandma.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
My house.

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,320
I have to go to Grandma.

31
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,920
I must hurry.

32
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,870
(Receipt, Kim Dae Sik, 95,321.55 dollars)

33
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,740
So now,

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,340
this house is mine.

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,210
I own a home now too.

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,320
Thank you, Mom.

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,090
Wait.

38
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,660
What am I going to tell Hye Sook?

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,000
That's Jin Tae.

40
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,270
- Oh, my.
- Hey, did you buy a new car?

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,210
Geum Ok, what do you think?
This is the newest model.

42
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,710
My gosh. It's very nice.

43
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,340
Your restaurant must be doing well
these days,

44
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,740
seeing how you bought such a nice car.

45
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,810
Come on. I didn't buy this myself.

46
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,210
My brother bought me this.

47
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,220
What? Gyu Tae?

48
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,850
What? But he has no money.

49
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,520
He said he recently sold a building.

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
He bought me this
with the commission he got.

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,560
Really?

52
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,190
I thought he spent all his money
to pay for Min Yong's surgery.

53
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,130
How did he buy this car?

54
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, yes. Are you calling
from Baeheung Real Estate?

55
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,940
That's right. I'm Choi Gyu Tae.

56
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,040
Mr. Kim gave me your business card.

57
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,940
He said you were interested
in buying some land here.

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,850
Oh, yes.

59
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,580
Then by any chance,

60
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,880
do you have some time this weekend?

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,660
Yes, I'll see you then.
We'll talk more in person.

62
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,990
Sure, have a good day.

63
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,300
Is there anything you like?

64
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,860
Yes.

65
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,170
I'd like this ring.

66
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,300
Could you show me some bracelets?

67
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,410
Oh, my. It will look amazing
if you wear them as a set.

68
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,440
Gentlemen like you who exude luxury...

69
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,710
should wear pure gold
as it suits you best.

70
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,550
Oh, is that so?

71
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,180
Then can I see it?

72
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,420
Here.

73
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,690
Oh, my. Gold is the best.

74
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,190
It looks great as an accessory,

75
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,730
and you can make money when you sell it.

76
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,600
How great is that?

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,400
Oh, my.

78
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,940
These look so cool.

79
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,410
(Number One Real Estate)

80
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,080
Oh, hello.

81
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,850
My gosh. What brings you here?

82
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,180
Has my husband...

83
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,750
mentioned anything about our move?

84
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,490
Your move?

85
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,790
Yes. As you know, we have to move soon.

86
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,830
Our lease is almost up.

87
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,930
I was wondering
if my husband had checked out some places.

88
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,370
Well, as you know, both Dae Sik and I...

89
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,840
had a lot to take care of
because of what happened to Mu Chul,

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,340
so we couldn't do anything else
for a while.

91
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,710
I was actually going to start
looking into it again for you.

92
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,710
Do you have a specific place in mind?

93
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,380
Yes, I...

94
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,480
I shouldn't tell him I want to buy
an unsold apartment unit, right?

95
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,220
I have an expert right in front of me
but can't even ask him.

96
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,990
This is so frustrating.

97
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,390
You know about our situation.

98
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,630
We can't afford to be picky.

99
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,460
Then I'll take some time...

100
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,100
and look into it again for you.

101
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,330
All right.

102
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,240
My gosh. What is that?

103
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,410
What's with that tacky gold necklace?

104
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,340
Goodness. He looks like
a gangster's lackey or something.

105
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,910
Oh, did you want to talk to me
about something else?

106
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,290
What? Oh, that's such a nice necklace.

107
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,620
Your bracelet and ring are nice too.

108
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,360
Oh, really? Well...

109
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,390
I went shopping to get some retail therapy
and bought these. So?

110
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,160
Do these suit me?

111
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,830
Yes. They look so fancy,
and they sure stand out.

112
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,200
They really suit you.

113
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,670
Thank you. Oh, let me.

114
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,810
- Here, get home safe.
- Bye.

115
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,510
Of course.
Everyone thinks these are very cool.

116
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,550
(Daewoon Building)

117
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,550
My gosh.

118
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,490
Can I win Dae Sik over
by cooking something delicious for him?

119
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,930
- Hello.
- Hello.

120
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,290
Oh, you're selling octopus.

121
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,030
I'll get an octopus.

122
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,800
Hold on. Should I buy some for Mi Jin
and drop it off at her house too?

123
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,840
My gosh.
You bought meat, octopus, and fish.

124
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,140
Oh! Isn't this crab?

125
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,040
Goodness, I know you like crab.

126
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,850
They're nice and fresh,
so you should steam them up soon.

127
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,850
If you get sick of that,
you could make some crab soup.

128
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,780
Only give Gwang Sik a little bit.

129
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,720
No. You should just steam them up
and eat them as soon as I leave.

130
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,260
You should loosen your belt...

131
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,320
and eat your fill while no one is around.

132
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,130
If you're with your family,
it won't be enough food...

133
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,630
since you would have to share.

134
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,700
Mom.

135
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,030
Oh, my. What's up with you?

136
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,400
You're the only person
who cares about me, indeed.

137
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,300
I've been craving crab recently.

138
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,470
I'll eat my fill until I'm about to burst.

139
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,070
Goodness,
all I did was buy you a few crabs.

140
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,710
Why are you so touched?

141
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,710
By the way, Mom,

142
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,750
do you have the money
to splurge on me like this?

143
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,080
What?

144
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,780
Hey, I'm home.

145
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,780
Oh, my.

146
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Mother.

147
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,920
What brings you here, Ms. Lee?

148
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,790
How have you been, Ms. Park?
It's been a while.

149
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,060
I was in the area
and stopped by to drop something off.

150
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,700
Oh, I see.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,370
But what did you have to drop off
that you came all this way?

152
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,370
My mom brought crab,

153
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,440
meat, abalones, and a few other things
for me to eat.

154
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Is that right?

155
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,910
Gosh, you didn't have to buy all this.
It must've been so heavy.

156
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,620
We have all of this at home too.

157
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,620
Oh, it wasn't heavy at all.

158
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,920
I bought everything with a happy heart...

159
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,860
for you and Gwang Sik to enjoy.

160
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,920
I mean, your household income
must've gone down by a third...

161
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,060
since Mi Jin lost her job recently.

162
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,830
So, I was worried about
how you guys were eating and all.

163
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,830
How we were eating?

164
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,440
Someone might think that we're starving.

165
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,870
Gosh, that's not what I meant.

166
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,410
Actually, since we're on the topic,

167
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,880
Gwang Sik is riding a scooter around...

168
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,080
to work as a deliveryman these days.

169
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,450
Did you know?

170
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,620
I mean, it's been so long
since he quit his job,

171
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,360
but he still can't find a new one.

172
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,090
Do you understand this situation?

173
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,060
I just can't wrap my head around it.

174
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,130
Mom.

175
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,430
Yes, then let me also say something
since we're on the topic.

176
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,600
You must've called my son over...

177
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,240
and scolded him about that the other day.

178
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,640
No matter how mad you are,

179
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,580
you should leave the kids' issues
for them to resolve on their own.

180
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,280
If he can't find a job,

181
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,180
you won't have them stay married?

182
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,720
How could you say that as an elder?

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,020
Wait, did Gwang Sik say that?

184
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,690
That I scolded him?

185
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,690
Also, you.

186
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,030
Were you so upset that your mother-in-law
cooked your husband some crab?

187
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,630
Your husband is working so hard
outside of the house.

188
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,700
It would be one thing
if you were taking good care of him.

189
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,430
But you just sat there,
expressing how upset you were.

190
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,700
Did you tattle
to your mother this time too?

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,500
Mother, it's not like that.

192
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,640
Wait a minute, Ms. Park.

193
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,340
What you just said...

194
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,980
Do you mean you only fed the crab
to Gwang Sik, leaving my daughter out?

195
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,610
Mom, it's not like that.

196
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,750
All she brought when she got married
was herself and nothing more.

197
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,280
I thought it was a disgrace,
but I held my tongue all this time.

198
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,120
You shouldn't act like this, Ms. Lee!

199
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Hang on.

200
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,490
Are you doing this because Mi Jin
didn't bring wedding gifts?

201
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,890
I mean, you were the one
who said that she should just move in...

202
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,860
since you couldn't afford
to find them a house.

203
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,790
Why are you changing your tune now?

204
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,830
I'm heading to my room now.

205
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,860
Mother!

206
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,800
I can't believe this.

207
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,640
Mom.

208
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,780
Hey, it's me.

209
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,550
Do you know when Jung Ah will be back
from her honeymoon?

210
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,250
Today?

211
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,090
Oh, nothing. Bye.

212
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,790
It was so much fun, wasn't it?

213
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,990
One second.

214
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,160
(Ji Woong)

215
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,600
Oh, it's your friend.

216
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,030
How did he know you just got back?

217
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,870
I know, right?

218
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,300
I'll call him back later.

219
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,510
Just take it. Why make him wait?

220
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,470
Go on.

221
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,380
Shall I?

222
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,380
Hey, it's been a while.

223
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,650
Tae Hyung.

224
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,250
Are you back in Korea?

225
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,760
I called just in case.

226
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Yes, just now.

227
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,160
Hey, how did you know
to call me right when I got back?

228
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,260
I missed you a lot.

229
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,730
Can we meet now?

230
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,730
Now?

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,240
That's too bad. I have to go home.

232
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,470
Is that so?

233
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,980
Then, I'll come to you.

234
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,850
You're standing right in front of me
at the moment.

235
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,250
A black cardigan with brown pants.

236
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,990
That's you, right?

237
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
What's wrong?

238
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,060
If you don't want me to show myself,

239
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,760
I'll send you an address.

240
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,860
Meet me there.

241
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,370
Hey, I'm sorry, Jung Ah.

242
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,330
Something came up.
I'll have to go somewhere for a bit.

243
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,840
What? Where?

244
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,210
We said we'd go and greet my parents.

245
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,810
Something urgent came up for Ji Woong.

246
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,510
You should go ahead.

247
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
Tae Hyung!

248
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,620
Seo Woo! What happened?

249
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,490
How did you know I was back...

250
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
Oh, my.

251
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,130
What do you think you're doing?

252
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,430
Hey!

253
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,260
That woman I saw is your wife, right?

254
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,330
And what? You don't have a girlfriend?

255
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,770
Seriously, you little...

256
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,940
- Let me go!
- That's enough, Tae Hyung.

257
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,240
Darn it.

258
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,310
Why?

259
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,810
Why don't you make excuses
in front of your friend too?

260
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,210
Why should I? I did nothing wrong.

261
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,680
Let's go. Come on. Let's have a talk.

262
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,380
You even had a girlfriend,

263
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,050
and you were two-timing me.

264
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,890
But what? You did nothing wrong?

265
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,220
You had a fiancee.

266
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,160
Why did you ask to go on a trip with me?

267
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,630
Do you think I'm such a pushover?

268
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,630
Hey.

269
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,290
You must be mistaken...

270
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,560
that you're some kind of sad heroine
of a fairytale.

271
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,400
I knew that you had strings of guys.

272
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,770
You've had all your fun.

273
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,570
Why are you acting all innocent?

274
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,940
- What?
- Tae Hyung, stop this.

275
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,540
What kind of man would look at you
and consider you marriage material?

276
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
The trip?

277
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,510
That was because
that's all you're good for.

278
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,880
A girl to have a bit of fun with!

279
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,180
Hey, Kim Tae Hyung!

280
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
Seo Woo!

281
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
How dare she?

282
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,530
Oh, no.

283
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Seo Woo!

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,300
(Daewoon Building)

285
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,810
(Transaction history,
Total balance: minus 2,152 dollars)

286
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,380
(Kim Ah Jin)

287
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,650
Darn it.

288
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,880
Whatever.

289
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,160
Meet me outside this instant.

290
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,930
We still have more to discuss.

291
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,930
Am I crazy? I won't meet up with you.

292
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,870
Gosh, what do I do now?

293
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,100
Creditors are hounding me
to pay them back already,

294
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,770
but we'll lose the house too?

295
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,150
Mom, are you asleep?

296
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,550
Can we talk for a minute?

297
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,750
What will you do now?

298
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,820
We can't just do nothing
and avoid the situation.

299
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,490
We should come up with a plan.

300
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,490
Will you just sit here
until we get kicked out of the house?

301
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,130
Mom!

302
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,830
Mom, what's wrong?

303
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,040
Hey, you're burning up.

304
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,770
Mom, wake up.

305
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,310
Mom!

306
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,780
What?

307
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,350
She didn't bring anything but herself
when she got married?

308
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,490
She should be grateful that
she even married that old son of hers.

309
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,520
How dare she ask for more?

310
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,820
Tae Ha. Are you going somewhere?

311
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,130
The hospital... I mean, the pharmacy.

312
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,490
Why? Is someone sick?

313
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,930
It's not me. It's my mom.
I'll be going now.

314
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,960
Oh, okay.

315
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,430
Gosh, Mi Ja is sick?

316
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,770
How bad is she
that the kid looks as white as a sheet?

317
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,680
So, you won't pick up?

318
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,810
Gosh, that money means so much to me.

319
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,050
How could he blow that money?

320
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,450
Hey, there.

321
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,890
You're on the same side as that punk,
Han Tae Ha, aren't you?

322
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,130
Are you going to order something?

323
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,990
Tell us while we're being nice.

324
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,760
Where is Han Tae Ha now?

325
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,700
Where do you think you're going?

326
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,630
Let go of me.

327
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,070
You know.

328
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,270
Don't pretend like you don't.

329
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,870
Do you think I don't know
that you're working together?

330
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,870
Goodness.

331
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,310
Hey, seriously. Do you have a death wish?

332
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,810
Fine! Go ahead and kill me!

333
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,610
- Darn it.
- Kill me, then.

334
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,880
Do you think you're the only ones
who lost money?

335
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,520
I lost money too!

336
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,020
I'm so angry with Han Tae Ha
that I don't know what I might do.

337
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,920
Don't try to fool us.

338
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,430
- Fine, come at me!
- Darn you!

339
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,630
Hey!

340
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,590
I was furious to begin with.

341
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,400
Let's see who dies or collapses.

342
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,560
- Let's go!
- Come on.

343
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,230
Hey, missy. Seriously?

344
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,230
- What?
- Darn it.

345
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,970
- Give me back my 30,000 dollars!
- Where is Han Tae Ha?

346
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,710
Oh, it's my neighborhood.

347
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,950
What?

348
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,320
Man Young's house is gone.

349
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,850
And Seung Hwan's house too.

350
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,750
Where did they all go?

351
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,890
That's weird.

352
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
What?

353
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,330
My house is all gone.

354
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,070
Then, where did Grandma go?

355
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,740
What happened?

356
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,650
My head hurts.

357
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,120
Gosh, I feel like
my head is about to split in half.

358
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,360
Mom, are you all right?

359
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,350
This is really bad.

360
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,120
We're about to lose our house,
and Mom's bedridden now.

361
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,090
If only I hadn't fallen for that scam,

362
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,360
my family wouldn't have had to
deal with this mess.

363
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,200
(Receipt, Kim Dae Sik, 95,321.55 dollars)

364
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,570
How should I tell her?

365
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,310
She's already very upset with me.

366
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,210
If I tell her I bought this house...

367
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,180
Oh, boy.

368
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,450
Yes, I should tiptoe around her feelings
as much as I can...

369
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,220
to appease her anger. It's the only way.

370
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,660
Is today some kind of special day?

371
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,090
I see steamed octopus and short rib soup.

372
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,930
These are all Dad's favorite dishes.

373
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,070
Of course.

374
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,240
Pleasing your dad is my mission for today.

375
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,100
I haven't cooked these in a while,

376
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,670
so I'm not sure if they're seasoned well.

377
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,880
What?

378
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,110
I'm sure they taste good.

379
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,010
Anyway, how come Seok Jin isn't here?

380
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,280
The grand opening is in a few days,
so I think he's busy.

381
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,820
Oh, really?

382
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,490
All right, let's dig in.

383
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,490
Okay.

384
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,660
The octopus is so good.

385
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,530
Dad, hurry up and try it.

386
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,000
Here.

387
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,170
Oh, my. It's very tender and delicious.

388
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,310
I'm telling you.
Your mom is such a great cook.

389
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
You probably don't know this.
I married your mom...

390
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,850
because I fell for her cooking skills.

391
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,050
You did?

392
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,150
Just my cooking skills?

393
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,990
Then you should've married
some restaurant owner's daughter.

394
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,520
Why did you marry me?

395
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,360
Of course, I fell for your looks,
first and foremost.

396
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,130
After that, you won my heart
with your cooking skills. I was...

397
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,830
completely head over heels for her.

398
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,600
Stop it, honey. You're making me blush
in front of our daughter.

399
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,230
Lucky you, Mom.

400
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,770
Your husband says
you're still pretty at your age.

401
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,070
My gosh. I want to marry a man
who's just like Dad.

402
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,910
Hey.

403
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,340
I told you the other day.

404
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,510
You won't find another man like your dad.

405
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,410
Not every woman gets to marry
such a wonderful man like him.

406
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,350
It's only possible
if you've built good deeds...

407
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,650
for three generations in a row.

408
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,920
What? For three generations? My goodness.

409
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,130
So, have you two made up?

410
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,430
Have we made up? Why?

411
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,360
When did we even fight?

412
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,830
Right, honey?

413
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,070
Yes, that's right. We didn't fight.

414
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,940
Honey, here. You should try this too.

415
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,270
- Okay.
- Here.

416
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,900
- Open wide.
- Here.

417
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,170
Open wide.

418
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,280
- What about you? This?
- Yes, sure.

419
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,580
This is good for you.

420
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,890
Yes, well done.

421
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,490
With that as bait,
I'm sure my plan will work out.

422
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,890
Be persuasive, Kim Dae Sik.

423
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,660
Be persuasive, Kim Dae Sik.

424
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,930
Honey.

425
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,200
Oh, my. Honey.

426
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,530
Let's sit down.

427
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,640
My goodness. Honey.

428
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,640
You worked so hard
to cook so much food today.

429
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,440
It was nothing hard.

430
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,610
I was so happy while cooking the dishes,

431
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,240
knowing you'd eat them.

432
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,110
Oh, that feels nice.

433
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,680
By the way, honey.

434
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,990
I actually wanted to talk to you
about something.

435
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,020
Really? You did?

436
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,030
I wanted to talk to you
about something too.

437
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,930
You go first, honey.

438
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,160
The thing is,

439
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,730
I went to a department store...

440
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,340
and bought furniture.

441
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,500
What? Furniture?

442
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,910
I mean, we'll need new furniture
if we're moving anyway.

443
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,610
The furniture pieces we have now
won't work in our new home.

444
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,350
They said...

445
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,450
they had a sale on until today,

446
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,020
so I just put down a deposit.

447
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,220
We have to order these things
way in advance,

448
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,460
or it'll take forever to get them.

449
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,890
Good.

450
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,730
What? You think it's good?

451
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,730
We'd need to buy them anyway.

452
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,730
It's not a bad idea
to buy them in advance.

453
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,570
Good thinking.

454
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,640
- Thank you, honey!
- My goodness.

455
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,580
You kept telling me not to spend money,

456
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,610
so I was really frustrated.

457
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,850
I feel like I can finally breathe now.

458
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,150
Goodness, silly you.

459
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,720
Does it make you that happy?

460
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,120
Yes, of course.

461
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,190
I'll be honest.
When you said you didn't want to move,

462
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,430
it made me very upset.

463
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,800
We may have won the lottery,
but it didn't even feel real.

464
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,900
We had money but couldn't even spend it.

465
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,710
Why do you think I told you...

466
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,210
to just give the lottery ticket back
to Mr. Han?

467
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,510
But...

468
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,110
it's finally starting to feel real now.

469
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,720
I guess we can actually move soon.

470
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,520
I, Lee Hye Sook,

471
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,090
can live it up, at last.

472
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,430
Well, honey.

473
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,000
Honey. Now, we just need
to buy an apartment unit.

474
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,870
Then half of our work is done.

475
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,340
Let's move to a newly built apartment...

476
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,440
and start fresh, the two of us.

477
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,780
I...

478
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,040
promise...

479
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,110
I'll be so good to you
for the rest of my life.

480
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,980
You caved in
and are letting me have my way.

481
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,620
I will...

482
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,890
never forget this.

483
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Oh, right.

484
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,260
What did you want to talk to me about?

485
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,230
You said earlier
that you had something to tell me.

486
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,430
What?

487
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,800
Oh, it was nothing.

488
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,040
Gosh, I'm so forgetful.

489
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,970
I totally forgot
that I was boiling laundry.

490
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,880
Let me go and check.

491
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,310
Oh, dear.

492
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,550
What has gotten into him?

493
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,320
He won't even get mad at me
for buying such expensive furniture?

494
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,990
Does this mean
I can start spending some money now?

495
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm so excited!

496
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,730
My head hurts.

497
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,330
Grandma... I must find her soon.

498
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,640
- Watch out!
- My goodness.

499
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,910
Oh, what is that?

500
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,740
I've never seen it before.

501
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,350
My gosh.

502
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,910
What? Na Hoon A is having a concert?

503
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,350
Will you go to his concert?

504
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,420
Of course. I love Na Hoon A.

505
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,090
- I'll have my daughter find me a ticket.
- Na Hoon A?

506
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,890
My daughter is very good at these things.

507
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,330
Wouldn't it be so nice
if she got good grades too?

508
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,460
Myung Hee got the highest grade
in her class.

509
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,460
- Yes.
- What? What did you say?

510
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,560
- What?
- What's your deal?

511
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,200
(The Last Concert, Thank You)

512
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,240
What? What happened to Na Hoon A's face?

513
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,440
Oh, no.

514
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,750
Someone must've colored his hair white
as a prank.

515
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,910
People are so mean.

516
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,890
Sir!

517
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
Sir.

518
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,060
My gosh.

519
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,760
- Sir.
- Yes.

520
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,930
You said...

521
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,660
you found me passed out...

522
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,170
on the street, right?

523
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,640
Yes, that's right. What about it?

524
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,910
Didn't you notice anything strange
when you found me?

525
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,970
Anything strange?

526
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,010
Not really. Why? Did something happen?

527
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,750
Earlier today,

528
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,780
my grandmother wasn't feeling well,

529
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,120
so I was on my way home.
That much I remember.

530
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,920
Gosh, but after that...

531
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
What?

532
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,560
What's with this calendar?

533
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,470
What do you mean? It's a calendar.

534
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
But this says 2025 here.

535
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,710
Right, that's because it's the year 2025.

536
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,510
What?

537
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,910
It's 2025 now?

538
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,910
Yes.

539
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,650
My goodness.

540
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
What?

541
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,220
It's 2025?

542
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,590
What?

543
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
What is this?

544
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,600
What happened to my face?

545
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,770
What happened?

546
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,980
Why am I...

547
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,010
so old?

548
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,150
(Good Luck!)

549
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,150
How could you be fine...

550
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,460
when your house
is being put up for auction?

551
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,890
We can't find your identity.

552
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,390
Then, do you mean
you can't find out who I am?

553
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,500
About my house...

554
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,160
- I bought it.
- What?

555
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,870
Please keep it a secret
for the time being.

556
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,270
I wish I could beg you...

557
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,140
to let Mu Chul's family stay there.

558
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,540
I remembered something.

559
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,010
