1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,410
(All child actors filmed safely
under the supervision of their guardians.)

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,410
(Animal scenes were directed
and filmed...)

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,410
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,880
What? Honey, what happened?

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,450
(Episode 61)

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,450
I...

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,520
I remember.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,930
You remember? What do you mean?

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,770
The time...

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,370
we kissed at the bed and breakfast.

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,470
The moment I heard this,

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,510
it all came back to me.

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,780
My gosh.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,710
Anything else?

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,980
Do you remember anything else?

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,790
No.

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,520
That's all I remember.

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,690
Nothing else.

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,460
What about your injuries?

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,470
Is your back okay now?

21
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,670
Yes, I think so.

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,340
I think my memory is coming back,
slowly but surely.

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,840
The first thing that came back to me
was that moment with you.

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,210
Mi Ja.

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,610
You know, that night...

26
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,610
You should just...

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
sleep here alone tonight.

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,690
And tomorrow,

29
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,560
I want you to move out.

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,620
I'm telling you my memory is back.

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,430
How could you be so indifferent?

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,530
I'm your husband,
the man you've lived with for decades...

33
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,400
and your kids' father.
I'm telling you my memory is coming back,

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,940
and you feel nothing?

35
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,610
You see,

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,810
I erased you from my life a long time ago.

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,080
I shut you out the moment you died.

38
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,190
So don't expect anything from me.

39
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,190
I just...

40
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,460
I just wanted to stay by your side, Mi Ja.
That's all.

41
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,670
When I saw how much you hated me,

42
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,470
I deeply regretted
how I wronged you in the past,

43
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,500
but more than that,

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,480
I just liked being near you.

45
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,850
It's fine even if you don't believe me.

46
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,990
Please...

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,460
Please just let me stay here.

48
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,690
Mi Ja, I wish to...

49
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,260
recover my memory and identity
by your side...

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,370
and become the family head
who can stand confidently before everyone.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
So, please...

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,470
Then why did you do that?

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,870
The promise you made.

54
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,440
Why did you break your promise?

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,450
You said you'd protect me
for the rest of your life.

56
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,510
You said you would only look at me,
always.

57
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,620
So, what is this?

58
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,590
You cheated on me
like you wanted me to see it,

59
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,760
then just left me. And what?

60
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,060
You want me to forgive you now?

61
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,030
You say...

62
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,470
you lost your memory, but I...

63
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,370
still vividly remember
the pain you caused me.

64
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,740
I want to ask why you did such a thing,

65
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,950
but what's the point
when you remember nothing?

66
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,550
You don't remember how it happened.
It'll only cause me more pain!

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
So,

68
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,160
please leave now.

69
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,160
Unless you want to make things
even harder for me,

70
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,930
please leave.

71
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,360
My gosh...

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,050
Hey, Min Yong.

73
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,550
What?

74
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,120
Is he washing up?

75
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,780
This rascal.

76
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,060
(June 25 to July 2,
Parent-Teacher Conference Week)

77
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,700
Parent-Teacher Conference Week?

78
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,770
Hey, Jin Tae.

79
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,940
I think I've made a big mistake.

80
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,580
What? A mistake?

81
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,150
I think Min Yong's mad at me.
What can I do?

82
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,480
Got any ideas?

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,280
Well, let me think.

84
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,020
Oh, right.
Min Yong's birthday is coming up.

85
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,760
What? His birthday?

86
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,160
Yes, I'll throw him
an awesome birthday party. That'll do.

87
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,800
But where? And how?

88
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,970
What is this?

89
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,220
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

90
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,300
Goodness. How did this end up here?

91
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,470
Gosh, seriously.

92
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
What?

93
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,780
Where did that one sock go?

94
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,280
It's not like socks can walk.

95
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,650
My gosh.

96
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,150
What?

97
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,340
Gosh, you must be crazy, Hwang Geum Ok!

98
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,740
Please come to your senses!
Forget about that incident now!

99
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,850
How embarrassing.

100
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,890
Mu Chul.

101
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,190
Hey, what happened to you?

102
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,400
Are you better already?

103
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,570
Cheers.

104
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,570
(Jackpot Chicken, The Best Fried Chicken)

105
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,510
You could just drink by yourselves.
Why did you have to call me out too?

106
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,810
My goodness.

107
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,710
By the way,
you recovered really quickly, Mu Chul.

108
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,480
Yes, I know.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,290
Gosh, what a shame.

110
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,820
Why did I have to get better so soon?

111
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,330
- Hey, have a drink first.
- Okay.

112
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,600
By the way, what's going on?

113
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,340
So, guys.

114
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,510
If your kid says he's struggling
because he doesn't have money,

115
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,440
will you help him out?

116
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,740
Why? Did someone ask you for help?

117
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,980
No, don't ask me anything.

118
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,950
Just tell me. Will you help him or not?

119
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,590
Of course,
I should help him out if I have the money.

120
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,860
What? Is that what you're worried about?

121
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,930
Sure, you must have a lot to think about.

122
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,300
I heard through the grapevine,

123
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,470
and that family was
in the same situation as you.

124
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,000
But the whole family fell apart
not long after.

125
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,310
The family got into a fight
and made a huge fuss...

126
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,670
about who gets more money.

127
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,510
That's not all.

128
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,120
The whole neighborhood found out,

129
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,920
so that guy was almost kidnapped recently.

130
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,990
What? Kidnapped?

131
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,290
Kidnapped? What are you talking about?

132
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,390
Well, it's no big deal.
You don't have to know.

133
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,790
Hey!

134
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,900
My gosh.

135
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,130
Hey, you guys sometimes look down on me
because I lost my memory.

136
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,700
I may have skipped
from my early 20s to my current age,

137
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,470
but I know all there is to know.

138
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,080
Okay, fine. So, what would you do?

139
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,380
Of course, I'd help my kid out.

140
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,220
Why do you make money?

141
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,820
You make money
so you can live happily with your family.

142
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,190
There's no reason
not to help your kids out.

143
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,520
Don't make me laugh.

144
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,230
Do you think you're the type of guy
who'd help his family out?

145
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,130
Just wait until your memory comes back.

146
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,160
I bet you wouldn't give up
a single penny as soon as that happens.

147
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,800
My memory is back.

148
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,340
Wait, what does that mean?
Your memory is back?

149
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,580
It's just like I said.

150
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,380
My memory...

151
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,450
is back.

152
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,150
While listening to a cassette tape
that I gave Mi Ja before,

153
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,320
I suddenly remembered.

154
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,260
What was the memory about?

155
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,370
The first time Mi Ja and I...

156
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,100
went on a trip.

157
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I remembered.

158
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,340
So, don't you remember...

159
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,380
anything else?

160
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,850
No.

161
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,990
But this is the hopeful part.

162
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,830
Before, I only had headaches
and couldn't remember a thing.

163
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,470
But for the first time,
I remembered something...

164
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,240
on my own.

165
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,170
Soon,

166
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,540
I'm sure all of my memories...

167
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,380
will come back.

168
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,210
That's what I think.

169
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,250
What?

170
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,350
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Wipe yourself down.

171
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
You too.

172
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,960
Oh, also,

173
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,330
I'm going to leave for Mi Ja's sake.

174
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,900
I'm really...

175
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,930
going to move out. However,

176
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,300
this isn't the end. It's the beginning.

177
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,670
I'll regain my memory soon...

178
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,040
and go back to see Mi Ja and the kids.

179
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,150
You guys have to help me, okay?

180
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,980
- Of course.
- All right.

181
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,120
- All right.
- Cheers.

182
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,390
Yes. Cheers.

183
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,710
What if Mu Chul really gets
all of his memories back?

184
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,080
No, that won't be a problem.

185
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,390
I can just give him his money back.

186
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,490
That's right.
There's no need to be scared.

187
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,830
Will he perhaps remember something
about the lottery ticket?

188
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,430
No. And what if he does remember?

189
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,340
Did I steal from him or something?
I haven't done anything wrong.

190
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,040
Nothing at all.

191
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,480
Will everything be over tomorrow?

192
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:23,580
I won't be able to see Mi Ja
or the kids often anymore, right?

193
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
What's this?

194
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,880
These are donuts.

195
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,550
What's that?

196
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,750
Sweet rice donuts.

197
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,550
Did you buy these?
These are your favorite donuts.

198
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,060
No, I didn't buy them.

199
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,620
Is that right?

200
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,430
By the way, why are your eyes so puffy?

201
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,700
Mom.

202
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,000
What's this, all of a sudden?

203
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,330
How hard was it...

204
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,140
to raise the three of us
on a tight income?

205
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,840
Thanks, Mom. And I'm sorry.

206
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,480
Is today Mother's Day?
What's with the sudden appreciation?

207
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,680
Hey, about these donuts.

208
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,720
Do you maybe think your dad bought them?

209
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Dad?

210
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,090
He used to bring these home often
when you were young...

211
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,290
because you liked them.

212
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,430
Hang on a minute.

213
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Honey.

214
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,470
Did he leave already?

215
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,640
I'm sure he brought those home.

216
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,280
Why did he suddenly do that?

217
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,580
(669 Chicken)

218
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,810
(Number One Real Estate)

219
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,650
Hey, you're here.

220
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,320
Yes, you're here early.

221
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,030
- See you.
- Bye.

222
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,600
It's so awkward to face him
even for a short while.

223
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,170
How will I keep seeing him from now on?

224
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,810
My goodness. This is so uncomfortable.

225
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,380
That's right.

226
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,910
We said we'd forget about what happened.

227
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,280
I'm sure things will get better with time.

228
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,320
And moving on.

229
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,860
As Baeheung is likely to be named
the fifth new town development area,

230
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,330
the real estate transactions in the area
have been skyrocketing as of late.

231
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,430
The government has yet to make
an official statement...

232
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,530
But my spot will get filled
before you even know it.

233
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,630
Since Mr. Jang is leading it,

234
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,370
everyone wants in.

235
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,280
Hey, Mr. Kim.

236
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,590
It's me.
About the money I invested in Baeheung.

237
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,490
Could I maybe get that back?

238
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,290
Oh, I need some money
for something urgent.

239
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,190
Well, instead of that kind of promotion,
raising the quality of our products...

240
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,030
and ensuring that we build our image
to reach a wider audience might be better.

241
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,900
What do you think, Ms. Park?

242
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,370
I agree. We still have a long way to go.

243
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,110
Please politely turn down
that kind of offer.

244
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,140
Yes, I understand.

245
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,910
Send me the list of possible sites...

246
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,650
to move our distribution center,
like I mentioned before.

247
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,720
Let's wrap up today's meeting.

248
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,350
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

249
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,950
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you.

250
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,490
Hey, Seo Woo.

251
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,330
Can you talk right now?

252
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,130
I called since it was lunchtime.

253
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,500
Our meeting just ended.
What are you up to?

254
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,200
I was thinking of you, of course.

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,100
Gosh, I miss you.

256
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,000
Me too.

257
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,610
Ye Won.

258
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,480
I'll call you back later. Bye.

259
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,580
Shall we have lunch together?

260
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,380
I've found a good restaurant.

261
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,120
Sorry, I have plans.

262
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,520
Then, how about a cup of coffee?

263
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,920
The new coffee shop in the building
across from ours has good coffee.

264
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,490
Sorry, I have to get to a meeting
with a client right after.

265
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,660
I don't think I can have coffee either.

266
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,260
Hey, are you mad at me about something?

267
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,800
You've been acting strange
since yesterday. Tell me...

268
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,930
why you're upset.

269
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,900
Did Seo Woo tag along
on the business trip?

270
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,910
Yes, that's right. How did you know?

271
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,940
Seo Woo answered your phone
when I called you in the morning.

272
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,640
She said she was in Naju with you.

273
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,750
Well, it happened unexpectedly.

274
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,880
Is that why you're mad at me?

275
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,220
We're business partners
before we're friends.

276
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,820
Don't you think it's wrong...

277
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,920
to let your girlfriend tag along
on your work trip without telling me?

278
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,390
You're right. I was there to work.

279
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,960
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

280
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
I'm off.

281
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,070
Hello.

282
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,980
Who still uses coins these days?

283
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,850
Nowadays, it's all about cryptocurrencies.

284
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,590
What's wrong with using coins?

285
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,250
These are money too, you see.

286
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,030
Excuse me. How much is this?

287
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,060
What's this?

288
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,640
They were handing them out for free
on the street, so I grabbed one.

289
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,870
You can have it.

290
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,940
Amazing. I needed a coin purse.

291
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,810
Do you like it?

292
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,810
I love it so much!

293
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,410
But I have to say,

294
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,380
this is way too nice for a freebie.

295
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,250
Where did you get this?

296
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
What?

297
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,090
If they're still handing them out,
I want to get one more.

298
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,090
Where did you get this?

299
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,090
Oh, don't waste your time going there.

300
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,160
I got the last one.

301
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,760
Really? That's too bad.

302
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,300
Anyway, this will be so useful.
Thanks for this.

303
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,970
Hey, what can I do?
Do you need me to do anything?

304
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,770
Well, can you help me with this?

305
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,040
Sure.

306
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,440
Okay.

307
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,150
- It's been a while.
- Oh, Mr. Choi!

308
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,020
I guess you're closed today.

309
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,750
The sign outside says
you're closed temporarily.

310
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,220
We had to close today for renovations.

311
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,490
I see, renovations.

312
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,530
The truth is,
I'm taking over the business.

313
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,860
Oh, my.

314
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,630
Congratulations.
So, you really are a business owner now.

315
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,040
Oh, please. I'm embarrassed.

316
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,170
Anyway, I'm sad.

317
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,110
I came all this way
just to eat your food, Ah Jin.

318
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,340
Really?

319
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,740
We have no ingredients right now,

320
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,980
so I can't cook anything for you
even if I wanted to.

321
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,020
Well, that's okay.

322
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,520
Can I give you a hand
since I'm already here?

323
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,590
Is there anything I can do?

324
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,220
My gosh, no. I can't make a customer work.

325
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
Hey, Ah Jin.

326
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,530
Hey, brother! What brings you here?

327
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,390
I came to check on you,
to make sure you're working hard.

328
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,390
How's it going? Is it going well?

329
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Are you perhaps...

330
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,970
Aren't you Kim Seok Jin?

331
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
What? Are you Choi Dong Min?

332
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,800
Yes! I'm Dong Min.

333
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,670
My gosh. It's so good to see you.

334
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,270
How long has it been?

335
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,440
Hey, seriously.

336
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,980
I can't believe I ran into you here.

337
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,880
- Right?
- How have you been?

338
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,310
Do you two know each other?

339
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,950
Hang on.

340
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,620
Earlier, you called Seok Jin "brother."

341
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,160
Ah Jin, then are you...

342
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,190
that crybaby, Kim Ah Jin?

343
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,600
What? What are you talking about?

344
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,260
Hey, don't you remember Dong Min?

345
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,300
He used to come over a lot.
We went to elementary school together.

346
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,140
No way. Dong Min, that prankster?

347
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,840
Yes, that Dong Min.

348
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,740
No way.

349
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Oh, my.

350
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,250
You're all grown up now, Kim Ah Jin.

351
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,690
What? You were a regular at Buddumak?

352
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Yes.

353
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,960
Ah Jin is an amazing cook.

354
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,700
I got hooked on her cooking
without even realizing it.

355
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,100
My gosh. What a coincidence.

356
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,100
It's crazy how the two of you
didn't recognize each other.

357
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,300
I had no idea that little Kim Ah Jin
would have grown up so much.

358
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,810
Also, I was very chubby back then,
you know.

359
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,780
I look very different now.

360
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,680
Hey, I'm surprised
you didn't recognize him.

361
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,720
You had a crush on Dong Min
when you were little.

362
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,290
Did she?

363
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,350
Ah Jin had a crush on me?

364
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,060
Seok Jin, did you have to bring that up?

365
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,030
I'm a little embarrassed,

366
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,230
but I was really young back then.

367
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,860
That's right. I used to
have a crush on you, Dong Min.

368
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,800
Oh, my. What an honor.

369
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,370
Ah Jin used to have a crush on me?

370
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,610
So, was I your first love?

371
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,780
My gosh, stop it.

372
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,650
Why? It's fine. It was ages ago anyway.

373
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,280
- A long time ago,
- Yes.

374
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,180
- she asked me what you liked.
- What?

375
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,620
- So, that guy...
- Hey, stop it.

376
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,490
- is Kim Ah Jin's first love?
- I told you to stop.

377
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,760
You're investing
in Mr. Jang's new business?

378
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,570
Yes, your spot opened up,

379
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,670
so I grabbed it. Lucky me.

380
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,340
Nice. I knew he'd take the bait.

381
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,440
Congratulations.

382
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,780
I was bummed that I had to back out.

383
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,110
I'm so glad to hear that you took my spot.

384
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,320
I owe it all to you, Mrs. Taylor.

385
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,090
Oh, also...

386
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,590
Here.

387
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,690
You got Min Yong that gift,

388
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,730
and I was able to make the investment
thanks to you,

389
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,100
so I got you a little something.

390
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,860
Oh, my.

391
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,910
My gosh. It's so beautiful.

392
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,340
Does this mean...

393
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,410
today is our first day?

394
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,980
"First day?"

395
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,080
Our first day as a couple.

396
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,520
Oh, that reminds me.
Would you be able to...

397
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,590
come to my son's birthday party
if you're free?

398
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,530
What? Birthday party?

399
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,500
I want to properly introduce you...

400
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,270
to my son, Mrs. Taylor.

401
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,770
My son is very fussy.

402
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,540
I need my son's approval...

403
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,780
to date anyone.

404
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,250
Oh, I see.

405
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,280
Sure.

406
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,320
I'd love that.

407
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,850
I was curious about your son anyway.

408
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,160
Darn it. Why does he want to introduce me
to his son? What a hassle.

409
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,960
All right, then I'll expect
to see you at the party.

410
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,360
Please dig in.

411
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,870
What were you thinking,
throwing the ball so hard?

412
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,980
What would you have done
if you had broken his bone?

413
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,940
I didn't throw the ball
for Hyeong Il to catch.

414
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,280
I was just throwing it casually.

415
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,710
He tried to catch it and got hurt.

416
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,920
Look at you.
Are you blaming my son right now?

417
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,190
Mom, that's enough. Let's just go, okay?

418
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,390
Hold on.

419
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,690
Call your mom right now.

420
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,630
We should discuss his medical expenses
from this, so call your mom.

421
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
Now!

422
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,440
Can't you use this
to pay for his treatment?

423
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,270
Why, you...

424
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,040
Are you kidding me right now?

425
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,850
How dare you offer cash to your elder?

426
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,320
I'm sorry.

427
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,520
Forget it. Just call your mom now.

428
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,490
Now!

429
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,890
I'm his mom.

430
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,430
I am Min Yong's mom.

431
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,270
What's the matter?

432
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,340
Your son did this to my son's hand.

433
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,440
What will you do about this?

434
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,370
I apologize.

435
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,440
I apologize to you on my son's behalf.

436
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:41,180
And I'd like to send you some money
to help cover your son's treatment.

437
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,920
Could you give me
your bank account details?

438
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,090
Well, if you insist...

439
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,400
Here you go.

440
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,430
Thank you.

441
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,500
- Let's go.
- Wait.

442
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,900
You should apologize to my son too.

443
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,170
Sorry?

444
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,840
I should apologize?

445
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,410
He apologized
and asked for your forgiveness,

446
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,110
so how could you yell at him like that?

447
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,980
So, you need to...

448
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,750
apologize to my son
for yelling at him earlier.

449
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,940
I'll be going, then.

450
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,540
I'll come with you. I'll take you there.

451
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,710
No. There's no need to see me out.

452
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,080
If there's anything you need,

453
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,580
you can come and see me
at Jackpot Chicken.

454
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Bye.

455
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,400
Is Dad really leaving like this?

456
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,100
This is so sudden.

457
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,940
(Kim Dae Sik)

458
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,000
He's still not home.

459
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,870
I heard Mr. Han hurt himself
and wasn't coming to work.

460
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,970
Is he busy working by himself?

461
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,790
Are you just getting home?

462
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,290
Yes. Where's Mi Jin?

463
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,390
She's in Ah Jin's room.

464
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,730
Maybe it was because she was out all day
trying to borrow money,

465
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,730
but she didn't even eat,
saying she didn't have an appetite.

466
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,630
By the way,
those sweet rice donuts in the kitchen.

467
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,430
Did you buy those?

468
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,340
Tell the kids to come on out.
I have something to say.

469
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,180
The reason why I asked you guys
to get together...

470
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,950
is because of the lottery winnings.

471
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,420
I believe there have been
quite a few misunderstandings...

472
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,090
and speculations
because of that money up until now.

473
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,160
So, I've made up my mind.

474
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,390
The lottery winnings.

475
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,500
I'll split the money
and give it to you guys.

476
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,430
What are you saying?

477
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,470
You will give the money to the kids?

478
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,460
(Good Luck!)

479
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,390
You didn't answer when I called you.

480
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,760
Are you really angry?

481
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,130
What about asking for five million dollars
like Seok Jin?

482
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,670
- What?
- We can say...

483
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,930
that we'll pay it back like Seok Jin did.

484
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,970
Don't you remember
any of the people who were close to me?

485
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,710
- Right!
- What?

486
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,880
