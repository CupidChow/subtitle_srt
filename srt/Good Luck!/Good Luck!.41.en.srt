1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,310
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,950
Your husband always came on his own,

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,010
so we were wondering
what his wife would be like.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,750
It turns out
you're quite the beauty, ma'am.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,980
By the way, what brings you here today?

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,550
I'm going to withdraw some money.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,590
I asked earlier, and they said
all I had to bring were...

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,160
my husband's seal, my ID card,
and a family relation certificate. Here.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,100
Yes, you can make a withdrawal.
How much would you need?

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,040
Five million dollars.

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,370
Five million dollars?

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,080
Well, that's quite a large amount.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,610
How would you like it?

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,590
(Five Million Dollars)

15
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,270
(Five Million Dollars)

16
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,710
Mom!

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,540
Hey.

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,710
What brings you by at this hour?

19
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,120
I had to drop things off
for my side job...

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,480
and stopped by to check out the house.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,880
Did you have to go somewhere?

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,950
Oh, I had to go to the bank.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,090
My gosh. The house is big and nice.

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,860
What's this furniture?

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,860
Did you buy these
with the inheritance from Grandpa?

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,200
Yes.

27
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,730
Oh, my.

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,900
What?

29
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,100
What do you mean Mr. Han came back alive?

30
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,000
How could something like that happen?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,940
Apparently, it can happen.

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,570
I totally thought I'd seen a ghost.

33
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,340
Yes, I bet.

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,850
Oh, right. What's going on with Seok Jin?

35
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,950
The opening has been delayed?
Did something happen?

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,820
My goodness. His friend who had promised
to invest in Seok Jin's business...

37
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,120
suddenly changed his mind.

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,160
What? Does that mean Seok Jin
can't launch his business anymore?

39
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,490
My gosh. I'm so upset.

40
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,790
What is the matter
with that friend of his?

41
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,960
Who promises to invest money
just to take it back?

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,900
How's Gwang Sik doing?

43
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,270
Has he found a job yet?

44
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,640
Not yet.

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,870
Goodness. What is he going to do?

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,640
He keeps saying
it'll all get sorted out if I wait a bit.

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,580
Honestly, I don't know what he's up to.

48
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,910
But I've been hounding him about it,
so I'll wait for now.

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,360
Yes, I just sent the 150,000 dollars.

50
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,560
Then when will I get my commission?

51
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Really?

52
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,060
Okay, all right.

53
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,240
My commission will be
a few hundred thousand dollars.

54
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,110
I even took out a loan
using this house as collateral.

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,310
Yes, it'd better be that much.

56
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,050
Mom.

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,720
Hey, you're home.
You must be exhausted, son.

58
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,590
My goodness.

59
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,820
- Yes, I'm tired.
- Yes, I know.

60
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,460
That said,
when will you give me the money, Mom?

61
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,690
You're sure you can give me money, right?

62
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,560
Yes, of course.

63
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,230
Where did you get the money, Mom?

64
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,800
Is someone lending you some money?

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,830
My gosh. This is a secret, okay?

66
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,770
The thing is, I've been working in sales.

67
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,810
- Sales?
- Hold on.

68
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,210
This is the product I sell.

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,210
The more I sell,

70
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,810
the more I earn in commission.

71
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,650
I've already made 30,000 dollars!

72
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,720
- What? Did you say 30,000 dollars?
- Yes.

73
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,860
Just you wait. In no time,

74
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,690
I'll be bringing home
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

75
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,330
Hang on, Mom. Isn't this...

76
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,200
a pyramid scheme?

77
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,200
A pyramid scheme? What's that?

78
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,740
I mean, "Health Water."
The name is shady too.

79
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,870
What? Hey,
are you looking down on your mother?

80
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,340
Do you think
I don't even know what I'm doing?

81
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,380
No, don't get me wrong.

82
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,580
If you don't need the money, forget it.

83
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,080
I'm not the one who needs help!
You little...

84
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
My goodness.

85
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,580
- Good grief.
- What?

86
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,590
Hey, Mom.

87
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,460
I'm your son.
Why would you take it the wrong way?

88
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,290
(Jackpot Chicken)

89
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,530
Oh, boy. He scared me for a moment.

90
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,200
Why did he suddenly bring up
lottery tickets?

91
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,970
Hold on. Where did she go
that she's still not back?

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Hey, Dae Sik.

93
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,670
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

94
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,240
Is Mu Chul inside?

95
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,580
Yes.

96
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,380
Gyu Tae! Hi.

97
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,650
My, you're looking all professional.

98
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,120
How's the job? Do you like it?

99
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,690
Yes, it's fun. I'm doing my best.

100
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,450
Are you here to see me?

101
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,120
Of course. For this and that.

102
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,590
By the way,
I'm going to have to find a house again.

103
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,530
Why?
Did your wife tell you to leave again?

104
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,470
- Yes.
- All right.

105
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,740
I'll let you know
if a decent place turns up.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,170
Okay, thanks.

107
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,110
Oh, I have a question.

108
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,880
How did both of you...

109
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,880
end up in this building?

110
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,150
When I first saw this building,

111
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,850
I had a weird headache.

112
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,590
I must've remembered something...

113
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,960
because both of you were here.

114
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,260
Then,

115
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,900
do you mean you get a headache
when you're about to remember something?

116
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,900
Yes.

117
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,800
It was the same when I went to my house
for the first time too.

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,570
Hey, other than that,

119
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,310
has it ever happened
when you saw something else?

120
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
I'm not sure.

121
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
No.

122
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,430
Oh, right.

123
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,530
The Daewoon Building, my house...
Other than that, nothing.

124
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,970
Oh, okay.

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,300
I'm sure
your memory will come back someday.

126
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,710
Don't be too disappointed
that they're not back yet.

127
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,980
That's right. Your memory will come back.

128
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,410
Hey, let's stop standing around.
Have a seat.

129
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,110
- I'll bring out some food.
- Okay.

130
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,980
- Oh, really?
- Hey, let's sit.

131
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,450
I want to eat jjajangmyeon.

132
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,520
You know we don't have jjajangmyeon here.

133
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,350
(Jackpot Chicken)

134
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,890
Hello.

135
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,260
Yes, welcome.

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,860
How much does the mackerel cost?

137
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,130
It's seven dollars each.

138
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,570
But if you buy 2,
I'll give them to you for 12 dollars.

139
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,940
Did you say 12 dollars?

140
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
Yes.

141
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,670
How about this halibut?

142
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,980
This is five dollars,

143
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,040
but I'll give you 2 for 8 dollars.

144
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,350
Can't you give me a discount
for the halibut?

145
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,520
Come on. It's 2 for 8 dollars.

146
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,650
I can't go any lower than that.

147
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,220
Try going somewhere else.
You won't find it for this price.

148
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,630
So, will you buy it or not?

149
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,230
Well, I'll come back some other time.

150
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
All right.

151
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,380
You went to work, right?

152
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,050
Don't fight. Be nice to each other, okay?

153
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,850
Okay. Bye.

154
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,920
So, are you saying you'll work here again?

155
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,890
Well, Jin Tae begged me to stay,

156
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,900
so I have no other choice but to do that.

157
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,930
If you cause trouble one more time,

158
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,300
I won't let it slide,
so get your act together.

159
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,570
Do you think your threats scare me?

160
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,940
All right.
Let's just endure this for a year.

161
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,680
I have to put up
with that cheap and nasty person,

162
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,210
but I'll just do this for a year.

163
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,350
Did you choose what you want?

164
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,350
One serving of tteokbokki.

165
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,490
What? One serving of tteokbokki?

166
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,420
Hey, can't we have fried rice too?

167
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,730
No. You said
you wanted tteokbokki earlier.

168
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,060
Just have one.

169
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,600
Kids, I'm sorry,

170
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,070
but the rule here is
that each person has to order one dish.

171
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,600
Here, order one more.

172
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,170
I'm just not that hungry.

173
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,670
Just give us one serving.

174
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,010
Hey, even if you're not hungry,

175
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,650
you have to order 2 dishes
for 2 people here.

176
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,880
What's going on?

177
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,250
Oh, they each have to order a dish,

178
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,220
but these kids seem to be
too young to understand.

179
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,050
I see.

180
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,690
Where are the adults?
Why is it just the two of you?

181
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,660
My grandpa is sick,

182
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,770
so I'm watching my brother.

183
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,000
He loves tteokbokki so much,
and he said he wanted some.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,270
That's why I brought him here.

185
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,640
I see.

186
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,310
By the way, you guys are so lucky.

187
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,240
Today, we're having a special event...

188
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,410
where you get one more dish for free
if you order tteokbokki.

189
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,650
What? An event?

190
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,150
Then, can we also have fried rice
if we order tteokbokki?

191
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,390
Of course.

192
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,320
One order of tteokbokki
and one fried rice. Sounds good.

193
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,160
I'll give you some fried dumplings
on the house.

194
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,630
I'm only giving this to you guys
because you're so adorable.

195
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,730
Don't tell anyone, okay?

196
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,070
Yes, I'm so excited!
We get to have dumplings too.

197
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,270
Thank you.

198
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,610
I'll cook those up soon.
Wait just a little.

199
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
But what...

200
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,480
My gosh.

201
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,580
Hey, I get that
you feel bad for those kids,

202
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,350
but they could have money too.
Aren't you going overboard?

203
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,250
They don't have money.

204
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,860
What?

205
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,860
The older boy had
a single five-dollar bill in his hand.

206
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,000
The tteokbokki costs five dollars.

207
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,300
That's why they only ordered that.

208
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,500
But still, aren't you being too generous
with someone else's money?

209
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,740
What will you say to Jin Tae?

210
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,970
Don't worry. I'll pay for the rest.

211
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,640
What? You'll pay?

212
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,510
Hey, you buy corn dogs with coupons,

213
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,050
but you'll pay for someone else's meal?

214
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,110
As if.

215
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,790
Ta-da.

216
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,150
Enjoy your food and come again.

217
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,260
If you guys come back,
I'll always give you tteokbokki for free.

218
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,790
- Really?
- Sure.

219
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,300
What? For free?

220
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,130
Gosh, she's going to act kind
with someone else's money?

221
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,000
I've been working
on a tteokbokki recipe lately.

222
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,470
I'm going to give you guys
the tteokbokki I make for practice,

223
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,140
so don't feel bad about it.
Come anytime, okay?

224
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,350
Okay. Thank you.

225
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,980
Thank you.

226
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,480
Have a good meal.

227
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,350
Hey.

228
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,120
But that tteokbokki...

229
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,590
From now on, when those boys come,

230
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,420
don't take their money.
Just tell me, okay?

231
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,090
I'm going to pay for their tteokbokki.

232
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,730
Dae Sik, I'm off.

233
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,100
Mu Chul, take this.

234
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
What?

235
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,710
What is this?

236
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,810
Oh, I thought of you
when I was at the market earlier.

237
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,050
I bought some fish for you too.
Take it and eat it at home.

238
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,120
Gosh, you didn't have to. Thanks, Dae Sik.

239
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,090
By the way,
don't say that I bought you this.

240
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,060
Why not?

241
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,590
I'm sure your wife isn't pleased
about you working here.

242
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,260
If she hears that I bought you this,
she will feel even more burdened.

243
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,600
Just say that you bought it.

244
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,900
Oh, okay.

245
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,870
Thank you, Dae Sik.

246
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,300
No worries.

247
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,010
- You should get going.
- Okay.

248
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,240
(Jackpot Chicken)

249
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,610
Oh, boy.

250
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,120
It sounded like
you got a call asking for Seok Jin.

251
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,490
Did something happen?

252
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,190
It's nothing.

253
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,090
You must still be sulking
because of Seok Jin.

254
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,400
This is all for his sake.

255
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,330
You know,

256
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,100
people don't expect anything
when they don't know what's available.

257
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,300
But when they do know,

258
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,470
they end up relying on that
for every little thing.

259
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,340
Even if Seok Jin were to fail this time,
what does that matter?

260
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,710
We're supporting him firmly from behind.

261
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,720
Let me see.
Is the bankbook safely in place?

262
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,290
I brought it home from the bank
since I was worried after Mu Chul came.

263
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,620
The bankbook?

264
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,220
Let me see.

265
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,620
Why are you looking for that,
all of a sudden?

266
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
What?

267
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,990
I was just curious
if it was safe and sound.

268
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Wait.

269
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,940
Here is your bankbook.
We're all good, right?

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes.

271
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,140
We can keep it in there.

272
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,780
It's safe and sound.

273
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,620
Hey.

274
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,450
Are you making dinner?

275
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,590
Oh, I was just about to. Why?

276
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,890
Ta-da.

277
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,230
I bought some fish.

278
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,930
Let's grill them and eat them together.

279
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,000
Fish?

280
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,500
Yes, I'll cook dinner today.

281
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,470
Wait just a little while.

282
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,440
All right.

283
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,190
Tae Ha.

284
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,460
Were you upset with what I said yesterday?

285
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,160
I wasn't nagging.

286
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,100
You just seemed upset.

287
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,600
I was just asking you what was going on.

288
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,570
I was also curious
why you owed loan sharks money.

289
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,310
You were curious?

290
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Yes.

291
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,010
When I was young,

292
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,750
I always thought...

293
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,090
it would be nice...

294
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,460
if someone asked me what my interests were
and what was going on with me.

295
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,130
So, I must've asked you that...

296
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,260
without thinking.

297
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,800
You weren't ever interested in me before.

298
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,400
You weren't curious
about anything I did either.

299
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,840
Whenever I did something,

300
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,310
you would scold me
and be really hard on me.

301
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,050
So, what you're saying to me...

302
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,280
doesn't really sound nice, to be honest.

303
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,250
I'll be going.

304
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,970
All right. Ta-da!

305
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,870
Dad, you really cooked these yourself?

306
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,470
Yes, I tried my best,

307
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,270
but I'm not sure if you'll like them.

308
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
Try this first.

309
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,620
What? It tastes better than I expected.

310
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,690
What do you think, Tae Ha?

311
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,560
Well, it's not bad.

312
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Mom, did Dad use to cook often
in the past?

313
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,450
My gosh! You scared me.

314
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,520
You really scared me.

315
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,650
What are you doing?

316
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,850
I'm making soybean paste stew.
You said you liked it.

317
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,990
- My gosh, soybean paste stew?
- Yes.

318
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,590
All right.

319
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,270
Isn't it good?

320
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,400
Yes, it tastes...

321
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,640
delicious. It's good.

322
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,010
This is my first time
making soybean paste stew.

323
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,010
Is it really good?

324
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,050
Yes, it's very good.

325
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Well...

326
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,520
Let me take care of the rest.

327
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,920
You'll take care of the rest?

328
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,560
Yes. I used to cook very often
when I lived with my grandma.

329
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,120
I can make soybean paste stew
with my eyes closed.

330
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,330
So, go inside and get some rest,
my princess.

331
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,360
Let me handle the rest.

332
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,260
- Wait, I want to stay here and watch.
- No.

333
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,770
- No, it's okay. Go on in.
- What? Why not?

334
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,670
- No, but...
- Go on in!

335
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,110
Try it and tell me...

336
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,210
how it tastes.

337
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm sure it just tastes like
soybean paste stew.

338
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,850
Dad, can you keep cooking for us?

339
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,690
I was always jealous of my friends
whose dads cooked at home.

340
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,490
Let's be honest.
We hardly ever had time...

341
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,090
to eat with you in the past.

342
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,800
What? We didn't have time to eat together?

343
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,530
He'll only be staying with us
for a few more days, so don't say that.

344
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,500
Stop being silly. Just eat your food.

345
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,500
He'll only be here for a few more days?
What do you mean?

346
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,710
- Dad, are you going somewhere?
- What?

347
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,670
Your dad...

348
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,540
will get his own place and move out soon.

349
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,880
What? But why?
He's only been back for a few days.

350
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,910
I told you.

351
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,120
Your dad and I are divorced.

352
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,550
Why should we live together
when we're no longer married?

353
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,220
So, that's that. Eat your food.

354
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,010
I'm sorry about earlier.

355
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,910
You must've been surprised
to see me out of the blue.

356
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,980
You must've been more surprised, Mom.

357
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,580
I'm sorry you had to see that.

358
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,320
No, don't say that.
You've done nothing to apologize for.

359
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,120
Anyway, why did you say that?

360
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,060
That Farm to Market
would open within a week.

361
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,490
I'm still struggling to find an investor.

362
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,700
Now, I'm in even more of a pickle
because of what you said.

363
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Don't worry.

364
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,070
Farm to Market can open within a week.

365
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,900
What? But how?

366
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,210
Sit there.

367
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,850
What is this?

368
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,820
(Five Million Dollars)

369
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,520
- Five million dollars?
- Hush.

370
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,620
Where did you get this?

371
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,990
Seok Jin,
you can't tell anyone about this.

372
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,830
You have to keep this to yourself, okay?

373
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,830
What is going on?

374
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,270
The truth is,
your dad and I won the lottery.

375
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,200
What? The lottery?

376
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,640
My goodness.
I told you to lower your voice.

377
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,010
We'll get in trouble if someone hears us.

378
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,380
So, is this part of your lottery winnings?

379
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,520
The thing is, we bought this house
with our lottery winnings too.

380
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,490
Not with an inheritance from your grandpa.

381
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,390
What? How much money did you win...

382
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,260
to spend this kind of money?

383
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
Well, you don't need to know.

384
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,060
There's still a lot left,

385
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,200
so don't worry. Just spend it.

386
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,170
Also, Mi Jin and Ah Jin... No.

387
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,000
Do not tell anyone about this.

388
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,440
This has to stay
between you and me. Got it?

389
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
- Yes.
- Good.

390
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,910
Seok Jin.

391
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,750
I know you've been under a lot of stress.

392
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,920
From now on, you can do whatever you want.

393
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,760
I'll give you all the support you need.
All right?

394
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,830
What? Are you serious?

395
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,300
Yes, the company has been saved.

396
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,570
I've secured
an investment of five million dollars.

397
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,510
Thank goodness.

398
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,040
By the way, who's the investor?

399
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,050
I'll tell you more later.

400
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,750
Let's meet tomorrow.

401
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,450
Okay, sounds good. Well done.

402
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,490
Nice! What a relief.

403
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
Yes, Mom.

404
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,230
Something good must've happened.

405
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Hey, about the investment.

406
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,500
Should I try to talk
to your dad about it again?

407
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,370
No, I no longer need Dad's help.

408
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,870
Why not?

409
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,080
Just yesterday, you nearly broke down
saying the company needed help.

410
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,380
I told you there was this incredibly smart
and passionate businessman.

411
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,450
Seok Jin got it all sorted out.

412
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,650
Really?

413
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,920
Oh, my.

414
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,600
You weren't ever interested in me before.

415
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,430
You weren't curious
about anything I did either.

416
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,700
Whenever I did something,

417
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,040
you would scold me
and be really hard on me.

418
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,770
Let's be honest.
We hardly ever had time...

419
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,410
to eat with you in the past.

420
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,680
What kind of father was I...

421
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,750
for both of my children
to say stuff like that?

422
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,390
No!

423
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,590
- My gosh! What are you doing?
- Nothing!

424
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,460
- I was just...
- No, get out.

425
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,030
- Oh, no.
- Move!

426
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,130
- I'm sorry.
- Move aside!

427
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,570
My gosh.

428
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,510
Yes, don't worry.

429
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,580
Farm to Market will open very soon.

430
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,550
- Of course, yes.
- We found a new investor.

431
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,950
Yes, we'll proceed
with the contract as planned.

432
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,090
Yes, thank you.

433
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,520
- Thank you.
- Yes.

434
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,290
I guess something good has happened.

435
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,730
The opening of our online shopping mall
was delayed,

436
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,800
but it looks like we can open soon.

437
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,170
Really? That's such great news.

438
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,600
Congratulations, Seok Jin.

439
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
Thank you.

440
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,170
Does Seo Woo know about this too?

441
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,170
Seok Jin!

442
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,320
Seo Woo, you want coffee too, right?

443
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,950
Yes, I'd like some too.

444
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,950
Okay.

445
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,420
I'm sorry. Seok Jin said he was here,

446
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,390
so I stopped by to see him briefly.

447
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,060
No worries. I understand.

448
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,730
Oh, did you hear?

449
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,970
We can open our online shopping mall now.

450
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,470
Really?

451
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,900
That's such great news!

452
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,870
I haven't been able to sleep
because I was so worried.

453
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,040
You couldn't sleep?

454
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,350
No, I was so worried.

455
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,180
Seriously, congratulations, Seok Jin.

456
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,880
I guess you worry about Seok Jin a lot.

457
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,520
You couldn't even sleep?

458
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,990
Yes.

459
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,020
Now? Sure.

460
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,530
Ye Won, we should go now.

461
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,230
Seo Woo, I'll call you when I'm back.

462
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,800
- Okay.
- Hey, your bag.

463
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,840
Gosh, I'm trying to patch things up.

464
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,640
How come nothing's going my way?

465
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,480
Something's fishy.

466
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,850
I swear, I saw Mu Chul
with my own two eyes.

467
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,850
Why did she say he died?

468
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,750
Oh, that man...

469
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,160
Darling!

470
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,460
Sorry? Me?

471
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,770
Darling, it's been a while.

472
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,330
Have you been keeping well?

473
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,210
I'm sorry.

474
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,310
I think you're confusing me
with someone else.

475
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,380
Darling.

476
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,150
I get that you're not exactly excited
to see me again,

477
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,420
but I really missed you.

478
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,950
Didn't you miss me?

479
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,360
Oh, you mistook me for someone else!

480
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,690
My gosh.

481
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,660
Is he acting like he doesn't know me?

482
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,370
No.

483
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,500
It seemed like
he really didn't recognize me.

484
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,910
Has he already forgotten me?

485
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,080
Goodness, her perfume was so strong.

486
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,510
I'm much older than her,
but she was calling me "darling."

487
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,150
Gosh, what a weird woman.

488
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,390
Oh, right. I was supposed to go
to the supermarket and buy ground pepper.

489
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,130
The supermarket.

490
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,500
The supermarket. "Lottery."

491
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,700
(Our customers
have won 1st place 14 times!)

492
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,870
The lottery?

493
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,280
(Lottery Store)

494
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,680
Oh, hello.

495
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,020
I want to buy a lottery ticket.

496
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,750
Okay. You can get a random set of numbers,

497
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,260
or you can fill in
the numbers you want to choose.

498
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,760
You can pick one or the other.

499
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,860
Oh, okay. I'll think about it.

500
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
Sure.

501
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,270
The numbers I want to choose?

502
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,870
(Lottery Ticket)

503
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,870
Which numbers should I choose?

504
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,580
Oh, my head.

505
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,320
Hey, you're here.

506
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,360
Why does he look so out of it?

507
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,370
(Jackpot Chicken)

508
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,230
I thought he'd forget, but he bought it.

509
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,010
What's this?

510
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,210
A lottery ticket?

511
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,110
Zero, two, zero, three, eleven...

512
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,310
Nineteen, twenty.

513
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,720
But how...

514
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,250
(Lottery Ticket)

515
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,820
- Dae Sik.
- Oh, gosh!

517

518
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,570
(Good Luck!)

519
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,170
- How old is Seo Woo?
- Bye.

520
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,610
She's in college.

521
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,810
What? She's just a little girl.

522
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,750
- Why do you care whether I sell coffee...
- Why, you!

523
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,420
- or let someone grab my wrist?
- My gosh.

524
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,820
It popped into my head
after I had a sudden headache.
