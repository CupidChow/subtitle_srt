1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,310
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,110
Let go of me!

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,880
In the world we live in,

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,380
there are such things
that matter more than money.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,050
What is this mere thing called money?

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,390
People came before money,

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,130
not the other way around!

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,770
(Episode 30)

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,070
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,840
I suddenly felt a surge of rage.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,880
All right. Then, think about...

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,650
why you were so enraged.

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,620
When I was seven years old,

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,160
my parents passed away in an accident.

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,230
So, I grew up living
with relative after relative.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,070
Back then, people said...

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,970
that I was an orphan...

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,770
who had nothing...

19
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,410
and mistreated me.

20
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,570
So,

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,180
if anyone looks down on me the least bit,

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,280
I get really mad.

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,120
That was...

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,050
when I promised myself...

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,490
that I'd never become someone like that.

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,690
And...

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,960
that I'd become rich for sure.

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,970
So,

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,400
do you think you've lived such a life?

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,610
I mean, the life in your lost memories.

31
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,510
I'm not sure.

32
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,980
I don't think I would've looked down on
or mistreated people who don't have money.

33
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,220
Judging by my clothes,

34
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,750
I might not have had...

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,590
much food or clothes.

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,230
I probably lived a tough life.

37
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,700
What if your life was the opposite?

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,200
- What?
- I mean,

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,170
what if you're a rich man,

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,870
but rather than help those in need,

41
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,340
you looked down on them
and mistreated them?

42
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,340
There's no way that's true!

43
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,540
I suffered so much
because of people like that.

44
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,580
No, never.

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,480
There's no way.

46
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,190
(Fresh Carrots)

47
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,760
Gosh, I can tell...

48
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,860
we won't have any issues with freshness.

49
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,600
Still, just in case, let's make sure
we don't have issues on our opening day.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,930
Delivery Team,
check the trucks and warehouse thoroughly.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,770
PR Team, look over the event promotion
and social media advertising.

52
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,770
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

53
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Yes, Mr. Kim.

54
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,450
Goodness, kid.

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,050
You said you'd come by
after Tae Hyung's wedding.

56
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,750
I apologize. I'm so busy
with our opening day coming up.

57
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,090
I was going to visit you soon.

58
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,120
Right. Are the preparations going well
for your opening day?

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,630
Thanks to you, sir.

60
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,600
I was going to tell you this in person,

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,870
but I told a client
that I'd pay them in advance in a week.

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,340
Would you be able to give me
the rest of your investment by then?

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Hello.

64
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,890
Hey, how did you come here?

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,800
Are you here with Jung Ah?

66
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,770
How do you know Jung Ah?

67
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,600
Why are you so surprised?

68
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,040
Oh, that's right.

69
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,640
You were married to Jung Ah, weren't you?

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,110
Did Seok Jin tell you that?

71
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,220
The fact that I got married and the day
I got back from my honeymoon too?

72
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,920
Well, sure.
No one else knows about us besides him.

73
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,090
It's him, right?

74
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,360
Think whatever you like.

75
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,620
I'm off.

76
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,230
Where do you think you're going?
I asked you if it was Seok Jin.

77
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,230
That hurts.

78
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,700
Tae Hyung.

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,800
Oh, Seo Woo.

80
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,800
Tae Hyung, do you know Seo Woo?

81
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,710
- Yes, we went to the same college.
- I see.

82
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,080
How do you know Seo Woo?

83
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,010
We went to elementary school together.

84
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,850
But why were you grabbing her arm?

85
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,550
Oh, that?

86
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,650
No way.

87
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Hey, Han Seo Woo.

88
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,260
Are you seducing my husband now too?

89
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,020
What?

90
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,860
That's your specialty.

91
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,730
Seducing someone else's man
and stealing him away.

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,160
Why? Did you want to steal him
when you saw him at the wedding?

93
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,430
Did you want to make him yours?

94
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,100
Still, you shouldn't go after
a married man, you brat.

95
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,010
Fine. I seduced him.

96
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,910
What? Hey.

97
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,480
Not me.

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,110
Your husband did.

99
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,180
Hey, Han Seo Woo!

100
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,650
He was engaged to you,

101
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,450
but he was trying to seduce me so badly
to date him.

102
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,120
Hey, he was such a nuisance.

103
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,720
Why, you... Are you going to keep lying?

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,220
Your husband's birthday...

105
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,960
is April 25, right?

106
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,000
How do you know that?

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,460
How else would I know?

108
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,230
He was practically begging me...

109
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,800
to go on a trip with him
and stay the night on his birthday.

110
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,770
I'd be a fool not to know,
don't you think?

111
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,970
What?

112
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,340
Tae Hyung. You said you were going
to visit a relative that day.

113
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,080
You said that was why you couldn't see me!

114
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,880
Well, the thing is...

115
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
I mean...

116
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,850
I almost went to Gangwon Province
with your husband for a good time.

117
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,860
Oh, my.

118
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,160
Come to think of it,
I almost became an adulteress.

119
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,290
You little...

120
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,500
Hey, who do you think you are?

121
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,460
Why do you keep stealing my man?

122
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,700
Hey, how would I know that?

123
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,730
- You must not have much charm!
- Hey!

124
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,670
- He's mine!
- Hey, Seo Woo! Stop!

125
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,740
Darn it.

126
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,370
Hey, seriously?

127
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,210
Jujubes, chestnuts, pufferfish.

128
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,050
Oh, right. A pig's head.

129
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,620
Even if it costs a lot,
we'll have to choose one that's smiling.

130
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,180
Let's see here.

131
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,920
- Hye Sook.
- Hey, Geum Ok. Where were you?

132
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,360
Oh, I went to the mill nearby.

133
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,230
By the way, the lady at the mill told me.

134
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,500
You know the new apartments
in the neighborhood nearby?

135
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,860
They started selling the ones
that didn't sell during the presale.

136
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,870
Is that so?

137
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,170
It may just be a pipe dream for us,

138
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,540
but they're being sold for a great price,

139
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,370
so all the ladies in town
are talking about it.

140
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,310
Finally, the unsold apartment units
are up for sale?

141
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,080
I should tell Dae Sik
and buy it right away.

142
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,080
I know, right? Why is everyone
so interested in that apartment complex?

143
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,420
Anyway, what were you doing?

144
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,890
Oh, Seok Jin's shopping mall
is opening soon.

145
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,060
So, I'm thinking of holding a small rite
for him at the office.

146
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,100
I'm making preparations.

147
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,860
Is that so?

148
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,330
- Seriously, you little...
- Let me go!

149
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,540
That's enough, Tae Hyung.

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,110
(Jackpot Chicken)

151
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,810
Should I mention that?

152
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,840
No, it won't do any good to bring it up.

153
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,850
It has nothing to do with his business.

154
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
Hey.

155
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,890
A patient shouldn't eat ramyeon.
Eat a proper meal.

156
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,590
I'm not a patient anymore.

157
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,260
And you have to pay rent
for your office tomorrow.

158
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,190
Around this time of the month,

159
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,900
you were the one
who always nagged me to save money.

160
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,360
Oh, right. Rent.

161
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,000
Tomorrow is rent day
for the Daewoon Building.

162
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,270
What? You forgot about that?

163
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,540
Hey, don't eat ramyeon again after this.

164
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,340
- Okay? Got it?
- Okay.

165
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,180
- Just this meal.
- Okay.

166
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,050
Hey, Dad!

167
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:11,030
<i>- Neener</i>
<i>- Neener</i>

168
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,130
Hey, don't you have any other clothes?

169
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,730
Why do you always wear the same thing?

170
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,040
He doesn't have a mom.

171
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,610
That's why he doesn't have any clothes.

172
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,810
Hey, don't say that. He has a grandma.

173
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,510
So? Why does that matter?

174
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,810
She's all hunched over...

175
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,880
and walks with wobbly legs like this.

176
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,020
That's why no one came to see him...

177
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,050
on our kindergarten presentation day.

178
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,990
<i>- Han Mu Chul is a fool</i>
<i>- Han Mu Chul is a fool</i>

179
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,760
<i>- He's a fool, neener</i>

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,160
<i>- Neener</i>
<i>- Neener</i>

181
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,200
Who wants to play games with me?

182
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,470
- Me!
- Me!

183
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,040
Grab my hand if you want to play.

184
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,080
Is this how you do it?

185
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,180
- My gosh.
- Go forward.

186
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,710
- Gosh, that's cool.
- No, like this.

187
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,550
- Go.
- Yes!

188
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,650
- Let me try.
- Kids.

189
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,720
What are you doing here?

190
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,150
We're playing.

191
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,320
Who are you, mister?

192
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,490
Me?

193
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,830
(Kang Min Soo)

194
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,400
Well, I'm Min Soo's uncle.

195
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,870
Min Soo.

196
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I was looking for you.

197
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,070
You should've said you were playing here.

198
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,070
What?

199
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,640
Why are you so old if you're an uncle?

200
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,310
My uncle is much younger than you,
Grandpa.

201
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,020
Well, I'm his eldest uncle.

202
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,720
Not the youngest uncle.

203
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
You kids.

204
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,490
Shall I make some toys for you?

205
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
Bang!

206
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,170
Swish! Go!

207
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,670
What do you think? Do you like them?

208
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,870
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my!

209
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,640
- What is this?
- What is this?

210
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,070
- Oh, my.
- Can I have this?

211
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,640
- I want this.
- Give me this.

212
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,540
Okay, but instead,

213
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,010
you must promise me something.

214
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,280
- What?
- What is it?

215
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,610
Do not...

216
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,020
make fun of Min Soo.

217
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,050
Be his good friends.

218
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,050
Can you promise that?

219
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,690
- Yes, we promise!
- Yes, we promise!

220
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,490
Good. All right. Here.

221
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,990
Min Soo, these are all yours.

222
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,330
I'll make new ones for you kids,

223
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,570
so be good and play with Min Soo.

224
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,900
- Okay!
- Very well.

225
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,240
- Oh, my.
- Can I see?

226
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,470
- Can I see this?
- Go ahead.

227
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,140
Your uncle rocks.

228
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,140
- Your uncle is so cool.
- He's awesome.

229
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,140
Bang!

230
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,180
- Oh, my.
- Bang.

231
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,610
- My gosh.
- This is really cool.

232
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,720
Let me... Can I try this?

233
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,640
Mom, are you feeling all right?

234
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,980
My gosh.

235
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,650
Don't mind me.

236
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,450
Mom, what's going to happen to us now?

237
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,450
Do we have a place to live
if we have to move out?

238
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,320
Say something.

239
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,130
Are we just going to
get kicked out of our house?

240
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,230
Don't worry.
They won't make us move out right away.

241
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,200
Even if it won't be right away,

242
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,830
we will have to move out eventually.

243
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,080
What is this?

244
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,140
So, we don't even know
when we'd have to move out?

245
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,210
Is it right
to just keep staying here like this?

246
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,850
Tae Ha, do you not have a plan?

247
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,650
A plan?

248
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,290
You're the head of this household
now that Dad is gone.

249
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,190
You need to come up with a plan!

250
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,360
What? What are you saying?

251
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,830
We have Mom.
Why am I the head of this household?

252
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,060
You're overstepping your bounds
by calling me the head of the household.

253
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,100
Do you realize that?

254
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,130
I am overstepping my bounds?

255
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,340
Seriously? Unbelievable.

256
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,010
I can't believe she called me
the head of the household.

257
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,110
I'm struggling
to even take care of myself.

258
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,710
My gosh. Where's my life going?

259
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,860
Let's meet.

260
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,170
Tae Ha, you're here. Eat something good.

261
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,730
- Will do. See you.
- See you.

262
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,340
Why did you call me here?

263
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,740
Pay me back my 30,000 dollars
in installments.

264
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,740
What? In installments?

265
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,450
I wanted a lump-sum payment,

266
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,150
but it doesn't look like that's possible.

267
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,320
Pay me 2,500 dollars every month.

268
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,050
Then you can pay me back in full
in a year. Are we good now?

269
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,450
Two thousand and five hundred dollars?

270
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,090
Hey, are you crazy?

271
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,490
I wouldn't have loan sharks going after me
if I had that kind of money.

272
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,390
I don't even have a few hundred dollars.
Two thousand and five hundred?

273
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,000
Besides, you lost my watch too.

274
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,230
I will give it back once I find it.

275
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
If I fail to find it,

276
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,700
I will return 20,000
from the money you paid back.

277
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,110
I see. So, it's your way or the highway.
Is that it?

278
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,680
Forget it. I have no money, so sue me!

279
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,880
Get a job and work if you have no money.

280
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,210
You're perfectly healthy.
What are you doing now?

281
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,410
Get a job? What the...

282
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,950
Hey, do you think
I'd go and get just about any job?

283
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,990
On my way here, I saw that
the hot dog place was hiring a part-timer.

284
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,190
How about you work there?

285
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,090
What? A part-time job at a hot dog place?

286
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,630
Have you lost your mind,
telling me to work at a place like that?

287
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,360
Have you forgotten
how much debt you have now?

288
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,870
You can't afford to be choosy right now.

289
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,870
Anyway, I've made it very clear to you.

290
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,640
Starting next month, I will expect...

291
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,070
to receive 2,500 dollars
from you every month. Okay?

292
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Hey!

293
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
What the...

294
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,480
Try this.
Our profit margin is practically zero.

295
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
(Energy booster
with anti-cancer benefits!)

296
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

297
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,350
It has a unique taste.

298
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,090
Hello, ma'am. Try this.

299
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,930
Oh, it's good. What is this?

300
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,130
Health Water. It's a healthy beverage.

301
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,170
It energizes you and prevents cancer.

302
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,170
It's a patented beverage.

303
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,010
- Oh, it prevents cancer?
- Yes.

304
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,710
My gosh. That is amazing.

305
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,080
Yes, it really is.

306
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,280
It's already available
at the military bases...

307
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,310
and some department stores.

308
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,150
We recently started
exporting the product to China as well.

309
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,620
Here's a pamphlet about our company.

310
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,680
Read it when you have a moment.

311
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,080
Thank you.

312
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,250
Ma'am, do you live alone?

313
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,260
Me?

314
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,390
No, I don't live alone.

315
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,360
I live with my son,
daughter-in-law, and grandkid.

316
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,330
I told them to get their own place,

317
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,200
but they insisted on living with me.

318
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
They're such a nuisance.

319
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,970
A nuisance? No way.

320
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,470
Young people these days
don't want to live with their parents.

321
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,110
You're very lucky.

322
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,180
It's either that, or you're very rich.

323
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,510
What? I'm not rich.

324
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,480
I'm not rich,

325
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,380
but thanks to this young man,

326
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,820
I was able to help my son, big-time.

327
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,460
- What?
- Because I listened to this young man...

328
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,690
and bought Health Water,

329
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,830
I was able to buy a house for my son.

330
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,600
- You bought him a house?
- Yes.

331
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,570
But how?

332
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,770
(Energy booster
with anti-cancer benefits!)

333
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,170
Oh, you're home.

334
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,840
What's that?
It looks heavy. Let me help you.

335
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,380
What was that?
Did she flat out ignore me just now?

336
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,380
Why does she care what I bring home?

337
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,490
You team up with your mother...

338
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,160
and bad-mouth my son.

339
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,790
I can't stand you any longer.

340
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,060
This won't do.

341
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,800
I can't sit idly by
as they belittle my son.

342
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,530
(Energy booster
with anti-cancer benefits!)

343
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,530
I will sell these...

344
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,770
and help him start his own business.

345
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,040
The more I sell,

346
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,640
the more money I'll make.

347
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,110
Who should I sell these to?

348
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,420
This will make my wife happy, right?

349
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,460
Yes, I'll give this to her and tell her.

350
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,870
He gave me the go-ahead
to buy new furniture,

351
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,600
which tells me he's now leaning toward
buying a new apartment.

352
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,470
When he's back,

353
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,770
I should tell him about the unsold units
being available for purchase.

354
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,910
I'm so excited.

355
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,110
My gosh.

356
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,310
- Oh, hello.
- This is for you.

357
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,780
- Yes, thank you.
- Sure, have a good day.

358
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
What is this?

359
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,060
"Payment Deadline Notice?"

360
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,360
"Haengbok-ro 7, Sujeong-gu, Seoul,
Kim Dae Sik?"

361
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,530
"Your payment deadline
has been decided as above."

362
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,330
"Please pay the selling price
by the deadline."

363
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,170
What is this?

364
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,370
Selling price?

365
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,340
Does this mean my husband...

366
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,710
won the house in the auction?

367
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,020
My gosh, honey. You were here?

368
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,120
You said you'd be at the restaurant.

369
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,730
Ta-da!

370
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,030
Aren't these so pretty?

371
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,900
I bought these on my way home
as they reminded me of you.

372
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,170
Honey.

373
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,440
Let's go out for dinner this evening.

374
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,710
This. How about this? A steak dinner.

375
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,480
Let's close the restaurant early
and go to a steak house.

376
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,750
What do you say?

377
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,250
What's wrong? Do you not like the flowers?

378
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,190
What is this?

379
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,830
What... Why do you have this?

380
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,970
Honey.

381
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,670
Did you win this house
in the auction and not tell me?

382
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,510
Is that it?

383
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,240
The thing is...

384
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,410
Yes.

385
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,850
How could you do this
without even consulting me first?

386
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,720
You know full well that
I want to move to an apartment.

387
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,290
So, how could you go ahead and do this?

388
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,230
Not everyone who participates
in an auction wins the property.

389
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,030
I was afraid
you'd get mad at me if I told you,

390
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,230
so I didn't tell you.

391
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,700
And what if you win?

392
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,100
What were you going to do in that case?

393
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,370
And you won the house!

394
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,410
Honey, let's just stay here.

395
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,850
You're very attached to this house too.

396
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,850
Instead of moving from place to place,

397
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,450
we should just stay here. Okay?

398
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,890
Honey.

399
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,250
How could you say that to me?

400
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,720
What about
everything I've been telling you?

401
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,220
Were you not listening at all?

402
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,230
I told you...

403
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,730
that I was so sick of this house
and the Daewoon Building.

404
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,530
Right. You said that, but...

405
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,630
I suppose you don't want
to live with me anymore.

406
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,400
Fine, then.

407
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,640
You can live here.

408
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,610
I'm leaving.

409
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,710
Let's...

410
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,050
split up...

411
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,020
and live our own lives now.

412
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,820
What? Honey.

413
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,790
My gosh.

414
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,630
All right. Here's your coffee.

415
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Oh, my.

416
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,940
Give me another glass of iced Americano.

417
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,170
That one's for you.

418
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,340
Gosh, sir. I can't drink coffee.

419
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,780
I can't sleep if I have caffeine.

420
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,250
Oh, my.

421
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,420
Then, if you can't sleep,

422
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,020
you can have fun with me.

423
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,560
I can stay here for a while.

424
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,890
All day long.

425
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,890
What? I have to close down for the day.

426
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,860
How can you stay here all day?

427
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,700
Oh, that's right.

428
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,470
Then,

429
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,670
shall we go to my house?

430
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,470
What did you say? Your house?

431
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,610
Hey, Hwang Geum Ok!

432
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,010
Oh, hey.

433
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,780
What...

434
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,410
Then, Ms. Hwang,

435
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,980
see you again.

436
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,550
My gosh.

437
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,820
- Excuse me.
- Goodbye.

438
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,560
My goodness.

439
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,630
What the...
How dare he wink at you like that?

440
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,500
Hey, Gyu Tae. What should I get you?

441
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Hey!

442
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,010
You say whatever you want to me,

443
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,280
but you couldn't even say a word
to that fool.

444
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,850
You let him grab you by the wrist.

445
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,280
Do you let any old guy
hold your hand here?

446
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,080
Why? What did I do?

447
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,150
I saw everything!

448
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,150
If you'd treated him
half as harshly as you treat me,

449
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,390
he would've run off
with a burn on his hand!

450
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,760
Goodness.
You're just all smiles, aren't you?

451
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,330
Are you doing this knowingly, perhaps?

452
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,200
What?

453
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,070
Hey.

454
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,300
What is this?

455
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,570
My bank account information.

456
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,240
Send your rent for the Daewoon Building
to this account starting tomorrow.

457
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,010
What? But why would I send you the rent?

458
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,950
Before Mu Chul died,

459
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,920
he sold this building to someone.

460
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,950
And that person entrusted me
with everything.

461
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,420
And I'm to collect rent
and send it to them too.

462
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,220
Is that right? Who is that person?

463
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,360
You wouldn't know.

464
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,690
It's someone Mu Chul knows.

465
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,030
I see.

466
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,630
Why? Can't you believe me?

467
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,730
Should I bring the power of attorney
and show it to you?

468
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,340
Gosh, who said I couldn't believe you?

469
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,540
I just feel bad for Mu Chul. That's all.

470
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,180
By the way, what's with that necklace?

471
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,610
I haven't seen it before.

472
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,150
Why? I bought it.

473
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Does it look nice?

474
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,820
How tacky.

475
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,090
Gosh, it's so tacky.
What is that? A dog collar?

476
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,720
Are you sure you paid money for that?

477
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,230
Hey, have you ever seen
such an expensive dog collar before?

478
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,660
This is pure gold, you know!

479
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,330
Pure gold? My gosh.

480
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,800
Oh, wait.

481
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,870
Now that I think of it,
you bought Jin Tae a car too, didn't you?

482
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,070
I guess you're making
quite a lot of money these days.

483
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,510
Yes, didn't Jin Tae tell you?

484
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,910
I bought it with the commission
from selling a building.

485
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,810
I mean, I've heard about that,

486
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,820
but things are so suspicious,
no matter how I look at it.

487
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,390
What do you mean?

488
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,650
Gyu Tae.

489
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,690
By any chance...

490
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,230
By any chance, what?

491
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,760
Are you terminally ill or something?

492
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,030
What, terminally ill?

493
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,100
Well, in dramas,

494
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,910
people who are terminally ill
spend all their money...

495
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,270
and are so generous to those around them.

496
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,980
Aren't you doing the same thing?

497
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,250
Fine. Think whatever you like.

498
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,680
Gyu Tae, if you die,

499
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,850
I'll throw a nice funeral for you.

500
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,220
You can die in peace, okay?

501
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,690
Gosh, you're practically praying
for me to die!

502
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
I'm leaving.

503
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,690
Gyu Tae! Gosh, hey.

504
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,600
I'm sorry.

505
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,300
I was playing with the kids...

506
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,970
and couldn't collect lots of boxes.

507
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,340
You couldn't collect boxes
because you fought with that driver.

508
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,280
And you couldn't collect boxes
because you were playing with kids.

509
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,350
When will you actually work
and pull your own weight?

510
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,450
Go over to the neighborhood next to ours.

511
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,860
They have lots of boxes over there.

512
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,590
- The neighborhood next to ours?
- That's right.

513
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,960
You just have to cross a road
called Haengbok-ro.

514
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,900
As you take a look around,

515
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
you'll find plenty of good stuff.

516
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,640
I see. Haengbok-ro?

517
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,250
That's strange.

518
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,020
This neighborhood seems familiar.

519
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,460
It's as if I've been here before.

520
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
I wonder why.

521
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,070
(Daewoon Building)

522
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,070
All right.

523
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,210
I've told all the tenants.

524
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,610
Starting tomorrow, I'll be receiving rent.

525
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,620
(Daewoon)

526
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,190
That's right. Choi Gyu Tae.

527
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,490
As the landlord of the Daewoon Building,

528
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,700
let's live the second chapter
of your life!

529
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,000
Who says only Mu Chul gets to do that?

530
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,110
Han Mu Chul! Are you watching?

531
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,740
If you're upset, come and have a go at me!

532
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,450
(Cornerstone, Daewoon Building)

533
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,380
My gosh.

534
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,950
This building is awesome.

535
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,490
Oh, my.

536
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,460
"Daewoon Building?"

537
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,630
(Cornerstone, Daewoon Building)

538
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Oh, right.

539
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,140
I almost forgot about my meeting
with the investment expert.

540
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,780
Then, I should go that way.

541
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,610
Let's go.

542
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,480
That's weird.

543
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,420
Ever since I got here...

544
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,490
Why does my head hurt so much?

545
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,150
Excuse me.

546
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,180
Excuse me. Can we talk?

547
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,330
(Good Luck!)

548
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,870
You and Mi Ja are
in opposite situations now.

549
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,610
Now, Mi Ja is about to get kicked out
of that house.

550
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,570
Can you talk to my wife...

551
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,380
so she can change her mind?

552
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,140
You've become a homeowner now.

553
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,150
Congratulations!

554
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,450
This house means something to my family.

555
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,980
I'm going to find a job.

556
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,920
