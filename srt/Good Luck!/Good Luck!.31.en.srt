(Daewoon)

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,480
That's right. Choi Gyu Tae.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,790
As the landlord of the Daewoon Building,

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,920
let's live the second chapter
of your life!

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,190
Who says only Mu Chul gets to do that?

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,300
Han Mu Chul! Are you watching?

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,930
If you're upset, come and have a go at me!

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,710
(Cornerstone, Daewoon Building)

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,510
My gosh.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,150
This building is awesome.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
Oh, my.

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,750
(Episode 31)

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,720
Daewoon Building?

15
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,760
(Cornerstone, Daewoon Building)

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,260
Oh, right.

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,400
I almost forgot about my meeting
with the investment expert.

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,000
Then, I should go that way.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,810
Let's go.

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,780
That's weird.

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,640
Ever since I got here...

22
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,880
Why does my head hurt so much?

23
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,100
Excuse me.

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,610
Excuse me. Can we talk?

25
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,540
Me?

26
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,010
Gyu Tae.

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,210
Yes.

28
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,650
Then, should I send my water bill payments
to you from now on?

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,590
I used to send my payments directly
to Mr. Han.

30
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,020
Yes, send it to me.

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,230
Things that have anything to do
with the building should be sent to me.

32
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,360
- Does he...
- Oh, really?

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
- own this building?
- Yes.

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,470
Then what about the new landlord?

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,340
But he looks familiar for some reason.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,340
- Well, that's...
- Who is he?

37
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,740
They're great, so...

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
I'm jealous.

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,910
By the time I'm his age,

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
I want to own a building like this too.

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Yes.

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,150
Han Mu Chul.

43
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,580
- They're nice.
- You can do it too.

44
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,350
Never lose hope.

45
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,520
I can do it. Let's go!

46
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,760
Now, let's go and collect some cardboard!

47
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,500
Hey, you're home early today.

48
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,740
What's wrong? Are you sick?

49
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,770
I think I threw my back out
while trying to lift a sack of rice.

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,680
I can't move. Oh, boy.

51
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,810
Hey, don't get up. Just lie down.

52
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,350
I have to go back to the restaurant.
I couldn't finish what I was doing.

53
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,020
It's for tomorrow,

54
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,490
but I want to go back
and get it done today.

55
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,660
How will you go back to work
in that state?

56
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,020
Can't you ask Ah Jin to take care of it?

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,590
Come on. Even when Min Yong
was in the hospital for his surgery,

58
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,930
I had her take care of everything,
so I can't do that.

59
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,060
Then either hire someone else,

60
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,870
or just close your business.

61
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,500
What? Close my business?

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,270
Then how will I support myself?

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,640
Well, you can take your time
and think about that.

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,270
Anyway, don't go to work
for the time being.

65
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,140
Come on, Gyu Tae.

66
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,710
How could I not work
when I have to make ends meet?

67
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,350
I need to earn
and save every dollar I can get.

68
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,380
I wasn't going to tell you this.

69
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,720
You have to keep this to yourself, okay?

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,250
What? What is it?

71
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,220
I took out my savings...

72
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,290
and invested the money in something.

73
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,060
And it hit the jackpot,

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
which means...

75
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,930
I have some money now.

76
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,870
Are you serious? What did you invest in?

77
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,500
Well, that's none of your business.

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,340
Anyway, just listen to me,
and don't go to work for the time being.

79
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,280
You fool, and also...

80
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,050
You've been working every single day
and don't even have time to take a shower.

81
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,750
It makes no sense
that you haven't fallen ill yet.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,820
Hey, and you should get married soon too.

83
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,620
Who'd want to marry a man
running a restaurant on the outskirts?

84
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,930
I will find a nice lady for you...

85
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,490
so you can get married.

86
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,830
Listen to me,
and just stay home for a while. Okay?

87
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,330
What?

88
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,670
But... Wait, Gyu Tae.

89
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,870
What?
You bought this house in an auction?

90
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,670
But where did you get the money?

91
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,870
Weren't we about to move
because we didn't have money?

92
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,510
Well, the thing is...

93
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,780
It turns out that your late grandpa
had left me some inheritance.

94
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,950
I was only able to receive it now.

95
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,850
Then, do we really not have to move?

96
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,850
What?

97
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,890
That's right.

98
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,260
No way.

99
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,100
We don't have to move! Yes!

100
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,870
I'm glad to hear that.
I was really worried.

101
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,070
But why do you look upset, Mom?

102
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,470
Aren't you happy
that we don't have to move?

103
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,710
Why would I be happy?

104
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,980
I wanted to move to an apartment
with that money.

105
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,450
Your dad didn't even consult with me...

106
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,050
before he bought this house.

107
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Why would I be happy?

108
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,780
Why?

109
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,820
Is this true?

110
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,150
Did you really...

111
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,790
buy this house
without talking to Mom first?

112
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,430
Gosh, Dad. You shouldn't have done that.

113
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,160
I get why Mom is upset.

114
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,030
If you're so happy,
you guys can live here too.

115
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,270
I'm going to get my own place
and move out.

116
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,510
My goodness.

117
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,200
Gosh, Dad! Is this really our house?

118
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,170
Of course. From now on, the four of us...

119
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,340
will live here.

120
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,280
Oh, my. Our house is so nice!

121
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,150
Tae Ha, let's go and check out our rooms.

122
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,190
Okay, let's go.

123
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,490
Honey.

124
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,690
Thank you for buying such a great house.

125
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,790
Sure thing.

126
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,700
I'm so happy.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,130
So happy!

128
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,400
- I'm so happy.
- Good.

129
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
I'm happy too.

130
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,140
Thanks for your hard work.

131
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,380
Honey, let's talk.

132
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,220
Honey.

133
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,020
Don't touch me.

134
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,870
(Daewoon)

135
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,730
(Number One Real Estate)

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,040
My, why do I look so handsome today?

137
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,070
Can my face look so different...

138
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,680
just because I got a few facials?

139
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,980
Money sure is nice.

140
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
Hang on.

141
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,920
Should I get some Botox injections too?

142
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,490
Right.

143
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Welcome...

144
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,920
Hello, Mr. Choi.

145
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,700
Oh, yes. What brings you here?

146
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,960
Please have a seat first.

147
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
- Okay.
- Here.

148
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,270
So,

149
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,770
would you like a cup of tea?

150
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,500
Oh, no. I'm fine.

151
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,940
All right.

152
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,470
Wait, why did she suddenly come here?

153
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,710
Is something else going on?

154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,550
Anyway, what brings you here?

155
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,180
As you know,
my house has been sold in the auction,

156
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,920
and we have to move out soon.

157
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,490
I was wondering if you had any idea...

158
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,360
when that might be.

159
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,730
Oh, that?

160
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,300
Once the buyer pays off
the cost of the house,

161
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,960
they could move in as early as tomorrow.

162
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,130
Tomorrow?

163
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,040
Well, I'm just saying that's how it works.

164
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,710
Usually, they give you a heads-up.

165
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,810
You don't have to worry so much.

166
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,850
Should I tell her
that Dae Sik bought that house?

167
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,210
No.

168
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,520
She's upset enough
with having to move out.

169
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,980
I shouldn't make things worse for her.

170
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,950
It'll all be over
once she moves out anyway.

171
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,290
Goodness, I should've called you earlier.

172
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,030
You said last time
that Mu Chul had left some money.

173
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,060
Could you perhaps tell me
how much that is?

174
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,270
What?

175
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,300
I mean,
you have to find a place to move to.

176
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,500
Housing prices are all over the place,

177
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,440
so we should find one
that fits your budget.

178
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,580
If you give me a rough estimate,

179
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,480
I'll try to find you a good place.

180
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,350
Well, that is...

181
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,920
How much was that?

182
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,590
So...

183
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,360
Actually, could you just tell me...

184
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,560
how much small apartment units
or detached houses go for?

185
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,800
I have no clue
about housing prices these days.

186
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,360
Yes, well...

187
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,500
You could find an older apartment
for about 500,000 to 600,000 dollars.

188
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,810
And the cost for detached houses
can vary a lot.

189
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,350
You could find a decent place
for about 500,000 dollars.

190
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,350
Did you say 500,000 dollars?

191
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,750
Okay, I understand. Bye, then.

192
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,050
Are you leaving already?

193
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,390
Oh, I have plans. Goodbye.

194
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,390
Okay, bye.

(Number One Real Estate)

196
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,860
Oh, isn't that Mi Ja?

197
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,530
- Hello.
- Hi.

198
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,070
By the way, why was Mi Ja here?

199
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,080
Well, it was about having to move out.

200
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,210
Oh, right. I heard from Dae Sik.

201
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,750
You guys bought the house.

202
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,390
You've become a homeowner now.
Congratulations!

203
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,120
My gosh.

204
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,660
(Daewoon Building)

205
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,920
What was that?

206
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,330
I was congratulating her.

207
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,490
What was that reaction?

208
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,500
Congratulations, my foot.

209
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,130
They should just let those
who want to live there stay there.

210
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,470
Why are they dragging someone
who doesn't want to stay into this?

211
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,040
Gosh, I'm so mad.

212
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,340
Oh, my.

213
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,670
What's wrong, Hye Sook?
Is something going on?

214
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,070
My gosh.

215
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,780
What? He bought the house?

216
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,950
Goodness, that's great news!

217
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,050
Why is great news?
I don't like that house.

218
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,050
I want to move somewhere else.

219
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,850
Oh, my. I can't believe you.

220
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,320
They say hard times are soon forgotten.

221
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,630
Think about the time when
you were nearly kicked out of that house.

222
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,260
Hang on. Come to think of it,

223
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,000
you and Mi Ja are
in opposite situations now.

224
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,000
Now, Mi Ja is about to get kicked out
of that house.

225
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,140
My goodness.

226
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,840
How could something like this happen?

227
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,480
Whatever. That's beside the point.

228
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,340
Anyway, I don't like that house.

229
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,810
I refuse to stay there.

230
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,520
Gosh, I don't even know.

231
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,920
Oh, right. Hye Sook, did you hear?

232
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
You know, about the Daewoon Building.

233
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,190
From now on,
we have to send our rent to Gyu Tae.

234
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,390
What? To Mr. Choi?

235
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,030
But why?

236
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,500
I guess Mu Chul sold just this building
to someone else before he died.

237
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,140
And that person entrusted Gyu Tae
with managing the building.

238
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Is that so?

239
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,470
The house became Dae Sik's,

240
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,740
and the Daewoon Building will be managed
by Gyu Tae.

241
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,340
If Mu Chul is watching down from above,

242
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,480
he must feel such mixed emotions.

243
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,850
Anyway, I just feel bad for poor Mu Chul.

244
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Oh, right.

245
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Grandpa.

246
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,760
When I went to Haengbok-ro yesterday,

247
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,260
- I saw this building.
- Yes?

248
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,270
It seemed oddly familiar.

249
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,540
It was called the Daewoon Building.

250
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,110
Daewoon Building?

251
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Yes.

252
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,850
After I saw that building,

253
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,250
I remembered my dream
that I had forgotten about.

254
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
So, what was your dream?

255
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,590
To become a landlord.

256
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,790
A landlord
who owns several buildings in Seoul.

257
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,830
A landlord? Come on.

258
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,500
Why would you want to become that
out of all the jobs in the world?

259
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,470
One time,

260
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,740
my grandma was really sick,

261
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,880
but because we lived at the top of a hill,

262
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,950
the hospital was too far away.

263
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,760
Grandma, hang in there a bit.

264
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,160
We'll be at the hospital soon.
You have to hang in there, okay?

265
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,030
I told her...

266
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,330
to please hang in there.

267
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,500
That we were almost there.

268
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,440
I told her and kept running.

269
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,080
Grandma, we're really almost there.
So, please...

270
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,150
No!

271
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,420
Grandma, no!

272
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,260
Grandma!

273
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,260
Grandma...

274
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,830
Grandma!

275
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,930
In the end,

276
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,740
she breathed her last...

277
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,770
while being carried on my back.

278
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,250
I thought it was so unfair,
and I deeply regretted it.

279
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,350
So,

280
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,490
I told myself that day...

281
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,690
that I'd one day own a nice home...

282
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,790
in a fancy neighborhood...

283
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,600
in Seoul.

284
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,930
You were only a kid back then.

285
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,470
I will work hard.

286
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,810
Whatever I do, I will work very hard...

287
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,210
and accomplish my dream, no matter what.

288
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,880
Starting tomorrow,

289
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm going to look for a job.

290
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,420
A job?

291
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,050
Yes.

292
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
What?

293
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,190
But...

294
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,830
What? You hurt your back?

295
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,830
How serious is it?

296
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,000
My gosh. Okay, yes.
Then you should rest up.

297
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,200
I'm sorry.
But you'll be overworked by yourself.

298
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,370
Should I hire a temporary part-timer?

299
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,810
No, it's fine. I can manage by myself.

300
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,810
I'll let you know if it gets too much.

301
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,510
Okay.

302
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,010
Hold on.

303
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,450
This guy must be looking for a job
at least, right?

304
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,150
I'm kindly letting him
pay me back in installments.

305
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,520
If he won't even do that,
he shouldn't call himself human.

306
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,800
A part-time job? Is she crazy?
Why would I take up such a job?

307
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm highly educated
and incredibly capable.

308
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,400
Does she expect me
to put ketchup on corn dogs all day long?

309
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,470
Nonsense.

310
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,070
(Account Balance: minus 2,152 dollars)

311
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,370
My gosh.

312
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,880
Whatever, fine.

313
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,720
I can grow this into a big sum.

314
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,590
Who knows?
This could become my seed money...

315
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,150
and make me rich.

316
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,790
Yes, I shouldn't give up.

317
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,030
Which stock should I buy today?

318
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,140
Did Seok Jin tell you that?

319
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,310
Well, sure.
No one else knows about us besides him.

320
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
It's him, right?

321
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,940
Hey, wait.

322
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,150
Have you met Tae Hyung since that day?

323
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,780
Tae Hyung? No.

324
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,690
Did you hear from Tae Hyung?

325
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,050
No, why would he contact me?

326
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Never mind.

327
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
My gosh.

328
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,580
What?

329
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,850
Shoot.

330
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,390
Oh, it's you.

331
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
What?

332
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,700
Why is this coming back to me just now?

333
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,240
Does that mean he carried me home?

334
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,680
Are you busy?

335
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,950
Why are you here?

336
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,590
Shouldn't you welcome your friend
with a smile on your face?

337
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,120
What? Why am I here?

338
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,490
Come and sit here for a minute.

339
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,590
(Jackpot Chicken)

340
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,060
What's this about
that you look all serious?

341
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,100
Well, Mu Chul's wife...

342
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,570
stopped by my office earlier.

343
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,540
What? Mu Chul's wife?
Why did she visit you?

344
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,310
Well, they should move out soon, you know.

345
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,470
They need to find a new place to live,

346
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,810
but I don't think
she has much money right now.

347
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,480
I'm sorry. In that case, it'll be hard
for you to get a loan from our bank.

348
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,520
Yes, I understand.

349
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,020
That said,

350
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,730
you own that house now, you know.

351
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,400
Can't you just let Mu Chul's family
stay there?

352
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,830
I'll cover their rent.

353
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,730
Why should you cover their rent?

354
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,240
Well, seeing Mu Chul's family...

355
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
suffer so much
after losing him like that...

356
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,270
breaks my heart. What do you think?

357
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,210
I have thought about that too.

358
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,810
But that's not important now.

359
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,150
It doesn't look like
I can keep living there.

360
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,590
What? Why not?

361
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,620
My wife finally found out
that I bought the house,

362
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,260
and she says she refuses to stay there.

363
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,730
Oh, really?

364
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,700
That explains
the look on her face earlier.

365
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,030
What?

366
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,270
Oh, it's nothing.
So? What are you going to do?

367
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,840
Gyu Tae, help me out.

368
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,910
Can you talk to my wife
so she can change her mind?

369
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,310
Hey, how am I supposed
to persuade her to change her mind?

370
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,850
I can't believe you're asking me this,
knowing I don't even have a wife.

371
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,750
Well, you could say stuff like...

372
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,720
how the house will probably skyrocket
in value in the future...

373
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,220
or how the location is amazing
according to feng shui.

374
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,960
Tell her everything you can say
as an expert.

375
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,930
Hey, you're a real estate expert.

376
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,500
Unlike me
who has a business anyone can run,

377
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,570
you're a real professional
with a nationally recognized certificate.

378
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,370
You're a pro, man.

379
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
My goodness.

380
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,210
Oh, come on. Cut it out.

381
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,120
Well, you're right that
it's not a job everyone can have.

382
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,550
Okay, all right. As an industry expert,

383
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,220
I will consider it in a positive light.

384
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,990
For sure, right?

385
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,100
Thanks, Gyu Tae.

386
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,800
I'm counting on you.

387
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,900
Oh, boy.

388
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,600
"A nationally recognized certificate?"

389
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,570
You didn't have to bring it up.
Now, I'm blushing.

390
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,910
Enjoy.

391
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,210
Welcome! You can take this table.

392
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,850
Yes, boss.

393
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,950
Hey, are you all right? Is it manageable?

394
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,220
The thing is,
I don't know why we're so busy today.

395
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,420
Really? How busy is it?

396
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,430
- We'll have two bowls of bibimbap.
- Sure.

397
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,360
Could we get some water
and more side dishes?

398
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,700
Yes. One moment, please!

399
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,770
Boss, I'm so busy right now. I have to go.

400
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,700
Yes, all right.

401
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,610
It doesn't sound like
she can manage alone.

402
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,180
(We're hiring!)

403
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,050
Hello.

404
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,590
(We're hiring!)

405
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,400
Gosh, we can't hire someone so old.

406
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,630
Go somewhere else.

407
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,870
(Now Hiring)

408
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,270
I thought...

409
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,040
I could eat as much jokbal
as I wanted if I worked here.

410
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,750
I can do this.

411
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,880
(Now Hiring)

412
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,990
Then please think about it
and let me know.

413
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,250
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

414
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,090
These days, you must hire
such handsome, young part-timers...

415
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,460
to make your customers happy.

416
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Right, sir?

417
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
"Sir?"

418
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,170
(We're hiring. Inquire inside!)

419
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,810
Yes, we need a part-timer
even if it's only temporary.

420
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,980
I can't keep doing this alone.

421
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,850
(We're hiring, Buddumak)

422
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,320
It's so hard to get a job.

423
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,890
What should I do now?

424
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,830
What? They're hiring too.

425
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
Should I go in and ask?

426
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,340
What's the point?

427
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,440
They'll just say I'm too old for the job.

428
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,890
(We're hiring. Inquire inside!)

429
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,090
Hey, Mi Ja.

430
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,490
Are you feeling better?

431
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,730
I wanted to drop these off.

432
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,030
We enjoyed the food.

433
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,730
Thanks.

434
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,970
Wait.

435
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,340
Have you found a new place yet?

436
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,810
I know it's probably upsetting
to have to move out all of a sudden,

437
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,950
but don't be too sad.

438
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,150
This house is really old, you know.

439
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,250
These days,

440
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,390
there are many clean new buildings,
although they may be on the smaller side.

441
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,560
It might be better for you
to move to one of those buildings.

442
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,230
If you stay here,

443
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,260
this place will keep reminding you
of your husband.

444
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,400
Try to look on the bright side.

445
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,670
It's so easy for you to say, isn't it?

446
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
What?

447
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,770
How could you say that, you brat?

448
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,010
When someone tells you something
from their heart, don't twist their words.

449
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,610
Do you enjoy twisting others' words?

450
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,520
To you, this might be just an old house,

451
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,320
but this house means something
to my family.

452
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,490
It was after we moved here...

453
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,360
that my husband started erecting
all those buildings.

454
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,330
My son, Tae Ha,
got into a prestigious university,

455
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,230
and Seo Woo got into grad school.

456
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,460
These things all happened
while living in this house.

457
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,140
Do you think I stayed here
because I didn't want a better house?

458
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,900
Do you think we didn't have the money
to move to an apartment?

459
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,870
It was because
my husband loved this house so much.

460
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,010
And as I watched my husband
become more successful while living here,

461
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,320
I gladly stayed.

462
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
You don't even know.

463
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,090
Don't be so careless with your words!

464
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,430
How could I only remember that now?

465
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,530
Gosh, I didn't even know that...

466
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,470
and practically shouted
that I got home fine on my own.

467
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Hang on.

468
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,480
Then, was that also...

469
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,780
You're pretty.

470
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,160
The one who told me I was pretty...

471
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,900
It was him?

472
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,770
Attention, everyone.

473
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,500
Tomorrow, Farm to Market officially opens.

474
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,370
Let's all hurry things up!

475
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,370
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

476
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,410
Who are you?

477
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,810
Hello.

478
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,110
I'm the corporate lawyer
for Shinmi Apparel,

479
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
Sim Han Soo.

480
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,990
Are you Mr. Kim Seok Jin,
the CEO of Farm to Market?

481
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,860
Yes. Shinmi Apparel is
Tae Hyung's father's company.

482
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,130
What business do you have here?

483
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,290
I came under orders
from Chairman Kim Chang Soo.

484
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,700
Tae Hyung's father sent you?

485
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,800
I came to tell you on his behalf
that he will be taking back...

486
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,930
his investment in Farm to Market,
both the part he already paid...

487
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,840
and the part he promised to pay you
in a week.

488
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,270
What? He's taking back his investment?

489
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,040
Excuse me.

490
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,710
Is anyone here?

491
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,380
I'm sorry. We're closed for our break.

492
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,850
Please come back after 5 p.m.

493
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,250
Hello, I'm here for a job interview.

494
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,320
A job interview?

495
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,830
Yes, I'd appreciate it
if you could spare me a moment.

496
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,660
Have a seat here first.

497
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Okay.

498
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,070
So...

499
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,840
How old are you...

500
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,310
What?

501
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,110
What?

502
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,330
(Good Luck!)

503
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,660
What are you doing here?

504
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
Let go of her!

505
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,630
I can't believe you!

506
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,170
I seriously can't believe you!

507
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,170
Your father took back his investment
in my company.

508
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,070
I thought
I shouldn't have to be so generous...

509
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,010
to a jerk who chose a girl
over our friendship.

510
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,410
Let's move.

511
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,280
- What?
- This house.

512
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,980
Dae Sik is the one who bought it.

513
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,210
What?

514
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,450
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
