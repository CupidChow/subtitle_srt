1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,070
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,840
Then what is your name?

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,810
I'm Han Mu Chul. That's my name.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,180
Han Mu Chul?

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,320
Are you sure that's your name?

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,650
Yes!

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,790
Mu Chul?

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,920
Are you Choi Min Yong's father?

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,790
Mr. Choi?

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,930
Yes, what did you say?

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,830
We can't identify you,
and you don't even have a guardian.

12
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,740
If he weren't lenient with you,

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,600
you would've ended up in jail.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,840
What? Jail?

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,140
I did not steal anything.

16
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,380
You're still lying? You can go.

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,410
What is this?

18
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,580
- Okay.
- I don't know.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
Why did you go there?

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,390
- Thank you for your leniency.
- We didn't go there.

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,790
Stop lying.

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,790
- My gosh.
- No, we really didn't...

23
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,860
(Nambu Police Station)

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,470
What did I just see?

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,670
Was I possessed by a ghost or something?

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,340
Gyu Tae.

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,050
What happened?

28
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,610
Why did you suddenly have to
go to the police station?

29
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,620
Min Yong, did you cause trouble again?

30
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,190
You punk.

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,160
You're still recovering.
What did you do...

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,920
that you were taken to the police station?

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,160
Gyu Tae.

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,090
He rode a motorcycle without a helmet.

35
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,800
What? Are you trying to get killed?

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,700
You brat. Your dad and I did everything
in our power to save your life.

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,500
How could you ride a motorcycle
without a helmet?

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,470
You're grounded.

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
I'm taking your phone and game console,

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
so don't go anywhere.
Just stay home, okay?

41
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,210
That brat!

42
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,650
My goodness, Gyu Tae.
That must've given you such a scare.

43
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,910
Grandpa.

44
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,240
What's wrong?

45
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,740
Are you not feeling well?

46
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,650
Who am I?

47
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,750
If something bad happens to me,
who can help me?

48
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,390
When I die, will anyone remember me?

49
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,920
Anyone?

50
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,960
My goodness. What's the matter?
Did something happen today?

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,060
I'm scared.

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm really scared.

53
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,600
And I'm lonely.

54
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,350
I'm Han Mu Chul. That's my name.

55
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,890
I swear,

56
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,160
it was Mu Chul.

57
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,760
No, that can't be. Mu Chul is dead.

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,730
Yes, I'm sure it was just someone
who looks like him.

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,000
I must've been mistaken.

60
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,970
Wait, but how's it possible...

61
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,740
that he even has the same name?

62
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,310
My goodness.

63
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,180
That's what happened?
Why didn't you call me?

64
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,380
I already feel so bad that
I've been inconveniencing you like this,

65
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,520
so how could I?

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,060
You see,

67
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,830
I feel like I've been staying strong...

68
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,760
since my grandma passed away,

69
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,860
but I really had a hard time earlier.

70
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,500
Should I say...

71
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,040
I felt as though
I was left all alone in the world again?

72
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,370
Oh, dear.

73
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,680
It doesn't have to be your family.

74
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,680
Don't you have any acquaintances
you were close with?

75
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,450
Your relatives...

76
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,680
or friends.

77
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,650
Relatives?

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
Wait.

79
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,990
Friends?

80
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,130
Friends... Oh, that's right!

81
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
The trio.

82
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,400
The trio?

83
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,900
Yes, my best friends...

84
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,870
from high school.

85
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,440
Why hadn't I thought of them?

86
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,570
I'll be right back.

87
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,380
Wait, you're going out now?

88
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,610
Do you even know where they are?

89
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,250
We all lived in the same neighborhood.

90
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,150
They must know everything about me.

91
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,350
They always have, since the old days.
I'll see you later!

92
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,620
Wait!

93
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
My goodness.

94
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,490
Would your friends welcome you
if you showed up dressed like that?

95
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,790
What?

96
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,300
I don't know what kind of person
you were in the past,

97
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,440
but they'd all be shocked
if you showed up like this.

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,770
It's getting late, so just go to bed.

99
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,440
You should visit them in the morning.

100
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Okay.

101
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,110
I'll do that.

102
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,980
I just wanted to see them
as soon as possible.

103
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,890
Oh, boy.

104
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,690
I'm really curious to see...

105
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,530
how they've changed.

106
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,100
Those guys...

107
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,970
should be able to tell us
everything about me.

108
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,470
What?

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,540
You decided to stay here?

110
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,040
Then what about Mom?

111
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,250
Don't worry. I'll stay here too.

112
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,850
With you guys and your dad.
We'll all live a happy life together here.

113
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,560
Really? My gosh. That's so great.

114
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,960
Honestly, I wanted to stay here too.

115
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,760
Mom, you seemed to hate the idea,
so I couldn't say it.

116
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,060
Now, you can talk all about
how happy you are.

117
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,430
From now on, no one can tell us
to move out of this house.

118
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,340
We own this house now, you know.

119
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,940
Mom, Dad. The two of you...

120
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,410
are our landlords now.

121
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,580
That's right.

122
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,910
We never have to live as tenants again,

123
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,950
so enjoy it all you want,
the landlord's daughter.

124
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,620
Okay, Ms. Landlady.

125
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,360
Anyway, what's going on with Seok Jin?

126
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,520
Why did he suddenly cancel
his grand opening today?

127
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,790
I don't know either.

128
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,200
He left the house very early
and is not even answering his phone.

129
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,870
What happened that
he even had to postpone his grand opening?

130
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,670
He seemed to be
in a really bad mood yesterday.

131
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,700
He even yelled at you, Mom.

132
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,240
I'd never seen him get like that.

133
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,710
What is going on?

134
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,130
Mr. Kim!

135
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,130
Please hear me out.

136
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,400
I don't know what Tae Hyung told you,

137
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,200
but it's a misunderstanding.
Tae Hyung is mistaken.

138
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,200
By that,

139
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,940
do you mean
my son is overreacting over nothing?

140
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,210
I admit it is true that
some stuff happened between us.

141
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,180
However, that has nothing to do
with my business.

142
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,050
I'll get things sorted out
and make up with Tae Hyung.

143
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,850
So, please reconsider...

144
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,190
your decision to withdraw your investment.

145
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,630
You said yourself that
my business would do well.

146
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,030
You told me you'd decided
to invest in my business...

147
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,130
because you believed in me,
not because I was Tae Hyung's friend.

148
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,400
I think you were mistaken about something.

149
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,770
Even if I trust you,

150
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,670
I can't trust you more than my own son.

151
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
You see,

152
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,550
I'll never do something
my son doesn't want me to do.

153
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,050
Leave now.

154
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,620
I should've been more thoughtful.

155
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,420
Please forgive me, Mr. Kim.

156
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,380
Hey, wait. Let's talk.

157
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,690
Hey, neighbor.

158
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Hey.

159
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,200
Are you okay? Get up, will you?

160
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,970
Gosh, you're heavy.

161
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,110
Hey, open your eyes!

162
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Oh, dear.

163
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,650
Seok Jin.

164
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,620
What's wrong, Seok Jin? Get up.

165
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,960
Dad! Come out here! Hey, get up.

166
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,530
Gosh, you reek of alcohol!

167
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Get up.

168
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,640
Dad! My goodness. Let's go inside.

169
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,470
What's going on that he got so drunk?

170
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,190
Hey, what about Seok Jin?

171
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,130
He fell asleep.

172
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,630
He's usually not a heavy drinker.

173
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,700
I don't know what's going on,

174
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,840
but I'm so worried.

175
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,100
He hasn't told you anything, has he?

176
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,870
No, he hasn't.

177
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,080
It seems like something went wrong, right?

178
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,180
Doesn't it?

179
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,250
Let him be. He'll tell us when he's ready.

180
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,620
By the way, about the family upstairs.

181
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,690
Do you perhaps know
if they have plans to move?

182
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,390
I don't know. Why should I care?

183
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,590
I don't even want to speak to her.

184
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,460
Ever since her husband died,
she has developed an inferiority complex.

185
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,300
She's constantly twisting my words.

186
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,070
Gosh, I can't stand her.

187
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,600
We must get a rough idea
of what they're planning to do...

188
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,800
so we can plan our move too.

189
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,240
Why don't you ask her?

190
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,910
Ask her when they're going to move.

191
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,940
Ask her if she has a place to go.

192
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,410
Me?

193
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,450
Of course, you should do it. Who else?

194
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,350
I don't even want to see her,

195
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,350
so you can take care of this or not.

196
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,760
Do what you want. I don't care.

197
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,160
Gosh, I can't stand her.

198
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,400
Really?

199
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,660
Can we really move in and live there?

200
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,570
The house is empty anyway.
You can go and live there.

201
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,570
That way, you won't have to go around
looking for a place.

202
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,780
Thank you so much.

203
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,880
I won't forget this, ever.

204
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,750
There's no need to thank me.

205
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,980
Auntie has done my mom so many favors
over the years.

206
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,550
So, don't say that.

207
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,420
Then, when can we move into that house?

208
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,630
Kids!

209
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,260
Now, we have a place to move to!

210
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,100
- What? Where?
- What? Really?

211
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,370
You know Aunt Ji Sook, right? My cousin.

212
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,900
She has an empty apartment in Gangnam,

213
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,140
and she says we can go and live there.

214
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,440
Then, are we moving to Gangnam?

215
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,140
Yes! We're moving to Gangnam.

216
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,680
When are we moving?

217
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,720
The place is empty, so she says
we can move in right away, even tomorrow.

218
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,450
Kids, let's pack our things.

219
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,150
Let's move out as soon as possible.

220
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,750
If we stay here,

221
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,990
we'll only have to watch Hye Sook
jumping with joy.

222
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,460
That family is jumping with joy?
What do you mean by that?

223
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,200
Hye Sook's family bought this house
in the auction.

224
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,830
What did you say?
Then, will that family be living here?

225
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,440
Yes! All right.

226
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,510
If you understood what I said,
let's get packing.

227
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,380
We're moving to Gangnam!

228
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,220
What's this? Where's your lunch?

229
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,320
My grandma is sick,
so I couldn't bring one.

230
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,330
My dad was busy
and couldn't cook any food.

231
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,270
I'll go and stand watch.
You guys can eat first.

232
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
This is delicious, Dae Sik.

233
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,750
Your dad is a great cook.

234
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,490
Hey, punks. Eat slowly.

235
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,130
You should leave some food for me.

236
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,130
Okay.

237
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,440
- Hey, run!
- You punks!

238
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,580
All right. Stop right there.

239
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,180
- Little rascals. Get up, one at a time.
- My gosh. Hey.

240
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,620
- Get up!
- Hey, man. Get up.

241
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,720
Dae Sik.

242
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,060
Gyu Tae.

243
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,360
Are you doing all right?

244
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,770
Wait.

245
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,300
I will visit you soon.

246
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
I promise.

247
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,660
Hey, are you leaving already?

248
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,990
It looked like
you had a lot to drink last night.

249
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,330
I made some dried pollack soup.
You should eat before you go.

250
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,560
- I'm fine.
- Seok Jin.

251
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,470
Is something going on?

252
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,970
You said
you weren't opening your business.

253
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,340
I'm worried.

254
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,670
It just got delayed a bit.

255
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,510
That's all I can tell you for now.

256
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
I see.

257
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,110
Okay, I'll see you later.

258
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,060
Seok Jin, are you okay?

259
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
What about Seok Jin?

260
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,870
I finished making dried pollack soup,

261
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,570
but he was all ready to go.

262
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,910
And did he say anything else?

263
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,180
He just said that
the opening was delayed a bit.

264
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,250
What? They took back the investment?

265
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,690
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

266
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,560
Why is that your fault?

267
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,960
This won't do.
I'll book a flight to Korea today.

268
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,030
No, I'll try
to take care of things myself.

269
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,270
You should just stay there.

270
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,830
Okay, then.

271
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,780
Who are you?

272
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,720
The landlord told us
to tear down this office.

273
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,360
By the landlord, do you mean Tae Hyung?

274
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,090
- Tear everything down.
- Yes, sir.

275
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,990
Wait a minute.

276
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,890
You should let us take our stuff
before you tear things down.

277
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,360
I don't know about all that.

278
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,530
We just have to finish our jobs on time.

279
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,700
Get out of the way. You'll get hurt.

280
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,970
Wait a minute, please.

281
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,270
- We're busy! Move! You'll get hurt.
- But...

282
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,720
Who are you?

283
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,060
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

284
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,900
Do you perhaps know Kim Dae Sik?
He used to live here.

285
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,960
Kim Dae Sik?

286
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,430
I'm not sure. It doesn't ring a bell.

287
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,000
Then, how about Choi Gyu Tae?

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,040
Gosh, I don't know.

289
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,980
Hello, do you know someone called
Kim Dae Sik or Choi Gyu Tae?

290
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
Hello.

291
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,890
Do you know Kim Dae Sik or Choi Gyu Tae?

292
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,560
- No.
- I don't know them.

293
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,260
Okay. Thank you.

294
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,930
Gosh, I'm tired.

295
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,370
Everyone says they don't know them. Shoot.

296
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,170
What?

297
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,110
This place...

298
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,610
It's Mr. Gi Toong's house.

299
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,780
I'm sure of it.

300
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,250
Oh, my.

301
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,720
Who are you?

302
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,590
Oh, may I ask you something?

303
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,870
This is Mr. Byun Gi Toong's house,
isn't it?

304
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,370
Yes, it is. And who might you be?

305
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,940
Oh, hello.

306
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,340
I'm Han Mu Chul.

307
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,340
I used to live here a long time ago.

308
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,350
Han Mu Chul?

309
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,820
Oh, did you use to live
with your grandmother?

310
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,650
Yes, that's right.

311
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,220
Do you remember me?

312
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,750
Yes, I remember.

313
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,090
I heard you moved away
after your grandmother passed.

314
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,830
What brings you here?

315
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,830
Could I see your father, perhaps?

316
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,170
Oh, I'm sorry.

317
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,300
My father passed away a year ago.

318
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,700
Really?

319
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,440
I see.

320
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,780
He was such a wonderful man.

321
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,980
Then by any chance, do you remember
my friends who also lived in this area?

322
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,190
Kim Dae Sik and Choi Gyu Tae.

323
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,950
They were my friends.

324
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Do you remember them?

325
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,290
I'm not sure.

326
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,000
I was very young back then.

327
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,500
I remember you
because my father told me about you.

328
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,970
I see.

329
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,700
Anyway, it was nice meeting you again.

330
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,070
Take care.

331
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,650
Wait!

332
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,390
I want to pack as quickly as possible...

333
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,790
so we can move out tonight.

334
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
What?

335
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
(Mr. Kim Dae Sik)

336
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Hello?

337
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,380
My goodness.

338
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,380
I can't believe
I'm seeing those two together here.

339
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,720
Gosh, seeing this is bringing back
the old memories.

340
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,190
When those two were standing side by side,

341
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,320
they looked so lovely together
that I thought...

342
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,090
they were brightening up the whole street.

343
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,860
My goodness. What am I saying now?

344
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,830
Why did you want to see me?

345
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Well, please hear me out
without getting the wrong idea.

346
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,780
You've probably heard by now,
but your house...

347
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,280
I bought it in the auction.

348
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,210
Do you want to know when we're moving out?

349
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,550
Pardon?

350
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,380
Oh, right.

351
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,120
We need to know your plans.

352
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
So,

353
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,760
have you found a new place?

354
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,260
Yes, I have.

355
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,960
Oh, really?

356
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,230
Where will you move to?

357
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,570
That's none of your business.

358
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,500
We can move out tomorrow, so don't worry.

359
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,170
No, it's not that.
You don't need to move out in such a rush.

360
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,170
I want to move out as soon as possible.

361
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,040
I do not want to get tangled up
with your family again.

362
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,910
So,

363
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,320
just keep in mind
that we're moving out tomorrow.

364
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,350
Wait, but...

365
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,750
Mi Ja, wait.

366
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,360
My gosh. Hey.

367
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,230
Is Mi Ja moving out tomorrow?
Where's she moving to?

368
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,860
Oh, dear.

369
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,440
What? What's happening here?
Is this office moving out?

370
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,740
The landlord told us
to tear down the office.

371
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,870
That's what we're doing now.

372
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,170
- The landlord?
- Yes.

373
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,580
Who's the landlord?

374
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,550
I think his name was Kim Tae Hyung.

375
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,950
What did you say? Kim Tae Hyung?

376
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,950
- Yes.
- My gosh.

377
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,660
Hey! What is going on?

378
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,590
Is Tae Hyung kicking you out? Is he?

379
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,460
Is he kicking you out? Hey!

380
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,600
Hey, tell me.

381
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,100
Is he doing this
because of what happened with me?

382
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,080
Please tell me what's going on.

383
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,910
Why is Tae Hyung
suddenly making you move out?

384
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,050
It has nothing to do with you.

385
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,480
Please leave now.

386
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,980
But...

387
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,360
(Do Not Answer)

388
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
You little...

389
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,550
I asked to meet today,
so hear me out first.

390
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Okay, talk.

391
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,120
First off, it is my own fault
that I failed to pay you back on time,

392
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,420
so I'm sorry about that.

393
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,230
But you see,

394
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,930
don't you think it's also wrong for you
to cause a scene...

395
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,760
at my friend's restaurant
and harass my mom?

396
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,830
They have nothing to do with it.

397
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,800
What? Why, you little...

398
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So?

399
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,670
- Seriously.
- What's your point?

400
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,740
I give you my word.

401
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,210
From now on, I'll pay you
1,000 dollars every month.

402
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,040
And you expect me to believe that?

403
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,650
What if you fail to keep your word gain?

404
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,820
Well, then...

405
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,220
send me to a salt farm
or a deep-sea fishing vessel.

406
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,090
I'll just think that my life is over...

407
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,220
and work like a dog until the day I die.

408
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
If you don't believe me,
I can write a pledge.

409
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,860
Here, I can stamp it with my thumb.
Shall we do that?

410
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,430
From what I've heard,
if you get it notarized at a law office,

411
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,430
it becomes legally binding.

412
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,470
Are you confident about this?

413
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,840
Are you?

414
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,780
Hey, give me some water.

415
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,680
Do it yourself
unless you're here to eat as a customer.

416
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,080
Hey, come on.

417
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,890
I'm here to grant your wish.
Don't be so mean.

418
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,490
My wish?

419
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,660
I'll work here.

420
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,360
What? You will do what?

421
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,560
You told me to work here.

422
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,230
Wasn't it your wish?

423
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,400
So, I will grant your wish. Happy now?

424
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,370
What? Tae Ha?

425
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,540
Okay, all right.

426
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,210
What's gotten into Tae Ha?

427
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,550
When I asked him for help
during the busy times,

428
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,820
he always ignored me. My goodness.

429
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,990
Don't get up.

430
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,960
Hey, is your back better now?

431
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,830
Yes, I think so. Are you heading out now?

432
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,630
Yes, someone wants to see some buildings.

433
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,230
Oh, my. Are you going to sell
another building?

434
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,130
You'll become wealthy at this rate!

435
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,900
Oh, cut it out.

436
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,200
Hey, keep a watchful eye on Min Yong.
Make sure...

437
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,070
he doesn't sneak out again like last time.
Okay?

438
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,840
Yes, don't you worry.

439
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,010
I don't know why,

440
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,910
but I have a good feeling about today.
It'll be a great day.

441
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,780
- Have a great day, Gyu Tae!
- You too!

442
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Let's go.

443
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,990
What kind of building
would this person be interested in today?

444
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,230
Oh, my.

445
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,370
I hope it's another high roller,
like that lady last time.

446
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,170
A real estate high roller
who just spends money...

447
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,640
and buys properties
without asking many questions.

448
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,870
Oh, my. For some reason,
my gut tells me...

449
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,810
that I might meet
another high roller like that today.

450
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,950
Oh, it must be them.

451
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,250
Welcome.

452
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Excuse me.

453
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,190
By any chance...

454
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,260
You...

455
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
My gosh.

456
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,490
Why...

457
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,130
have you aged so much?

458
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,560
By any chance,

459
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,670
are you Choi Gyu Tae?

460
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,570
It's me.

461
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,540
Han Mu Chul.

462
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,210
Do you remember me?

463
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,280
(Good Luck!)

464
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,020
I only remember my friends
when they were young, you know.

465
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,120
He's changed so much.

466
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,750
We're moving to Gangnam.

467
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,420
A new apartment complex in Gangnam.

468
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,860
Why is it that when there's something
I want to do, she always beats me to it?

469
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,330
How did I live my life...

470
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,060
that I can't even show myself...

471
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,300
in front of my family and friends
with confidence?

472
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,770
