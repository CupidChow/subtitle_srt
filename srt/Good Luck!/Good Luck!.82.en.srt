1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,010
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,080
What? Geum Ok knows
about the Daewoon Building now?

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,820
So? What did she say?

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,250
She urged me to tell Mu Chul
as soon as possible.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,520
After Dae Sik, even Geum Ok knows now.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,790
Two people know about it already.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,630
Don't you think
the word is bound to get out?

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,800
Why not just tell him?

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,030
I told you.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,500
That's not everything.
There's something else.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,070
And you can't tell me what that is?

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,540
Hey, Mr. Kim. It's me.

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,010
What? Someone's interested
in the building?

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,590
Great. Then I'd like to
meet that person tomorrow.

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,490
I'll pay you a handsome commission.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,330
Someone's interested
in buying the Daewoon Building?

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,090
I want to sell it.

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,760
Then I'll give the money to Mu Chul
and leave the country.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,570
Leave the country?

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,700
But why, all of a sudden...

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,670
I really can't bring myself
to tell the truth.

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,980
I'll give the money to Mu Chul
to compensate him for everything.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,780
Then I'll leave this place
and go somewhere where no one knows me.

24
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,750
As for Dae Sik and Geum Ok,

25
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,850
if I beg them, they will listen to me.

26
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,590
So, I'll ask them
to please keep the truth buried.

27
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,770
Mr. Han Mu Chul?

28
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,870
Are you Mr. Han Mu Chul?

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
What is this about?

30
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,580
Police.

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,810
(Civil Servant ID Card)

32
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,120
I'm sorry, but could I see your ID?

33
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,390
Well...

34
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,260
We've had a report
about your false death registration.

35
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,690
You are Mr. Han Mu Chul, aren't you?

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,900
Would you mind telling us
exactly what kind of report you received?

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,470
You were investigated as a suspect
in a fraud case in the past, weren't you?

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,240
Some of the victims reported seeing you,

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,250
so we've been monitoring you
over the past few days.

40
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,580
Anyway, you'll have to come with us.

41
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,450
Sure.

42
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,980
Go home.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
I'll be back.

44
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,020
Let's go.

45
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,530
Dad.

46
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,110
What? The police took him? Why?

47
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,780
I think someone saw Dad recently
and reported it to the police.

48
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,710
The cop said
the police had been monitoring him.

49
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,550
Then what's going to happen to Dad now?

50
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,520
Wait, where are you going?

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,650
To your Dad. I can't just leave him
at the police station by himself.

52
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,960
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

53
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,990
If anyone needs to go, let it be me.
You just stay home, Mom.

54
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,460
What if something bad happens to your dad?

55
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,740
The truth is, I got into an accident...

56
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,310
and lost my memory.

57
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,050
Everything after high school is a blank.

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,250
Do you seriously expect me
to believe that?

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,120
Are you aware that you were
under investigation for a fraud case?

60
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,490
Yes.

61
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,590
My family told me.

62
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,930
Then, the reason why you didn't correct
your death registration all this time...

63
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,560
must've been to purposefully
avoid being prosecuted under the law.

64
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,930
No, that's not true.

65
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,100
I hesitated because I was scared
that I had to repay so much money.

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,900
I didn't intend to keep living like this.

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,340
That's the truth.

68
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,840
Your debt is a civil case.

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,880
That's not something for us
to get involved in.

70
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,180
We're talking about
the criminal case right now.

71
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,720
The case was closed since you died
and there was no right to indict.

72
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,050
But seeing how you're alive and well,
the investigation should be reopened.

73
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,290
Then, what will happen to me?

74
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,230
Once we go through a few steps here,

75
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,860
you'll be sent over
to the prosecution again soon.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,500
But then, am I being arrested?

77
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,370
The amount of fraud was substantial,
and there were several victims.

78
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,470
By any chance,

79
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,810
if your family registered your death
on purpose,

80
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,910
your family members might have to face
legal action as well.

81
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,550
Gosh, that was never the case.
My family has done nothing wrong.

82
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,050
You may return home for today.

83
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,790
Cancel your death registration first.

84
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,190
Yes.

85
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Oh, Officer.

86
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,990
Haven't you caught that conman,
Jang Tae Poong?

87
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm a victim of identity theft.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,630
My innocence will be proven
as soon as you catch that man.

89
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,430
My goodness.

90
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,670
Do you really not know
where Jang Tae Poong is?

91
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,770
I don't even know what he looks like.

92
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,980
May I see what that man looks like?

93
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,390
- Here.
- Thank you.

(Wanted, Accused of Fraud,
Name: Jang Tae Poong)

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,870
You're at that cafe, right?

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
What?

97
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,610
Who is that man?

98
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,080
Why am I getting this headache
all of a sudden?

99
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
This man...

100
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,420
He really was Jang Tae Poong.

101
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
What did you say?

102
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,630
Oh, it's nothing. May I take this with me?

103
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,230
Go ahead.

104
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Anyway,

105
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,300
we've confirmed that you're alive now.
Don't do anything foolish.

106
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,270
I understand.

107
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,970
(Wanted, Accused of Fraud,
Name: Jang Tae Poong)

108
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,810
What? Ms. Mi Ja said that to you?

109
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,150
How dare she say that
we're here to extort money?

110
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,520
I can't believe that ridiculous lady.
Honey, did you just let her say that?

111
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,590
Mom came outside and stood up for me.

112
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,500
Now that you mention,
I haven't seen Mom. Did she go somewhere?

113
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,300
She went out to get some air.

114
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,230
Mom is already upset
with Dad agreeing to the divorce.

115
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,240
She must be frustrated
with Ms. Mi Ja adding to all that.

116
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,240
Dad, have you had dinner?

117
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,650
He must be really angry.

118
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,960
So, Dad...

119
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,470
Were you hurt
because of what I said before?

120
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,700
I wasn't trying to blame you.

121
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,670
I'm sorry if it sounded that way.

122
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,810
I just thought it was such a shame
for the money to disappear just like that.

123
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,210
I don't mean
that you should give it to us.

124
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,710
Even if the two of you hold onto it,

125
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,580
I just wish you wouldn't give it
to that family.

126
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,950
I understand. You may leave.

127
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,290
Okay. Get some rest.

128
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,780
The amount of fraud was substantial,
and there were several victims.

on purpose,

- Dad!

- Honey.
- What happened?

137
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,280
What did the police say?

138
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,550
Oh, they told me to hurry up
and cancel my death registration.

139
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,650
Was that it?
Didn't they say anything else?

140
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,650
What about the fraud charges?
You're involved in a fraud case.

141
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,990
I just have to go in for some interviews.

142
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,630
I left your number with them,
so they'll let us know.

143
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,260
Is that really all they said?

144
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,430
It's nothing serious.

145
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,100
Lighten up, you guys. Okay?

146
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,740
Is Dad telling the truth?
Can we really believe him?

147
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Honey.

148
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,490
I know you're just pretending
so that we don't worry.

149
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,260
I mean, you're being accused of fraud.

150
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,460
How does it make sense that you
just have to go in for a few interviews?

151
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,200
What if you can't prove your innocence?

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,230
You'll have to go to prison.

153
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,670
You know,

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,240
I won't leave our family so easily,
so don't worry.

155
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,780
Oh, also,

156
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,650
I found out
what Jang Tae Poong looks like.

157
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,950

This is him.

160
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,790
Do you recognize him?

161
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,860
I don't.

162
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,700
Don't you remember him either?

163
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,830
No, but...

164
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,170
I ran into him on the streets once.

165
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,940
Oh, you said you had a headache
after seeing this man.

166
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,010
It really was him.

167
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,310
We could clear your name
if we could just find this guy.

168
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,620
But where are we supposed to find him?

169
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,290
You said...

170
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,360
that I had the tenacity
and persistence to survive, right?

171
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,960
I will catch this jerk, Jang Tae Poong,
for sure,

172
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,370
and bring our family back
to where we belong.

173
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
So,

174
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,410
have faith in me.

175
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,420
Dad will be okay, right?

176
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,690
You don't think he'll be arrested, do you?

177
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,950
That can't happen.

178
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,660
Anyway, it's the creditors
I'm worried about.

179
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,360
If they find out Dad is alive,
they won't just sit back and watch.

180
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,630
But does he still have a lot to pay back?

181
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,830
We don't even have money.
What are we supposed to do?

182
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,470
That's why we have to get
Mr. Dae Sik's money back.

183
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,700
The lottery winnings, I mean.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What?

185
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,110
Is it because of your boyfriend again?

186
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,940
No, it's just...

187
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,380
Gosh, I feel so uncomfortable
with everything that's happening.

188
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,310
I don't feel great either.
I'm tangled up with someone too.

189
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,880
Tangled up? Who?

190
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,690
Are you going to keep seeing that guy,
Kim Seok Jin?

191
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,520
Of course. Would you break up
over something like this?

192
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,290
I could never break up with Seok Jin.

193
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,300
So, don't tell me to break up or not.

194
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,060
I've already heard enough from Mom.

195
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,520
I like you.

196
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,950
What?

197
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,090
I have feelings for you.

198
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,230
Even before Seo Woo. I liked you first.

199
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,070
Oh, Seok Jin.

200
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Hey, Seo Woo.

201
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,000
Why are you sitting out here?

202
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,870
I was just getting some air
before going inside.

203
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,710
I see.

204
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,450
Did you have a good meal with Ye Won?

205
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,850
Yes. Why did you come outside?

206
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,220
I just felt a bit confused.

207
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,120
What did you talk about with Ye Won?

208
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,130
We just talked about this and that.

209
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,630
To be honest, I wasn't happy
about you and Ye Won eating together,

210
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,270
but I let you go
because you called me beforehand.

211
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,670
Yes, I know. Thanks for understanding.

212
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,240
Oh, right. I have to go
to the office tomorrow. What should I do?

213
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,640
There's an important shoot left.

214
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,010
Don't mind what my mom said,
and just come.

215
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,010
I'll take responsibility.

216
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,180
Okay, I will.

217
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,990
I'm tired. I'll head inside first.

218
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,790
Did something bad happen?

219
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,340
What?
Seok Jin is dating Seo Woo from next door?

220
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,240
Mom, did you know about this?

221
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,740
Gosh, no way. That mindless party girl?

222
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,410
What on earth is Seok Jin thinking?

223
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,980
She's not as mindless as you think.

224
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,650
She can be rather cute sometimes too.

225
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,920
Are you serious right now?

226
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,160
Mom, you should stop him.

227
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,190
I'm not saying this
because it's that family.

228
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,160
He's way too good for her.

229
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,560
Gosh, why does he have to date her,
of all people?

230
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,130
I already told him to break up with her.

231
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,240
Good. Seriously,
Seok Jin needs to be taught a lesson.

232
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,710
Mom, have you found a place to move to?

233
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,140
Yes, I've decided
to move into a small apartment.

234
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,710
I think I'll be moving this weekend.

235
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,550
Mom, do you really have to move?

236
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,280
Just thinking that
you won't be living with us anymore...

237
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,120
makes me feel weird and anxious.

238
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,920
Could you please reconsider divorcing Dad?

239
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,020
Oh, goodness.

240
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,740
Don't worry.

241
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,580
Now, you have me right by your side.

242
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,350
No one can hurt you anymore.

243
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,990
I'll never let you get arrested.

244
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,200
(Buddumak Korean Cuisine)

245
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,040
Are you busy now?

246
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Yes.

247
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,970
Some customers
are waiting for you outside.

248
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,510
That lady who left you that note
the other day.

249
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,780
Hello.

250
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,590
I'm sorry, but there's someone I like.

251
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,430
You mean, you have a girlfriend?

252
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,860
No, I don't.

253
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,160
It's just someone I like.

254
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,800
I see. I'm sorry for bothering you.

255
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,500
Hey, let's go.

256
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,410
Hey, wait.

257
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,810
Bye.

258
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,580
What did you guys talk about?

259
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,150
What did she say? Did she ask you out?

260
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,290
Hey, Mr. Han Tae Ha.

261
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,260
Do you still feel uncomfortable around me?

262
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
What?

263
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,760
We said we'd keep
our personal problems separate from work.

264
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,500
So, what's the matter with you?

265
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,530
You've been avoiding eye contact with me
since yesterday,

266
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,970
and you keep giving me one-word answers.

267
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,400
You're making it so obvious
that you feel uncomfortable around me.

268
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,170
Sorry, it wasn't intentional.

269
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,380
Do we have to be like this too,
just because our parents are at odds?

270
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,510
What does that lottery ticket
have to do with us, anyway?

271
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,750
I guess I was just feeling awkward
and didn't realize I was acting that way.

272
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,580
Are you mad at me?

273
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,520
- Hey, Ah Jin.
- Dong Min.

274
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,820
You're on break now, right?

275
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,260
I came to the market
and stopped by to have coffee with you.

276
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,500
Coffee sounds good.

277
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,860
Should we go to the park?

278
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,970
Oh, sure. Let's do that.

279
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,170
Hey.

280
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,140
What's with you today?

281
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,380
Why, that...

282
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,060
What's the big deal
about the lottery ticket...

283
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,120
that he treats me like that?

284
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,530
It feels good being this close to you.

285
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,930
What?

286
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,500
- Oh, gosh.
- Hey.

287
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,140
This is nice.

288
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,410
Hey, why?

289
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Ye Won.

290
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,570
Let's talk.

291
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,080
About what you said yesterday.
Did you really mean it?

292
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,650
Yes, I meant every word I said.

293
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,420
I had no idea. I never imagined
you'd say something like that.

294
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,020
I've liked you since elementary school.

295
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,230
I forgot about my feelings
once we became friends,

296
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,030
but seeing you date Seo Woo...

297
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,300
made me realize
how I really feel about you.

298
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
I didn't tell you expecting you
to do something about it right away.

299
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,070
I just didn't want to lie to you...

300
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,280
or hide my feelings anymore.

301
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,250
That's why I told you. That's all.

302
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,310
Ye Won.

303
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,720
You know I'm with Seo Woo now.

304
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,350
Can't I get just one chance too?

305
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,560
Am I really just a friend?

306
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,530
Have you never had feelings for me?

307
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,530
Have you...

308
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,360
never been attracted to me,

309
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,270
even once?

310
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,270
To me,

311
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,070
you're just a precious friend.

312
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,910
Nothing more or less.

313
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,580
I see. Okay.

314
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,620
I'm off.

315
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,800
What? The police came?

316
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,300
And? What did they say?

317
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,700
I was told to come to the police station
a few times for interviews.

318
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,240
That's it?

319
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,340
Well, I don't know the details either.

320
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,470
Oh, right.
I have to go to the courthouse...

321
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,640
to apply to have
my death registration revoked.

322
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,350
Right, you can go.

323
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,310
All right, see you.

324
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,320
All right.

325
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,850
(Jackpot Chicken)

326
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,200
Oh, what brings you here?

327
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,740
Did Mu Chul step out?

328
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,410
He just stepped out
to go to the courthouse.

329
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,340
If you leave now, you'll catch him.

330
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,480
No, I'm here to see you, Mr. Kim.

331
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,080
My husband told you...

332
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,820
he'd just forget about
the lottery ticket, didn't he?

333
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,560
He might be able to forget about it,
but I can't.

334
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,230
You hid it from us and deceived us
while living under the same roof.

335
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,460
I can't forgive you for that,

336
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,730
and because of that,
I have to get all of that money back.

337
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,370
Return the lottery money to us, Mr. Kim.

338
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,340
Actually, Mu Chul
and I talked about it already.

339
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,840
I can't give it all back to you, but...

340
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,880
Give what back?

341
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,580
Hey, Lee Mi Ja.

342
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,480
What are you, a thug?

343
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,550
How dare you come here
and try to extort money behind my back?

344
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,190
You stay out of this.
I'm only going to talk to Mr. Kim.

345
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,390
Even if you talk to him,

346
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,960
you won't get anything
unless I agree to it.

347
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,160
I'm not giving you anything.
Not even a penny.

348
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,270
Stop, that's enough.

349
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,130
Why are you telling me to stop?

350
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,900
She's the one who should stop, not me!

351
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,610
I want to give my money to my friend.
What's your problem with that?

352
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,510
You and your friends!

353
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,980
Worry about your own children first.

354
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,650
What's so important about your friends?

355
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,280
What right does your friend have
to that money?

356
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,190
What about you? You think
you have a right to my money? We're...

357
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,190
We're, what?

358
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Say the rest.

359
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,190
Go ahead and say it in front of Mi Ja!

360
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,730
I'll come back another time.

361
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,700
Why are you here?

362
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,770
I'm asking why you're here.

363
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,610
I came to tell you...

364
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,210
that I found a place
and that I'd be moving this weekend,

365
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,350
but forget it.

366
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,150
I am not moving out.

367
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,990
You can go ahead and move out.

368
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,160
Give up all the lottery money
and move out on your own.

369
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,290
To protect that money and my kids,

370
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,930
I'll never move out,

371
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,490
and that's final.

372
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Yes, I'm leaving now.

373
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,380
I'll head straight to the office.

374
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,390
Oh, hello.

375
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,690
Don't tell me...

376
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,590
you still work at Seok Jin's office.

377
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,400
The thing is,
there's an important photo shoot today.

378
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,200
They said they needed me for the shoot.

379
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,430
What's Seok Jin going to do
if you keep showing up at that office?

380
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,240
Didn't you hear?
I told him to break up with you.

381
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Listen carefully now.

382
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,040
You two can't be together
because of your families.

383
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,610
And I...

384
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,850
don't like you.

385
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,950
Do you really have to make me say this?

386
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,950
I know I'm not good enough for Seok Jin.

387
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,090
But I'll do my best to become someone
who deserves him.

388
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,460
Please watch me.

389
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,030
Why should I?

390
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Forget it.

391
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,900
Break up with Seok Jin right this instant.

392
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,170
Don't make me repeat myself.

393
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Please let me know as soon as you decide.

394
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,710
Yes, will do.

395
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,480
Thank you. Get back safely.

396
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,790
Hey, who was that?

397
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,620
A customer, who else?

398
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,330
You're not perhaps trying to sell
the Daewoon Building again, are you?

399
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
Why are you here?

400
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,200
The police came to see Mu Chul.

401
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,870
The police? So?

402
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,670
They must be reinvestigating
the fraud case.

403
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,510
When will you tell him?

404
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,510
When will you tell Mu Chul...

405
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,510
that you're the owner
of the Daewoon Building?

406
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,850
I'm thinking about it.

407
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,950
How much longer will you keep thinking?

408
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,490
You're not getting other ideas, are you?

409
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,930
Gosh, I'll deal with it myself.
Stop worrying.

410
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,670
How could I not worry, man?
Mu Chul trusts you so much.

411
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,570
We should've told him together
when the lottery ticket came up.

412
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,670
Then, it would've ended
with him getting shocked just once.

413
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,810
If he hears about...

414
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,680
the Daewoon Building now...

415
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,350
Gosh, I said I'd deal with it on my own!

416
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,420
You have to tell him.

417
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,390
Even if Mu Chul ends up shocked,
you have to tell him the truth. Got it?

418
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,820
Got it. I understand.

419
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,030
Jin Tae. You know too, don't you?
About Gyu Tae.

420
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,940
I mean the Daewoon Building.

421
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:03,310
Yes, I heard that you found out too.

422
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,480
Shouldn't he come clean now, at least?

423
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,880
What is he planning to do?

424
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,010
That's what I suggested too,

425
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,450
but it seems like
something is stopping him.

426
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,650
What?

427
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,950
What's stopping him?

428
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,320
I'm not sure either,
but he says there's something else.

429
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,360
He said he couldn't say anything
because of that.

430
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
Is that so?

431
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,500
What could it be?

432
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,430
So, Geum Ok.

433
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,040
I'm telling you out of concern.

434
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,110
Before Gyu Tae speaks up on his own,

435
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,740
don't tell anyone about this.

436
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,940
I know that my brother was wrong too,

437
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,110
but I'm sure he didn't feel greedy
from the beginning.

438
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,020
It all began
because of Min Yong's hospital bills.

439
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,390
So, my heart aches so much.

440
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,160
Please give my brother...

441
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,460
a chance to talk about it himself,
at least.

442
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,200
I implore you.

443
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,200
Okay. Don't worry.

444
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,070
Thank you.

445
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,070
Oh, wait just a minute.

446
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,170
I'll bring you
a cold glass of cinnamon punch.

447
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,570
Okay.

448
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,820
(Pregnancy Journal)

449
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,820
"Pregnancy Journal?"

450
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,490
Oh, my.

451
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,820
- What...
- A customer left it behind earlier.

452
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,420
Wait just a minute.

453
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,760
Oh, okay.

454
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,300
Yes, Mr. Jang.

455
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,030
I'm on my way there now.

456
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,070
Okay, see you there.

457
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,540
(Seoul Central District Court)

458
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,710
Hello.

459
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,680
Where should I go to cancel...

460
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,050
a death registration?

461
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,680
So, you need to apply for a correction
on your family registry document?

462
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,790
You can go to the second floor.

463
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,790
Thank you.

464
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,190
If things go well,

465
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,370
I'll become a living man again
in two months.

466
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,040
Yes, I'm almost there.

467
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,110
Okay, I'll see you soon.

468
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,850
What?

469
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,060
Jang Tae Poong.

470
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,030
Who...

471
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,200
What is going on?

472
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,830
You know who I am, don't you?

473
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,300
I'm not sure. Who are you?

474
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,010
Stop lying, Jang Tae Poong!

475
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,510
You know who I am!

476
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,160
(Good Luck!)

477
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,990
Gyu Tae.

478
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,700
Why were you so startled?

479
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,030
Is something wrong?

480
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,800
Did you perhaps run into my mom?

481
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,800
Did Seo Woo say that I told her off?

482
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,840
Why in the world did you do that?
What did Seo Woo ever do wrong?

483
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,610
I could never accept that girl, Seo Woo!

484
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,980
Over my dead body.
