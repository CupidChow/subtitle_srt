1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,270
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,580
- Gosh, Mi Ja.
- Mi Ja, are you okay?

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,910
- Oh, no.
- Mi Ja.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,680
What do we do?

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,360
What?

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,200
- My gosh.
- Hey!

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,270
- You.
- Oh, right.

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,940
Hello.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,310
This house...

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,310
Hey.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,280
What brings you here?

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,410
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,820
What about you?
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,550
Come with me, quick.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,890
- Come this way.
- Why?

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,760
- Hurry.
- Wait, I have to take this too.

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,260
- Come on, quick!
- No, wait!

18
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,600
Hey, why on earth did you go there?

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,300
Well, I just...

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,910
left the house
because I wanted to get some air,

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,680
and I wanted to go to that house
for some reason.

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,410
You wanted to go to that house?

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,150
Why?

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,720
But you know what?

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,190
That street seemed oddly familiar.

26
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,120
And so did the Daewoon Building.

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,420
The Daewoon Building?

28
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,660
Is this guy...

29
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,030
really Mu Chul?

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,100
How could he mention
the Daewoon Building, of all places?

31
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,770
What were you doing there?

32
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,410
I didn't expect to run into you there.

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,980
I saw you while walking by.

34
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,650
Oh, I see.

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,550
I thought there was something
in that neighborhood.

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,550
This is not good.

37
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,420
I should hurry up and order the DNA test
as soon as possible.

38
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,030
Did any of his hair fall on the floor?

39
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,700
What is it?

40
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,710
Well...

41
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,910
- What?
- Here.

42
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,780
You had something on your shoulder.

43
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,510
Well...

44
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,520
Here.

45
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,020
Write down your phone number.

46
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,750
My phone number? Oh, sure.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,060
Here you go. It's the landline number...

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,030
for the house where I'm staying now.

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,270
I told you, didn't I?

50
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,940
Before I confirm that you are Mu Chul,

51
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,670
you shouldn't wander around recklessly.

52
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,170
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,810
But...

54
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,750
you're the only person
I can lean on right now.

55
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,080
Confirm what you have to,

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,880
and please call me.

57
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,690
Okay, I will. You can go now.

58
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,390
Please make sure to call me!

59
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,830
Goodness, all right. Just go.

60
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,600
- Please do.
- My gosh. Go.

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,900
Okay. Please.

62
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,460
Just leave.

63
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,900
My goodness.

64
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,780
Hello?

65
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,410
You run DNA tests there, right?

66
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,480
What do we do now?

67
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,820
Are you sure
we can't move into Aunt Ji Sook's place?

68
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,160
Please say something. What will we do now?

69
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,350
Good grief.
How could something like this happen?

70
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,480
She was bragging so much about
moving into an apartment in Gangnam.

71
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,490
But now, she ended up like a stray puppy.

72
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,730
Then, what will happen to that family?

73
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,130
Do they have somewhere to go now?

74
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,560
I don't know about that.

75
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,700
If they have money,
I'm sure they'll go somewhere.

76
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,770
But now, we can't move either.

77
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,070
Gosh, what is all this?

78
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,940
I know. We even packed everything.

79
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,040
Oh, right. Didn't you say
the furniture was being delivered today?

80
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,810
Oh, you're right.

81
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,110
I should call them and push it back.

82
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,410
Boy, what a hassle.

83
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,880
Dad, I'm going to work.

84
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
I haven't gone in all morning.

85
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,690
- Okay. Thanks for helping.
- Sure.

86
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,540
What?

87
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,780
Then, does Mu Chul's family have
somewhere else to go?

88
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,220
It happened so suddenly.
I doubt they have anywhere else.

89
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,790
Hey, Dae Sik.

90
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,090
What about letting them stay
in your house?

91
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,430
I told you before.

92
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,260
I'll pay for their rent,

93
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,830
so just let Mu Chul's family live
in your current house.

94
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,870
Wouldn't they feel more comfortable,

95
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,470
living where they've always lived?

96
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,540
And would they accept that offer?

97
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,870
- What?
- Don't you know...

98
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,010
how proud Mu Chul's wife is?

99
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,310
She didn't even accept the money
that we gave her.

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,410
Even if we bring it up,

101
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,350
it's obvious she won't accept.

102
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,550
So, I couldn't even ask.

103
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,650
Well, that's true.

104
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,890
But you know, Dae Sik...

105
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Well...

106
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,790
When Mu Chul died,

107
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,360
who did you say...

108
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,800
confirmed his body?

109
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,000
Mu Chul's wife.

110
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,500
But why do you ask, all of a sudden?

111
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Oh, it's...

112
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,210
It's nothing.

113
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,010
So, should I go...

114
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,610
and talk to Mu Chul's wife?

115
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,180
You're the landlord,

116
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,420
so she might get proud in front of you,

117
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,990
but it would be different coming from me.

118
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,820
I'll try to convince her...

119
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,520
to live in your house.

120
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,130
Okay, please do that.

121
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,660
Goodness, Mu Chul must be...

122
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,700
so devastated to see this from up there.

123
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,170
His family is suffering so much.

124
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,740
If it were me, I'd be so sad and angry...

125
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,540
that I'd want to come back to life.

126
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,440
(Jackpot Chicken)

127
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,250
Should I say that someone
who looks like Mu Chul came to see me?

128
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
No.

129
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,790
If I say something
and it turns out not to be him...

130
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,690
Right. Let's not get everyone's hopes up.

131
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,290
Let's check things first.

132
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Wait a little.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,670
I'll let you know how it goes
after I go and see her.

134
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,430
All right.

135
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,910
My goodness.

136
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,650
Oh, Mr. Choi, you're here.

137
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,290
Yes, hello.

138
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,790
So, I've heard the news from Dae Sik.

139
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,590
Your move was canceled today.

140
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,890
Seo Woo, go to your room.

141
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,260
Okay.

142
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,540
That's how things turned out.

143
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,210
But why do you ask?

144
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,940
Well, before I tell you,

145
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,150
there's something I'd like to ask.

146
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,480
When Mu Chul died,

147
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,020
did you really confirm his body yourself?

148
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,460
Yes, I did.

149
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,390
Are you sure that was Mu Chul's body?

150
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,000
Did you get a DNA test done or something?

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,970
No, we didn't as it was clearly him.

152
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,800
Oh, I see.

153
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,610
But why do you ask?

154
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,280
Is it perhaps about the rite
for the 49th day of his passing?

155
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,950
Oh, the 49th day?

156
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,550
Well, I thought it must be coming up soon.

157
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,420
What do you plan on doing?

158
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,190
We're just going to hold a rite
at home as a family.

159
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,720
That sounds nice too.

160
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,920
And by the way,

161
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,160
about your move...

162
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,730
Do you perhaps have somewhere to go?

163
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,870
We'll have to find one.

164
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,470
If you have nowhere to go,

165
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,610
how about you live in this house?

166
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,140
What do you mean, this house?

167
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,650
I discussed it with Dae Sik,

168
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,150
and you know
the downstairs unit where he's living now.

169
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,290
He doesn't intend to rent it out
to someone right away,

170
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,120
and instead of leaving the unit empty,

171
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,890
he said it would be nice
if your family moved in and lived there.

172
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,660
He was going to leave it empty anyway,
so he won't charge you rent.

173
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,030
Wouldn't that be all right?

174
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,800
I mean, moving
from the main unit upstairs...

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,770
to the rental unit downstairs
must not be easy.

176
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,870
But Dae Sik is the owner
of this house now.

177
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,340
You must move out of this unit soon.

178
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,650
If not, the court might force you out,

179
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,450
and you won't have any other choice.

180
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,480
Force us out?

181
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,390
Well, what I mean is...

182
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,260
I'm sure there is no way
Dae Sik would do that.

183
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,260
We will...

184
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,560
move out by the end of the day.
That should do it, right?

185
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,100
No, that wasn't what I meant. So...

186
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,430
I'm grateful for the offer,

187
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,470
but I have no intention
of living here anymore.

188
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,100
We'll make sure to move out
by the end of the day,

189
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,770
so please leave now.

190
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,810
No, you should just live here...

191
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,980
Goodbye.

192
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,150
Gosh, why did I have to bring up
being forced out just now?

193
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,480
She seems really offended already.

194
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,990
This is really bad.

195
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
Mom.

196
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,340
Let's just live in this house.

197
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,050
We don't have anywhere to go anyway.
This is a good thing.

198
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,420
Mom, please?

199
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,990
I like this house.

200
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,650
I don't want to go anywhere else.

201
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,890
Don't you have any pride?

202
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,630
How can we move into the unit
we used to take rent from?

203
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,560
And Hye Sook used to live there at that!

204
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,860
I can't do that!

205
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,370
What? Mom. Does pride matter right now?

206
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,340
We're all left with nowhere to go.

207
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,240
Does that matter so much?

208
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,310
Whatever. You decide what to do.

209
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,730
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't think we can help you.

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Then, is there any other way
that I could take out a loan?

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,030
No, I'm sorry we couldn't help you.

212
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Still, please just take another look.

213
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,150
I've been doing business with your bank
all this time.

214
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,880
Please reconsider.

215
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,520
All right, but it won't be easy
for us to approve it.

216
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,160
But... As you can see,

217
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,190
we will definitely make a profit
in a month.

218
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,230
Sir.

219

(Trustworthy fresh produce,

220
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,240
(Office for rent)

221
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,510
Hey, you have to clear out all of this
in front of the office by today.

222
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,250
- Okay, I understand.
- Good.

223
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Welcome...

224
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,090
- Hello.
- Hey.

225
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,620
- You're here.
- Hey, there.

226
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,120
I heard you guys were working together.

227
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,290
It's nice to see you here.

228
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,060
Are you here to eat?

229
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,800
Yes, that too.

230
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,100
So, Tae Ha. Come and have a seat.

231
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
Well...

232
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,580
Just now,

233
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,280
I went to see your mother.

234
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,750
My mom?

235
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,850
You guys didn't get to move out today.

236
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,720
So, I asked her.

237
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,730
You know, that girl.

238
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,860
I asked if you guys could move
into the unit where she lives now.

239
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,430
What?

240
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,600
The unit she lives in?

241
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Yes.

242
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,640
Dae Sik seems to be planning
on keeping the unit empty.

243
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,480
But if that's the case,

244
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,310
I thought it might be better
for your family to live there instead.

245
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,910
That was why I asked your mother.

246
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,320
And what did my mom say?

247
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,420
She doesn't want to.

248
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,550
I knew it.

249
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,490
Why? Don't you like it either?

250
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,290
To be honest,

251
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,560
I'm not that happy about it. I mean,

252
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,900
it would be moving into a place
that's not as nice as my current home,

253
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,170
and it used to be my dad's friend's home.

254
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,640
I understand
why my mom doesn't like the idea.

255
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,380
Well, I get that too.

256
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,650
But as of now, it is the best solution.

257
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,350
Wherever you go, it'll cost money.

258
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,220
And you won't feel comfortable.

259
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,050
But still,

260
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,960
wouldn't it be better to stay
in your dad's friend's home?

261
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,930
So, you should try
to persuade your mother.

262
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
Tell her you think
you guys should live there.

263
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,600
Can you do that?

264
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,270
Well, okay. I'll try.

265
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,770
All right.

266
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,240
I'll assume you understood what I meant,
and I'll be going now.

267
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,710
What? Are you leaving already?
You should stay for a meal.

268
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,910
No, I'd like to, but I have plans.

269
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,850
All right, then.

270
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,150
- Oh, no.
- Is that a nail?

271
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,150
- Gosh, it stings.
- What? A nail?

272
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,230
Oh, my. I tripped.

273
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,400
- Are you okay?
- Oh, dear. I felt a sharp prick.

274
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
- A nail...
- Did a bug bite you?

275
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,000
I think I felt a sharp prick too.

276
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,300
Oh, okay. Are you all right?

277
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Yes. How about you?

278
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,340
- Yes, I'm fine. Have a good day.
- Okay.

279
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,810
Oh, okay. Goodbye.

280
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,810
All right. Bye.

281
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,580
- Get back safely.
- Will do.

282
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
What was that?

283
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,020
(The way to Buddumak)

284
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,090
Right. It's all set now.

285
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,700
I just have to check.

286
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,600
- Hey, look at that.
- Oh, my.

287
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,670
Hey, let me see it too.

288
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,670
Mom, look.

289
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,010
Wait, what's this?

290
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
Look.

291
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,340
- What could it be?
- Come on.

292
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,940
Before you died,

293
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,010
your family suffered a lot.

294
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,750
They were finally able to
escape your debt because of your death.

295
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,050
But if you just show up like this,

296
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,260
it might cause your family harm.

297
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,090
- I'm right, aren't I?
- What?

298
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,460
I had...

299
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,630
a family like that?

300
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,300
Hey, don't you know that my mom is sick?

301
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,910
It's hard enough for her
to live on her own.

302
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,780
She can't raise a little kid.
How could you bring him here?

303
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,380
I must be the only one
who considered our late brother-in-law...

304
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,880
a member of the family.

305
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,950
You can't do this, all of you!

306
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,420
What are you saying?

307
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,590
I raised that boy for seven months too.

308
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,290
You only had him for five months.

309
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,790
What? "Only?"

310
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,360
Hey, raising someone else's child
for five months is a lot.

311
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,200
I mean,
I'm not even related to that boy by blood!

312
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
How could you say that to me?

313
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,500
What do you think you're doing
in front of the child?

314
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
Oh, whatever.

315
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,040
You take him, then.

316
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,970
What are you talking about?

317
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,340
I'm telling you, I can't.

318
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,540
Then, what am I supposed to do?

319
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,350
Oh, my adorable grandbaby.

320
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,950
You're hungry, aren't you?

321
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,560
Grandma will go and make some rice.

322
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,060
It's okay.

323
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,690
What?

324
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,600
I don't eat a lot.

325
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,600
I have a small stomach,

326
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,970
so I only eat one meal a day,

327
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,830
and I play all day long.

328
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,100
My mom even scolded me for it once.

329
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,740
So, Grandma,

330
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,710
please just let me live with you.

331
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,650
What?

332
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,850
I'll run errands for you...

333
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,050
and be a good boy.

334
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,890
I won't eat a lot...

335
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,360
or whine and ask you to buy me toys.

336
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,390
So, just don't abandon me, please?

337
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,630
Oh, dear.

338
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,570
Goodness, come here.

339
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You poor thing.

340
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,240
Grandma would never abandon you.

341
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,450
I will take care of you, no matter what.

342
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,810
Let's...

343
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,150
live together until the day I die, okay?

344
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,750
Okay? Good.

345
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,450
Oh, dear.

346
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,730
That was why...

347
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,210
I wanted to protect my own family
in any way I could.

348
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,550
Gosh, why has my life...

349
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,280
gotten all tangled up?

350
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,490
Look at Daddy.

351
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,920
- Hang on. Give it to Daddy.
- Over there.

352
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,260
You did it.

353
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,770
What? Then, they weren't able to move?

354
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,170
Then what?

355
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,510
Will they not be moving
into that house now?

356
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,640
It's not that.

357
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,880
They'll just have to wait
until the other family moves out.

358
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,480
Gosh, I made time to go over
for the first time in a while.

359
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,580
What a shame. Isn't that right?

360
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,820
Still, Grandma gave us fried chicken.

361
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,590
I like Grandma's fried chicken the best.

362
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,160
Oh, this pretty thing.

363
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,700
Let me see.

364
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,870
How much money will I get this time?

365
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,770
Mr. Lee.

366
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,350
You saw the money I sent
from my Health Water sales, right?

367
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,110
Yes, I did.

368
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,850
By the way, you're a great saleswoman.

369
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,590
You flatter me.

370
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,020
Anyway, when will I get my next payment?

371
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,130
You should get it sometime this week
at the latest.

372
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,130
Then, please keep up
your great work, ma'am.

373
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,800
All right. Thank you.

374
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,070
Gosh, I shouldn't just sit here.

375
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Should I try and sell some
to Mi Jin's family too?

376
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,640
They have money now.

377
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,080
I can't know about
such a great thing by myself.

378
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
Isn't that right?

379
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,290
(Filing Receipt)

380
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,330
My goodness.

381
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,670
- Hey, Gyu Tae.
- Hey.

382
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,900
Dae Sik.

383
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,240
Did you meet with Mu Chul's wife?

384
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,110
Oh, that? She said no.

385
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,780
What?

386
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,150
I tried to talk her into it,

387
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,510
but she doesn't want to live
in your house.

388
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,620
So, does she have somewhere else to go?

389
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,290
It didn't seem like it,

390
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,050
but she was being so stubborn.

391
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,760
By the way, another thing.

392
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,330
Mu Chul's wife said...

393
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,360
that his 49th-day ceremony was coming up.

394
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
What?

395
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,440
Gosh, has it been that long already?

396
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,910
So, what will they do?

397
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,310
She said they were just going to
hold a simple rite at home,

398
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,010
but they'll need a home to move into.

399
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,540
Let's wait and see for now.

400
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,280
Also,

401
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,980
I told her to move out soon...

402
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,520
since that place is yours now.

403
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,490
If not,
she might have to face legal issues.

404
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,550
Hey, man!
Why would you say something like that?

405
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,660
It seemed like the only way
to get her to move out!

406
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,890
What else was I supposed to do?

407
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,890
Goodness, by the way,

408
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,100
if Mu Chul's wife says
she will live in your house,

409
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,560
what will you do about rent?

410
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,700
I told her...

411
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,040
that you wouldn't charge anything.

412
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,010
Of course, I shouldn't charge anything.
How could you even talk about rent?

413
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,710
Didn't you use
all of your father's inheritance...

414
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,810
on buying the house?

415
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,510
What are you planning to do?

416
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,280
Are you going to eat the house
and live in it too?

417
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,250
Stop being so generous.

418
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,350
I'll just pay for their rent instead.

419
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,020
Hey, man. Is Mu Chul a stranger?

420
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,290
Rent, my foot. Forget it.

421
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,360
I won't take your money either.

422
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,100
Punk. You know what they say.

423
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,360
Stop acting so cool.
You might freeze to death.

424
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,030
You're going to starve
while trying to act so generous, punk.

425
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,900
That will never happen,
so don't worry, man.

426
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
What?

427
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,550
Is this going to be like last time?

428
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,510
Do you want to take this outside?

429
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,400
You punk. You're scared, aren't you?

430
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,370
Deal.

431
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,430
Deal.

432
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,240
Punk.

433
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,540
My goodness.

434
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Come on.

435
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,820
Oh, my.

436
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,460
Oh, dear.

437
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,800
What are we going to do
about all of these boxes?

438
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,100
They're taking up the whole yard.

439
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,240
What is Mi Ja planning to do?
She's just holed up inside.

440
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,370
She should tell us what her plans are
so we can get going too.

441
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,140
Hang on.

442
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,840
What if they just end up staying here?

443
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,810
This won't do.
I should go and talk to her.

444
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,150
Gosh, no.

445
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,660
Her husband is gone,
and the house is in disarray.

446
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,230
I felt so bad for her earlier.
She looked like a kite sinking in the sky.

447
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Right.

448
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,460
Let's leave her alone.

449
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,740
Grandpa.

450
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,280
What?

451
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,210
What's wrong?

452
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,580
Are you not feeling well?

453
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,890
Gosh, I must've overworked myself
the past few days.

454
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,350
I think I'm coming down with a cold.

455
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,160
- Oh, dear.
- Have you had lunch?

456
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,030
Lunch doesn't matter right now.

457
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,230
I'll go and buy some medicine.

458
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,100
My goodness.

459
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,470
Just have your lunch first.

460
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,730
I...

461
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,470
made you food.

462
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,180
You cooked for me?

463
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,090
But you're feeling ill.

464
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,060
You made all this for me?

465
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,590
Goodness, it's okay.

466
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,000
It must be harder for you
to go out and work by yourself.

467
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,630
Go on and eat.

468
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,370
Okay? Eat up.

469
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,900
Oh, dear.

470
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,340
Oh, boy.

471
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
My goodness.

472
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,230
What? Then...

473
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,060
you mean Mu Chul committed suicide?

474
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,260
Things must've been so stressful...

475
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,770
since he was being chased by creditors.

476
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,170
I'm sorry.

477
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,140
I'm here to ask about a loan.

478
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,760
What are you doing now?

479
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,400
Could I have a word, please?

480
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,040
We'll move out of the house by today,
so don't you worry.

481
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,880
There's no need.

482
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,150
What did you say?

483
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,420
Actually, I had borrowed some money...

484
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,480
before Mu Chul passed away.

485
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,490
It was weighing on me
that I never got to pay him back.

486
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,960
But come to think of it,

487
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,560
I did have a chance to pay him back.

488
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,160
You know the unit that I live in now?
Why don't you...

489
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,630
live there with your family?

490
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,140
Do you expect me to believe that?

491
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,540
Whatever my dead husband did for you,

492
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,210
it has nothing to do with me now!

493
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,810
I'm Mu Chul's friend.

494
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,650
My friend's family...

495
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,080
is about to be out on the street.
I can't just sit back and watch.

496
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,120
Are you doing this
just so you can feel more at peace?

497
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,820
I'm saying I don't want to!

498
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,820
Then, tell me where you're going.

499
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,390
If you really have somewhere to go,
that is.

500
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,490
Why should I have to tell you that?

501
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,930
You don't have anywhere to go.

502
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,700
Why are you being so stubborn
when you don't have a plan?

503
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,300
What did you say?

504
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,670
What do you know to say that to me?

505
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,570
Do you think I really don't know?

506
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,040
You must think I'm a joke
since I'm a widow,

507
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,910
but I'm Lee Mi Ja!

508
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,780
I'm not the butt of your jokes!

509
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,690
None of you could say a word
when my husband was alive!

510
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,020
Why are you all doing this now?

511
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,630
Oh, my.

512
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,100
Just live here if I tell you to!

513
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,750
(Good Luck!)

514
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,150
- Do you want to go on a blind date?
- Is she pretty?

515
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,150
Don't be in pain.

516
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,060
It pains me too.

517
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,860
It must've been a big shock
since she didn't get to move out today.

518
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,960
Would you not like it
if we asked Mu Chul's family to live here?

519
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,030
What did you say?

520
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,470
