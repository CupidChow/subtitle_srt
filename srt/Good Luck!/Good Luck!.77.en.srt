Sir, are you saying...

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,220
my husband bought
a lottery ticket right here...

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,820
with the exact same numbers
he always played, even that day?

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,820
That's right.

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,820
Those exact numbers won the 1,177th draw,
so I clearly remember it.

- This way.

- Okay.
- Come on.

Yes. That's him, right?

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,780
It's him, right?

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,920
Oh, you're right. Look right there.

So, who collected the lottery prize?

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,430
No idea. I guess someone
either stumbled upon it by accident...

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
or stole the money.

Fine. Let's say he gave you that ticket.

Then, why do you get to keep
all of that money?

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,520
You should've given
at least half of the money to Mu Chul.

You were watching Mu Chul struggle too!

with your family, go ahead and tell him.

half of the prize,"

let alone 20 million, it's still a no.

is over 500 percent now.

I never said it was a bar.

the name of a bar.

what purpose you had in mind...

No way.

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,320
Gosh, not at my age. It can't be that.

132
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
Oh, my.

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,670
Sure, go ahead.

147
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,850
Do you know anything
about the lottery ticket...

148
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,750
that Mr. Kim won the lottery with?

149
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,250
A lottery ticket?

150
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,650
Mu Chul bought that lottery ticket.

151
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,490
I'm just curious how Mr. Kim ended up
receiving the winnings.

152
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,260
You know something, don't you?

153
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,200
Please tell me what happened.

154
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,930
No, I don't know about that.

155
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,270
I only just heard from you
that the lottery ticket was Mu Chul's.

156
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,870
Is that really true?

157
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,340
Yes, if you're curious,

158
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,340
you should ask Dae Sik yourself.

159
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,350
Or should I ask him for you?

160
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,380
No.

161
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,820
I went to his restaurant
but left as no one was there.

162
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,390

Oh, did you just get back
from the grocery store?

169

You bought a lot of things.

170
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,150
Did you go out?

171
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,060
I stepped out to get some air.

172
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
What?

173
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,630
You look upset. Did something happen?

174
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,100
No, nothing happened.

175
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,900
What's that?

176
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,330
Oh, this.
I got some puffed rice cakes for Dae Sik.

177
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,370
No matter how angry he gets,

178
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,280
puffed rice cakes always melt his anger.
He just loves them so much.

179
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,240
I got some so I can give them to him
when he comes over later.

181
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,250
I owe my friends a great deal,

182
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,320
so I'm really glad
you invited them over for dinner.

183
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,460
I'm really happy and grateful.

184
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:08,270
Mi Ja, you're the best!

185
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,070
It's such a hot day.
You must be exhausted.

186
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,870
Let's go inside, Mu Chul.

187
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,040
All right. Let me take that.

188
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,450
The three million dollars...

189
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,460
What if I took care of that for you?

190
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,460
Sorry?

191
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,500
But how? It is a lot of money.

192
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,670
More importantly, why would you...

193
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,600
pay off his debt for him?

194
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,970
Mu Chul really wants
to get his identity back,

195
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,470
so I want to help him.

196
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,550
We will have to look into it
to figure out the exact amount,

197
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,950
but Mu Chul and I can take turns
making the monthly payments,

198
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,790
or I could act as a joint surety for him.
I'll find a solution.

199
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,220
So, that means...

200
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,230
Hye Sook's family was the one...

201
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,700
who won the lottery?

202
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes, apparently.

203
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,540
My gosh. I knew it.

204
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,340
I wondered how he was going to
take care of such a large amount of money.

205
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,610
Hold on. How did he win the lottery
with those exact numbers?

206
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
Honey.

207
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,920
Did you buy that lottery ticket
and give it to Mr. Kim?

208
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,660
Gosh, no.

209
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,160
He said he let the machine
pick the numbers automatically.

210
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,900
I guess I didn't buy
any lottery tickets that week.

211
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:02,110
(Buddumak Korean Cuisine)

212
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,280
(Break time)

213
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,690
I followed your advice, and everything
feels much more manageable now.

214
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,260
Our sales have gone up
significantly as well.

215
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,800
See? I told you I'd save Buddumak.

216
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,730
I have to admit,
you really know what you're doing.

217
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,270
Oh, please.

218
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,770
So anyway,
your dad didn't get hurt, did he?

219
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,540
I think he's fine.

220
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,140
What about your dad? Is he okay?

221
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,840
I think he hurt his back a little,

222
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,180
but I think he's okay now.

223
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,780
Anyway, isn't it kind of fascinating
that our dads are friends?

224
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,780
It is. I didn't know before
because they didn't seem that close,

225
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,620
but these days,
they really seem like true friends.

226
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,690
Even in their old age,
they're still really good friends.

227
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,060
It's so nice to see.

228
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,700
Your dad is looking out for my family,

229
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,060
and I'm really grateful.

230
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,430
Get some rest.

231
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Well...

232
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,170
Are things going well
between you and that guy, Dong Min?

233
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,210
I'm just casually seeing him.

234
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,910
"Casually?" What does that mean?

235
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,550
He wants to date me seriously,

236
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,250
but I don't know how I feel about it.

237
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,120
I've never dated anyone before.

238
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,620
You've never dated anyone?

239
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,590
Come on. How old are you?
Don't give me such nonsense.

240
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,190
What about you?
How many relationships have you had?

241
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,960
You don't even have a girlfriend now.

242
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,930
Hey, how do you know
whether I have a girlfriend or not?

243
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,100
We spend all day together.

244
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,470
Of course, I'd know.

245
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,540
I've never seen you
get a single call from a girl.

246
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,480
What are you talking about? I have a girl.

247
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,340
- You do?
- Yes.

248
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,480
Look at my face. Do you really think
girls would leave me alone?

249
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,080
I'm staying single because I don't want
to deal with all the hassle of dating.

250
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,950
You don't even know.

251
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,120
Sure, whatever.

252
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,220
I'm sorry. We're on break now.

253
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,890
Oh, could you please give this
to your employee?

254
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,960
What is this?

255
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,900
My friend over there likes him,
so she wrote that note for him.

256
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,000
Hey, you didn't have to say that.
I told you to just give her my note.

257
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,970
I'll make sure he gets it.

258
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,140
Thank you.

259
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,710
- Let's go.
- Have a good day.

260
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,510
Oh, my. He is really handsome.

261
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,910
Girl, you sure like eye candy.

262
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,180
Hey, I called dibs on him first.

263
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,020
- Because of you...
- Let me think about this.

264
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,490
What's going on? What was that about?

265
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,890
Here. Those customers asked me
to give this to you.

266
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
What's this?

267
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,100
Oh, my. Han Tae Ha has still got it!

268
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,970
Hey, did you see that?
Girls really like me.

269
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,340
Yes, sure.

270
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,540
- All right. This is the last one.
- Okay.

271
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,350
- Well done.
- Good work, everyone.

272
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,180
- Thank you.
- Great job, Seo Woo.

273
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,250
Well done.

274
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,620
By the way, I don't see
Seok Jin or Ms. Park around.

275
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,790
Have they gone somewhere?

276
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,320
They left together earlier for a meeting.

277
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,830
They left together?

278
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,190
Yes.

279
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,600
So, I hear
your sales have been good lately.

280
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,910
Yes. We owe it all to you, sir.

281
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,880
I want to repay you, so this is my treat.

282
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
Please eat as much as you like.

283
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,350
Okay. I'm already enjoying the food a lot,
so don't worry.

284
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,180
You should eat too.

285
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,020
You haven't been eating at all
because of my dad.

286
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,090
Here, try this too.

287
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Thanks.

288
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,660
I bet you don't know this.

289
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,760
Ye Won is an only child,
so she grew up feeling lonely.

290
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,900
That's why she likes
being around people so much.

291
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,330
Once she feels someone's a keeper,

292
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,970
she falls head over heels...

293
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,810
and gives them everything.

294
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,740
Yes, I can see that.

295
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,340
I wish Ye Won would find her match soon.

296
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,180
Then I'll be able to
hand the business over to them...

297
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,610
and finally enjoy a relaxed retirement.

298
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,050
My dad's always telling me
to hurry up and find a decent match.

299
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,760
He wants to hand the company over to me
and finally start doing some fun things.

300
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,760
Then you'd better start working
on introducing your boyfriend to him.

301
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,530
Yes, I want to,

302
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,660
but it's easier said than done.

303
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,170
Why does it have to be so hard...

304
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,270
when there's a good-looking guy
right in front of you?

305
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,600
You mean, Seok Jin?

306
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,740
Why? Aren't you two each other's type?

307
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,240
Well, I...

308
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,910
I'm up for it.

309
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,980
I'd be grateful
to have a boyfriend like Seok Jin.

310
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,280
The problem is,
guys like him are hard to find.

311
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
Is that so?

312
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,220
What about you, Seok Jin?

313
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,190
Is Ye Won not your type?

314
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,160
It's not that, but...

315
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,300
Sir, the truth is...

316
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,600
- Dad, must you interrogate him like that?
- What?

317
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,830
That's enough for today.

318
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,970
Was I grilling him?

319
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,310
Sorry, my bad. I can't hold back
when I'm curious about something.

320
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,580
All right, let's eat. Eat up, Seok Jin.

321
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
Yes.

322
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,840
Thanks for today.

323
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,970
Thanks to you, we had a delicious dinner,

324
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,370
and I had such a great time.

325
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,840
My pleasure. It's nothing compared
to everything your father has done for us.

326
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,080
Can we actually talk for a minute now?

327
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,980
Oh, my mom's coming back
from her trip today,

328
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,080
so I should head in now.

329
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
Oh, really?

330
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,450
All right.

331
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,090
You should get going.
The driver's waiting.

332
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,030
Okay, I'm off.

333
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,710
Seo Woo.

334
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,320
About earlier...

335
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,260
You were in the middle of the shoot,
so I couldn't tell you. I'm sorry.

336
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,100
Hey, I actually wanted to talk to you.

337
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,970
As I mentioned in the morning,
this will keep happening.

338
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,810
Ye Won and I will have to go
to places together.

339
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,010
We have to do many things together.

340
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,180
And I'll have to see her dad
now and then, just like today.

341
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,950
If it's this hard for both of us
every single time,

342
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,480
wouldn't it be too uncomfortable?

343
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,550
What's your point?

344
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,620
I just want you...

345
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,620
to feel comfortable.

346
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,430
I know it bothers you
that my best friend is a girl,

347
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,560
but what can I do? This is how it is.

348
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,330
You know, Seok Jin...

349
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,770
Seok Jin.

350
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,240
What are you doing here?

351
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,910
Hello.

352
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,310
Then, I'll head inside first.

353
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,450
- Are you just getting home now?
- Yes.

354
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,550
Anyway, what were you doing with Seo Woo?

355
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,660
We were just talking. Let's go inside.

356
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Okay.

357
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,670
Mom's home!

358
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,780
Mom.

359
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,350
- Did you have a good trip?
- Grandma!

360
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,110
- Yes. Oh, goodness.
- You're back, Mother.

361
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,220
Ji Woo, how have you been?
Let me pick you up.

362
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,150
There we go.

363
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,420
I missed you, Grandma.

364
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,820
I missed you too.

365
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,190
Did you have a good trip?

366
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,230
Yes, I had a great time.

367
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,560
How was it? Did you have fun?

368
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,660
Yes, it was so exciting.

369
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,400
Was everything okay at home?

370
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,830
Yes, everything was fine.

371
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,600
Well, except for when Dad
went to the mountains and got lost.

372
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
What?

373
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,170
Your dad got lost in the mountains?

374
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,410
(Number One Real Estate)

375
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,850
Gosh, this punk...

376
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,690
Hey, where are you?

377
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,560
Hey, something came up, so I had to leave.

378
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm sorry.

379
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,700
It seems like you'll have to go alone.

380
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,530
You can't do this.

381
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,600
We were both invited. We should both go.

382
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,000
Sorry about this.

383
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,640
I'm busy right now, so I can't talk. Bye.

384
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,550
Should I tell him?

385
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,180
No, then I'm sure Dae Sik will say...

386
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,320
that I should spill my secret too.

387
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,990
Gosh, this punk. Why is he flaking out?

388
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,830
I'm going to tell Mu Chul
after dinner tonight.

389
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,140
About the lottery ticket.

390
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,650
You know that it's your turn next, right?

391
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,860
Gosh, this looks delicious.

392
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,530
All right.

393
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,670
Is everything ready now?

394
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,570
Mi Ja, that's all of the food, right?

395
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,110
What?

396
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,180
Mi Ja.

397
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,750
Yes? Did you say something?

398
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,990
What?

399
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,990
Is something going on?

400
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,120
Gosh, it's nothing.

401
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Oh, I forgot the liquor.

402
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I'll go outside and buy some.

403
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Okay.

404
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,910
Hello.

405
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,220
Gyu Tae said he couldn't come,
so I came alone.

406
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,690
We need to talk for a minute.

407
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,710
What?

408
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,110
That's Mi Ja and Dae Sik.

409
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,620
What?

410
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,590
What? The lottery ticket?

411
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,420
(Jackpot Chicken)

412
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,260
The lottery ticket
that you won the lottery with.

413
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,200
It was Mu Chul's ticket, wasn't it?

414
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,900
I'm asking you!
Was it my husband's ticket?

415
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
Yes.

416
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,410
It was.

417
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,380
Then, why did you tell my husband...

418
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,660
that you had bought it yourself
with automated random numbers?

419
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,830
Did you perhaps...

420
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,230
take it without my husband's knowing?

421
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,830
That's not true.

422
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,570
Then, why did you lie?

423
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,370
Why didn't you say anything all this time?

424
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,280
I was going to tell Mu Chul
about it today.

425
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,380
That lottery ticket...

426
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,180
Mu Chul gave it to me himself.

427
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,950
But I just couldn't say so...

428
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,890
once I won.

429
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,390
How am I supposed to believe that?

430
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,190
You lied that you bought it yourself
when you didn't!

431
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,660
How am I supposed to believe what you say?

432
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,200
I know it must be hard to believe,

433
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,130
but it's all true.

434
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,400
Hey! Kim Dae Sik!

435
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,040
You said we were friends.

436
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,780
That's what you said to me.

437
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,180
You're my friend...

438
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,380
as well as Mu Chul's friend.

439
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,680
You said we were all friends!

440
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,480
How could you do this to us?

441
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,790
You stole 35.7 million dollars...

442
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,790
and made a huge deal out of offering us
a mere three million...

443
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,860
as if you cared about us?

444
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,630
Is that it?

445
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,730
Is that what it was?

446
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,730
What?

447
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,210
Does Mu Chul know too?

448
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,750
The fact that
the winning lottery ticket was his.

449
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,550
Does Mu Chul know about it too?

450
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,320
The winning lottery ticket...

451
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,890
was mine?

452
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,620
(Good Luck!)

453
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,890
Dong Min wanted to see you anyway.
This is great.

454
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,890
Why does Seok Jin seem so distant?

455
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:09,560
Mom, did you perhaps change your mind
while you were on your trip?

456
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,490
My mind did change.

457
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,330
The symptoms that I described...

458
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,000
are signs of menopause, right?

459
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,630
There is another possibility too.

460
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,340
