00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,310
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,860
- What is this?
- Hey, go away!

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,760
- Go away, you jerk!
- What?

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
Go!

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,570
- Why are you doing this? Calm down!
- Go away!

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,270
- My gosh!
- Go!

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My knives.

8
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,640
Don't kill me!

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,710
Please don't kill me!

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,950
- Hey, calm down.
- Don't kill me.

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,150
- Please calm down, all right?
- Don't kill me, please.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,390
Goodness. Han Seo Woo!
Quiet down, will you?

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,390
Isn't that Seo Woo's voice? Our Seo Woo.

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,560
- What?
- What? Mom.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,730
Don't kill me!

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,400
- Please...
- What's wrong, Seo Woo?

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,800
- Mom, what's going on?
- Go away!

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,540
- What is this? Hey!
- He has a knife!

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,740
- That knife! Look.
- What's going on? A knife?

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,340
- Snatch it from him.
- Goodness.

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,940
- Careful!
- No, I was...

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,910
- Gosh, honey.
- Put the knife down.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,410
You punk!

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,710
Why, you... Drop the knife.

25
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,550
Drop it at once, you punk!

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,350
- Drop the knife!
- Please, let me...

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,690
- You little...
- My goodness. Seok Jin!

28
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,320
Honey! Come, quick!

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,020
- My gosh, Seok Jin.
- Why are you here?

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,790
What are you doing?

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,260
Seok Jin.

32
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,360
You should be in the US now.
What are you doing here?

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,370
Why are you holding that thing?

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
Oh, this...

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,040
Goodness, no.

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,270
Hey! Put that down!

37
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,680
Hey, Dae Sik.

38
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,140
Is this punk really your son?

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,180
Yes, you fool!

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
"Punk?"

41
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,680
Who are you
to call my precious son a punk?

42
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,250
What are you saying?
He's a robber holding a knife.

43
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,920
Who is a robber here?

44
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,620
You tell us, Seok Jin.
What is going on here?

45
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,890
Let me explain.

46
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,200
That guy followed me from the alley.

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
- Then he pulled out that knife and...
- My gosh!

48
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,070
No, I did not pull out the knife.

49
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,630
Hey! You didn't?

50
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,540
Then did the knife
suddenly emerge from the ground?

51
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,110
Let's hear him out.
He says it's a misunderstanding.

52
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,210
Misunderstanding, my foot!

53
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,270
That's enough.

54
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,380
Put down that broom first.

55
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,010
As if!

56
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,150
Until that knife is out of my sight,

57
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,820
I will not put this down.

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Seok Jin.

59
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,820
Yes.

60
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,230
Are we good now?

61
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,330
Let's go inside.

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,140
- Let's go inside, Seok Jin.
- Okay.

63
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,540
Go on in.

64
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,580
- Move it, you brat!
- Goodness.

65
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,210
- Go!
- My gosh!

66
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,880
- Hey!
- Oh, boy.

67
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,620
You'd better stay out of my sight!

68
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,150
Darn it.

69
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,190
Goodness. What was that commotion about
in the middle of the night?

70
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,460
Gosh, that hurts.

71
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,090
Darn it.

72
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,090
You must've been so scared, my daughter.

73
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,600
Gosh, I can't even believe this.

74
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,460
What? A misunderstanding?

75
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,800
Isn't it normal to misunderstand someone
carrying knives at night?

76
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,100
Is it normal to understand that?

77
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,300
That is true,

78
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,540
but he didn't seem like
a weirdo or anything.

79
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,510
Don't you know that normal-looking guys
are even scarier these days?

80
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,280
Hye Sook was bragging so much...

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,950
about how smart her son was.

82
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,550
What if there's something wrong
with him mentally?

83
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,050
You know how some kids go crazy
because all they do is study.

84
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,820
Can't we just kick those people out?

85
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,990
What if I run into him again
while living in the same house?

86
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,630
Hey, how can we kick them out
for a reason like that?

87
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,930
What are we? Evil landlords?

88
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,460
Whose side are you on, Tae Ha?

89
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,270
What sides? This isn't a game.

90
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,830
I'm just saying those are the facts.

91
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,070
I'm uncomfortable around that family too.
Especially, that...

92
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,840
Anyway, if anyone wants them gone,

93
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,970
I'd probably want it more than you.

94
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,510
Honey, say something.

95
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,250
Are you just going to leave
those people there like that?

96
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,320
Go to bed!

97
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,150
- Gosh, Dad!
- Honey!

98
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,690
Hang on. It's so dark.

99
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,220
- He's so mean.
- Seriously.

100
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,990
Does he have to do this
even on a day like this?

101
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,760
He's been doing this for decades,
but I still can't get used to it.

102
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,790
- What...
- Hey!

103
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,760
Hey, you stepped on my foot.

104
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,760
Sorry, I didn't know that was your foot.

105
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,470
Gosh, nothing goes right
when I get tangled up...

106
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,870
with the people in that family.

107
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,870
Dad is seriously so mean.

108
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,810
I was so scared,

109
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,310
but he didn't even ask if I was okay.

110
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,250
But I feel like
I've seen that guy somewhere.

111
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,450
Who is he?

112
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,850
What? You got an investment?

113
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,420
Yes, you know Tae Hyung,
my friend from high school.

114
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,430
Tae Hyung's father invested
five million dollars in my business.

115
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,500
So, I was able to get things started.

116
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,130
Oh, my goodness. I'm beyond grateful.

117
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,300
I'm so grateful to him.

118
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,740
You said the online shopping mall
was called Farm to Market, right?

119
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,200
What exactly is it?

120
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,240
Our shopping mall directly connects
the producers and consumers...

121
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,080
so people can receive fresh produce
in the comfort of their homes.

122
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,510
Then, the money issue is all settled.

123
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,110
Are there any other issues?

124
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,320
I don't think so,
thanks to Tae Hyung's father.

125
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,760
Then, will you live in Korea from now on?

126
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,920
Yes, I should.

127
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,190
I wanted to surprise you,

129
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,530
but things got out of hand.

130
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,660
No need to be sorry.

131
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,630
Thank you, Seok Jin.

132
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,130
We've never done anything for you,

133
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,670
but you're doing so well on your own.

134
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,270
Thank you so much.

135
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,470
You've been through a lot.

136
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,380
Don't worry about me.

137
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,410
Also,

138
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,010
I brought this knife set for you guys.

139
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,680
But you already saw it earlier.

140
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,250
Oh, I see.

141
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,390
This was what caused all that ruckus.

142
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,460
Anyway, thank you.

143
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,300
You didn't have to buy anything for us.

144
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,430
Just having you here
is the best gift for me.

145
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,670
You know that, right?

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,040
Yes, of course.

147
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,770
It feels so relaxing to be home.

148
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,170
I'm so happy too.

149
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,920
Oh, no. Your room is a mess, isn't it?

150
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,720
Just sleep like this for tonight.

151
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,820
Hang on. Let me get you some blankets.

152
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,830
Okay.

153
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,200
Oh, hey!

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,270
That guy followed me from the alley.

155
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,270
Then he pulled out that knife and...

156
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,380
She's the woman I saw at the airport.

157
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,390
Honey.

158
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,860
Honey, how do I look?

159
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,330
Aren't you cold? I'm kind of cold.

160
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,570
I have...

161
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,700
something to say to you.

162
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,170
Something to say?

163
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,510
So, you know Chief Kim at your company.

164
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,710
You said he got a loan recently, right?

165
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,650
Couldn't you do the same?
I mean, get a loan.

166
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,380
A loan? Why, all of a sudden?

167
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,790
Is something going on?

168
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,790
Well, it's about my parents' restaurant.

169
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,620
Their sales are down,

170
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,260
but the landlord wants
an extra 100,000-dollar security deposit.

171
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,930
What? A hundred thousand dollars
out of nowhere?

172
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,030
And they haven't been able to pay
their credit card bills,

173
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,630
so they were told
their property would be seized.

174
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,700
Seeing 2 people in their 60s struggle
because of money...

175
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,600
makes me so upset
that I can't even stand it.

176
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,040
Please see if you can take out a loan
through your company.

177
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,780
Well...

178
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,450
Right now, the company is...

179
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,780
It may be hard since you only joined
the company recently,

180
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,150
but consider this
as saving your one and only wife.

181
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,820
Honey.

182
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,690
Okay, I'll try talking to them.

183
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,790
- Really?
- Yes.

184
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,400
Oh, thank you, honey!

185
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,660
Thank you!

186
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Honey.

187
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,000
Shall we make a second baby tonight?

188
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,500
Well... My stomach hurts all of a sudden.

189
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,510
Hold on.

190
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,380
Gosh, but... Honey.

191
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,350
Honey, what are you doing?

192
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,680
Hey, that tickles!

193
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,020
- That tickles! Stop it!
- Hold still!

194
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,050
Good morning.

195
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,660
Oh, my. Seok Jin.

196
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,260
You must be tired.
Why didn't you sleep in?

197
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,860
Why are you up already?

198
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,260
I have to get to work.

199
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,200
I have to find an office space too.

200
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,870
I know you're busy,
but you should still eat breakfast.

201
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,870
It must've been hard for you
to take care of your meals on your own...

202
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,070
all this time.

203
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,940
Now, I will prepare your meals for you.

204
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,440
All you have to do is work hard, okay?

205
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Okay.

206
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,180
Well, I have to go now,
but could you wash this for me?

207
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,250
There's a stain,
but I'm not sure if it'll come out.

208
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,510
Oh, okay.

209
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,880
- I'll leave it to you, then.
- Okay, see you later.

210
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,520
- Take care.
- Okay. Bye!

211
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,620
He never gets any stains on his clothes.

212
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,920
What happened here?

213
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,970
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

214
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,130
What is this?

215
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,860
How could you spill that on me?

216
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,860
Wait, it wasn't my fault.

217
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,630
What?

218
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,340
The airport...

219
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,640
What should I do?

220
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,670
The only option I have left is Dad now.

221
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,680
Should I bring it up?

222
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,850
No, I doubt he'll even listen to me.

223
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,850
No.

224
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,350
I can't give up without even trying.

225
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,450
I shouldn't write off sour grapes
just like that.

226
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,860
That's right.
I should give it a shot. Yes.

227
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,670
Hey, thank you so much.
I won't forget your kindness.

228
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,840
What will you do with this?

229
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,440
- I'm just going to show it to someone.
- I see.

230
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,810
- Use it carefully.
- Okay.

231
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,810
Thanks a bunch, man.

232
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,250
Gosh, how can this machine
cost 10,000 dollars?

233
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,650
Well, in order to make money,

234
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,690
I must invest at least this much.

235
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,590
Jin Tae!

236
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,030
What?

237
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,730
This is what's called
a crypto-mining machine.

238
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,130
I'm going to present
my business plan to you.

239
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,270
Hear me out,

240
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,270
and decide whether or not
you can invest in this.

241
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,900
Hey, I'm busy. Later.

242
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,100
Come on, Jin Tae. Just hear me out.

243
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,640
- Okay?
- Ah Jin, here's the soft tofu stew.

244
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Okay.

245
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,480
Mom!

246
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,910
Oh, no!

247
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
- What is it?
- No!

248
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,550
Are you okay?

249
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,990
- Mom!
- I'm sorry!

250
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,650
Mom!

251
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,750
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,020
Gosh, no.

253
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,790
Hey! Are you crazy?

254
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,230
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
Are you all right?

256
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,970
Hey, are you okay?

257
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,370
Yes.

258
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,540
Oh, boy.
I'm glad it wasn't any worse than this.

259
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,870
You could've been badly hurt.

260
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,840
Hey, anyway,
what will you do about the machine?

261
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,180
Should we plug it in again
and try turning it on?

262
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,850
I've tried everything I could.

263
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,620
It's dead.

264
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,580
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,020
We need to talk.

266
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,320
(Buddumak)

267
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,670
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,870
I didn't mean to,

269
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,870
but I was trying to avoid the kid
in case he got hurt.

270
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,140
I'm really sorry.

271
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,010
Do you know how important
that thing is to me right now?

272
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,250
The investment of my life depends on it.

273
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,620
Do you know how hard it was
for me to get that thing?

274
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,160
Forget it. Just buy me a new one.

275
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,460
How much is a new one?

276
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,060
- Ten thousand dollars.
- What?

277
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,560
Ten thousand dollars?

278
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,300
Come on.

279
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,270
You're lying, right?

280
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,870
That's just a computer.

281
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,840
What kind of computer
costs 10,000 dollars?

282
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,510
Do you think that's your average computer?

283
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,970
That machine is
none other than a crypto...

284
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,340
You wouldn't get it even if I told you.

285
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,080
I'll message you the model number.

286
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
Buy me a new one, okay?

287
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,720
Wait a minute.

288
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,150
Is that really 10,000 dollars?

289
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,650
But wouldn't they have...

290
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,390
a cheaper one on the Internet?

291
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,960
Why don't you look it up yourself
if you don't believe me?

292
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Wait.

293
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,430
I can't afford to spend 10,000 dollars
at once right now.

294
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,000
How about I pay you back in installments?

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
For the next 24 months... No, 36 months.

296
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,040
You're making me laugh.

297
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,740
Why should I be considerate
of your situation?

298
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,550
Do you know how much I lost
because of you?

299
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,750
I don't want your excuses.
Just buy me a new one.

300
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,780
No, wait.

301
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,920
Can you please...

302
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,390
give me a small discount, at least?

303
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,090
Hey, seriously!

304
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,760
You have money.

305
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,730
I saw your bankbook.
The balance was 30,000 dollars.

306
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,130
Don't act all pitiful.

307
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,760
Just order a new one right away, okay?

308
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,340
I can't spend 10,000 dollars at once!

309
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,510
Do you know
how hard I had to work to save up?

310
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,510
I need to get a store space
to start my business with that money.

311
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,380
What the...

312
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,080
This apple skin. Who did this?

313
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,950
I threw it in the trash can. Why?

314
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,250
Don't you see this?

315
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,220
Look at all this flesh.

316
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,620
You're crazy to throw this away!

317
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,590
Goodness. Don't be so nitpicky.

318
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,730
Seo Woo can't peel an apple well
on her own yet.

319
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,830
What?

320
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,000
I am taking this.

321
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,530
- Honey.
- Dad!

322
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,470
If you want to eat fruit,

323
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,010
eat the flesh off the skin first.

324
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,880
Seriously, honey?
Are you going to be this petty?

325
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,380
Forget it. I don't want that stupid apple.

326
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,450
You brat. Take the apple skin!

327
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,520
Hey, Dad.

328
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,050
Can you spare me a minute?

329
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,390
- Why?
- Well...

330
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,220
I need to talk to you about something.

331
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,660
Why don't we sit down for a moment?

332
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,460
What is it?

333
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,800
(Crypto Mining Business Plan)

334
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,170
Dad, I want to present
my business plan to you.

335
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,670
Please have a look at this first.

336
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,240
"Crypto Mining?"

337
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,010
My gosh.
Are you planning to develop a mine?

338
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,380
Where?

339
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,080
Do they say you'll find many coins there?

340
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,380
You, ignorant woman.

341
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,750
This is a different type of mining.
Be quiet.

342
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,920
I wanted to get a mining machine
for this presentation...

343
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,920
but couldn't.

344
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,420
Dad, you know
how crypto mining works, right?

345
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,630
The computer
that finds the fake crypto blacklist...

346
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,160
more quickly and accurately than others
receives incentives.

347
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,860
You know, that saying you like.

348
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,070
"If you dig deep enough,
you might find gold."

349
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,570
It's just like that saying.

350
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,340
But I don't have to do the digging myself.

351
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,940
This computer... In other words,
the mining machine will do the work.

352
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,110
So in short,

353
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,140
you'll reap the profit
without doing any work?

354
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,980
You brat!

355
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,580
Are you seriously presenting this
as a business idea?

356
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,890
Goodness me. So, what are you getting at?

357
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,520
Dad, I'm confident that
this business will do really well.

358
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,490
The thing is, there is one problem.

359
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,760
I'm a little short on funds.

360
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,600
That said,

361
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,400
could you lend me some money?

362
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,670
About 200,000 dollars.

363
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,540
What? Did you say 200,000 dollars?

364
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,170
That brat has lost his mind.

365
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,110
Hey, Tae Ha.

366
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,680
I guarantee
that I'll pay back the principal.

367
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,580
With higher interest
than what any bank would offer you.

368
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,950
This will be the last time.
Please invest in me just once more.

369
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,020
Invest, my foot.

370
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,890
Hey, it's not like
everyone can become successful.

371
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,990
It's hard to become successful
even if you work all day and all night.

372
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,990
You just want a quick fix to everything.

373
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,100
How could you hope to become successful
when you're that lazy?

374
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,070
That's just what you think, Dad.

375
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,100
In this day and age, some people...

376
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,170
are earning money very easily.
Why don't you see that?

377
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,510
Times have changed.

378
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,510
Be quiet!

379
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,810
If I had to give you money,

380
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,940
I'd rather give the money
to a dog walking by.

381
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,550
The dog would at least wag its tail
to get treats.

382
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,650
Why would I lend my money
to a lazy slacker like you?

383
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,190
No soup for you! Dream on!

384
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,160
You fool.

385
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,990
Dad!

386
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,330
- My gosh.
- That foolish brat.

387
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,830
What? Crypto mining?

388
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,070
How could he even dream
of doing such a thing?

389
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,930
- Unbelievable.
- My goodness.

390
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,340
Tae Ha worked hard
to come up with the idea.

391
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,970
Don't be so harsh on him.

392
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,470
Do you want our son to feel discouraged?

393
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,710
He should be discouraged.

394
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,810
That fool.

395
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,250
Honey.

396
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,380
You'd better not help him.

397
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,650
It's not like
I have any money to help him out.

398
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,390
I don't even have enough
for our living expenses.

399
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,760
- Goodness.
- So what if you make so much rent money?

400
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,790
I don't even get to see that money.

401
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,000
Actually,

402
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,000
you're raising Hye Sook's rent.

403
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,800
Can you give me that money?

404
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,200
Don't make me laugh.

405
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,410
Oh, right.
Jackpot Chicken will move out soon.

406
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,040
What? Hye Sook is closing her restaurant?

407
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,040
- Why?
- How would I know?

408
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,350
They'll close the restaurant
and move out of our house too.

409
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,850
Hye Sook practically begged me for help
as if she wanted to stay,

410
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,190
no matter what.

411
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,690
Why did she suddenly decide to move out?

412
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,330
But then again, it's not easy
to suddenly come up with 100,000 dollars.

413
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,030
They're not doing well financially.

414
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,830
Don't you think
100,000 dollars is a bit much?

415
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,800
I am doing it for a reason.

416
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,870
You stay out of it.

417
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,270
Why in the world
does he need 100,000 dollars?

418
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,410
Whatever.
I'm sure he'll take care of things.

419
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,250
Anyway, what's Tae Ha going to do now?

420
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,320
<i>Don't criticize me</i>
<i>and call me a cheapskate</i>

421
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,890
<i>I still have</i>

422
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,260
<i>My youth</i>

423
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,860
<i>Wonderful</i>

424
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,200
<i>Dad's youth</i>

425
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
<i>Bravo</i>

426
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,370
<i>Bravo</i>

427
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,570
<i>Dad's life</i>

428
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,510
- Dad.
- Hey, Seok Jin.

429
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,820
What? You wanted to be a singer
when you were young?

430
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,690
Why? Are you surprised?

431
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,990
Yes, I had no idea.

432
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,160
Right, I bet.

433
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,000
I worked office jobs all my life,

434
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,500
and I'm just frying chickens here now.

435
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Seok Jin.

436
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,040
You see, in my prime,

437
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,240
whenever I picked up my guitar
and started singing,

438
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,780
I saw women lining up to see me.

439
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,780
I'm pretty good-looking, you know.

440
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,750
(Jackpot Chicken)

441
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,320
Like those kids who get scouted
on the streets by entertainment agencies.

442
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,720
Many people approached me,
saying I should be a singer.

443
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,820
Then you should've become a singer.

444
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,260
Of course, I wanted to do that.

445
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,760
But the truth is,

446
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,800
such dreams...

447
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,770
wouldn't even pay for your baby formula.

448
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,700
I have no regrets, though.

449
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,140
By giving up on that dream,

450
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,540
I was able to feed
and provide for my family.

451
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,980
But it's a little sad.

452
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,480
I thought I'd be able to do it
at least once in my life.

453
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,150
Doing the things I like all I want.

454
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,150
Dad.

455
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,090
The older I get,
the more I lose my confidence.

456
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,430
I'm getting weak, and my mind
isn't as sharp as it used to be.

457
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,460
So, I don't have the courage
to start anything new.

458
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,670
My hair turning gray,

459
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,570
my legs getting weak,

460
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,610
and not having money. It's all okay,

461
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,240
but this scares me the most.

462
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,940
That I'm not sure...

463
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,380
if I can get back up when I fall down.

464
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,390
Seok Jin, your dad has become a coward...

465
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,030
who is afraid
of not being able to protect...

466
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,460
the things he has, but you're different.

467
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,470
You have your youth and the ability
to make your dreams come true.

468
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,900
So, spread your wings
and pursue your dreams with vigor.

469
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,770
I may have no money,

470
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,080
but I can and will root for you
with all my heart.

471
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,750
You know, right?

472
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,220
I trust you more than anyone else, son.

473
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Yes.

474
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,490
I'll do my best.

475
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,690
All right.

476
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,160
<i>- Bravo</i>
- My goodness.

477
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,060
<i>Dad's life</i>

478
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,900
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

479
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,700
Did you drink?

480
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,830
Yes, I had a drink with Seok Jin.

481
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,200
He has to leave the house
early in the morning.

482
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,240
Why did you make him drink?

483
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,340
- What?
- He was already exhausted.

484
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,810
We only drank a little.

485
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:51,150
My gosh. My pretty wife.

486
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,690
I love you very much,

487
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,190
and I'm really sorry.

488
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,260
You know how I feel, right?

489
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,890
Honey.

490
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,730
I'm still with you because I know.

491
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,760
- Oh, my. This is nice.
- Come on.

492
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,770
I got to have a drink with my son
for the first time in a long while.

493
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm so happy.

494
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,570
Oh, boy.

495
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,540
That reminds me. You know
your birthday is in two days, right?

496
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,080
Goodness. Who cares about my birthday?

497
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,880
Forget it.
Don't do anything for my birthday.

498
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,610
How could I do nothing for your birthday?

499
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,780
This works out. Seok Jin is here,

500
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,050
so let's call Mi Jin too.
We should all have a meal together.

501
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,820
I haven't seen them in a while either.

502
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,890
My gosh, look at him.

503
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,260
Goodness.

504
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,500
You made it through
another long, hard day, honey.

505
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,200
You must be exhausted. Sleep tight.

506
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,700
Don't even have a dream.

507
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,610
Okay?

508
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,450
Dae Sik!

509
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,460
What is it?

510
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,230
Wait.

511
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,100
This is my house?

512
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,000
What do you think? You like it, don't you?

513
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,140
But this place looks expensive.

514
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,370
Can I really buy it with the money I have?

515
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,080
Gyu Tae.

516
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Gyu Tae?

517
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
Gyu Tae.

518
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,550
Where did he...

519
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,460
Who are you?

520
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Mom?

521
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,970
You're home.

522
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,180
My dear Dae Sik.
You're hungry, aren't you?

523
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,550
I've made you some good food.

524
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,620
Mom.

525
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,990
I'm sorry, Dae Sik.

526
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,700
I left you too soon.

527
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,170
My dear Dae Sik.

528
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,440
You grew up so well.

529
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
I promise...

530
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,450
I will make you happy from now on.

531
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,150
So, don't lose your confidence.

532
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,120
Be strong in life.

533
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,590
All right?

534
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,690
Promise.

535
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Okay.

536
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,270
I promise.

537
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Mom?

538
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,510
Mom.

539
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,550
Mom.

540
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,550
Mom!

541
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,950
Mom.

542
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,220
Mom.

543
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Mom.

544
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Mom.

545
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,240
Mom.

546
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
Mom.

547
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Mom.

548
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,590
Mom!

549
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,060
Mom.

550
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,490
Mom.

551
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,400
Hello, this is the lottery
that gives you joy.

552
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,430
I'm your host,

553
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,500
- and I will be drawing the numbers today.
- Is that the time already?

554
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,870
Today is already the 1,177th lottery...

555
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,500
- that we will be drawing.
- All right.

556
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,410
For the past eight consecutive weeks,

557
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,870
- we haven't had a winner.
- Mom, did you buy a lottery ticket?

558
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,110
- The winner will take a huge amount...
- Hang on a minute.

559
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,680
- as it has been accumulating for weeks.
- I have a good feeling today.

560
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,380
- My, it really is huge.
- I feel like I'm going to win.

561
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,480
- Really?
- Yes.

562
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
Will there be...

563
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,620
- a lucky winner today?
- Mom, if we win this,

564
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,550
- Let's watch as we hold our breaths.
- give me some money too.

565
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,590
Just about 10,000 dollars.

566
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,990
- Okay, got it. Just quiet down.
- The proceeds from the lottery...

567
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,360
help fund support programs...

568
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,930
- What's with your hand? Were you hurt?
- for those in need.

569
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,530
- Gosh, no.
- Now, the 1,177th...

570
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,430
- You have to give me money if you win.
- lottery draw...

571
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,530
- You promised me.
- will begin.

572
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,900
- Fine.
- To win,

573
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,770
regardless of the order of numbers,

574
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,540
you must get all of the numbers
on the balls.

575
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,340
Then wishing you the best of luck,

576
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,310
we will now draw the first ball.

577
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,180
Here is the first ball.

578
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,020
(The 1,177th Lottery)

579
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,920
It's a red ball. Number 20.

580
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,220
The red 20 ball.

581
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,520
- Oh, we have a 20.
- Here comes the 2nd ball.

582
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,920
- We really do!
- The second ball is...

583
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,630
Number 2. It's the pink 2 ball.

584
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,830
- This is a 2, right?
- Let's check the 3rd ball. It is...

585
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,500
- Yes. It is.
- It's blue.

586
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,630
- Mom, we already have 2 matches.
- It's the blue 11 ball.

587
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,140
Number 11.

588
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,370
And what will the fourth number be?

589
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,670
(The 1,177th Lottery)

590
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,160
(Good Luck!)

591
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,060
Do you two know each other?

592
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,660
When you leave, you have to put
everything back to its original state.

593
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,170
Han Mu Chul, that jerk.

594
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,870
I'm grateful for him, though.

595
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,330
By the way, Mu Chul...

596
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,370
There was someone else he liked.

597
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,810
- Hey.
- Oh, Mom!

598
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
