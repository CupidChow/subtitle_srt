1
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,640
The doctor and I used to date.

2
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,000
Did you use to date?

3
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,679
Tell me. Last night,
did you rekindle the old flame?

4
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,399
Why are they serving food
before the customer has arrived?

5
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
I ordered your favorite dish.

6
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,320
Son-in-law eggs, my favorite!

7
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,640
What do you want?

8
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,160
I'm trying to pursue Earn.

9
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,119
Wish me luck.

10
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,720
Did you come just to get your phone?

11
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,960
-Why?
-Just to keep me company.

12
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,799
Unless you're afraid of your own feelings.

13
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,519
Why go to all this trouble?

14
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,680
I don't want to eat with you.

15
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,959
Excuse me, Doctor.

16
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,480
I'll be the guinea pig then.

17
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,519
I can see it's inedible.

18
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,280
It's not tasty. It's bland.

19
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,720
Is it that irresistible?

20
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,880
No, it isn't.

21
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,560
Your expression says otherwise.

22
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,080
I said it's not tasty.

23
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
Don't eat any more then.

24
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
-I won't.
-Don't eat it.

25
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,880
I won't eat it.

26
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,360
I won't. I said I won't…

27
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,360
eat it.

28
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,000
It's too hard.

29
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,159
I've been working on it for ages.

30
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Gosh.

31
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,120
I've been trying for so long.

32
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,760
This piece…

33
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:18,200
-goes here.
-Gosh.

34
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,560
Let me see.

35
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Here.

36
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,640
What?

37
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,479
-It doesn't fit. How can that be pink?
-It does.

38
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,960
I told you it doesn't fit.

39
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,280
It doesn't fit.

40
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,359
Here.

41
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,599
Jigsaw puzzles?

42
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,799
Yes.

43
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,640
-For me to complete?
-Yes.

44
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,680
What's the image on it?
Do you have a pattern I can follow?

45
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,760
Do you really think I can complete them?

46
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:17,200
I can't even do one
with a pattern to follow.

47
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,159
Of course.

48
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,479
You can do it.

49
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,919
When you are done with the puzzles,

50
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,599
you will realize how meaningful
the image is to our relationship.

51
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,919
Really?

52
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,840
Yes.

53
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,920
Look, this is my dream house.

54
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,920
I dream of owning this house one day.

55
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,640
It must be expensive.

56
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,040
Doctor.

57
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:06,800
Is this our dream house?

58
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,199
I have to go.

59
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:41,959
Doctor.

60
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,959
Doctor.

61
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,719
Drive safely.

62
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,839
Sweetheart.

63
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,640
What are you doing, Lada? Focus.

64
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,400
Pull yourself together.

65
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,480
You keep falling for her.

66
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,959
Lada.

67
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,240
New lipstick?

68
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,760
It looks nice.

69
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,719
Did you hear that?

70
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,719
-I wasn't imagining it, right?
-You heard it right.

71
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,520
She remembered I like white lilies.

72
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,839
How thoughtful.

73
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:22,959
Do you like them, Lada?

74
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,599
I just bought them
because they were pretty.

75
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,560
But I'm glad you like them.

76
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,160
Are they from you?

77
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,040
Thank you.

78
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,959
Your next appointment
is in the evening, right?

79
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,520
How about we get a coffee?

80
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,880
I…

81
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,800
Give me five minutes to get ready.

82
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,439
Sure.

83
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:05,520
FRIENDS
SOS, I NEED URGENT HELP.

84
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,199
Here you go.

85
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,959
I usually see you drink black coffee.

86
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,880
Why did you order orange juice today?

87
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,479
I've reached my coffee limit for the day.

88
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,160
I only drink one cup a day.

89
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,360
I got it.

90
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:25,040
I'll remember that.

91
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,560
Could you remember my order too?

92
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,560
Iced cappuccino, not too sweet.
I'm watching my weight.

93
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,199
Iced cappuccino, not too sweet
to watch your weight?

94
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,160
What about the bubble tea
and sweet pastry you had?

95
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,079
-And what about you--
-Stop.

96
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,280
Stop yelling over my head.

97
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,079
Sit down, both of you.

98
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,439
Nice to see you, Bow, Tan.

99
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,319
I always see you two whenever I visit her.

100
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,599
Well, the three of us stick together.

101
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,920
We go everywhere as a group.

102
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,319
Bow, did you get what I ordered?

103
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,599
Hello.

104
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,079
What? An urgent case?

105
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,599
How is the patient?

106
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,520
Okay, I'll be right there.

107
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,120
You deserve an Oscar.

108
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,199
I did my part.
The rest depends on you now.

109
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,120
I have to go.

110
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,280
Okay.

111
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,800
See you.

112
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,040
It's my phone.

113
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,079
Do you need me?

114
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,000
Okay, I'll be right there.

115
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,079
Listen, I have to go too.

116
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,120
Sure, you do.

117
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:04,879
Excuse me.

118
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,000
Do dermatologists
get urgent cases every day?

119
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,119
Well…

120
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,159
Your Americano is ready.

121
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,280
I'll get it.

122
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,599
-It's fine. I'll get it.
-It's okay.

123
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,839
-It's fine. I ordered it, I'll get it.
-It's okay.

124
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,240
-Be careful.
-It's okay. I'll take it.

125
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,879
-It's fine.
-I got it.

126
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Oh, no.

127
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,399
No.

128
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,960
I'm sorry, Doctor.

129
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,120
I'm very sorry.

130
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,280
You can borrow my shirt
and give it back to me later.

131
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,919
Thank you.

132
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,879
I can do it myself.

133
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,800
That's all right.
I'm a doctor so I'll do it.

134
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,679
Have you forgotten?

135
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm also a doctor.

136
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,440
You're right.

137
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,040
You can do it then.

138
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,240
I'll wash it and return it to you.

139
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,080
Okay.

140
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,280
What's wrong with me?

141
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,280
Good morning, everyone!

142
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,280
We are here.

143
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,639
We brought a lot of snacks!

144
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,040
That's awesome.

145
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,879
Distribute them, dear.
Give some to Wang since he eats a lot.

146
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,679
-Distribute them.
-Don't go yet.

147
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,120
I haven't picked my snacks.

148
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,000
Let me choose first.

149
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,280
You need nourishment.

150
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,399
Take it.

151
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,200
Wow.

152
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,919
Bottoms up.

153
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,560
Let's share it.

154
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:32,240
Get your makeup done
while I go check around.

155
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,159
-Okay.
-You seem happy.

156
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,879
Well, something good happened.

157
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,720
I hope you won't forget me
with all the good things happening.

158
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,960
Just tell me what you want
and I'll find it for you.

159
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,600
-Really?
-Yes.

160
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,120
I don't want money or snacks.

161
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:02,679
I want a kiss as a reward.

162
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,080
Do you want it
like in the drama or real life?

163
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:17,040
Real life.

164
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,560
Wait.

165
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,280
Aren't my nails pretty?

166
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,520
Yes, they are so pretty.

167
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,480
What were you doing?

168
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
I was just teasing her.

169
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,639
I see.

170
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,960
That was a little too much.

171
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,560
Earn's still a baby.

172
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:42,159
You're definitely right.

173
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,879
-You should get changed.
-Yes, I should.

174
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,159
Be right back.

175
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,000
-She needs to change.
-All right.

176
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,120
What do I wear?

177
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,879
Earn!

178
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
Cut.

179
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,760
-Bring the first aid kit.
-Ratee.

180
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,080
-Bring it now.
-Ratee.

181
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,280
-Ratee.
-Hurry.

182
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,480
Are you hurt?

183
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,879
My leg.

184
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,800
Did you miss your cue again, Ratee?

185
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:34,480
I didn't mean to.

186
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,240
Who would expect this to happen?

187
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,840
I don't believe you. We rehearsed.

188
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,760
Were you scared of the special effects?

189
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,120
You pushed Earn.

190
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,919
How is that unintentional?

191
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
It's just bad luck.

192
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,800
I'm being accused
when I was just minding my own business.

193
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:50,800
Do you want me to show you bad luck?
I can show you.

194
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:54,360
You've hurt someone
and you don't even feel guilty.

195
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,960
Don't cross the line.

196
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,240
-Not another word.
-Or else?

197
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,840
-Or this breath will be your last.
-Bring it.

198
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,360
-Bring it.
-Come on.

199
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:02,200
-Bring it.
-Enough.

200
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,399
Whether or not it was intentional,

201
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,919
you missed the cue.

202
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,840
You've hurt your colleague,

203
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,200
but you haven't apologized to her once.

204
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,600
Sorry.

205
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:21,600
Look, isn't it a little too late
to apologize now?

206
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,919
Your apology means nothing.

207
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,439
Everything I do is wrong. Should I quit?

208
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,399
Yes.

209
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,720
Quit.

210
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,280
Nobody messes up 30 to 40 times like you.

211
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,159
Quit. Do it.

212
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,080
Suzie.

213
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:35,840
I'm fine.

214
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,720
Help her.

215
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,159
Can you get up?

216
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,760
Careful.

217
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,679
Up.

218
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,360
Are you okay?

219
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,679
-What's wrong?
-Blood.

220
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,000
Take her to the hospital immediately.

221
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,600
-Let's go.
-Suzie, take her.

222
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,120
Go, Suzie.

223
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:03,800
This is bad.

224
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,120
Move.

225
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,399
This is a disaster.

226
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:12,960
Earn.

227
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,679
Are you okay?

228
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,159
Follow me.

229
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,879
This way.

230
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,600
You can't enter. Please wait outside.

231
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,240
But I'm worried about her. Let me in.

232
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,600
Please, let us in.

233
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:29,280
I can't. It's hospital policy.

234
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,480
You must wait outside.

235
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,399
Please.

236
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,639
Doctor.

237
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,679
Stay calm. I'll take care of her.

238
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,480
We're counting on you.

239
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:40,399
This way.

240
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,720
Doctor.

241
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,720
-Prepare some suturing equipment.
-Yes, Doctor.

242
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:07,879
You will be okay.

243
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,000
I'll give you some anesthesia.
It'll hurt a bit.

244
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,000
It'll sting a bit.

245
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,600
Just a little sting.

246
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,080
Think of it as an ant bite.

247
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,840
Good job.

248
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,199
Don't cry.

249
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,600
I'll stitch you up nicely.

250
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,040
Here we go.

251
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,080
Almost done.

252
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,919
Does it still hurt?

253
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,560
A bit.

254
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,080
I want to keep getting hurt like this.

255
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:05,120
Why?

256
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,720
So you'll keep paying attention to me.

257
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,560
Wait.

258
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,080
Hey.

259
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,320
Earn, how are you feeling?

260
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:42,199
I'm better now.
I'll be running by tomorrow.

261
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,159
Doctor, will it scar?

262
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,879
If you follow my instructions, it won't.

263
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,280
Just don't go drinking at night.

264
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,280
It'll cause problems.

265
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,439
I heard that

266
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,280
you and Earn lived together
when you were abroad.

267
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:26,399
Did Earn tell you that?

268
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,480
Who do you think I heard it from?

269
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,760
Did Earn tell you
what our relationship was?

270
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:39,679
Yes.

271
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,879
She said you were friends.

272
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,320
Doctor.

273
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:11,480
Doctor.

274
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,919
I…

275
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:24,600
Engfah,

276
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,240
that was too far.

277
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,120
I never said that.

278
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:32,840
I've never told you any stories
about my time abroad.

279
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,480
Where did you get it?

280
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:37,800
Well, I…

281
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,520
I told her.

282
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,040
Okay, I went too far.

283
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,199
Are you worried about the doctor?

284
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,120
Yes.

285
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,480
Yes, she gets upset easily
and takes a long time to calm down.

286
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,879
That's why I teased her.

287
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:57,800
Engfah.

288
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:03,040
Okay, I'm sorry.

289
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,280
I won't do it again.

290
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,480
No, I mean I'll try my best
not to do it again.

291
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:10,120
Don't be mad.

292
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,520
I'm sorry.

293
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,840
Let's go home.

294
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,760
Excuse me, we're leaving.

295
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,360
I'm sorry.

296
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,360
Don't be mad. I didn't mean it.

297
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,800
How's the new cream? Any allergies?

298
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,000
No,

299
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,120
it's very smooth

300
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,080
and absorbs quickly. Not sticky at all.

301
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,679
Let me see.

302
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,800
Continue using it.

303
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:58,800
And I'll prescribe a new cream,

304
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:00,639
Retino.

305
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,919
Use them together.

306
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Thank you.

307
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,919
Excuse me, Doctor.

308
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:09,800
Go ahead.

309
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,480
Hello, Engfah.

310
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,560
Who are you eating with?

311
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,399
Earn?

312
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,439
You two have fun.
Don't make me a third wheel.

313
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,679
Okay.

314
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,800
Bye.

315
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,480
Earn just got discharged
and they're already on a date.

316
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,879
They want me there
so people don't suspect them.

317
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,520
That's Earn all right.

318
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,360
She flirts with everyone around her.

319
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,639
Hashtag charmer.

320
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:52,679
I wish you could see

321
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,040
how sweet Engfah and Earn are on set.

322
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,159
You don't know the half of it.

323
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:01,719
Real kisses, no stand-ins.

324
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,240
You don't believe me?

325
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,639
I have photos.

326
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,439
Here.

327
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,760
There are more photos and videos

328
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:28,040
if you want to see them.

329
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,959
Doctor.

330
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
What's going on?

331
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Answer me.

332
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,520
What?

333
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,080
I asked, what's going on?

334
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,760
I don't understand.

335
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,879
What are you talking about?
I don't follow.

336
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,360
Stop playing dumb.

337
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,320
Is it fun for you?

338
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,600
Do you think I'm stupid?

339
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,760
You're playing me.

340
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:12,800
What are you talking about?

341
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,639
I've never played you.

342
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,560
If you're talking about Engfah,

343
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,840
I don't have feelings for her.

344
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:27,800
You are the only one for me.

345
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:30,320
I want to build a family with you.

346
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,959
A family?

347
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,280
Really?

348
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:38,879
You got it.

349
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,840
Doctor, what are you doing?

350
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,719
Here's your family.

351
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,679
Doctor, why did you do that?

352
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,920
This puzzle

353
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,719
represents our feelings
being put back together.

354
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:15,159
Really?

355
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,480
Like old times?

356
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,719
You're right.

357
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,679
You are still the same liar
that you used to be.

358
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:30,600
You pretended to be a good person,

359
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:33,480
but then lied

360
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,040
and played with my feelings.

361
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,639
Could it be…

362
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,639
that you need money?

363
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,600
Tell me how much.

364
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,920
You can charge me for that night

365
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:53,199
or tonight.

366
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,680
Earn.

367
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Earn.

368
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Suzie.

369
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,480
I can't take it anymore. I give up.

370
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,200
I give up on her.

371
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:06,200
Calm down.

372
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,759
After the shooting finishes,

373
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,720
I'm leaving.

374
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,240
I can't stay here anymore.

375
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:20,400
Earn.

376
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:43,279
I can't do this anymore.
How could she do this to me?

377
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Earn…

378
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,160
Sweetheart.

379
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,960
Earn.

380
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,319
Earn.

381
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,160
Getting fooled again

382
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,759
is part of the learning process,

383
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:11,600
but hurting yourself again like this

384
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:14,240
makes you a fool.

385
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,839
Is she going to quit?

386
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,600
What happened, Suzie?

387
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,359
Dr. Fahlada.

388
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,880
Excuse me, I have to work.
There's no time to talk.

389
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,480
Are you afraid of me?

390
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,560
If you're afraid
and running from your problems…

391
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,160
then be on your way.

392
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,799
Say what you need to quickly.
Don't waste my time.

393
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,279
I want you and Earn to reconcile.

394
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,400
Is that quick enough?

395
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,560
It's none of your business.

396
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,000
Yes, it is. I caused your fight

397
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,880
so it's my responsibility

398
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,640
to fix it.

399
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,640
No need.

400
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,240
I don't want to see her anymore.

401
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:08,720
Then I'll court Earn for real.

402
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:11,960
Do what you want. Why tell me?

403
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,359
Why are you getting angry then?

404
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:17,960
I was serious

405
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,960
about courting Earn.

406
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,000
I did what I could.

407
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,600
But she turned me down

408
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,480
because she loved you.

409
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,880
If you doubt Earn's love for you,

410
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,359
ask yourself

411
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,359
why she wouldn't open her heart
to someone like me.

412
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,680
The reason must be
that only she loves you.

413
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,120
Dr. Fahlada.

414
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,040
Many people come into our lives,

415
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,200
but loving someone more than ourselves

416
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,319
happens only once.

417
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,560
If you let this person go,

418
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,040
you'll never find your other half.

419
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,200
I suggest

420
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,400
you think about it.

421
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:25,440
I also want to ask

422
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,720
who made you so angry
to take it out on Earn.

423
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,319
I might be the cause,

424
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,440
but if no one stoked the fire,

425
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,799
you wouldn't have acted like that.

426
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:42,640
Who is it?

427
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:45,960
This is a clear murder case.

428
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:51,759
Okay, good. Let's move to the next scene.

429
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:54,680
Okay, Ratee. You're done for today.

430
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:57,440
-Yes, I'm going home!
-Okay.

431
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:10,480
Did you know she had an affair
with a younger guy

432
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,000
who already had a girlfriend?

433
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,240
She used her status to steal him.

434
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:17,480
That's not all.

435
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,799
She got pregnant on purpose
so he would stay with her.

436
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,720
But he dumped her in the end
so she had to get an abortion.

437
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:25,520
She's a popular actress, rotten…

438
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,240
Engfah.

439
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,680
It's pitiful.

440
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,640
Backstabbing colleagues

441
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,759
and getting recorded.

442
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,120
You don't know what true friendship is.

443
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,240
What do you want?

444
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,759
Leave Earn

445
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,920
and Dr. Fahlada alone.

446
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,520
Who are you to order me?

447
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,799
That's a dumb question.

448
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,120
Didn't you hear the recording?

449
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,799
Don't you understand

450
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:58,480
that I hold the upper hand?

451
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,799
You should know that despite what happens,

452
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,759
May has enough connections

453
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,680
with directors and others in the industry

454
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:10,680
to ruin you.

455
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:13,319
You also benefit

456
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,160
from their fight.

457
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,680
What do you have against me?

458
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:19,319
I don't want dirty benefits.

459
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,880
I've cleared things up with the doctor.

460
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,720
Don't make me do it again.

461
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:26,480
Otherwise,

462
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,040
you'd better be ready to explain yourself
to May and the netizens.

463
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:21,359
I love you.

464
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,440
And I will do everything to get you back.

465
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
That's not happening,

466
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,040
Ms. Sanitada.

467
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,680
But I still want to see you every day.

468
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:35,279
That's your problem.

469
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,560
My problem is figuring out
how to get you out of my life.

470
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,200
You lost me a long time ago.

471
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,359
There hasn't been a day
I haven't thought of you.

472
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,839
Save your lies for someone else.

473
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,440
Doctor, no.

474
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,839
Doctor.

475
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,120
I'm sorry.

476
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,319
I was wrong.

477
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,839
Give me another chance.

478
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:19,120
I won't repeat the same mistake.

479
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,720
I'll love you more than ever

480
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:24,799
and never hurt you again.

481
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,319
Get out of my life

482
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,960
and don't come back.

483
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,200
Doctor.

484
00:45:50,879 --> 00:45:52,839
Come back.

485
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,040
Doctor.

486
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,879
Dad,

487
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,960
I'll shoot the ad as you wish.

488
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,759
If I pressured her,
she'd be married already.

489
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,000
You can't force someone's feelings.

490
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,720
Lada said she wouldn't
get back together with that girl.

491
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:16,720
I've wanted to do this for a long time,

492
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:19,720
but I didn't want to embarrass you
in front of others.

493
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:21,240
Are you sure

494
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:23,000
you weren't just scared?

495
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,440
Is this how you repay me

496
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,440
for saving your mom's life?

497
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,839
I love her.

498
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,359
Today, I'm reclaiming my love.

499
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:07,839
