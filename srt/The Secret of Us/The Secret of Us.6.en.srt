1
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,600
How sweet Engfah and Earn are on set.

2
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,080
Real kisses, no stand-ins.

3
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,040
Is it fun for you? You're playing me.

4
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,760
Doctor, why did you do that?

5
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,400
You played with my feelings.

6
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,120
It's my fault.

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,560
I'll fix it.

8
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,200
Say what you need to quickly.

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,560
I want you and Earn to reconcile.

10
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,600
Is that quick enough?

11
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,920
I was serious about courting Earn.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,240
But she turned me down

13
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,440
because she loved you.

14
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
I'm here.

15
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,520
May I sit with you?

16
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,400
May I?

17
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,680
Sure.

18
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,080
May I help you

19
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,680
with the puzzle?

20
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,400
That piece doesn't fit.

21
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,480
That's still not right.

22
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,040
I know.

23
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,640
I know I was wrong.

24
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,640
You can punish me

25
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,080
or

26
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,880
kiss me…

27
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,440
if you want.

28
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,480
What's so funny?

29
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
What?

30
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,160
What's so funny?

31
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,800
Is kissing me funny?

32
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No.

33
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,200
Are you really trying to make up with me?

34
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes, I'm doing my best.

35
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,960
You're so bad.

36
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,320
You're so bad at it.

37
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,920
Doctor.

38
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,080
Let's start over.

39
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,920
Will you be my girlfriend?

40
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,880
Yes.

41
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,400
My naughty girl.

42
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,480
-Good morning.
-Good morning, dear.

43
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,840
Good morning.

44
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,840
Here you go.

45
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,760
You seem different today.

46
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,440
I haven't seen you this happy in a while.

47
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,600
Come on, Dad.

48
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,200
You think I'm always grumpy

49
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,240
so me smiling is unusual to you?

50
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,560
I'm just surprised.

51
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,560
Am I not allowed to be surprised?

52
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Fine, you win.

53
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,920
-Dad.
-Yes.

54
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,200
About the ad shoot, I've changed my mind.

55
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,680
I'll shoot the ad as you wish.

56
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,760
You haven't shot the ad?

57
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
I thought you had already done it.

58
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,600
I wasn't ready before,

59
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,640
but now I am.

60
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,720
Then go ahead.

61
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,440
It's your decision.

62
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
All right.

63
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,160
Don't overwork.

64
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,720
Make time for Nu.

65
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,120
I feel bad for him.

66
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,240
He has been waiting for you.

67
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,320
Look at this stock news from the US.

68
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,080
All of them are going up.

69
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,240
Remember what I told you to buy?

70
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,440
It's gone up a lot.

71
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,960
You're right, Dad.

72
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,240
Look.

73
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,640
I'll buy it tomorrow.

74
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,760
We'll be rich.

75
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,960
Okay, deal.

76
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,840
Why did you change the subject?

77
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,120
What do you mean?

78
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,600
Oh, that.

79
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,360
I admit

80
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,320
I don't want you pressuring her about Nu.

81
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,000
If I pressured her,
she'd be married already.

82
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,320
She'd be married already.

83
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,760
She doesn't love him.

84
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,640
She has no choice.

85
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,400
Lada will be managing our hospital
one day.

86
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,360
She will need a trusted person
to support her.

87
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,520
Nu is the perfect candidate.

88
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,600
Most of all, he's a good man.

89
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,680
Those things don't matter.

90
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
You can't force someone's feelings.

91
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,960
If you keep spoiling her,

92
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,880
you will end up with a daughter-in-law.

93
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,120
I don't mind
as long as it makes her happy.

94
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,080
Did you know that

95
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,160
over 80% of office workers
suffer from office syndrome?

96
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,560
Gosh, that many?

97
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,440
How do we treat it,

98
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,040
Doctor?

99
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,520
There are many methods.

100
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
She smoothly called Fahlada "Doctor".

101
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,320
…changing the working environment,

102
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,160
exercise, or alternative
medical treatment.

103
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,480
Our hospital has a rehabilitation center

104
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,440
specifically for office syndrome

105
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,000
with state-of-the-art equipment.

106
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,400
Gosh, that sounds very interesting.

107
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,880
Can we see it?

108
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,960
Of course.

109
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,800
No, I'm not tired.

110
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,080
Their chemistry is amazing.

111
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,160
-Was my acting stiff?
-Not at all.

112
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,400
Are you serious?

113
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,920
Do you think I have time to joke around?

114
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,640
Lada said she wouldn't
get back together with that girl.

115
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,600
She said she had moved on.

116
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,400
She moved on in a circle.

117
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,800
Do you want to see if I'm right?

118
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,960
That was fast.

119
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,240
Wait for me.

120
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,880
Don't worry, we'll take care of you.

121
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,000
-All done.
-Thank you.

122
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,560
Drink this.

123
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,480
Thank you.

124
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,600
Do I look pretty?

125
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,640
Your scarf is pretty.

126
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,560
Thank you. My girlfriend gave it to me.

127
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,120
-Really?
-Yes.

128
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,120
Your ex-girlfriend

129
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,960
or your current girlfriend?

130
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,480
There's only one.

131
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,000
What?

132
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,920
May I have some water?

133
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,600
I told you.

134
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,360
Oh, no.

135
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,880
It's you,

136
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,040
Dr. Bow and Dr. Tan.

137
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,840
Are you watching the shoot?

138
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,040
Oh, yes.

139
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,200
We were passing by
and decided to take a look.

140
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,800
I see.

141
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,360
Fill us in.

142
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,440
Well, it's nothing.

143
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,160
We kind of got back together.

144
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,240
-Really?
-Really?

145
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,840
Yes.

146
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
I see.

147
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,800
Would you like some dog food?

148
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,080
What flavor do you like?

149
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,400
Liver flavor, please.

150
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,360
Lada.

151
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,560
Did you forget
how you almost didn't graduate

152
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,960
and how you almost ruined your life?

153
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,720
Did you forget all that?

154
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,800
You got super drunk from a heartbreak
just a few days ago.

155
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,360
I'm bringing it up

156
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,320
because I don't want
to see you like that again.

157
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,320
Listen, I know you worry about me,

158
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,000
-but--
-But you're repeating the same mistake.

159
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,720
You're going in circles.

160
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,400
I love her.

161
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,560
What about the past?

162
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,120
The past…

163
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,800
I've forgiven her.

164
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,280
-Do you like liver flavor?
-Yes.

165
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,600
I like beef flavor.

166
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,320
Should we practice howling?

167
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,560
Yes.

168
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,720
Keep it down.

169
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,840
Guys, I'm sorry.
I know I never learned my lesson,

170
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,520
but I love Earn.

171
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,400
I'm speechless.

172
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,440
Do what you want.

173
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,000
You've made up your mind.

174
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,600
What else can we do?

175
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,160
Good luck.

176
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,240
If you need help, let us know.

177
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,480
I want you to know

178
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,840
that you are our friend.

179
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,400
Even if we don't think it's a good idea,
we're with you.

180
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,560
Guys.

181
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,320
-Thank you.
-Sure.

182
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,280
I love you so much.

183
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,880
I know.

184
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,040
Are you done talking?

185
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,160
-Yes.
-I'll get going then.

186
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,160
See you.

187
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,400
Liver flavor, was it?

188
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,160
Yes, let's buy some now.

189
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,160
Yes.

190
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,640
You're sighing again.

191
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,120
Good thing I wasn't counting

192
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,480
or I would run out of fingers and toes.

193
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,080
I'm worried about Lada.

194
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,560
I am too, but she's chosen already.

195
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,560
It's not about that.

196
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,880
I mean,

197
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,080
it's not just that.

198
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,800
I don't want her to get hurt.

199
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,000
But I'm also worried about something else.

200
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,600
What is it?

201
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,000
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

202
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,360
-Have the commercial crew left?
-Not yet.

203
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,560
They were still working when I came up,

204
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,200
but they should be done soon.

205
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,240
Earn, are you done changing?

206
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,560
Not yet. Hold on.

207
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,280
Throw the clothes out when you're done.

208
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,160
I need to go to the bathroom.

209
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Oh, my god.

210
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,040
Doctor! What's this? You scared me.

211
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,720
What?

212
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,400
You scared me.

213
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,680
I've wanted to do this for a long time,

214
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,200
but I didn't want to embarrass you
in front of others.

215
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,120
Are you sure

216
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,000
you weren't just scared?

217
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Let's go then.

218
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,200
Go where?

219
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,160
Let's kiss in front of everyone

220
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,720
and announce

221
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,680
that we're dating.

222
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,760
Everyone.

223
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,520
No.

224
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,040
Why not?

225
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,960
-No.
-Why not?

226
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,800
I need payment first.

227
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,200
One million?

228
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,040
Two million?

229
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,080
Three million?

230
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,480
-Is that enough?
-No.

231
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,280
What?

232
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,600
Is it still not enough?

233
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,320
Can I kiss you?

234
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,120
Of course.

235
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,520
Mom.

236
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,160
Mom.

237
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,080
This

238
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
is Earn,

239
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,760
our hospital's presenter.

240
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,440
-Hello.
-Hello.

241
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,400
We just finished the shoot.

242
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,960
We'll have a short interview soon.

243
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,840
Have you eaten?

244
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,720
Let's grab some food together.

245
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
No, thank you.

246
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,960
I don't have the appetite.

247
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,320
Doctor, we're ready for the interview.

248
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,320
Okay.

249
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,720
Thank you.

250
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,080
I'll go now.

251
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,080
Okay.

252
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Let's go.

253
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,600
I'll catch up later.

254
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,320
I think I left my bag in the room.

255
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,280
-Okay, see you soon.
-Okay.

256
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,560
This way.

257
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,400
Is this how you repay me

258
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,480
for saving your mom's life?

259
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Why?

260
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,640
Are you so poor that you need to leech off

261
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
my daughter again?

262
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,400
I love her.

263
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,720
Whether you believe it or not, it's true.

264
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,880
Even if she had no money,
I'd still be with her.

265
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,760
Clever.

266
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,000
Using love

267
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
to justify betrayal.

268
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,040
I never broke my promise.

269
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,480
I did walk away from her life.

270
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,800
I stayed away for two years. You saw that.

271
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,960
Then why are you back?

272
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,440
Because you lied.

273
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,840
You said our love was impossible

274
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,720
and I had to let nature take its course

275
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,920
but that wasn't true.

276
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,320
Because as of right now, Dr. Fahlada
and Dr. Wisanu still aren't together.

277
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,640
If I had known,

278
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,840
I would have found another way
to save my mom

279
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,880
and not made that promise.

280
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,960
For that reason, today,

281
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,320
I'm reclaiming my love.

282
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,600
Here,

283
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,800
-take your medicine.
-Thank you.

284
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,640
Here.

285
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,960
Thank you.

286
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,880
I told you to rest but you kept working

287
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,880
until you got sick.

288
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,240
How stubborn of you.

289
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,680
If I hadn't worked hard,

290
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,200
our hospital
wouldn't have grown this much.

291
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,200
Or do you just want a small clinic?

292
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,840
If it means spending more time with you,

293
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,120
a small clinic is fine.

294
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,840
-Really?
-Yes.

295
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,240
I'll become a doctor

296
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,800
and help you and Dad with the hospital.

297
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,520
That way, you won't have to work hard.

298
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,040
That'd be wonderful.

299
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,880
Do you like the idea?

300
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,400
Did she pass?

301
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,800
Yes, she did!

302
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,160
You scared me.

303
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Gosh, she passed dermatology,

304
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,520
the most competitive field.

305
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,760
She's one of the top scorers.

306
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,160
Our daughter never disappoints.

307
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,160
She's amazing, like her mom.

308
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,320
Exactly, you couldn't be more right.

309
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
Come in.

310
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,800
The Celebrity Today show
wants to interview you.

311
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Sure.

312
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,880
Schedule it.

313
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,720
Yes, ma'am.

314
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,680
Are you hungry?

315
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,840
What do you want to eat?

316
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,280
I'm hungry but I want to eat at home.

317
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,240
Okay, it's your choice.

318
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,960
What's wrong?

319
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,080
Do you think

320
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,680
your mom will accept us?

321
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,000
Gosh, so that's what it's about.

322
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,640
Don't worry. It's not a big deal nowadays.

323
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,400
Mom loves me, so she'll love you too.

324
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,960
She'll understand our love.

325
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,080
Let's go.

326
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,320
Again, we have son-in-law eggs
and stir-fried glass noodles.

327
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,480
At least, we have soup too.

328
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,000
Are you sure it's edible?

329
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,560
It's your first time making it.
I don't want to die yet.

330
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,280
How dare you?

331
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Let's find out then.

332
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,560
If you die, you will die in front of me.

333
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
No.

334
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
No.

335
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm sorry.

336
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,240
I'll stop.

337
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,320
Yes.

338
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,960
Does nodding mean delicious?

339
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Nodding means I'm definitely going to die.

340
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,160
Come on, don't tease me.

341
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,600
Fine, I'll stop.

342
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,160
-I was just joking.
-Okay.

343
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,880
Earn.

344
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,240
Doctor.

345
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,440
-You're up already?
-Yes.

346
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
What are you doing?

347
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,960
Good morning.

348
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,200
Good morning.

349
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,480
I'm steaming your clothes for work.

350
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,440
But…

351
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm not going to work today.

352
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,880
What?

353
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,040
Why not? Are you skipping work?

354
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,880
No, I'm not.

355
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,880
It's just not my shift today.

356
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,280
I see.

357
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,520
Then I'll make you breakfast
after I finish steaming this dress, okay?

358
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,920
You're not going anywhere.

359
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,440
Don't be too nice.

360
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Why not?

361
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,120
Because I'll fall for you even more.

362
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,880
Doctor.

363
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,720
You're too sweet.

364
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,080
I thought doctors should avoid sugar.

365
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,960
-You're the only exception.
-Okay.

366
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,240
-The only exception.
-Really?

367
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,720
-Yes.
-Okay.

368
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,040
Are you sure?

369
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,760
MOM

370
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,120
Answer the phone.
The hospital probably needs you.

371
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,840
Answer the phone.

372
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,400
Go.

373
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,360
Hello, Mom.

374
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,760
-See you at 10:00 a.m.
-Yes.

375
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,520
Don't be late.

376
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,480
I won't. See you tomorrow.

377
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,720
See you.

378
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,560
Bye.

379
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,680
My daughter won't be tainted
by someone like you.

380
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,360
Earn.

381
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,080
We're here.

382
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,200
It's already late.
What time are you going to finish?

383
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,960
I'm not sure.

384
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:25,440
They called me urgently
because the guest got sick.

385
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,560
They asked me to fill in for them.

386
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,880
I couldn't say no.

387
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Anyway,

388
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,640
I should go.

389
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,280
Drive home safely.

390
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,080
I will.

391
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,200
Thank you for the jacket.

392
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,600
You are welcome.

393
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Bye.

394
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,000
Bye.

395
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,199
Oh, my.

396
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,760
This is great.

397
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,840
You have four months of work
booked with Engfah,

398
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,239
earning ten times more.

399
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,800
It's easy money
where you just have to show up.

400
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,719
You will be busy collecting money.

401
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,080
Suzie.

402
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,320
Can I take other jobs
not involving Engfah?

403
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,639
Why? I thought you cleared things up.

404
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,960
We did but I don't want to be
inconsiderate towards Fahlada.

405
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,440
What about me? I got you those jobs.

406
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,960
Come on, Suzie.

407
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,040
You know that
Engfah and I are just friends.

408
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,040
But the employers want
a couple vibe from us.

409
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,080
I don't want to deceive people.

410
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,159
What an angel.

411
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,520
I'm not dating a rich hospital
owner's daughter like you.

412
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,320
I can't be picky.

413
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,640
Suzie.

414
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,080
I'm sorry.

415
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,200
I promise to behave.

416
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,240
Look at me showing up today
on short notice without complaining.

417
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,120
Please. Just do me this one favor.

418
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,600
Please, Suzie.

419
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,200
If you don't agree,
I will kiss your cheek.

420
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,800
-Come here.
-Stop.

421
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,120
-Have you gone insane?
-Is that a yes?

422
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,760
-No.
-Please. I'm begging you.

423
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,160
Please.

424
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,680
I'll get you free plastic surgery.

425
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
Where?

426
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,080
At Dr. Fahlada's hospital.

427
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,680
Your skin will shine like glass

428
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,280
for life.

429
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,680
Well…

430
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,720
Doctor.

431
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,160
Are you done?

432
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,320
Why are you still here?

433
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,960
I thought you had gone home.

434
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,120
Well…

435
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,840
I was going to go home,

436
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,320
but I suddenly got sleepy.

437
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,680
It was dangerous.

438
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,320
To avoid an accident,
I decided to take a nap.

439
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,120
But it was only 7:00 p.m.

440
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,040
Were you that tired?

441
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,040
Yes.

442
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,400
I've been working hard lately.

443
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,080
I'm exhausted.

444
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,720
Are you done

445
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,840
for the day?

446
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,400
Yes.

447
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
Let's go home then.

448
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,080
I'm awake now.

449
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Yes.

450
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
Okay.

451
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Let's go.

452
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,040
Let's go home.

453
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,880
Cover up.

454
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,920
Let's go home.

455
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,320
I'm sleepy.

456
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,040
-Let's go home.
-Let's go.

457
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,680
Our daughter is all grown up.
Don't worry so much.

458
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,840
We think differently.

459
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,720
Let's stay quiet and not argue.

460
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,240
But it's her happiness.

461
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,680
They just started dating,

462
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,120
but she's already neglecting home.

463
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,800
I don't believe it's true happiness.

464
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,000
And she must take over our business.

465
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,680
I won't let her be flawed.

466
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,360
Being gay isn't a flaw.

467
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,040
For me,

468
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,000
it is.

469
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,760
No blush, please.

470
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,160
Do I look beautiful?

471
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,080
Sure, I mean, always.

472
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,720
Can I open my eyes now?

473
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Yes.

474
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,320
Your lip balm is too thick.

475
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,400
I'll wipe some off
so it doesn't leave any residue.

476
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,880
How do I look?

477
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,120
When you're this beautiful,
you make me jealous.

478
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,440
You can be jealous all you want

479
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,000
after the interview with my mom today.

480
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,600
Okay.

481
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,640
Do you have work today?

482
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,240
No,

483
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,120
I'll be home all day.
Suzie will come over to rehearse with me.

484
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,400
I see. Let's get dinner when I come back.

485
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,080
I'll ask my mom to join if she's free.

486
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,480
I want you guys to be closer.

487
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,600
Sure.

488
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,160
What?

489
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
I see.

490
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,480
Drive safely, darling.

491
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,520
I will. See you later.

492
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,040
Bye.

493
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,080
What? Her mom doesn't approve?

494
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,720
No, and I haven't told Fahlada.
I don't want to start a fight.

495
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,240
I'm sure her mom won't give up easily.

496
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,280
So that's what's going on.

497
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,840
But Dr. Fahlada isn't that submissive.

498
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,480
She won't be controlled easily.

499
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,680
I think so too.

500
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,360
It's a shame I hurt her
because I didn't realize it back then.

501
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,280
If I had believed in our love more,

502
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,080
we wouldn't have wasted all these years

503
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,920
and we wouldn't be
in this awkward situation.

504
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,480
It made you stronger.

505
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,040
Otherwise, how would you face her mom?

506
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,800
You're right.

507
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,000
Listen.

508
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,400
What do you think her mom will do?

509
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,920
I don't know.

510
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,440
All I know is…

511
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,600
she doesn't like me

512
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,880
and she'll do anything to separate us.

513
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,120
But this time,
I won't give up on our love.

514
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,960
Are you here to see Lada?

515
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,360
I'm here to see her mom

516
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,320
for an interview.

517
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,080
She wants me there

518
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,840
to promote my business as her partner.

519
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,520
I see. Businesspeople surely grab
every little opportunity they have.

520
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,920
Yes.

521
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,360
After you.

522
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,120
Are you not coming?

523
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,320
I just remembered I forgot something.

524
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,560
You go ahead.

525
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,360
You're here.

526
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,440
Yes.

527
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,000
Are you here for the interview as well?

528
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,800
Your mom didn't tell me.

529
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,560
Both of you, please head inside.
We're ready for you.

530
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,400
-Okay.
-Follow me.

531
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:49,040
Did your hospital start as a small clinic?

532
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,240
Yes.

533
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,680
Our clinic began in a small townhouse.

534
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,840
Now, it's a national hospital.

535
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,560
We worked hard to maintain high standards

536
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,400
and had a strong partnership
with Dr. Wisanu

537
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,560
who supplied us
with excellent medical equipment.

538
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,360
His support is behind our growth.

539
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,320
We grew together.

540
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,800
My company wouldn't be successful
without their support too.

541
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,440
What's next?

542
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,680
Let's hear from the future owner.

543
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,120
My job is to follow the planned policy.

544
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,920
We aim to be
a comprehensive healthcare hub.

545
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,000
No.

546
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,840
Anyone can just search our policy
on the Internet.

547
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,280
We have a more interesting
announcement for them.

548
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,640
What do you mean?

549
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,960
We bring good news

550
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,400
that will take place soon.

551
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,000
Dr. Wisanu and Dr. Fahlada

552
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,640
are getting married.

553
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,520
That's the good news.

554
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,720
Gosh, it's the best
and biggest news of the year.

555
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,880
Congratulations to you both.

556
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,760
Thank you.

557
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,120
Will you really marry me

558
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,160
when we don't love each other?

559
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,840
If that's what our parents want,

560
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,760
then I will.

561
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,000
Why are you doing this?

562
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,640
I'm not an object.
You can't treat me like one.

563
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,280
Can you even marry
the person you want to marry?

564
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,520
I'm begging you.

565
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,440
No.

566
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,400
You must marry Wisanu.

567
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,120
He's the best for you.

568
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,600
What is "best", Mom?

569
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,680
What I say is best.

570
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,600
You have no right
to question my reasoning.

571
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,720
