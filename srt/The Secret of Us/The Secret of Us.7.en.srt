1
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,280
Are you serious?

2
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,559
Do you think I have time to joke around?

3
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,616
Lada said she
wouldn't get back together with that girl.

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,160
She said she had moved on.

5
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,960
She moved on in a circle.

6
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,880
Don't be too nice.

7
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,039
Why not?

8
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,039
Because I'll fall for you even more.

9
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,895
They just started
dating but she's already neglecting home.

10
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:03,160
I don't believe it's true happiness.

11
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,720
Being gay isn't a flaw.

12
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,919
We have a more interesting
announcement for them.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,759
Dr. Wisanu and Dr. Fahlada

14
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
are getting married.

15
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,519
What deal did you make with my mom?

16
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:31,440
I honestly didn't know she would say that.

17
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Is that so?

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,760
Then why did you go along with her?

19
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Well…

20
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,679
Because I really want to marry you.

21
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,679
When did we fall in love?

22
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,640
When did I ever love you like a lover?

23
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,320
I know. I can wait for you.

24
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Nu.

25
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,400
I already have someone I love.

26
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,799
Don't waste your time with me.

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,959
But our families want us to get married.

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,720
We don't have a say in this.

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,679
Will you really marry me

30
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,880
when we don't love each other?

31
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,359
If that's what our parents want,

32
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,799
then I will.

33
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,239
But I won't.

34
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
Why are you doing this?

35
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,280
I'm not an object. You
can't treat me like one.

36
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,840
I have a heart.

37
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,359
But I'm your mom.

38
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,720
I have the right to
choose what's best for you.

39
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
No.

40
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,440
Not in this case.

41
00:03:58,519 --> 00:03:59,760
I won't accept it.

42
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,920
That's why I have to do this
because you are being stubborn.

43
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,079
Even though you know I
don't want to marry Nu,

44
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,679
you still push this on me.

45
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,320
Can you even marry the
person you want to marry?

46
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,960
Mom.

47
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,400
I'm begging you.

48
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,800
Just this once, don't tie my hands.

49
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,560
No.

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,640
You must marry Wisanu.

51
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,080
He's the best for you.

52
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,840
What decides that? What is "best", Mom?

53
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,080
What I say is best.

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,039
You have no right to question my reasoning.

55
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,200
YOU HAVE THREE NEW MESSAGES

56
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,479
CONGRATULATIONS, DOCTOR

57
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,680
SEND ME AN INVITE TO YOUR WEDDING

58
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,440
I'VE PREPARED A DRESS TO WEAR

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,840
OH, MY GOD

60
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,960
CONGRATULATIONS

61
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:30,800
CONGRATULATIONS

62
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,440
HEIRS OF TWO BIG
FAMILIES, SUPER HEARTWARMING

63
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,280
HEIRS OF TWO BIG
FAMILIES, SUPER HEARTWARMING

64
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:10,520
HEIRS OF TWO BIG
FAMILIES, SUPER HEARTWARMING

65
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:15,359
Doctor.

66
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,599
Earn.

67
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,159
You've seen the news, haven't you?

68
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,000
Sit down.

69
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Earn.

70
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,080
I didn't expect my mom to
give an interview like that.

71
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,840
Please understand,

72
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,120
I'm trying…

73
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Hey.

74
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,560
Are you tired?

75
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,799
I am.

76
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,320
I'm very tired.

77
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm here for you.

78
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,719
Thank you.

79
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,960
Thank you.

80
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:12,799
You are welcome.

81
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Come here.

82
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,679
Remove the slippers, Doctor.

83
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,199
Move your feet a bit.

84
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,240
It feels nice.

85
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,240
Don't tire yourself with my problems.

86
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:28,160
I'll never get tired
of your problems, Doctor.

87
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:33,839
Do you promise?

88
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,680
I promise.

89
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,959
Are you here to see Lada?

90
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Yes.

91
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,040
Wait.

92
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,040
I think she's with a patient.

93
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,480
It's all right. I'll
wait for her. Thank you.

94
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,480
I think you'll just be wasting your time.

95
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,120
You should arrange to
meet her another time.

96
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,680
It's okay. I'm already here.

97
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,760
I'll wait in the doctor's lounge.

98
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
All right then.

99
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,599
Nice guys really do finish last.

100
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,839
Please accept my apology.

101
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:11,400
If you are really sorry, don't do it again.

102
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,240
It might be selfish,

103
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:16,120
but I really like you.

104
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,199
Seriously?

105
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:20,319
You go ahead and say that
when you're hurting me?

106
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,560
You know I can't refuse my mom,

107
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,560
but you still do this.

108
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:39,319
Even if I had no one, we
couldn't love each other…

109
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,800
because I can't love someone like you.

110
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,839
Lada.

111
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,680
Don't you think you were too harsh on him?

112
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,959
He's not that bad.

113
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,800
Prove it to me.

114
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:29,479
He knows I don't like him,
but he still wants to marry me.

115
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,160
Maybe he thinks you'll love him eventually.

116
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,680
No way.

117
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,079
Lada, let me ask you something.

118
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,599
Do you never plan to love a man?

119
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
No.

120
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,120
I love a woman

121
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,920
and that woman is Earn.

122
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:01,719
Are you sure you are
ready for the backlash?

123
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Yes.

124
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,000
Then hold onto Earn tightly.

125
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,839
Get well soon.

126
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,240
Doctor.

127
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,120
I must apologize on Lada's behalf.

128
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,199
She might have a lot on her mind
and that's making her irritable.

129
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,640
I think she's irritated because of me.

130
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,959
You've been pushing hard lately,

131
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,839
constantly trying to win Lada over.

132
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,800
Do you really want to marry her that much?

133
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,359
Our families want us to get married.

134
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,319
Are you trying to marry her

135
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,400
just to please your family?

136
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,319
Yes.

137
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,319
Our marriage will help push
our family businesses forward.

138
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,479
But do you love Lada?

139
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,319
Honestly,

140
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:51,199
I'm starting to have doubts.

141
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:54,959
You understand business well,

142
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,359
but do you understand your own heart?

143
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,120
My own heart?

144
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,639
My heart?

145
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Yes.

146
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,720
Have you ever really asked
your heart what it wants?

147
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,399
Maybe your heart

148
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,440
wants something else.

149
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,440
So have you talked to
Lada about the wedding?

150
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,159
Not yet.

151
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,760
It's hard enough just making small talk.

152
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,120
Nu.

153
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
Ma'am.

154
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,399
I think Lada likes someone else.

155
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,639
-I also... -Nu.

156
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,760
You can't back out now.

157
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,800
I've already announced
your marriage to the media.

158
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,280
Also, our families'
businesses are at stake.

159
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,360
You must marry Lada

160
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,240
or everything will fall apart.

161
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,200
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,639
Tomorrow?

163
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Yes, there's a hospital management
training session in Pattaya tomorrow.

164
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,600
I want you to attend.

165
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,200
Why me?

166
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,600
Because you'll eventually
manage our hospital.

167
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,679
It has to be you.

168
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,720
Am I going alone?

169
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,360
Wisanu is going too.

170
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,720
So do you want me to attend the training,

171
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,919
or do you want me to go
to Pattaya with Wisanu?

172
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:21,120
Work is more important
than personal matters.

173
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Just do as I say.

174
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,840
Yes, Lada left early this
morning. She should be arriving soon.

175
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,879
Thank you very much.

176
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,776
I've arranged
for Lada's room to be next to yours.

177
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
You need to make a good impression.

178
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:48,320
I have high hopes for this trip.

179
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:49,440
Yes.

180
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,760
I will do my best.

181
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:55,919
Goodbye.

182
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,800
Hello, Doctor.

183
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Hello.

184
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,679
What are you doing here?

185
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Where…

186
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:23,240
Where's Lada?

187
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,440
Hold up.

188
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,399
What did you say?

189
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:34,919
You want me to attend the
training instead of you?

190
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,360
Yes.

191
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,120
-In Pattaya? -Yes.

192
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,320
With Dr. Wisanu?

193
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,040
Are you crazy?

194
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,840
Your mom will kill me.

195
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,080
If you don't go, you don't get to drink it.

196
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,560
-Tan. -What?

197
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,399
Friends help each other out, right?

198
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,720
Yes.

199
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,159
Only bad friends don't help each other out.

200
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,800
Are you going or not?

201
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:03,919
If not, I'll get a notebook to
put your name on the blacklist.

202
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,720
Shut up.

203
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,120
-Hey. -Help a friend out.

204
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,919
I'll go get the notebook.

205
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,040
Stop.

206
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,360
Will you help me or not?

207
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,280
No, I don't want to go.

208
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,720
You asked about Lada the
moment you saw my face.

209
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:27,360
I feel a little neglected.

210
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,399
Lada is busy today

211
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,720
so she sent me instead.

212
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
I see.

213
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,600
This case is very important.
Please take care of it.

214
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Sure.

215
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,040
Lada?

216
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,760
Mom.

217
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,439
You didn't go to the training?

218
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,399
I had an urgent case this morning.

219
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,080
Then who is attending the training?

220
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,560
I sent Tan.

221
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
What?

222
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,040
Tan took the management class with me.

223
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,879
He's reliable.

224
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,520
It was a very important case.

225
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,720
You said work is more important

226
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,399
than personal matters, didn't you?

227
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,960
-So you sent Tan instead? -Yes.

228
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,399
That's sneaky.

229
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,399
Won't your mom be mad?

230
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,159
I don't know. I just did it smoothly.

231
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,040
She can't say much.

232
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:52,280
-Doctor. -Yes.

233
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,960
If you found out your mom did something
behind your back without telling you,

234
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,720
would you be mad at her?

235
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,120
I don't know.

236
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,040
Why do you ask?

237
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,520
I'm just asking.

238
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,399
Let's stop talking about other people.

239
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:15,720
I'm hungry.

240
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,399
Let's find something to eat.

241
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:21,040
Okay, I'll cook for you.

242
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,320
What, Doctor?

243
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:29,919
Aren't you hungry? I
was going to cook for you.

244
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,159
When I said I was hungry,

245
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,200
I meant I was hungry for you.

246
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,040
I want you more.

247
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,520
Who taught you that line?

248
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:48,520
Did you not like it?

249
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,960
Really?

250
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,879
Did you not like it?

251
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,879
Tan taught it to me.

252
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,280
He said you would like it.

253
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,280
He said it would seduce…

254
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,120
I shouldn't have listened.

255
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,800
Let me go cook for you, Doctor.

256
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,760
That was weird.

257
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,919
Darn it, Tan.

258
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,200
I shouldn't have listened to him.

259
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,399
You understand business well,

260
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,120
but do you understand your own heart?

261
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,679
Have you ever really asked
your heart what it wants?

262
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:38,639
Maybe your heart

263
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,639
wants something else.

264
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,080
What got you drinking alone like this?

265
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,560
I'm thinking about what you said.

266
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:10,439
Did my words bother you that much?

267
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,199
I've never asked myself what I wanted.

268
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,960
All this time,

269
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,760
I must have been a robot.

270
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:47,080
What did your heart say?

271
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,159
I don't know. For now,
I'm just forming hypotheses.

272
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,040
It will take time

273
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,120
to figure out

274
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,919
what my heart truly wants.

275
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,080
It's complicated, isn't it?

276
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,800
Or maybe…

277
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:13,760
you could help me figure it out.

278
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,639
How?

279
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,120
I want to be with you like this every day.

280
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,720
I want you to be the last
person I see before I sleep

281
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,199
and the first person I see when I wake up.

282
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,679
Would that be good?

283
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,199
I'd be tired every day.

284
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,879
Let's find a day

285
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,080
to go on a trip together.

286
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,720
Sure, where should we go?

287
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,080
How about…

288
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,840
Italy?

289
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:45,800
I want to take you on
a boat ride in Venice.

290
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,000
We could get on a boat

291
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:53,399
and float away,

292
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,159
float away…

293
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,439
float…

294
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,159
No!

295
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,520
Help, Doctor!

296
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
How can you sit there and work so calmly?

297
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,000
Why shouldn't I be able to work?

298
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,800
Our daughter is back with that girl again.

299
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,240
As she should be.

300
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,800
No, she shouldn't.

301
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,480
Honestly, they would have
been together years ago

302
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,520
if you hadn't interfered

303
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,159
and broken them up.

304
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
You knew?

305
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,240
Of course, I know everything.

306
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,560
You instigated things

307
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,480
and threatened that girl,

308
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,399
forcing her to leave our daughter.

309
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,159
Then you manipulated our daughter,
making them misunderstand each other,

310
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:46,679
without caring how much it would hurt Lada.

311
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,520
But I did it because I meant well.

312
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,600
No, you were selfish.

313
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:52,919
All this time, I didn't say anything

314
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,600
because I knew you wouldn't listen.

315
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,120
People like you only realize
your mistakes when it's too late.

316
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,600
You instigated things

317
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,959
and threatened that girl,

318
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,199
forcing her to leave our daughter.

319
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,839
Then you manipulated our
daughter, making them misunderstand each other.

320
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:32,959
There's a patient
suffering from a critical brain tumor.

321
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,720
Who is this person?

322
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,800
She's…

323
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,760
the mom of my junior.

324
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,360
Is this junior so important to you
that you had to call me from over there?

325
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,360
I met someone. We're done.

326
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,760
I don't like women. I like men.

327
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,760
I like men.

328
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,399
Do you understand?

329
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,040
Earn, don't leave.

330
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,919
Earn.

331
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:07,639
Earn!

332
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,959
No.

333
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:21,679
It's Earn.

334
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,840
-Earn's here. -Lada.

335
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:27,000
Earn.

336
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:28,879
Lada.

337
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:32,320
Mom?

338
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,679
Have you been drinking?

339
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,679
Mom.

340
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,240
Why are you so drunk?

341
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,720
Mom.

342
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
I can't take it anymore.

343
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,439
Lada.

344
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,000
Mom.

345
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,919
Mom.

346
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,240
I can't take it anymore.

347
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,600
Mom.

348
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,879
When I visited her mom…

349
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,879
I saw her with another man.

350
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,719
They looked very close.

351
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,280
He must be her new boyfriend.

352
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,959
She probably just used
us to get her mom treated.

353
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,520
Now that her mom has been treated,

354
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,800
you have no use for her.

355
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,879
That's why she dumped you.

356
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,520
Mom, how could she leave me?

357
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,120
You still have me.

358
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,439
It's okay if she doesn't love you.

359
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:19,879
Because I still love you.

360
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,800
Mom.

361
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,639
Is Lada home?

362
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,279
Yes, she arrived a while back.

363
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,799
She wouldn't say a word then she
walked into her room with a serious face.

364
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,400
Lada, what are you doing?

365
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,199
I'm moving in with Earn.

366
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:29,480
Why?

367
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,679
This morning, I went to see Dad.

368
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,759
I heard everything.

369
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,560
You broke us up.

370
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,120
You saw how much I was hurting,

371
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,159
but you still let me suffer for years.

372
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,000
Is this your love for me?

373
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:03,560
Do you still see me as your daughter?

374
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,040
Lada.

375
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,960
Lada.

376
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,120
Lada.

377
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,520
Lada.

378
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:24,720
Lada, hear me out.

379
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,560
That's not what happened.

380
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,160
Then what happened?

381
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,759
I did it because I loved you
and wanted the best for you.

382
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,799
Really?

383
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:43,880
You wanted the best for me
by causing me pain and sadness?

384
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,560
That's not love or care.

385
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,720
But what you chose

386
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:55,880
was wrong.

387
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,560
Is that so?

388
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,520
All this time, I've done what you wanted.

389
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,040
I did whatever you
thought was right for me.

390
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,319
You wanted me to become a doctor so I did.

391
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,880
Whatever you asked of me, I did it for you.

392
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:19,520
But have you ever realized

393
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,920
that I was never happy?

394
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,000
Not a single day.

395
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,279
From now on, I'll choose
what you think is wrong.

396
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,440
I choose to love Earn.

397
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,279
Earn will be the most
important person in my life.

398
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,520
Where are you going?

399
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Lada?

400
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Doctor.

401
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:11,520
What happened?

402
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,480
I know the truth.

403
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,200
My mom knew how much I was hurting,

404
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,359
but she still chose to hurt me…

405
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,040
and you.

406
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,799
I don't understand why she did that.

407
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,799
I'm sorry.

408
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,920
I'm sorry.

409
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,359
I'm sorry.

410
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,839
It's okay.

411
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm sorry.

412
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:38,560
I know now how much you
were hurting. I'm sorry.

413
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
I'm sorry.

414
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,759
It's all my fault.

415
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,680
Doctor, listen to me.

416
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,920
Don't blame yourself.

417
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,560
I was never angry with you.

418
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,520
Just being with you

419
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,640
makes me so happy.

420
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,520
Truly happy.

421
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:17,040
The happiest.

422
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,759
From now on, I won't let anyone
sabotage our relationship again.

423
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,759
But Doctor,

424
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,400
are you sure you want to do this?

425
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,560
This time, I'll follow my heart.

426
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,799
What about…

427
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,560
your job at the hospital?

428
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,680
What are you going to do about that?

429
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,480
Gosh, the lighting is perfect.

430
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,319
Ratee, did you hear? Dr. Fahlada
has resigned from the hospital.

431
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,880
What? How do you know?
Where did you hear that?

432
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,040
Did she quit her own hospital?

433
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,440
I just called to book a facial
treatment at the hospital.

434
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,359
They told me Dr. Fahlada resigned.

435
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,640
Why would she resign? Didn't
they announce her wedding?

436
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,720
I don't know.

437
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:22,680
Is it because of love?

438
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,760
Did she resign because she
doesn't want to get married?

439
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,960
I can't believe someone like
Dr. Fahlada would do anything for love,

440
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,520
for Earn.

441
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,360
Who's going to do my facial treatments now?

442
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,359
You must be heartbroken.

443
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,640
Yes, I am.

444
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
I lost before the battle even started.

445
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,520
They love each other so much.
Who can compete with that?

446
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,759
I can't believe

447
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,880
this is our last supper

448
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,240
together.

449
00:43:21,759 --> 00:43:24,240
We won't have moments
like this anymore, will we?

450
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:30,600
Don't be so dramatic.

451
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,400
I'm not dying.

452
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,839
If you want to have a meal,
we'll meet outside the hospital.

453
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:44,400
It's just hard to accept.

454
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,080
Are you sure about this?

455
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,240
You can still change your mind.

456
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,400
Yes.

457
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,560
Yes.

458
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:01,160
I've made my decision.

459
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:04,839
Not only am I resigning,

460
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,759
but I'm also cutting ties with
everything related to this hospital.

461
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,200
So you're leaving with nothing?

462
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,720
Yes.

463
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:18,680
I want to start fresh

464
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,920
and rely on

465
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,120
my own abilities.

466
00:44:26,879 --> 00:44:29,040
Why go to such lengths

467
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,799
and leave everything behind?

468
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:37,960
I can't work with my mom anymore.

469
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,920
If you need anything, just let me know.

470
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,319
All right?

471
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,160
Thanks, Tan.

472
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,560
We're friends, no matter what.

473
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:17,879
Doctor.

474
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:21,720
Can't you stay?

475
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:24,960
Come here.

476
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,240
Don't cry, Ros.

477
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,879
I'll become a doctor

478
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:46,640
and help you and Dad with the hospital.

479
00:45:47,279 --> 00:45:49,520
That way, you won't have to work hard.

480
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,279
Do you think you are still a baby?

481
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,400
Don't be sad.

482
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,839
Her life belongs to her.

483
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,600
We don't own her.

484
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,440
Let her walk the path she wants.

485
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,480
But I can't accept it.

486
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,080
I can't.

487
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,879
Lada is the seed I've nurtured since birth.

488
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,440
I sent her to learn how
to be a doctor from you,

489
00:46:48,279 --> 00:46:49,799
instilled good values in her,

490
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,200
made her a dedicated doctor who wants
to save as many lives as possible…

491
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,759
even if there's only a
1% chance of survival.

492
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,120
I raised Lada to be a great manager.

493
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,720
A leader, better than any other.

494
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,160
But everything is ruined.

495
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,920
Because of that girl.

496
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:30,920
How can women love each other?

497
00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:33,759
How?

498
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,080
How can they truly love each other?

499
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,879
They can't build a good family.

500
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,040
It's impossible and you know it.

501
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,279
I know you're sad.

502
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,040
But it's probably
hurting Lada just as much.

503
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,160
I want to talk to her.

504
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,520
I've never even spanked her.

505
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,160
But I hurt her.

506
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,839
I've never even spanked her.

507
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,400
I've never spanked her.

508
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,000
I hurt her.

509
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,240
You know I've never spanked her.

510
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,040
Honey.

511
00:48:47,879 --> 00:48:48,879
Honey.

512
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,160
Honey.

513
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:53,440
Honey.

514
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
Honey.

515
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,560
Honey.

516
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
Honey.

517
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,839
Do you want to reconcile with your mom?

518
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,160
I've done enough for her in this life.

519
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,240
If that's your decision,

520
00:49:34,759 --> 00:49:36,920
I'll respect it and stand by your side.

521
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,839
Why didn't she tell me she was sick?

522
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,000
She probably didn't want you to worry.

523
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,839
You know how she is.

524
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,799
Doctor.

525
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,960
Should we take a break
from each other for a while?

526
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:31,359
