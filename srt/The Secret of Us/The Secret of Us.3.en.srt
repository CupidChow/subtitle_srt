1
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,920
Are you thinking of that brat?

2
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,520
You've been frustrated
ever since you ran into her.

3
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,720
I don't want to be like this.

4
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,119
Do you want it to stop?

5
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,080
Do you know how to help me?

6
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,280
Yes.

7
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,160
But I'll need your cooperation.

8
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,720
I know you hate me.

9
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,199
That's right. I hate you so much.

10
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,199
Earn, watch out!

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I still love you.

12
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,880
Love? How dare you use that word?

13
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,840
It's true. I love you.

14
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,359
And I will do everything to get you back.

15
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,799
That's not happening,

16
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,440
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT

17
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,160
Gosh, this dish is delicious.

18
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,400
-You're right.
-Yes.

19
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,560
Lada.

20
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,120
Here, enjoy eating.

21
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:31,519
She's not enjoying it.

22
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:34,680
You got jealous, didn't you?

23
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,720
That's why you're grumpy.

24
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,440
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,120
Don't play dumb.

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,480
Don't you realize

27
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,959
that you've been acting this way

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
since you saw your ex with that actress?

29
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
You're wrong.

30
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,040
Whatever.

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,679
Say whatever you want.

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
You can lie to us,

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,160
but not to yourself.

34
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,799
Your actions say it all.

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,079
Listen, you don't have to say everything

36
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,920
on your mind.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,120
She knows how she feels.

38
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,280
I'm fine.

39
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:11,560
It's her business who she's with.
Why should I care?

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,880
Okay, fine. You don't have to care.

41
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,720
I'm just being nosy.

42
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,840
Look, we hardly get to enjoy a meal
outside the hospital.

43
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,840
I didn't get to eat a free omakase.

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,399
Hey, this meal is free too

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,239
since Lada will be paying.

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,160
Let's eat then.

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,079
I'm happy now.

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,799
-Let's dig in.
-This looks delicious.

49
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,119
It's a free meal.

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,959
-I'm enjoying it now.
-So am I.

51
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,239
You're drenched in sweat.

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,239
You're sweating.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,240
How cute.

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,240
Oh, my.

55
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,599
Thank you, Engfah.

56
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
I'll do it myself.

57
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:37,599
All right.

58
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,760
-Engfah.
-Yes.

59
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,520
Can I ask you something?

60
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,640
What is it? Why so serious?

61
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,520
Be honest with me.

62
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
You like women, don't you?

63
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,159
Why do you ask?

64
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm just curious.

65
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,039
Yes.

66
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,680
I like women.

67
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,719
I see.

68
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,280
Wait.

69
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,640
I'm not done talking.

70
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,599
What?

71
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,680
What would you say if I told you

72
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,000
I had a crush on you?

73
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,239
Lada, you have to be okay.

74
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,640
You're okay.

75
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:49,520
Good.

76
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,200
Doctor, the first patient is here.

77
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
Let her in.

78
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,560
Hello, Doctor.

79
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,520
Not okay.

80
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,880
What did you say?

81
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
Please wait outside.

82
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,719
I'll handle this patient myself.

83
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,080
Okay.

84
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,799
Sure, Doctor.

85
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,520
I bought you some Banoffee pie.

86
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,040
I can't hear them from here.

87
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,040
Let's ask Dr. Bow and Dr. Tan for help.

88
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:24,319
You don't like Banoffee anymore?

89
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,600
I stopped liking it two years ago.

90
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,160
Please leave.

91
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,160
I know you don't want to see me,

92
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,760
but I still want to see you every day.

93
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,360
That's your problem.

94
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,880
My problem is figuring out
how to get you out of my life.

95
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,400
No, I won't--

96
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,439
I'm in love with someone else.

97
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,400
And I'll be marrying that person soon.

98
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,199
Are you talking about

99
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,120
Dr. Wisanu?

100
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,920
How do you know?

101
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,760
I saw his interview on television

102
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,720
the other day.

103
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,120
But I heard…

104
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,800
you don't like him.

105
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,560
He's still trying to win you over.

106
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,760
Should I kiss him

107
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,560
to prove it to you?

108
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,000
Do it.

109
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,160
I'd like to see

110
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,280
if you can kiss a man.

111
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,000
WISANU

112
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,600
It looks like I'll be
doing more than kissing.

113
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,040
Hello, Nu.

114
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,160
I was just thinking of you.

115
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,120
What did you say?

116
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,520
You're coming to see me?

117
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,839
Sure.

118
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,880
Hurry over.

119
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,400
I miss you.

120
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,000
PLASTIC SURGERY DEPARTMENT

121
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:20,480
PLASTIC SURGERY DEPARTMENT

122
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:00,480
Hello, Nu.

123
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,400
Just now?

124
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,480
No, I didn't say that.

125
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,160
You must have misheard.

126
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:11,640
I said I missed Taohu.

127
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:12,760
I want to play…

128
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,800
Okay.

129
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,719
Yes.

130
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,199
Dr. Fahlada.

131
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,439
Come to the second floor for Case 001.

132
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,640
Urgent, Dr. Fahlada,
come to the second floor for Case 001.

133
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,640
Nu, I have an urgent case.

134
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:37,280
Looks like we won't be able
to meet today. Talk later.

135
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,160
Hey, Lada, don't you think
you went too far?

136
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,599
She looked like she was crying.

137
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
Stop exaggerating.

138
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,920
She wasn't crying, just tearing up a bit.

139
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,480
You can't measure someone's sadness
by the number of tears.

140
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,920
I could tell she was deeply hurt
by looking at her face.

141
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:04,079
This is nothing compared
to what she did to me.

142
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,439
Yes.

143
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,680
You weren't there when Lada was suffering
because of her. You wouldn't get it.

144
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,040
All right.

145
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,880
I don't know. As a fellow woman,
I just feel sorry for her.

146
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,680
It's her fault for coming back.

147
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,439
Hey, Lada.

148
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,439
Are your feelings coming back?

149
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
No.

150
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,280
Good. That's my Fahlada.

151
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,599
Have you considered
that she might harm herself? What then?

152
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,920
No way.

153
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,920
Someone who loves themselves that much

154
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
would never think of harming themselves.

155
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,880
They can only hurt others. Trust me.

156
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,920
-But I think--
-Gosh, come on, Bow.

157
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,400
Whose side are you on?

158
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,599
Don't make Lada falter.

159
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,839
She's trying to be strong.

160
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,680
I was asking out of curiosity,

161
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,240
but if you both are sure, then fine.

162
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,560
I just hope she can move on quickly.

163
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,880
Dr. Bow, the ER department called.

164
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,560
I've been gone for a few minutes.

165
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,599
A woman has been hit by a car
in front of the hospital.

166
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,079
Really?

167
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,839
Where are you going?

168
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,760
Let's go.

169
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,199
Where is the patient who got hit by a car?

170
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,040
This way, Doctor.

171
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:06,160
Earn.

172
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,880
Let me treat your wound.

173
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,079
Where does it hurt?

174
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,079
Dr. Fahlada,

175
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,240
I'm the ER doctor.

176
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:23,560
Did you forget that's my specialization?

177
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,040
Please leave.

178
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,599
Your dermatology department
is on that side.

179
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,599
-Yes.
-How are you feeling?

180
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,920
Okay.

181
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:40,839
I'm going to apply pressure
on different areas.

182
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,560
Let me know if you feel any pain.

183
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,240
You were worried about her,

184
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,160
but acting like you weren't.

185
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,599
You're a terrible liar, Lada.

186
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,719
No, I wasn't worried about her.

187
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,720
I was just concerned for the patient
who got hit by a car.

188
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,960
-Really?
-Really?

189
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,200
Even if you took a polygraph,
no one would believe you.

190
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:14,879
That person has been dead to me
for a long time.

191
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,680
And what if

192
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,879
she comes back to life?

193
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,079
How can a dead person come back to life?

194
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,040
-That's harsh.
-That's harsh.

195
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:38,200
EMERGENCY CENTER

196
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:51,159
Miss, are you okay?

197
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,080
Someone just collapsed in the ER.

198
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:04,159
This is a hospital.

199
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,080
Patients collapse every day.
What's the big deal?

200
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,960
But it was Earn, the actress.

201
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,280
She was in our ward this morning.

202
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,639
-Really?
-Yes.

203
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,280
Doctor.

204
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,800
An ER patient had a shock just now.

205
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:24,520
Don't interfere with other wards.

206
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,159
Has our patient arrived?

207
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,720
I don't want to meddle,

208
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,720
but the patient was Earn Sanitada.

209
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,240
Stay calm. The doctor will be here soon.

210
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,200
Breathe slowly.

211
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,560
What are the patient's vital signs?

212
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:54,080
Her blood pressure is 90/50.

213
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,480
Her pulse is 100 beats per minute.

214
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,120
Her oxygen saturation is 95%.

215
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:00,919
Get the Atropine ready.

216
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,480
Start the free-flow IV fluids.

217
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,600
The patient has a banana allergy,

218
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,159
it's likely anaphylaxis.

219
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,080
Are you the patient's relative?

220
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,520
Yes.

221
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,879
I saw the patient
eating a banana just now.

222
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,919
I think she's right.

223
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Then give me 0.5 mL of adrenaline 1:1000,

224
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,679
1 amp of CPM via IV,

225
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,360
5 mg of Dexa via IV, and…

226
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,159
Doctor.

227
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,320
How are you feeling?

228
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,360
I'm fine.

229
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:14,399
I'm so happy

230
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,200
to wake up and see you first.

231
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,520
Is that something to be happy about?

232
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,200
Why did you do something so stupid?
Do you want to die?

233
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,720
Doctor, you misunderstood me.

234
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,040
How do I misunderstand you?

235
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,240
You knew you were allergic to bananas,
but you ate them anyway.

236
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,159
What do you call that
if not wanting to die?

237
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
I just wanted to see

238
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:44,000
if you would care about me.

239
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:47,679
The more you talk,
the more selfish you seem.

240
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,320
Don't you realize the emergency room
is for people in real emergencies?

241
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:54,560
There are many patients
who need medical attention,

242
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,679
but you're wasting their time

243
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
because you want attention.

244
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,879
Think about others for once,

245
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,399
not just yourself.

246
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,120
Yes,

247
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,360
I'm selfish.

248
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,360
But I'm doing it
because I'm afraid of losing you to…

249
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,639
Dr. Wisanu.

250
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,639
Listen to me, Earn.

251
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,200
You lost me a long time ago.

252
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:27,159
I don't like women. I like men.

253
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,520
I like men.

254
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,360
Do you understand?

255
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,439
Earn!

256
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,720
Earn, don't leave.

257
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,600
She's gone. She left me.

258
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,840
You are nothing but a toy
I've played with. Just let me go.

259
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,159
No.

260
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,679
I deceived you.

261
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,520
I knew you were rich
so I approached you to have a good life.

262
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,960
Let's not see each other again.

263
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,879
Breathe.

264
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,040
Breathe.

265
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,800
Are you okay, Doctor?

266
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,159
I'm fine.

267
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,919
How may I help you?

268
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,000
The patient is here.

269
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,439
Send her in.

270
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,439
Okay.

271
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,320
Suzie.

272
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,560
Here, take this.

273
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,360
I drove back

274
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:23,199
to get your stuffed toy
because you can't sleep without it.

275
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,879
Thank you.

276
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,120
Stop.

277
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,399
Not another word.

278
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,720
Don't thank me.

279
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,360
I'm furious with you.

280
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,280
What's wrong with you?

281
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,760
Why eat bananas when you're allergic?

282
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,639
What are we going to do if you're not
better by the day of the shoot?

283
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,960
Don't you know you have responsibilities?

284
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,560
A whole production team depends on you.

285
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,520
You're wasting their time
by hurting yourself.

286
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,840
Is that a smart move?

287
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,720
I'm sorry.

288
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,639
Good, you should be.

289
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,399
Do this again
and I won't talk to you anymore.

290
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,399
All right, I'm done lecturing you.

291
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,679
Stop.

292
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,199
Stop crying

293
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:36,439
or your eyes will swell.

294
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
You have every right to be angry.

295
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,320
She's an adult,
but what she did was very silly.

296
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,800
It's a miracle she's not dead.

297
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,480
I think she's run out of ways
to win you back, Lada.

298
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,960
That's why she did this.

299
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,720
If she knows I won't go back to her,

300
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,480
she should leave me alone.

301
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,040
She's being persistent.

302
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,360
It's annoying.

303
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,399
Let's just eat.

304
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,399
Here, eat this orange.

305
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,000
It's not a banana.

306
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,080
Are you going to keep making that face?

307
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,879
It's frustrating to look at.

308
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:25,679
Damn it.

309
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,439
What are they talking about?

310
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,800
I didn't want to get involved,

311
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,600
but as Lada's close friend,
I have no choice.

312
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:42,199
Can you do me a favor?

313
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,560
Please leave my friend alone.

314
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,280
Did she send you?

315
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,439
No.

316
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,280
I feel sorry for her.

317
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,120
She has been hurt enough by you.

318
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
I didn't mean to hurt her.

319
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,199
I got hurt myself too.

320
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,800
But not as much as Lada.

321
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,959
You know, it killed her

322
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,639
when you left.

323
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,159
She was done with life.

324
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,679
She gave up on everything.

325
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,879
She gave up her future,

326
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,320
her studies,

327
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,360
and even her family.

328
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,959
Her life was destroyed once.

329
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,120
Don't destroy it again.

330
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,159
Was she

331
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,240
really that hurt?

332
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Yes.

333
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,080
In ways you can't imagine,

334
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,199
Earn.

335
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:08,360
Hello, Lada.

336
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,439
I thought we'd stop by the store
before class.

337
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Lada.

338
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,600
Why are you crying?

339
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,000
Tan.

340
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,159
What is it?

341
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,879
Earn left me.

342
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,280
What? Why?

343
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,040
She's gone. She left me.

344
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,720
Calm down.

345
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,919
-Is it because I'm not a man?
-Lada, calm down.

346
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,480
-Is that why she left?
-Lada, calm down.

347
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,199
Lada.

348
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,919
Here, take it.

349
00:30:57,879 --> 00:30:59,399
What is it?

350
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:01,280
The lecture notes.

351
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,159
I went to class for you.

352
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm about to switch from surgery
to dermatology because of you.

353
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,439
You're awesome.

354
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,480
When will you stop this?

355
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,120
This isn't like you.

356
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,760
What am I supposed to be like?

357
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,600
More together than this.

358
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,800
I'm keeping it together
for someone who got dumped.

359
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:26,399
-That's enough. No more.
-Give me

360
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,360
No more.

361
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,399
-Give me.
-No, Lada.

362
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,919
-You drank-- No, Lada, stop.
-Give me.

363
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,720
You won't give it to me, will you?

364
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,360
Stop, Lada. Enough.

365
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,959
No more.

366
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,879
-Give it to me.
-Give it back!

367
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,840
-Do you want it that badly?
-Tan.

368
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,360
You're drunk every day. I can't stand it.

369
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,800
You stink.

370
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,760
-What?
-You reek of alcohol.

371
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,080
Are you disgusted?

372
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:00,240
Watch out.

373
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Come on.

374
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:11,199
Stop breathing near me.
Your breath stinks.

375
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,439
Hey, are you going to puke?

376
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:22,040
Enough, Lada. That's enough.

377
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,879
Give me that, Lada.

378
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,199
Here.

379
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,719
The lecture notes.

380
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,480
I went to so many classes for you
that I could graduate in your major.

381
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,600
Lada.

382
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:39,240
Pull it together, will you?

383
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,120
You can't keep doing this.

384
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,480
Stop crying.

385
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,679
Can you stop crying?

386
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,480
Lada would cry about you…

387
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,800
all the time.

388
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,360
She didn't understand why you left.

389
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,800
I love her.

390
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,080
Why are you back to hurt my friend again?

391
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,480
She's finally getting better.

392
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,959
Please leave her alone.

393
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,439
What you're doing

394
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,199
is like hurting someone
who's almost healed.

395
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,360
Listen to me carefully.

396
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,360
Her wound is almost healed.

397
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,280
If she gets hurt again,

398
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,760
she might not be able
to withstand the pain

399
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:47,320
and survive this time.

400
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,800
I didn't mean to.

401
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:51,080
I did it because--

402
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,840
It doesn't matter.

403
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,280
What matters is

404
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,719
you're making Lada

405
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,120
uncomfortable.

406
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:06,719
She has been kind and respectful to you.

407
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,360
If it were up to me,

408
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,719
you wouldn't be allowed in this hospital.

409
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,120
You naughty girl,
you always make me worried.

410
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Doctor.

411
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,960
Dr. Fahlada.

412
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
I got the wrong room.

413
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,680
What's up with her?

414
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,720
You lost me a long time ago.

415
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,880
No.

416
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,400
Please leave my friend alone.

417
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,480
You know, it killed her

418
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,000
when you left.

419
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,319
She's finally getting better.

420
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,880
Please leave her alone.

421
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,759
What if I ask for one last chance?

422
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:23,560
I promise this time will be different.

423
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,839
I will heal her completely.

424
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,560
I will heal her heart.

425
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,120
How's my new skirt?

426
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,440
Look.

427
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,160
What's with you? Let me see.

428
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,480
Wow, you look great.

429
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,799
-Pack your things.
-Fold the blanket.

430
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,560
How are you feeling?

431
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:03,920
Engfah.

432
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,480
What brings you here?

433
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,799
Suzie texted me last night

434
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,040
about you being admitted

435
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,920
so I came to visit.

436
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,080
I'm better now.

437
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,120
The doctor discharged me this morning.

438
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,400
Good thing I came in time.

439
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,160
Otherwise, who would I visit?

440
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,040
How nice of you.

441
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,960
You sacrificed
your precious time to visit her.

442
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,600
Shall we leave?

443
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,240
I'm sleepy.

444
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,319
Let's go.

445
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,680
Let me carry it.

446
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:40,560
-What? All of this?
-I'll carry it. Yes.

447
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,560
Let's go.

448
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,600
Wait, I got this.

449
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,920
Let me take that.

450
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,240
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

451
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,799
Come on.

452
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,120
-Are you all right?
-Yes, don't worry about me.

453
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,560
Hey.

454
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,240
Dr. Fahlada, hello.

455
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:34,799
Hello.

456
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,640
Are you leaving already?

457
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,839
Yes, thank you very much

458
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,960
for arranging Earn's room
while I wasn't here.

459
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:48,640
The staff did it.

460
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,879
I didn't do anything.

461
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,600
Doctor.

462
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,080
I…

463
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,240
I'm leaving now.

464
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,920
Goodbye.

465
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,960
I've heard so much about you.

466
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,200
It's nice to finally meet you.

467
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,960
Well, I'd say, "See you again,"

468
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:25,560
but that would mean getting sick, right?

469
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,839
We could meet for other reasons.

470
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:32,720
I don't think so.

471
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,600
Oh, my.

472
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,160
Who's calling?

473
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,240
A scammer?

474
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:47,879
Hello.

475
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:49,279
What?

476
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:52,359
A joint event?

477
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,879
Sure,

478
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,240
I'll call you back.

479
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,640
How did this video get so popular?

480
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,240
-What video?
-What?

481
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,520
A video of you two.

482
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,560
You guys were cute
so I uploaded a video of you on social

483
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,120
and it's blowing up.

484
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,879
How cute.

485
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,920
Wait a minute.

486
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,359
-What?
-"Eng and Earn" is trending.

487
00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:27,040
It's a new trend.

488
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,200
You two are a new ship.

489
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:34,440
"Eng and Earn" is trending!

490
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,839
Let me take this call.

491
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,600
-Hello?
-Today, we're a ship,

492
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:46,359
but in the future,

493
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,240
we could become a real couple.

494
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,000
Hello, Engfah. Where are you?

495
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,640
What's up, Doctor?

496
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,759
Why are you sitting alone?

497
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:48,640
Should I let Earn sit here with you

498
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,879
when she arrives?

499
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,799
Where are you going?

500
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:52,879
I'm going to a different bar.

501
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,400
Oh, no, she's wasted.

502
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,319
-She's alone too.
-Suzie.

503
00:46:57,879 --> 00:46:58,920
I'll handle this.

504
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,279
Doctor, why did you get so drunk?

505
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,720
