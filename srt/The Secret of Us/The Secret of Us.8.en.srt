1
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,280
I didn’t expect my mom
to give an interview like that.

2
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,440
Lada, let me ask you something.

3
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,320
Do you never plan to love a man?

4
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,440
I love a woman

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,720
and that woman is Earn.

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,600
Are you sure
you are ready for the backlash?

7
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:00,520
Yes.

8
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,880
How can they truly love each other?

9
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,080
They can't build a good family.

10
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,320
I know you're sad.

11
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,479
But it's probably hurting Lada
just as much.

12
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,239
Honey.

13
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,200
Honey.

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,920
Earn will be
the most important person in my life.

15
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,480
Doctor.

16
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,519
Are you okay?

17
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,079
Are you?

18
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,519
Of course.

19
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,079
There's nothing wrong.

20
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,799
Do you know

21
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,679
what the hardest things to hide are?

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,640
Feelings.

23
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,959
People can't hide their feelings.

24
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,120
They always show their feelings
in one way or another.

25
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,959
Do you want to reconcile with your mom?

26
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
I think…

27
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,600
I've done enough for her in this life.

28
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,000
I want to do something for myself now.

29
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,440
That's all I want to do.

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,039
If that's your decision,

31
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,960
I'll respect it and stand by your side.

32
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,760
Are you hungry?
I'll go make something for you.

33
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
No.

34
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,240
Wait.

35
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,240
Where are you going?

36
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,039
To get you something to eat.

37
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,039
I'm not hungry. Don't go.

38
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,360
Hello!

39
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,599
I heard there's a newlywed couple here.

40
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,000
May I join the celebration?

41
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,200
We're not married yet.

42
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,440
But maybe soon.

43
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,280
I can smell the love in the air.

44
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,240
I bought a lot of food.

45
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,880
What did you buy, Suzie?

46
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,560
Lots of treats.

47
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
You won't let me go, will you?

48
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Let me go.

49
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:18,840
These snacks will make me fat.

50
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,840
No, they won't. Look at me.

51
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
"Dad"?

52
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,960
Hello, Dad.

53
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:08,560
She's developed End Stage Heart Failure

54
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,240
and Intractable Ventricular Arrhythmia.

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,159
After half an hour of CPR,

56
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
her vital signs kept dropping.

57
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,599
Why didn't she tell me she was sick?

58
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,719
She probably didn't want you to worry.

59
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,680
You know how she is.

60
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:02,960
Suzie.

61
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,440
Why do I feel so bad?

62
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Do you feel bad?

63
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,760
Why?

64
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,479
You didn't do anything to her mom.

65
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,640
But if I hadn't come out

66
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,200
and stayed hidden,
none of this would have happened.

67
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,400
We're in this situation
because I came out.

68
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:31,760
No, don't overthink it.

69
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,760
The problem isn't as big as it seems.

70
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,760
You can't stop someone from getting sick.

71
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,959
Right now, Dr. Fahlada
needs all the support she can get

72
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,560
and you have to be strong for her.

73
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,560
Doctor.

74
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Listen.

75
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,800
Doctor,

76
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,199
your dad wants to see you.

77
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,760
Come in,
listen to what the doctor has to say.

78
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,319
Please start.

79
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,400
The operation was difficult,

80
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,040
but her vital signs are stable now.

81
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,720
There was significant blood loss

82
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,880
and she hasn't woken up

83
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,040
due to cerebral hypoxia.

84
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,400
It's impossible to predict
when she will fully recover.

85
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,000
It's crucial

86
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,720
that nothing stressful happens
after the operation

87
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,360
or it could affect her heart rhythm
and vital signs.

88
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,199
I understand.

89
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,560
Why are you sleeping so long this time?

90
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,439
You usually only sleep for a few hours.

91
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:53,800
Are you mad at me?

92
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,199
I'm sorry.

93
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,880
I'm sorry for saying hurtful things.

94
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,120
I'm sorry for misbehaving.

95
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,640
I'm sorry

96
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,640
for not being the daughter you wanted.

97
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,079
Please give me another chance.

98
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,520
Please wake up.

99
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:25,719
I promise to be a good girl.

100
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,199
Please.

101
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:33,760
I love you, Mom.

102
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,199
Mom.

103
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,160
Can you hear me?

104
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,199
Tell the doctor that my mom is awake.

105
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Yes.

106
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,959
Doctor, are you hungry?

107
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,160
Do you want some coffee or a sandwich?

108
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
I'll go buy it for you.

109
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,920
No, thanks.

110
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,800
I'm not hungry.

111
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,079
Doctor.

112
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,920
Should we take a break from each other?

113
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:47,560
You promised not to be tired
of my problems.

114
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,120
I've never been tired of your problems.

115
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,120
But you need to spend as much time
with your mom as possible

116
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,560
and take care of her.

117
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,800
You only have one mom.

118
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,439
I'm not going anywhere.

119
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,959
Whenever you look back…

120
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,680
you'll always find me here.

121
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:49,839
We just need to be apart
because your mom needs you right now.

122
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,640
Even if that means

123
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,719
we might be apart forever?

124
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,000
I might

125
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,159
not get to be a part of your life,

126
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,280
but your heart

127
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,960
will always belong to me.

128
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,560
You'll be the first

129
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
and…

130
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,520
the last person

131
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,760
to own my heart.

132
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Lada.

133
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,200
Mom.

134
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,360
Earn.

135
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,520
Lada.

136
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,560
Mom.

137
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,200
Are you thirsty?

138
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,399
I'll go get water for you.

139
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,600
No, it's fine.

140
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,760
-Slowly.
-Don't worry.

141
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,960
-Take it easy.
-I'm fine.

142
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,520
It's almost time for your medicine.

143
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,200
-I'll get it ready for you.
-Thanks.

144
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,240
What happened to that girl?

145
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,840
She's gone.

146
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:23,040
Why did she leave so suddenly?

147
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,960
She chose to leave

148
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:28,760
because she knew if she stayed,

149
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,080
you and Lada would keep fighting.

150
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,480
She decided to take a step back.

151
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:48,480
Can I ask you something?

152
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,480
Did she get sick because of me?

153
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,960
Don't blame yourself.

154
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,960
No one is at fault.

155
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,800
But if we're being honest,

156
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,120
Lada's mom needs her right now.

157
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,320
Lada should take care of her.

158
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,600
I understand.

159
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,240
I'll take a step back.

160
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
But…

161
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,080
aren't you sad?

162
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,120
Yes.

163
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm very sad.

164
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,800
But love alone isn't enough

165
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,840
for two people to be together.

166
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,120
You also need to understand each other.

167
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
I completely understand Dr. Fahlada.

168
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,720
I know how difficult it is for her.

169
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,240
But sometimes, things fall apart
when you hold onto one another.

170
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,520
If someone has to let go,

171
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,280
it should be me.

172
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,399
I'm glad

173
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,439
our daughter found someone like Earn.

174
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,399
Someone who can make her happy.

175
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,480
-But she's a woman.
-So what?

176
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,320
Our daughter loves her

177
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,679
and she loves our daughter.

178
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,240
I don't see any problems.

179
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,639
If you set aside your prejudice,

180
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,720
you will realize
how much they love each other.

181
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,760
Their love is stronger than we think.

182
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
Thanks.

183
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,600
Lada.

184
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,879
Yes, Mom.

185
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,040
Who's this?

186
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,080
Lady Russamee, hello.

187
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,720
I'm going to be honest with you.

188
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,159
How much do you love my daughter?

189
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,280
You know she isn't just a doctor,

190
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,199
but also an executive

191
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,760
who will be managing thousands of people.

192
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,080
Are you ready to take all the pressure

193
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,439
and support each other until old age?

194
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,679
What more do you want from me?

195
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,560
I can't step away any further than this.

196
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,520
I chose to be invisible,

197
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:43,080
quiet, and hidden

198
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,120
in Dr. Fahlada's heart.

199
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,720
I even stopped working
in the industry I love

200
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,439
to avoid causing a fight
between you and Dr. Fahlada.

201
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,679
I don't want to cause more trouble
for your family.

202
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,080
Isn't that enough?

203
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,199
What if I said it still wasn't enough?

204
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:19,959
What would you say?

205
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,959
I give up.

206
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,520
I mean it.

207
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,240
I'll do anything.

208
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:38,480
But please don't make me stop loving her.
I can't do that.

209
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,480
I really can't do that.

210
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,800
When I said it wasn't enough,

211
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,480
I meant…

212
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,520
please love Lada

213
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
like you always have.

214
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:42,720
Take care of Lada and make her happy.

215
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,439
Take away her sadness and pain.

216
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,080
I'm sorry for doubting your love.

217
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,679
I'm sorry for thinking it was impossible.

218
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,560
I'm sorry.

219
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,560
Thank you.

220
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,679
No, thank you.

221
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,839
I brought Earn to see you.

222
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,120
I'm sorry.

223
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,199
You don't have to cry alone anymore.

224
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,679
I want you to be happy.

225
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:53,080
Smile as much as you can.

226
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,360
Live your life
the way you've always dreamed of.

227
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,200
Please take care of Lada.

228
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,120
How much do I need for the dowry?

229
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,400
Don't ask for too much.

230
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,160
Ma'am.

231
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
May I?

232
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:57,680
Don't worry about that.
We will definitely request for the dowry.

233
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,960
Rest assured
that the amount will surprise you.

234
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,880
Very beautiful.

235
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,400
Can't tell who wins!

236
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:56,279
Very beautiful.

237
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,720
Awesome.

238
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,440
Listen.

239
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,560
Can you take a picture of me and Rossarin?

240
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,640
Sure.

241
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,799
With me?

242
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Beautiful.

243
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,040
My gosh.

244
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,200
Doctor, your hand
is in an inappropriate spot.

245
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:32,040
It's in the perfect place.

246
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,120
Have you sorted things out
with all the other girls?

247
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,680
Ros, stop it.

248
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,160
What?

249
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,000
Where's Tan? Why isn't he here yet?

250
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,040
Look.

251
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,640
There he is.

252
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,080
Dr. Tan and Dr. Wisanu.

253
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,080
Don't tell me…

254
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,240
Hush, don't say another word.

255
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,600
Are you two dating?

256
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,759
It's obvious.

257
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,799
Everyone.

258
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:30,279
There's a big problem.

259
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,319
What's wrong?

260
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,240
Look.

261
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,720
Someone is sad

262
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:39,200
and heartbroken.

263
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,640
Leave her alone.

264
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,839
My gosh.

265
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,440
Here come the brides.

266
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:09,759
Look.

267
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,160
It's okay if it's not complete.

268
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,480
Don't stress over it.

269
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
But this is our house.

270
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,680
You can still see our house.

271
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,680
But it's not perfect.

272
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:14,839
Nothing is perfect or complete.

273
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:37,920
Doctor.

274
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,319
It's complete now.

275
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:06,640
It's more than complete.

276
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,319
Are you ready?

277
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,960
For what?

278
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,680
Our honeymoon.

279
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,160
I'm ready.

280
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,080
Is that our house?

281
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,680
Yes, that's our house.

282
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
My gosh.

283
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,920
Thank you.

284
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,359
Ta-da.

285
00:44:42,799 --> 00:44:44,960
After you, my lady.

286
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,640
Thank you.

287
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,759
Should we put our picture here?

288
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,560
What do you think?

289
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,480
Let's do it.

290
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,759
Good morning, my love.

291
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,080
Good morning, my heart.

292
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,600
I'm so happy, honey.

293
00:48:10,799 --> 00:48:14,920
If you call me that,
we might never return to Thailand.

294
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,839
We have to!

295
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,200
You have to manage the hospital
as your mom wishes.

296
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:25,640
Oh, no. I've been replaced.

297
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,600
Are you her new favorite child now?

298
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,960
Of course I am.

299
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:44,920
Doctor.

300
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,600
Yes.

301
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,920
Thank you

302
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,720
for everything you've done for me.

303
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,720
I can do even more.

304
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,960
Shall I prove it to you?

305
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,120
I love you,

306
00:49:15,279 --> 00:49:17,680
my naughty girl.

307
