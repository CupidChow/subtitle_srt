1
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,880
What are you studying here?

2
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,360
I'm studying management. What about you?

3
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,680
I'm studying medicine.

4
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,240
Will you be my girlfriend,

5
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,960
my naughty girl?

6
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,120
Lada must break up with that girl

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,600
and marry the man I chose for her.

8
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,760
Hello.

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,520
If you break up with Lada,

10
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,240
I promise to take great care of your mom.

11
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,560
We're done.

12
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,160
Let's not see each other again.

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,400
I've missed you.

14
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Is this the presenter

15
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,160
I have to shoot the ad with?

16
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,160
That's right, Doctor.

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,560
Her name is Sanitada or Earn.

18
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,640
She's the most popular rising star.

19
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,720
Then count me out of this project.

20
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,520
Suzie, this photoshoot collection
came out great.

21
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,040
Of course,
you are a beautiful model after all.

22
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,280
You would look gorgeous on any camera.

23
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,320
Are you complimenting me
because you want something?

24
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,280
Not at all. Listen.

25
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm just proud of your fame.

26
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,920
Do you know that a hospital contacted us
to have you as their presenter recently?

27
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,920
It's a famous private hospital,
one of the top in the country.

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,280
And you'll get to work
with the hospital owner

29
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,800
who is beautiful, wealthy, and talented.

30
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,960
Everyone wants to work with her.

31
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,320
And her name is… Drumroll, please.

32
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,360
Dr. Fahlada.

33
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,280
I won't accept this job.

34
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,120
You have to. I've already made a deal.
It's a seven-figure deal!

35
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,280
If you can agree to it, you can cancel it.

36
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,520
I won't accept any work
related to this hospital.

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,760
Why? Give me a reason.

38
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,240
I can't tell you.

39
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,600
Please contact them
and reject their offer for me.

40
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,480
Seriously?

41
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,800
Hello, everybody.
Today, we are honored to have Dr. Wisanu,

42
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,760
a young doctor
and medical equipment business owner,

43
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,000
and the future partner of Dr. Fahlada,

44
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
the heir to a famous hospital.

45
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,160
Did I introduce you correctly, Dr. Wisanu?

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,120
Actually, that's only half correct.

47
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm the owner
of a medical equipment business,

48
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,280
but I'm not anyone's partner yet.

49
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,440
What about the rumors we've been hearing?

50
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,000
I've been pursuing Dr. Fahlada for years,

51
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,960
but she won't give me a chance.

52
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,240
If anyone has tips on how to woo a lady,
please let me know.

53
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,920
You may not be aware,

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,640
but she began dating Dr. Wisanu

55
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,880
before moving abroad.

56
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
- Suzie.
- Hello.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,720
I've changed my mind. I'll take the job.

58
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,840
Mark your words.

59
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,200
No backing out!

60
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,960
Let's schedule it right away.

61
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,720
What's going on?

62
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,920
First, you didn't want to take the job

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
and now Dr. Fahlada
is the one refusing to shoot.

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,880
Hey, let me ask you something.

65
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,800
Be honest with me.

66
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,960
Is there something
between you and Dr. Fahlada?

67
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,360
Why is she refusing
to shoot the ad with you?

68
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,080
No.

69
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,960
I don't have any problems with her.

70
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,560
- Are you lying?
- No.

71
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,560
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

72
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,720
Then who's the problem here?

73
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,320
The director?

74
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
The staff?

75
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,080
I actually don't know.

76
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,480
Are you lying to me?

77
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,480
Earn, Suzie,

78
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,080
come with me.
Someone wants to talk to you.

79
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,320
No, I'm not in the mood
to talk to anyone today.

80
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,680
The hospital executive
wants to speak with you.

81
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,680
Of course, let's go.

82
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,920
You should have started with that.

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,480
May I ask what this is about?

84
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Follow me.

85
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Put this away for me.

86
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,440
You have to be
considerate of others, Lada.

87
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
The crew has been here

88
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,720
since early this morning for the shoot

89
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,200
and now you're canceling
without any reason. It's not right.

90
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,800
I agree with Bow.

91
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,160
Your action is uncalled for, Lada.

92
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,600
Who said I don't have a reason?

93
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,600
Then what is it?

94
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,800
Are you afraid of becoming famous?

95
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
That's possible

96
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,560
since Lada is an introvert.

97
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,800
If Lada is an introvert,

98
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,160
then I must be innocent, right?

99
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,920
You've been through too much
to be called innocent, Tan.

100
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,320
Hey, Bow.

101
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
Take that back.

102
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,160
This is why you don't have a boyfriend.

103
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,920
- Tan! You're a foul-mouthed doctor.
- What?

104
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,240
Wait.

105
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,680
Weren't we scolding Lada?
Why are we fighting each other?

106
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,240
Yes, we were.

107
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Talk.

108
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,440
So what's your reason
for canceling the ad shoot?

109
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,880
Because I don't want to shoot…

110
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,559
with that presenter.

111
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,559
Why?

112
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,480
You don't usually hate anyone.

113
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,480
What did she do to you?

114
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,080
Don't tell me…

115
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
Yes, Dad.

116
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm talking to the crew
about today's shoot.

117
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,200
Why did you cancel suddenly?

118
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,480
I don't think I'm suitable for this job.

119
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,400
You're the hospital owner.

120
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
Who else is more suitable?

121
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,080
Exactly.

122
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,960
You are perfect for the job.

123
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,400
You're beautiful and classy.

124
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,400
No one else is better for the job.

125
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,720
I stand by my words

126
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,080
that I will not shoot this ad.

127
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,360
Find someone else to replace me.

128
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,840
Give me a reason.

129
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,840
Because I don't want to shoot with…

130
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,600
this presenter.

131
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,080
May I join you?

132
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,600
I didn't know

133
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,040
you had become so irresponsible, Doctor.

134
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,080
What are you talking about?

135
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,200
You canceled the shoot

136
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,216
because you didn't want to be close to me.

137
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,360
You're afraid you'll fall for me again,
aren't you?

138
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,760
That's ridiculous.

139
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,200
If it's ridiculous,
then why did you do it?

140
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,200
Prove to me

141
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,560
that you don't have feelings for me.

142
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm sorry to say this,

143
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,240
but I don't need to prove anything
to someone like you.

144
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,440
When you're ready,
let's work together again, Doctor.

145
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,560
TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS
READY TO SERVE YOU 24…

146
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,880
Mom!

147
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Earn.

148
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,600
Why did you come without telling me?

149
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,720
How's it going?

150
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,720
I've prepared your favorite food.

151
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
Look, there's shrimp.

152
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,640
I'm not hungry.

153
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,040
I just want to hug you.

154
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Hey.

155
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,600
What's the matter?

156
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Tell me.

157
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,880
Is everything all right?

158
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,840
Is something bothering you?

159
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,360
I saw Fahlada today.

160
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,280
She looked at me with disgust.

161
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,000
She even withdrew from the shoot

162
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,800
because she didn't want to work with me.

163
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,000
I see. I understand how she would feel

164
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,520
since you dumped her.

165
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,360
But I still don't understand

166
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,880
why did you leave someone
you loved so much.

167
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,480
It was my fault
for being too easily swayed.

168
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,760
I deserve her hatred.

169
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,080
Do you remember when I was very sick?

170
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,800
Do you know

171
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,680
what my biggest fear was?

172
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,560
I was scared that I wouldn't be able

173
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,120
to spend time with you and your dad.

174
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,560
Nothing in life is certain.

175
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,880
Love is not easy but it's not hard either.

176
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,120
If you have learned how to love someone,

177
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,920
then you must love them well

178
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,000
and learn how to maintain
your relationship.

179
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,000
But in the end, if it's not meant to be,
you have to let it go.

180
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,480
But in the end, if it's not meant to be,
you have to let go.

181
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
No.

182
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,240
I refuse to let go.

183
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,079
My list is complete.

184
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,319
It was hectic in the ER yesterday.

185
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
Hello.

186
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,160
I'm here to see Dr. Fahlada.

187
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,680
It's you, Earn.

188
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

189
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,480
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes.

190
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,720
In that case, I'll let her know.
Please wait a moment.

191
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,000
Actually, I want to surprise her.

192
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,080
Can you just tell me where her office is?

193
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,200
Also, would you please

194
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,880
hand this food to her?

195
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,120
Well…

196
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,240
I…

197
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,440
Doctor, you are needed
in the OPD ward in ten minutes.

198
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,480
You're stepping up your game.

199
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,800
You are surprising me

200
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,080
with my favorite food,
stir-fried glass noodles.

201
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,880
That's not from me.

202
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,960
Who is it from then?

203
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,040
It's from me.

204
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,880
Don't forget to eat it.
Doctors get sick too.

205
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,200
Ros.

206
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,440
Please leave us.

207
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Okay.

208
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Oh, no.

209
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,440
I guess you grew tired
of stir-fried glass noodles.

210
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,400
I'll cook you something else next time.

211
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,360
No, thanks.

212
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Will you leave quietly
or should I have security escort you out?

213
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,480
Fine, I'll leave.

214
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,640
But I will come back.

215
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,600
I will keep coming back
until you give me a chance.

216
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,320
I won't make the same mistake again.

217
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,320
I will be the one

218
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,680
who heals the scar in your heart.

219
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
See you soon.

220
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Oh, my god.

221
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,760
I…

222
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,800
This way, please.

223
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Thank you.

224
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,560
What did you say?

225
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,040
Earn Sanitada came to see Dr. Fahlada?

226
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,400
Yes, and importantly,
she didn't come empty-handed.

227
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,640
She surprised Dr. Fahlada
with her favorite food.

228
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,280
What did Dr. Fahlada say?

229
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,560
I don't know. She kicked me out.

230
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,760
Listen, I can sense a disaster
coming our way.

231
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,600
Me too.

232
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,280
Lada had a hard time getting over her.

233
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,360
Why is that brat back
to rub salt in her wound?

234
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,200
Guys.

235
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,800
What do you mean by her wound?

236
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,840
Don't you have to be
in the OPD ward right now, Rossarin?

237
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,320
That's right. I totally forgot.
I lost track of time gossiping.

238
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,680
- I have to go. See you later.
- See you.

239
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,720
- Hey.
- What?

240
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm starting to worry about Lada.

241
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,400
Me too.

242
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,400
What should we do?

243
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,320
Hey, listen.

244
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,080
How about we find Lada a new girlfriend?

245
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,240
They say the best lover is a new one.

246
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,080
Yes, a new lover could help Lada
move on from that brat.

247
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,520
Let's do it.

248
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Does it hurt?

249
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,640
No.

250
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,720
It's very soft.

251
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,680
It doesn't hurt but I sense irritation.
I could be allergic.

252
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,560
I suspect the same.

253
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
I'll prescribe you a new medication.

254
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,920
It's almost lunchtime. Are you free?

255
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,440
Do you need anything from me?

256
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,080
You've been taking care
of my skin for years.

257
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,800
Let me buy you a meal as a thank you.

258
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,720
You are my patient.

259
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,160
It's my job to take care of you.

260
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,320
Is that a yes then?

261
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,000
Normally, I only eat a sandwich for lunch.

262
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,320
Actually, she doesn't even have time
for a sandwich today.

263
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,200
She has a long line of patients
waiting for her.

264
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,480
Maybe next time then.

265
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,760
But…

266
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,160
Doctor, is the session over?

267
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,040
Let me interrupt you then.

268
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,040
Ratee, many fans are waiting
for your autograph outside.

269
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,080
Follow me.

270
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,800
Next time then.

271
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

272
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,880
- Hello.
- Earn, sit here.

273
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,840
Thank you.

274
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,000
- Hello, Sis.
- Hello, Sis.

275
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,080
Hello, Earn.

276
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,880
Oh, my gosh. Hello, Engfah.

277
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
No need for formalities.

278
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm honored to be working with you.

279
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,960
I'm glad our schedules finally aligned.

280
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,520
The honor is mine.

281
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,040
We are not surprised
why you are so famous.

282
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,040
- Everyone loves how nice you are.
- I agree.

283
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
Thanks.

284
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,480
Hey.

285
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Sorry.

286
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,240
Ratee, where are you?
Everyone's waiting for you.

287
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm here. Stop rushing me.

288
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,040
Sorry, I'm late.

289
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,080
I'm having my period cramps.
I'm still in pain.

290
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Oh, no, you poor girl.

291
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Why didn't you call me?

292
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,360
Can you work in this condition?

293
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,920
I'll manage. I won't put others
in trouble because of me.

294
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,200
That's the spirit.

295
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,480
- Assistant.
- Yes.

296
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,680
Where should Ratee get her makeup done?

297
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,120
You can take my spot.

298
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
Are you sure, Engfah?

299
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,200
He's your personal makeup artist.

300
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,960
Don't worry about it.
I got my makeup done a while ago

301
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,600
because I came on time.

302
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,760
I don't know why I'm laughing.

303
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,840
Yes, Earn is a great actress.

304
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,880
Cut.

305
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,080
Okay, let's see the footage.

306
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,480
Let us check the footage.

307
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Earn.

308
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Are you okay?

309
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,920
Thank you, Engfah.

310
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
It's okay.

311
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Gosh.

312
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,520
What's the matter?

313
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,280
Are you thinking of that brat?

314
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,680
How do you know?

315
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,880
Come on. Of course I know.

316
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,560
Look at you.

317
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,600
You've been frustrated
ever since you ran into her.

318
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,000
Ros told me that you even made
a mistake writing a doctor's note.

319
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,920
Yes, she has been frustrated all morning.

320
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,920
She glared at me many times.

321
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,160
I don't want to be like this.

322
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,040
Do you want it to stop?

323
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,200
Bow, do you know how to help me?

324
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,280
Yes.

325
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,800
But I'll need your cooperation.

326
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,640
WISANU

327
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Look.

328
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,880
Speak of the devil.

329
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
I was about to mention his name.

330
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Pick it up.

331
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,200
Pick it up.

332
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,280
Come on, Lada.

333
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,160
Answer the phone.

334
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,600
Hurry up.

335
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,560
Do it now.

336
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,000
I can talk to him if you don't want to.

337
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,400
- Go away.
- Go away.

338
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,560
If you won't pick it up,

339
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,840
I'll do it.

340
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,280
WISANU

341
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,480
- Come on.
- Hurry.

342
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,200
Hello, Nu.

343
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,680
My company is hosting the seminar
with the Dermatological Association.

344
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,520
I would love to see you there.

345
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,640
Let me check my schedule first.

346
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,960
I'll be there if I'm free.

347
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,160
Your mom told me you've been buried
with work since you got back.

348
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
I believe her now.

349
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,680
I love working.

350
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,040
I want to see my patients recover.

351
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,280
I'm jealous of your patients.

352
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,760
Their doctor is kind

353
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,840
and caring.

354
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,720
Thanks.

355
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,680
Are you off work yet?

356
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,400
Do you need a ride?

357
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,760
I've been meaning to visit your mom.

358
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,400
I…

359
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm sorry, Nu.

360
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,760
I'm meeting a friend today.

361
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,120
Feel free to visit my mom

362
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,360
without me though.

363
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,040
- They're beautiful.
- Earn's doing great.

364
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,040
- So is Ratee.
- That's right.

365
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,520
Earn really stands out.

366
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,680
Ratee is very outstanding.

367
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,680
Bang, bang.

368
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,440
Okay, let's call it a day.

369
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,480
Yes.

370
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,840
- Good job.
- Ratee.

371
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,680
- See you.
- Bye.

372
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,200
See you later.

373
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,120
Ratee, are you tired?

374
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,440
You did a great job.
The director was complimenting you.

375
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,600
- Really?
- Yes.

376
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Listen, Madame Ple is hosting a party
tonight. Do you want to go with me?

377
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,040
- Yes...
- We can't go, Engfah.

378
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,800
You're not going again?

379
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,760
I have something to do.

380
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,440
What is it this time?
You are always busy with something.

381
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,800
Do you have something against me?

382
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,000
No, I don't.

383
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,080
That means you like me then.

384
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
I'm kidding.

385
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,840
I understand you are busy.

386
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,000
We'll meet some other time.

387
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,960
We'll be seeing
a lot of each other anyway.

388
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,760
Sure, I should get going then.

389
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,800
- I'm leaving, Suzie. See you tomorrow.
- What?

390
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
What?

391
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
You're leaving me here?

392
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,760
I'm meeting someone.

393
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,960
I'm going to get changed.

394
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,680
Pu.

395
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,200
What's with her?

396
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,880
Gosh.

397
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,040
Doctor.

398
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,600
I'm looking for a friend
to watch the new movie with tonight.

399
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,600
Will you come with me?

400
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,400
Don't talk to me like I'm your friend
because I'm not.

401
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,400
Will you go with me as my girlfriend then?

402
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,960
I was joking.

403
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,120
There's no need to get upset.

404
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,120
Can't you talk to me nicely?

405
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,720
No.

406
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,280
How about we go for a ride instead?

407
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,160
- No.
- Let's go listen to some music then.

408
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,120
- No.
- How about shopping?

409
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Leave me alone. It's annoying.

410
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,280
I miss you.

411
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,800
I know you hate me.

412
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,160
That's right. I hate you so much.

413
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,960
Doctor.

414
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Wait for me.

415
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,600
Doctor, wait for me.

416
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,560
Doctor!

417
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,640
Earn, watch out!

418
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,800
Why are you following me?

419
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,880
Go home.

420
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,800
I still love you.

421
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,360
Love?

422
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,920
How dare you use that word?

423
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,160
It's true.

424
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,120
I love you.

425
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,200
And I will do everything to get you back.

426
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,120
That's not happening,

427
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,160
Ms. Sanitada.

428
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,840
HEART, FAHLADA & EARN

429
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,960
Whenever you feel overwhelmed by stress,
look at this music box.

430
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,400
It will remind you
that I'll always be here for you.

431
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,160
I want to break up with you.

432
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,960
You are nothing
but a toy I've played with.

433
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,240
Just let me go.

434
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,040
I don't like women. I like men.

435
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,400
I like men.

436
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,240
Do you understand?

437
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,080
I will make it happen.

438
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,760
I told you that
I would do everything to get you back.

439
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,280
SORRY, FORGIVE ME

440
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,360
Who let this lunatic inside?

441
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,960
Go away. Don't come any closer.

442
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,880
How did it go?

443
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
It went well.

444
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,240
I'll get these balloons cleaned up.

445
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,120
- Earn, can I take a photo with you?
- Yes.

446
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,880
- Of course.
- I'm a huge fan.

447
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,960
- Thank you. Sure.
- Can you hold it?

448
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,080
- All done. Thank you.
- Thank you.

449
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,120
She's prettier in real life.

450
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,480
May I join you?

451
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,360
I haven't answered you yet.

452
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,560
But I want to see your face.

453
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,960
Just a few seconds is enough.

454
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,320
Wait.

455
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,760
Will you shoot the ad with me?

456
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,560
You don't have to answer me now.

457
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,920
Are you free this evening?

458
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,160
- When I'm done...
- I'm warning you for the last time.

459
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,160
Leave me alone.

460
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,960
Don't be so cold-hearted.

461
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Or it will give you a heart condition.

462
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,000
FBI My Love, episode 1,
scene 15, cut 1, take 1.

463
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,280
The situation doesn't look good.

464
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,920
We can't trust those people.

465
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,360
I'll ask Lieutenant Chan for backup.

466
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,680
Lieutenant Chan?

467
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,400
He won't be of help to us.

468
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,240
We should raid their nest.

469
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,160
Let's go.

470
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
Cut.

471
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,080
Ratee stood in the wrong spot again.

472
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,880
Did no one brief her?

473
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,760
I told her many times.

474
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,160
Should we retake it?

475
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,360
There's no time.

476
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,240
Next scene.

477
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,120
Wait. That was Take 10.
Why did you write Take 1?

478
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Well…

479
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,400
She…

480
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,040
It's a lucky number.

481
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,480
With number one,
it looks like we got it on the first try.

482
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,040
What a day.

483
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,520
Move the camera
to film her face next time.

484
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,680
Listen, Ratee.

485
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,720
You stood in the wrong spot.

486
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,440
You completely covered Earn.

487
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,160
Oh, no.

488
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,200
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

489
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,240
My inner actress made me do it.

490
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,760
That's right, Sis.
She was just following her instinct.

491
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,640
I'm not your sister.

492
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,320
- I'm tired.
- Is that so?

493
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,120
Let's take a break.

494
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,440
Go around in circles.

495
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,680
Get some rest.

496
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,000
Do you want to reshoot?
I'll tell Ake for you.

497
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,440
It's fine.

498
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,880
I feel sorry for him.
We're running out of time.

499
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,760
Of course we are.

500
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,680
We reshot it ten times thanks to Ratee.

501
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,560
Engfah invited us to hit the gym with her.

502
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,200
We should go.

503
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,640
I've been feeling a little bloated.

504
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,120
Some exercise would be good for me.

505
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,880
Suzie, you just want to film yourself
working out so you can post it on social.

506
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,320
Oh, my. You know me so well.

507
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,600
Where's Engfah?

508
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,960
She's over there.

509
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,240
I'm glad you can come.

510
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,920
Why don't we leave our car here?
We can come back for it later.

511
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,280
We can reduce pollution by carpooling.

512
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,560
Earn can come with me.

513
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,600
You can drive and meet us there.

514
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,880
Sure, if that's what you want.

515
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,160
But don't forget

516
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,720
I have to post
a workout video with Engfah.

517
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,640
You got it.

518
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,920
Shall we go, Earn?

519
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,680
- Sure.
- Let's go.

520
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,720
Something smells fishy.

521
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,880
Since Lada has offered
to pay for our meal today,

522
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,640
I'm taking us to an Omakase restaurant.

523
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,000
Awesome.

524
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,440
You chose wisely, Dr. Bow.

525
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,600
You guys are unbelievable.

526
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,760
Let's order a full-course meal.

527
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,896
- I'm hungry.
- Let's go all out.

528
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,000
Sure.

529
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,360
Do your shoes hurt, Suzie?

530
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,240
You got jealous, didn't you?

531
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,440
What are you talking about?

532
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,840
You like women, don't you?

533
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,720
Hello, Nu.

534
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,640
I was just thinking of you.

535
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,680
Have you considered
that she might harm herself? What then?

536
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,920
A woman has been hit by a car
in front of the hospital.

537
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,680
You naughty girl,
you always make me worried.

538
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,520
