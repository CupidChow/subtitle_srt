1
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,039
Urgent announcement. Code 000 in the ER.

2
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,560
Urgent announcement. Code 000 in the ER.

3
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,760
Where is my daughter?

4
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,280
I want to go find my daughter.

5
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,840
-Can any of you speak Chinese?
-No, Doctor.

6
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,520
I want to go find my daughter.

7
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,080
Please calm down. I'll ask them for you.

8
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,200
She came with her daughter.
Do you know where she is?

9
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,160
She's being treated
by Dr. Pannaorn in Bed Three.

10
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
Your daughter is already
in the care of the doctors.

11
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,480
Don't worry, we will do our best.

12
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,840
Thank you, please save my daughter.

13
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,760
I suspect the patient
has an inhalation burn

14
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,760
and a second-degree burn
on 5% of her right limbs.

15
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm counting on you.
I have another case to tend to.

16
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,760
Sure.

17
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,200
The patient has an inhalation burn.

18
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,920
Her blood pressure is dropping.

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,560
Prepare a tube
and a central line insertion.

20
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,600
Yes, Doctor.

21
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,600
Look at you guys.

22
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,280
You look like you've just fought a war.

23
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,160
A van was involved in an accident
and everyone inside was injured.

24
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,120
Luckily, Lada came to my rescue.

25
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,960
Otherwise, I'd have been in trouble.

26
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Listen.

27
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,000
Since you are one smart lady
with lots of skills,

28
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
why don't you specialize in emergency
medicine and join my team?

29
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,200
You're funny.

30
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,680
What about my dermatology ward?

31
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,200
You can work in both wards.

32
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,520
Stop it, Bow.

33
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,880
You can't expect her to work both wards
just because her parents own the hospital.

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,440
The current workload
is already killing her.

35
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,920
You can't die yet.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,960
Drink some coffee

37
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,560
and get back to work.

38
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,080
-You are a devil.
-You are a devil.

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,240
Hey.

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,920
I'm a nurse.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,320
Sure, you are.

42
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,480
The whole ER was talking

43
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,040
about how cool you were.

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,920
You talked with the Chinese patient
without an interpreter.

45
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,960
Of course, she was an exchange student.

46
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,200
She speaks almost every language.

47
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,080
I see. Except the language of love,
am I right?

48
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,960
That's why you are still single.

49
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,080
Ros.

50
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,160
What time do I have
to check on the ward patients today?

51
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,160
It's not in your schedule

52
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,200
as you have an ad shoot today.

53
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,160
All set.

54
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,720
Dr. Fahlada, our presenter is on her way.
Please wait a moment.

55
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,720
Okay.

56
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,080
Here she comes.

57
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
It's you. Hello.

58
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,560
I've missed you.

59
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,920
She's gorgeous.

60
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,880
Thank you.

61
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,200
Are you Thai?

62
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,440
Yes.

63
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,280
I'm Thai.

64
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,720
Here's your coffee.

65
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,480
Thank you.

66
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,480
I'm glad to run into a Thai person.

67
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,360
I haven't met a Thai person
since I moved here.

68
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,480
I've been so lonely

69
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,040
and isolated.

70
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,600
What are you studying here?

71
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm studying management. What about you?

72
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm studying medicine.

73
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,240
Gosh, are you a doctor?

74
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,360
Why are you so excited?

75
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,000
I've never met such
a beautiful doctor before.

76
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,360
You say that as if
you're not beautiful yourself.

77
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,960
You're the first person
to call me beautiful.

78
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,560
Most people say

79
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,560
I'm childish.

80
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,920
Would you mind

81
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,640
if I called you "Doctor"?

82
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,440
I think it sounds pretty cool.

83
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,080
It's up to you.

84
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,320
You can call me whatever you want.

85
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,960
And what would you suggest I do…

86
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,960
if I fell for you?

87
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
Nothing.

88
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,600
Because you should focus
on getting back to work.

89
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Let's take a photo together.

90
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Sure.

91
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,880
Move it up a bit.

92
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,520
-Come on.
-What?

93
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
What?

94
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Kiss me.

95
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,920
Gosh.

96
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,000
It looks delicious.

97
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,280
-One more.
-Do it.

98
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,040
Come on.

99
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,520
I love it when a couple does that.

100
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,560
It's nice to watch.

101
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,600
Doctor.

102
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,520
Have you eaten?

103
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,280
I brought you food in case you are hungry.

104
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,600
I'll leave it here.

105
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,320
You've got yourself a sassy girl.

106
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,440
DON'T FORGET TO EAT,
DOCTORS GET SICK TOO

107
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,880
I know that all the Asian girls

108
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,120
lie and ask for money.

109
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,440
Despite changing jobs many times,

110
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,400
I couldn't escape discrimination.

111
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,320
I refused to be a victim
so I punched someone in the face.

112
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Wait.

113
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,720
Weren't you afraid
of being sued for assault?

114
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,320
That's why

115
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,640
I ran for my life and never looked back.

116
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,880
Can I ask you something?

117
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Why do you have to work this hard?

118
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Do you pay your own tuition fees?

119
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,840
No, my parents support me financially,

120
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,320
but I want to reduce their burden.

121
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,320
The cost of living is very high here.

122
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,760
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help you.

123
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,080
Can you take me in and support me?

124
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,760
Do this poor girl a favor.

125
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,880
I'm kidding.

126
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,760
Earn.

127
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,520
Why are you sleeping here?

128
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,640
My roommate's boyfriend is at our place

129
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,920
so I came down here to study.

130
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,960
Are you sick?

131
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,320
I have a bit of a headache.

132
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,200
I think it's more than a headache.

133
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,560
You are burning up.

134
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,880
Why don't you come to my place?

135
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,800
Earn, it's time to eat.

136
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,200
Son-in-law eggs.

137
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,880
-What?
-Stop right there.

138
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,400
Yours is porridge.

139
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,400
You need to take medicine.

140
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,880
Come on.

141
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,040
Do you know how much I love this dish?

142
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
I love it so much.

143
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,520
But I haven't had a chance to eat it
since I moved here.

144
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,600
What about you? What do you like?

145
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,680
I like you.

146
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,520
I like stir-fried glass noodles.

147
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,200
I see.

148
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,120
I'll practice making noodles so I can
cook them for you every day. Okay?

149
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,520
I'll do the same with son-in-law eggs.

150
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,200
It might help me become a son-in-law.

151
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,360
What?

152
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,600
It's Valentine's Day.

153
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,280
-Someone must have sent her flowers.
-Sure.

154
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,119
The flowers are beautiful.

155
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,240
Do you like them?

156
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,720
I just think they look nice.

157
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,480
They are for you.

158
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,320
Doctor.

159
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,840
Are they for me?

160
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,080
Will you be my girlfriend,

161
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,920
my naughty girl?

162
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Yes, I will.

163
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,160
Good morning,

164
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,560
Love.

165
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,760
Good morning, Heart.

166
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,640
HEART

167
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,200
Focus on studying.

168
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,640
I love you and only you.

169
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,080
I'm back.

170
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,240
You're back already.

171
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,920
Look, this is my dream house.

172
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,840
I dream of owning this house one day.

173
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,760
It must be expensive.

174
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,720
Of course it is.

175
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,440
But if I start saving up now,

176
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,640
I should be able to buy it
when I'm 40 years old.

177
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,960
Maybe 50.

178
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,000
Maybe 60, 70,

179
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,720
or 80.

180
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,280
That's way too long.
I'll just get a dog and stay with you.

181
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
Eighty years old?

182
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,240
Here.

183
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,840
Jigsaw puzzles?

184
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,600
Yes.

185
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,680
What's the image on it?
Do you have a pattern I can follow?

186
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,960
When you are done with the puzzle,

187
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,200
you will realize how meaningful
the image is to our relationship.

188
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,560
Really?

189
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,360
Yes.

190
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,120
Thank you.

191
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,760
Don't open your eyes.

192
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,120
-Keep walking.
-Will I hit something?

193
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,760
-No, you won't.
-Are you sure?

194
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,480
I'm sure.

195
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,960
-Keep them closed.
-They are closed. I promise I won't peek.

196
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,920
Sorry about that.

197
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,240
All right, it's time to open your eyes.

198
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,720
I'm so excited. Okay.

199
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,400
One, two, three.

200
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,360
Did you prepare everything yourself?

201
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
No, I hired someone to do it.

202
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm kidding.
Of course I prepared everything myself.

203
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,560
-Do you like it?
-I like it. Thank you.

204
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,360
-Look.
-What did you make?

205
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,560
I made Banoffee pie.

206
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,080
It's my first time making it.

207
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,760
I'll feed you.

208
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,120
Take a big bite.

209
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,160
Open wide.

210
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,360
Do you not like it?

211
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,120
I put a lot of effort into it.

212
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,160
Of course I like it.
My girlfriend made it for me after all.

213
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,760
Open wide.

214
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,240
-How is it? Is it good?
-Gosh.

215
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
So?

216
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,960
You like it, don't you?

217
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,480
Open wide.

218
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,520
Here.

219
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,320
Is it good?

220
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,440
Earn.

221
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,840
What's wrong?

222
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,920
Earn.

223
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,440
Earn!

224
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,480
Earn!

225
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,760
Breathe.

226
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,200
Breathe.

227
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,920
Earn, you will be okay.

228
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Doctor.

229
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,920
You can't take it off.

230
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,680
But it's uncomfortable.

231
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,240
Keep it on.

232
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,480
It's uncomfortable.

233
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,360
You're so stubborn.

234
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,200
Why didn't you tell me
you were allergic to bananas?

235
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,880
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

236
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,160
You put a lot of effort into it.

237
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,320
I just wanted to surprise you
on your birthday.

238
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,960
Well, that's the end of that.

239
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,760
What makes you think so?

240
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,760
What?

241
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,360
Who told you it was over?

242
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,920
Doctor.

243
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,480
Can I hold it?

244
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,280
You aren't allergic
to any ingredients, are you?

245
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,600
-Doctor, we were having a moment there.
-What?

246
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,840
Sorry.

247
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,600
Make a wish.

248
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Doctor.

249
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,520
The blanket…

250
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,960
Let me put this away first.

251
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,160
Look at the blanket.

252
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,920
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

253
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,040
I customized it.
It represents our relationship.

254
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,680
"FE" stands for Fahlada

255
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,840
and Earn.

256
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Do you like it?

257
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
Yes.

258
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,000
Let me put it on you then.

259
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Here.

260
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,360
What should we eat
for dinner today, Doctor?

261
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,360
Anything you want.

262
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,480
How about Chinese food?

263
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,720
Sure.

264
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,360
Or should we go to
your favorite sushi restaurant?

265
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,920
Sure.

266
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,640
I'm kind of craving son-in-law eggs too.

267
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,560
Should we cook the son-in-law eggs?

268
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,440
Let me finish up my studies first.

269
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,720
I don't mind if you are studying,

270
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,040
but I need to know
if I have to dress up or not.

271
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,160
Doctor.

272
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,680
That was your punishment
for not letting me study in peace.

273
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,920
Your punishment makes me
want to keep talking all day long.

274
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,960
You, naughty girl.

275
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
Don't you need to study?

276
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,320
I can't concentrate anymore.

277
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,320
Take a look.

278
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,640
Who are they?

279
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,960
It's Lada.

280
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,560
Our daughter has become…

281
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,160
She's gay.

282
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,360
So what?

283
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,080
What do you mean?

284
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,480
What are you saying?

285
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,120
Lada is the daughter of hospital owners.

286
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
She's a doctor.

287
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,600
She's the successor
to our family business.

288
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,160
She's dating a woman.

289
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,400
It makes her happy.

290
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,040
But it's unacceptable.

291
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,160
Aren't you bothered by this at all?

292
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
I'm just her dad.

293
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
I don't own her.

294
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,680
One's sexual preference
is a private matter.

295
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,560
It's none of our business.

296
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,440
Fine.

297
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
It's decided then.

298
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,640
We have different opinions.

299
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,960
It's your problem
if you don't care about this.

300
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,920
But I do.

301
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,680
Lada must break up with that girl

302
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,640
and marry the man I chose for her.

303
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Come in.

304
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,440
Lady Russamee,
Dr. Wisanu is here to see you.

305
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,080
Invite him in.

306
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,680
Hello.

307
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,600
I brought the new medical equipment spec
for you to consider.

308
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,040
Don't worry about this.

309
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,280
We've been doing business together
for a long time.

310
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,440
I'll have the procurement team
take care of it for you.

311
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,280
Thank you.

312
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,080
I'm glad you are here.

313
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,120
I have an important matter
to discuss with you.

314
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,720
What can I do for you?

315
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,720
It's nothing serious.

316
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,160
Have you talked to Lada lately?

317
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,960
We talked a few times over the phone.

318
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,360
But she has been quite busy lately

319
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,320
so she hasn't been able to speak to me.

320
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,600
You're being like this again.

321
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,000
But I just sent her a package
consisting of her favorite stuff.

322
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,320
Come on, Nu.

323
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,720
That's not enough.

324
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,120
I'm going to be honest with you.

325
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,800
I have high hopes for you.

326
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,200
I want you to be Lada's life partner.

327
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,080
In the future,

328
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,400
Lada will have to manage the hospital.

329
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,080
With you married to Lada,

330
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,680
I will be able to die in peace.

331
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,160
I know. I'm doing my best.

332
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,480
But if you think my effort isn't enough,
then I'll try even harder.

333
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,360
Put your trust in me.

334
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,360
-Are you studying?
-Yes.

335
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,480
Exams are coming up but I'm not ready yet.

336
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,440
I guess I'm just overwhelmed by stress.

337
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,280
Whenever you feel overwhelmed by stress,
look at this music box.

338
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,520
It will remind you
that I'll always be here for you.

339
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,639
So cute.

340
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,880
The doll or me?

341
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
The doll.

342
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,320
But you are cuter.

343
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,000
You cutie.

344
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,120
I love you so much that it could kill me,

345
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,639
Do you know that?

346
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,960
You can't die.

347
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,080
I can't live without you.

348
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,639
No.

349
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,719
-No.
-No.

350
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,920
Shall we turn it on?

351
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,520
It's my dad.

352
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,600
Hello, Dad.

353
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,840
What's happened to Mom?

354
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,480
Stay calm.

355
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,280
Earn.

356
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,200
Stay calm.

357
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,760
She's with a doctor right now.

358
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,360
But my dad said,

359
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,760
her brain tumor
is extremely difficult to treat.

360
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,080
He told me to prepare for the worst.

361
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,240
What do I do?

362
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,200
It's okay.

363
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,800
I'll find a way to help your mom.

364
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,640
Hello, how is it going?

365
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,800
Are you free to talk?

366
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,040
I need a favor from you.

367
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,960
Sure. What is it?

368
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,000
There's a patient suffering

369
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,600
from a critical brain tumor.

370
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,080
I would like our hospital
to take special care of this patient.

371
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,000
Who is this person?

372
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,080
She's the mom of my junior.

373
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,400
Is this junior so important to you

374
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,440
that you had to call me from over there?

375
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,520
Let's just say

376
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,480
I really need your help to save her life.

377
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,320
All right then.

378
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,760
What's her name?

379
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,600
Give me her number. I'll take care of it.

380
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,640
Thank you, Mom. I love you.

381
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,960
Okay, love you.

382
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,600
Love you back.

383
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,160
You have nothing to worry about.

384
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,120
Mom! Dad!

385
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,600
-Earn.
-Earn.

386
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,720
How did you get here?
I missed you so much.

387
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,600
I came back because I'm worried about you.

388
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,600
I missed you so much. I really did.

389
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,360
Come here.

390
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,560
I'm fine.

391
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,640
She's fine.
She just has a lump in her head.

392
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,640
How are you feeling? Does your head hurt?

393
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,840
No, I'm better now.

394
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,800
At first, I wasn't going
to receive treatment

395
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,720
because surgery might not help.

396
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,840
But out of the blue, the hospital called
and asked me to come for treatment here.

397
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,880
They mentioned that it was
at the request of your friend.

398
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,880
They even provided her with a VIP room

399
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,120
and the best doctor they have.

400
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,920
Who's this friend of yours?

401
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,200
Well…

402
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,640
She takes care of me over there.

403
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,320
She's very kind to me.

404
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,240
I see.

405
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,640
Let me get that.

406
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,640
Hello.

407
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,400
Who wants to see me?

408
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,360
Hello.

409
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,440
Are you Earn?

410
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,480
Yes.

411
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,280
Lada called

412
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,520
and asked me to take care
of your mom's treatment.

413
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,280
Yes.

414
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,320
Lada told me.

415
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,680
Thank you very much.

416
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,040
Don't thank me.

417
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,520
My hands were tied.

418
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,280
I looked at your mom's medical records.

419
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,280
I will prepare a team
of the best doctors we have for her.

420
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,600
However, I need to talk to you
about something first.

421
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,080
What is it?

422
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,840
I know you are dating my daughter.

423
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,480
And I understand

424
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,720
that you can't stop a person
from loving someone.

425
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,960
But I have great hopes for Lada.

426
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,360
She's the ideal candidate for us

427
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,840
to entrust the hospital to.

428
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,400
What…

429
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,360
What are you asking of me?

430
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,680
Break up with Lada.

431
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,680
You and Lada

432
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,480
will never end up together.

433
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,760
You are too young to understand,

434
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,720
but I know my daughter.

435
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,160
She was just lonely.

436
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,960
She found you to keep her company.

437
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,480
Deep down,

438
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:40,120
she knows that she will have to marry
the man I choose for her after graduation.

439
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,840
You may not be aware,

440
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,600
but she began dating Dr. Wisanu

441
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,920
before moving abroad.

442
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,280
Doctor, you got a package from Thailand.

443
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,800
It's from someone named Wisanu.

444
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,120
Who's that?

445
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,840
No one.

446
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Listen.

447
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,760
I have to answer this call.

448
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,880
Hello, Nu.

449
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,240
Yes.

450
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,280
But…

451
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,200
she never mentioned him.

452
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,040
Why would she?

453
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,000
You're just a toy to her.

454
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,280
Lada won't mention him
until after graduation.

455
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,360
That's the reality you must face.

456
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,600
If you break up with Lada,

457
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,440
I promise to take great care of your mom.

458
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,160
You have to choose

459
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,960
between your mom's life

460
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,800
and that fake relationship.

461
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,520
Earn.

462
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,680
You should have told me
you were coming back.

463
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,640
I would have picked you up--

464
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,080
She began dating Dr. Wisanu
before moving abroad.

465
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,320
Are you going somewhere?

466
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,960
I came to pack my stuff.

467
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,040
I'm moving back to Thailand.

468
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,800
Earn.

469
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,760
What's wrong?

470
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,880
Why so sudden?

471
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,800
What about your study?

472
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,760
I've transferred my credits.
I'll finish up my studies there.

473
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,520
Let me go.

474
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,000
What's the matter?

475
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,080
I've met someone.

476
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,440
We're done.

477
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,040
Earn, I don't believe you.

478
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,640
I want to break up with you.

479
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,400
You are nothing
but a toy I've played with.

480
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,880
Just let me go.

481
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,720
-Earn.
-Let go.

482
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,240
Let me go.

483
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,320
Earn, tell me you are joking.

484
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,280
You're not leaving me, are you?

485
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,720
You're not dumping me, are you?

486
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,400
I don't like women. I like men.

487
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,680
I like men.

488
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,440
Do you understand?

489
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,600
What about the things we've been through?

490
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,360
What was that then?

491
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,520
I deceived you.

492
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,520
I knew you were rich so I approached you
to have a good life.

493
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,960
That's the truth.

494
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,640
But I can't put up with you anymore.

495
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,560
Let's not see each other again.

496
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,680
-Let me go.
-No.

497
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,080
Let me go.

498
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,040
Earn.

499
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,720
Please don't go.

500
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,680
-Let me go.
-Don't go.

501
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,240
-Let me go.
-No.

502
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,480
-Earn.
-Let go.

503
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,680
-Let go.
-Don't go.

504
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,840
How could you do this to me? Let me go!

505
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,200
Earn!

506
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,280
Earn, don't leave.

507
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,160
Earn.

508
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,320
Earn!

509
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,720
Earn!

510
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,960
Don't leave me!

511
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,200
Earn!

512
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,080
Come back!

513
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:11,000
Earn, what did I do?

514
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,160
Good morning, Love.

515
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,240
Good morning, Heart.

516
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,360
How could you do this to me?

517
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,400
Please stay.

518
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,000
Do you know what I wished for?

519
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,840
I wished for you
to keep loving me like this.

520
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,040
Will my wish come true?

521
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,520
No.

522
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,200
Earn, come back!

523
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,480
Is this the presenter

524
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,840
I have to shoot the ad with?

525
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,960
That's right, Doctor.

526
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,320
Her name is Sanitada or Earn.

527
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,680
She's the most popular rising star.

528
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,240
Then count me out of this project.

529
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,640
I stand by my word

530
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,480
that I will not shoot this ad.

531
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,720
Give me a reason.

532
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,600
I know you hate me.

533
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,960
That's right. I hate you so much.

534
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,440
Hello, Earn.

535
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,040
I'm honored to be working with you.

536
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,640
How about we find Lada a new girlfriend?

537
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,360
-Does it hurt?
-No.

538
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,560
It's very soft.

539
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,440
Lada had a hard time getting over her.

540
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,440
Why is that brat back
to rub salt in her wound?

541
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,960
I will keep coming back
until you give me a chance.

542
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,960
