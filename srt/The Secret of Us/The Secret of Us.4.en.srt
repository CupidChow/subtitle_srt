1
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,080
You have to be okay.

2
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,760
-Hello, Doctor.
-Not okay.

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,720
I know you don't want to see me

4
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,760
but I still want to see you.

5
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm in love with someone else.

6
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
And I'll be marrying that person soon.

7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,720
Do it. I'd like to see

8
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,160
if you can kiss a man.

9
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,440
Hey, Lada. Are your feelings coming back?

10
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,240
-No.
-Nice to finally meet you.

11
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,160
"Eng and Earn" is trending.

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,600
You two are a new ship.

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,039
Today, we're a ship,

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,960
but in the future,
we could become a real couple.

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,960
FROM A SHIP, TO A COUPLE

16
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,640
Don't you two have work to do?

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
Are you hired to work

18
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,720
or gossip about celebrities?

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
-Sorry.
-She's scary.

20
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,960
FROM A SHIP, TO A COUPLE

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,240
Oh, my. They have great chemistry.

22
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,760
Eng and Earn.

23
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,200
How cute.

24
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,680
Hello.

25
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,240
What's so exciting, Rossarin?

26
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,440
I should get back to work.

27
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,440
Sure.

28
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,320
FROM A SHIP, TO A COUPLE

29
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,520
Look at this,

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
the problem might be solving itself

31
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
with the hashtag "Eng and Earn."

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,960
Are you such a fan of those two?

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,480
A fan, my butt.

34
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm just glad
that celebrity has a ship now.

35
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,200
She'll finally stop bothering Lada.

36
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,360
Resentment for a friend?

37
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,640
Don't you resent her?

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,840
I resent her more than you do.

39
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,240
I'll never forget how Lada
almost lost herself because of that girl.

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,680
Then consider this good news.

41
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,480
Now that she has a partner,

42
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
our friend can move on
instead of going in circles.

43
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,160
She's hung up

44
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,720
-on that girl--
-Hey.

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,360
What?

46
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,400
What?

47
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,600
Say it.

48
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,680
Why are you tapping?

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
Stop.

50
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,040
What?

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,040
-Why didn't you say something?
-I did.

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,480
Hey, Lada.

53
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,240
-Hey.
-Hey.

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,440
Drink some water.

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Is this your favorite dish, Lada?

56
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,080
Yes, it is.

57
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,800
I remember how delicious it was.

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,600
Let's eat. I'm starving.

59
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,880
-What?
-"Eng and Earn" is trending.

60
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,680
You two are a new ship.

61
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,120
"Eng and Earn" is trending!

62
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,240
Today, we're a ship,

63
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,680
but in the future,

64
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,080
we could become a real couple.

65
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,880
VOICE CALL

66
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,760
What?

67
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,240
Hello, Engfah, where are you?

68
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,480
Wow, quick call back.

69
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm out drinking with Yoon and the crew.

70
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,200
I saw someone you might want to see

71
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,680
so I sent the picture.

72
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,320
Engfah.

73
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,000
Can you share the location with me?
I'll join you.

74
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,320
-Sure.
-Thank you.

75
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,640
See you.

76
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,040
Where are you going?

77
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
You just got home.

78
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,240
The household spirit has barely seen
your face and you're leaving again?

79
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,360
Suzie.

80
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
Please.

81
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,080
You just got out of the hospital.

82
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,880
I just want to join Engfah.

83
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,720
I won't drink.

84
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,720
I'll take care of myself.

85
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,440
Please, Suzie, I promise.

86
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,560
Please.

87
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,000
Please, Suzie.

88
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,040
Please, Suzie.

89
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,560
Fine.

90
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,960
What was that for?

91
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,520
I love you so much.

92
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,640
I'll get changed then.

93
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
See you later.

94
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,040
What's up, Doctor?

95
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,960
Why are you sitting alone?

96
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,920
Sadly, I'm not alone anymore.

97
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,360
Earn is on her way.

98
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,520
I thought you might want to know.

99
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,120
Wait. Don't start insulting me just yet.

100
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,480
I told her not to come
since she just got discharged.

101
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,920
But she wouldn't listen.

102
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,640
How about this?

103
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,160
Should I let Earn sit here with you

104
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
when she arrives?

105
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,480
Where are you going?

106
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm going to a different bar.

107
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
I don't think
I can chill out here anymore.

108
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,640
Lada.

109
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,360
Sorry, I kept you waiting.

110
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,400
Let's go somewhere else, Tan.

111
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,560
Where?

112
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,480
I fought through traffic to get here.
Let's just stay.

113
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,600
I won't bother you anymore then.

114
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,960
Have fun.

115
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Hey.

116
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,600
What did she say to you?

117
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,880
Nothing.

118
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
-One Manhattan.
-Coming right up.

119
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,360
Easy, there.

120
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,560
Gosh.

121
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,440
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

122
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,200
Cheers.

123
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,040
Clink.

124
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,440
Sip it slowly.

125
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,880
Lada, sip slowly.

126
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,960
Lada.

127
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,120
-Hey.
-Same again.

128
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,960
Lada, slow down.

129
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,360
Are you drinking all that?

130
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,960
This is too much.

131
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Stop.

132
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,440
Lada, don't drink all that.

133
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,640
You've had enough.

134
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,040
No more. That's enough.

135
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,200
You're done.

136
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,200
-Give it to me.
-Don't spill it.

137
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,840
You're done. That's enough.

138
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,400
How can you drink that?

139
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm going to the restroom.

140
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,680
Finish those four shots,

141
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,880
then we're going home.

142
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay?

143
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,040
Sure.

144
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
No more after these.

145
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,760
-Don't let her order any more drinks.
-Sure.

146
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,280
-One Pink Me Up, please.
-Coming right up.

147
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,560
Are you here alone?

148
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,880
Do you see me with someone?

149
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,640
I see you're here alone.

150
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,960
Have you been waiting long, darling?

151
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,040
You're very drunk.

152
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,640
How many drinks have you had?

153
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,800
Oh, no.

154
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,560
I thought you were single.

155
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,080
You're dating a celebrity.

156
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,480
Here's your drink.

157
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,840
I should go then.

158
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,320
Doctor.

159
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,640
You're very drunk. You've had enough.

160
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,880
-Give it to me.
-Doctor.

161
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,880
No, that's enough.

162
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,320
Oh, no, she's wasted.

163
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,640
It's dangerous
to leave her alone like this.

164
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,840
Suzie.

165
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,600
I'll handle this.

166
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,960
Go have fun with Engfah.

167
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,480
What should I tell her?

168
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,880
Tell her whatever you want

169
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,240
and take care of her bill, please.

170
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Let's go.

171
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,480
-Come on.
-Okay.

172
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,400
Can you take her?

173
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,080
My dear.

174
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,680
-How much is the bill?
-One moment, please.

175
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,200
The total comes down to 8,500 baht.

176
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
What?

177
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,760
-Did you say 8,500 baht?
-Yes.

178
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,320
Excuse me.

179
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,120
Where's my friend?

180
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,880
-Dr. Fahlada?
-Yes.

181
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
She left.

182
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,280
-Where did she go?
-She left with Earn.

183
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
Don't worry, Earn will take care of her.

184
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,200
That's what I'm concerned about.

185
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,680
Wait.

186
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,200
Pay her tab first.

187
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,240
Okay.

188
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,600
-You take cards, right?
-Yes.

189
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,880
Awesome.

190
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,120
Doctor, why did you get so drunk?

191
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,360
Doctor.

192
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,840
You're very drunk.

193
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,720
How did you get so drunk?

194
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,120
Earn…

195
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,720
Doctor.

196
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,040
Where are you going?

197
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,440
I'm leaving.

198
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,480
Doctor.

199
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
Doctor.

200
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,600
Please stay.

201
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,800
We have a lot to catch up on.

202
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,440
No, we don't.

203
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,600
No.

204
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,400
What about last night?

205
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,560
Move aside.

206
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,200
I'm leaving.

207
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Move.

208
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,040
Get out of the way.

209
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,480
What was that?

210
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,480
What's going on?

211
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,800
Spill the tea.

212
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
Don't leave anything out.

213
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,560
Well.

214
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,640
It's nothing much.

215
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,080
The doctor and I used to date.

216
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
What?

217
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,640
Did you use to date? When?

218
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,120
Four years ago, when I studied abroad.

219
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,200
So the lover you mentioned

220
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,240
was Dr. Fahlada?

221
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,560
Tell me more.

222
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,560
You said you broke up.
What was that about?

223
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,440
We broke up because I dumped her.

224
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,960
What?

225
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,840
You dumped her? Why?

226
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,960
Well, it was…

227
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,000
It was silly of me.

228
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,320
But I regret it now
and want to patch things up.

229
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,760
This means

230
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,200
you brought her home
after you left the bar

231
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,880
last night

232
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,720
and let her spend the night here.

233
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,440
Yes.

234
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,320
Gosh.

235
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,080
Tell me.

236
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,520
Last night,

237
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,800
did you rekindle the old flame?

238
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Yes.

239
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,240
My goodness.

240
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,040
Why didn't you tell me?

241
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,640
I accepted many jobs with Engfah for you.

242
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,440
But you're in a relationship now.

243
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,640
What are you talking about?
It's not a relationship.

244
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,200
-She is still mad at me.
-Is that so?

245
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,160
You slept together.

246
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,680
She might have just slept with me
because she was drunk.

247
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,320
Why is your life so complicated?

248
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,320
Does this mean Engfah is out?

249
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,360
No, Suzie.

250
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,400
There's nothing going on
between me and Engfah.

251
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,440
You might not have feelings for her,

252
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,360
but she might have feelings for you.

253
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,480
I assure you, there's nothing
going on between us.

254
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,200
What would you say if I told you

255
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,680
I had a crush on you?

256
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,680
I don't feel that way about you.

257
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,280
That's fine.

258
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,480
It will stay as my little fantasy.

259
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,280
You can ask yourself

260
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,920
if you have feelings for me

261
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,880
after we know each other better.

262
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,880
I already have someone I love.

263
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,800
It's Dr. Fahlada.

264
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,200
Dr. Fahlada?

265
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,920
That rich dermatologist?

266
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Yes.

267
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,720
We used to date.

268
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,600
But we broke up

269
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,480
because of my immaturity.

270
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,600
Is that so?

271
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,040
What's your plan?

272
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,560
Do you want her back?

273
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,760
Then I'll help you.

274
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
-This part? Then next…
-Yes.

275
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,040
Is everything ready?

276
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,920
-Yes.
-Where's Ratee?

277
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,080
-Ratee, let's run through it.
-Okay.

278
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,480
Over there, quickly.

279
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,320
Come on.

280
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,000
Rehearse the dialogue.

281
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,560
-A dry run?
-Yes.

282
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,600
I told you I have nothing to do with it.

283
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,360
Liar.

284
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
That's your line.

285
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,400
Say it.

286
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,360
Liar.

287
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,560
You're so evil.

288
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,160
You're so evil.

289
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,760
I know what you are up to.

290
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,400
I know what you are up to.

291
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,480
Okay, now, after Earn turns around,

292
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,760
grab her shoulder

293
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,800
gently

294
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,920
and slap her

295
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,600
but keep your distance.

296
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,960
I'll use the camera angle
to make it realistic.

297
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,480
-Okay? Don't slap her for real.
-Okay.

298
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,320
Let's rehearse.

299
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,640
Five, four, three, two, action.

300
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
I told you I have nothing to do with it.

301
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,120
Liar. You're so evil.

302
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,040
I know what you are doing.

303
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,440
It's "I know what you are up to."

304
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,320
I know what you are up to.

305
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Wait.

306
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,480
Hey.

307
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,120
Gosh.

308
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,640
Are you hurt?

309
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,960
Sorry, I didn't mean to. I miscalculated…

310
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,360
Did you slap her on purpose, Ratee?

311
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,920
No, Engfah.

312
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,200
Why would I do that?

313
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,640
Why slap her so hard during rehearsal?

314
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,520
Exactly, that was too much.

315
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,040
Are you jealous of Earn?
That was a cheap shot.

316
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,920
Are you jealous?

317
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,200
Ratee is jealous of you guys?

318
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,960
Are you trying to pick a fight?

319
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,080
Bring it on.

320
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,400
I'll fight you.

321
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,840
Let's wrestle. Come on.

322
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,400
-Let's do it.
-Bring it.

323
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,120
-Bring it.
-Come on.

324
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,400
Wait. Stop.

325
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,160
I'm fine.

326
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,280
Don't let this go, Earn.

327
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,760
Trust me, I'm fine.

328
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,360
Let's not fight.

329
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,880
Ake, Earth, let's roll the camera.

330
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,560
Okay, if you're fine, let's shoot.

331
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,360
I'm changing the script
to no more slapping.

332
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,240
-Okay? No more slapping.
-Got it.

333
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,840
Earn, turn around and walk away.

334
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,600
Let's roll.

335
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,200
Get ready, everyone.

336
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,320
Okay.

337
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,960
Ready?

338
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,800
Ready?

339
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,680
All done.

340
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,440
Please follow the nurse
to get your medication.

341
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,240
Thank you, Doctor.

342
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,920
Let me help with your buttons.

343
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,240
One hot Americano with no sugar
for Dr. Fahlada, please.

344
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,200
No, I want…

345
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,880
a hot latte, please.

346
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,040
So you take your coffee with milk now.

347
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,640
I got sick of having the same old thing.

348
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,400
One caramel macchiato, 25% sweet
for Earn please.

349
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,600
Engfah.

350
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,920
You remembered!

351
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,520
In that case, for you,

352
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,080
it must be an iced latte, 50% sweet,

353
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,880
right?

354
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,800
You're the best.

355
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,160
You remember how I like my coffee.

356
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,080
I used to work in a coffee shop.
I have a great memory.

357
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,480
Look, they are in love.

358
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,760
I ship them.

359
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,400
Doctor.

360
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,120
Hey.

361
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,760
It's you, Ratee.

362
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,560
Are you here to pick me up for lunch?

363
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,040
I… Yes.

364
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,600
Perfect.

365
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,360
I know a great place.

366
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,680
I'd love to take you there.

367
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,240
What is it called?

368
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,640
I Think You'll Like It.

369
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,560
Of course I'll like it.

370
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,320
You're taking me there after all.

371
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,480
Let's go.

372
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,840
In that case, let me take off…

373
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,000
my coat before we leave.

374
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,640
I'll help you get changed.

375
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,960
Let's go.

376
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,800
"I Think You'll Like It."

377
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,159
Yes.

378
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,719
Is that the name of the restaurant?

379
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,159
Is something wrong?

380
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,199
No, nothing.

381
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,199
I thought you were talking to me.

382
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,320
You're funny.

383
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,199
I am.

384
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,400
Let's go, I have to get back to work soon.

385
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,880
-Please.
-Yes, let's go.

386
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,760
Wait for me.

387
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,760
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT

388
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,000
I can't decide what to order.

389
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,320
Why are they serving food
before the customer has arrived?

390
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,800
I ordered your favorite dish.

391
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,440
Gosh, son-in-law eggs,

392
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,040
my favorite!

393
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,720
I know you like it

394
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,240
so I ordered it in advance.

395
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,600
Shall we eat?

396
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,640
Sure.

397
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,560
I'll take…

398
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,120
this,

399
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
this,

400
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,160
and this.

401
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,360
Let me serve you.

402
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
What do you want to eat?

403
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,080
-Try this. I want you to eat first.
-Aren't you eating?

404
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,840
-Okay, I'll try it.
-Good.

405
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,080
Do you want a bite?

406
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,160
No?

407
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,640
Thank you.

408
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,960
Ratee.

409
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,960
The spaghetti here is delicious.

410
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,600
Try it.

411
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,240
Yes.

412
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
Thank you.

413
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,600
Are you trying to make me fat?

414
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,560
Actually, your figure is just perfect now.

415
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,000
You will still look cute
even if you gain weight.

416
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,960
Thank you.

417
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,640
Their stir-fried glass noodles
are to die for.

418
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,800
I'll get you some.

419
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,360
I'll do it myself.

420
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,600
It's okay. I'll feed you.

421
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,960
Come on.

422
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,640
Open wide.

423
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,400
Is it good?

424
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Yes.

425
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,320
Do you want to try the stir-fried basil?

426
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,600
It's delicious.

427
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,640
Thank you.

428
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,000
I'll leave it here.

429
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,920
It's more hygienic.

430
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,800
Thank you.

431
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,120
Eat up.

432
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,280
Their food is very delicious.

433
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,760
You're right. I love all the dishes.

434
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm so full.

435
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,160
I didn't know
Dr. Fahlada was so considerate.

436
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,080
She picked the perfect restaurant.

437
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,200
What about you?
Do you have a crush on Engfah?

438
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,240
Why do you ask?

439
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,760
I'm just curious

440
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,240
if you guys are really a couple.

441
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,280
It's none of your business.

442
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,720
You're right.

443
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,440
My concern only lies
on my future girlfriend, Dr. Fahlada.

444
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,560
You sound confident.

445
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,120
Of course.

446
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,080
Dr. Fahlada is beautiful,

447
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,880
smart, and rich.

448
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,320
She's perfect for me.

449
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,880
Have you asked the doctor
if she likes you?

450
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,080
I don't need to ask.

451
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,360
She invited me today. It's obvious.

452
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,400
What's the matter? Are you jealous?

453
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,480
But well,

454
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,320
someone like you can only do so much.

455
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,120
Someone of the doctor's caliber

456
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,280
wouldn't be interested in someone
from the low-end market like you.

457
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,280
If I'm from the low-end market,

458
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,520
you must be from the black market.

459
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,920
Sorry to say this.

460
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,840
But no matter how dark it gets,

461
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,760
I can still see

462
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,760
what kind of person

463
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,840
you really are.

464
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,640
You're rotten.

465
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,760
Excuse me, here's your fruit.

466
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,200
Thank you.

467
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,720
Earn is really cute, isn't she?

468
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,560
What do you want?

469
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,560
I just wanted to ask your opinion, Doctor.

470
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,880
What do you think?

471
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,440
I don't know.

472
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,720
I heard that
Earn is the hospital's new presenter.

473
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,920
I thought you chose her yourself.

474
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,040
No.

475
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,920
I see.

476
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,120
Even if you didn't choose her,

477
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,080
someone else would anyway.

478
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,680
Because she's beautiful,

479
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,320
cute,

480
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,480
and kind.

481
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,400
Don't tell anyone about this.

482
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm trying to pursue Earn.

483
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,040
Wish me luck.

484
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,360
Slap me.

485
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,800
Go ahead, I dare you.

486
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,600
How dare you insult me?

487
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,040
I wasn't insulting you.
I was telling the truth.

488
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,880
Do you think I didn't know
you slapped me on purpose?

489
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,800
I just didn't want to waste
everyone's time.

490
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Good, I'm glad you know
how much I hate you.

491
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,320
I hate your guts.

492
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,360
All right then.

493
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,520
Stop it! What are you doing?

494
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,440
Back off.

495
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,360
Stop. Go away.

496
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,680
Go away. Stop!

497
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
We're even.

498
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,440
Now you know I hate you too.

499
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,080
What happened to you?

500
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,840
It was Ratee again, wasn't it?

501
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,160
I need to teach her a lesson.

502
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,800
It's okay, Engfah.

503
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,120
I don't want any trouble.

504
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,600
Fine.

505
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,480
Let's go home.

506
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,080
Okay.

507
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,560
If that's what you want.

508
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,600
I've already paid. Let's go.

509
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,760
See you next time, Doctor.

510
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,880
Let's chat again soon.

511
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,480
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT

512
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,400
Engfah, what's so funny?

513
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,760
I was just thinking about the person I was
teasing and I couldn't help but laugh.

514
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,360
Engfah, weren't you a bit harsh
on the doctor?

515
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,560
Gosh, she doesn't get people like us.

516
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,400
She uses her brain to treat patients.

517
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,520
She can't keep up with people like us.

518
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,800
That's why I have to push her hard

519
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,840
so she realizes.

520
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Should I teach the person
who splashed you a lesson?

521
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,640
She's brainless too.

522
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,120
I took care of it.

523
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,880
The faucet broke. I got all wet.

524
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,440
Broken faucet

525
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,800
or broken character?

526
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,000
What did you say?

527
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,960
Check, please.

528
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,160
It has already been paid.

529
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,200
Who paid the bill?

530
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,880
Engfah did.

531
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,160
She wanted to treat you.

532
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,800
I forgot my phone.

533
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,960
Did you forget your phone?

534
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,800
Yes.

535
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,840
Here it is, my phone.

536
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,240
Doctor.

537
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,520
Did you come just to get your phone?

538
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,960
Yes.

539
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
Of course.

540
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,960
Wait.

541
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,800
Can you stay a bit longer?

542
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,280
Please?

543
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,480
Please?

544
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,520
Please?

545
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,920
Please.

546
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,960
Why?

547
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,000
Just to keep me company.

548
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,200
It won't take long.

549
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,760
Unless you're afraid

550
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,240
of your own feelings.

551
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,080
-Hey!
-Are you hurt?

552
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,360
Take her to the hospital immediately.

553
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,400
Stay calm.

554
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,680
I'll take care of you.

555
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,720
It'll hurt a bit.

556
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,960
I want to keep getting hurt like this.

557
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,640
-Why?
-So you'll keep paying attention to me.

558
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,400
I heard that

559
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,040
you and Earn lived together
when you were abroad.

560
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,480
Did Earn tell you that?

561
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,600
