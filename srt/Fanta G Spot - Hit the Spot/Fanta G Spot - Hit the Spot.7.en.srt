1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,344
I want to kiss you.

2
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,465
Stop me whenever you want.

3
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,473
You once asked if I found you easy.

4
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,851
I find you comfortable.

5
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,479
I'm comfortable around you.

6
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,106
Telling a man that
you're comfortable with him

7
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,150
isn't a compliment.

8
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,238
It is when it's coming from me.

9
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:39,052
You know how dogs roll over on their backs

10
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,286
to people they're comfortable with?

11
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,664
That's how it is for me.

12
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,835
I wear my heart on my sleeve
when I'm with you.

13
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,299
I'm not embarrassed to let you see
the clumsy and messy side of me.

14
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,054
Well, aren't you a good girl?

15
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,723
Hey.

16
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,606
Thank you.

17
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,860
I somehow feel more special

18
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,488
than I did before.

19
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,699
I feel liberated,

20
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,578
and I have a new sense of confidence.

21
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,331
I'm grateful too.

22
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,928
I suddenly felt curious about
what he hoped to find

23
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,431
by spending time with me.

24
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,852
I wonder what will happen to us

25
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,646
once he finds what he's looking for.

26
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,696

27
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,240

MS. SON HEE-JAE

00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,829
Yes?

30
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,873
Are you up for it today?

31
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,667
Sure.

32
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,161
And just like that,
we agreed to be friends.

33
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,126
Friends with benefits, that is.

There was a time when sex
was considered a taboo subject.

39
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,983
They say times have changed,

40
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,861

still seem to exist.

Good luck to everyone

Damn hormones. Take a break, will you?

00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,750
Someone who is hygienic

You can't enjoy sex when you're worried

This is Hit the Spot.

Our show has 170,000 subscribers?

62
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,739
It totally blew up.

63
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,365
We're a smash hit.

64
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,559
You can say that again. We're on fire.

65
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,521
See? I said you were perfect for the job.

66
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,189
I knew it'd be a hit.

67
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,567
I can't believe we topped the charts
in just two months.

68
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,837
- Mr. Sim.
- Yes?

69
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,322
- Do we get a bonus?
- A bonus?

70
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,116
In exchange for your month-long vacation?

71
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,803
- No, of course not.
- Sorry I said that.

72
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,287
The vacation days are enough.

73
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:56,559
I wasn't promised
vacation days or a bonus.

74
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,168
You're not the one people are eating up.

75
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,064
Forget all that.
Let's go away this weekend.

76
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,090
I know lots of delicious restaurants.

77
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,133
Yi-kyung, what are you in the mood for?

78
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,594
I think I'll be sick that day.

79
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,223
Can we drive out to the ocean?

80
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,618
- That sounds great.
- Right?

81
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,685
The ocean?

82
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,061
Good idea!

83
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,040
Let's go see some hot guys by the ocean.

84
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,458
I love it!

85
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,377
Nice.

86
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,963
- I'm so excited!
- What should we eat?

87
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,173
Let's eat hoe since we'll be by the ocean.

88
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,635
- Right.
- Let's have spicy fish stew and soju.

89
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,220
- It'll be a blast.
- What about you?

90
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,079
- Anything's fine with me.
- I see.

91
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,724
Yi-kyung, you don't look too happy.

92
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,017
- What? I'm fine.
- Stop that.

93
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,185
She doesn't look happy.

94
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,003
- What are you doing?
- Instagram.

95
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,724
- Hello.
- Hello.

96
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:01,899
What was that?

97
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,192
What do you mean?

98
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,712
You'd better watch it.

99
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,654
Be careful, or he'll grow on you.

100
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:08,739
Jeez.

101
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,282
Didn't you tell me to have fun?

102
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,827
You apparently have no idea
how attached you can get after doing it.

103
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,245
Doing it?

104
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,515
It's not what you think.

105
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,186
Yi-kyung, let me explain.
When a man and a woman--

106
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,212
Shut it, will you?

107
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,630
What was that?

108
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,825
SURGERY, OFF DAY, OFF DAY

109
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,684
HIT THE SPOT RECORDING DAY

110
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,853
Recovery will take about two weeks.

111
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,497
When's your day off?

112
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,291
I'll work around your schedule this time.

113
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,260
How does tomorrow sound?

114
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,179
I'm in.

115
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,029
How about we meet up during the day?

116
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,448
Sounds good.

117
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,161
I was surprised that
you wanted to meet outside.

118
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,081
- There's something I want to do.
- Which is?

119
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,709
Well...

120
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,254
Let's start by holding hands.

121
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,338
Here.

122
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,598
What should we do?

123
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,433
This way.

124
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,994
HANDMADE RICE CORN DOG

125
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,311
- Corn dogs?
- Sure.

126
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,105
- Two corn dogs, please.
- Okay.

127
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,193
This is so good.

128
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,695
It's all over your lips.

129
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,798
What do you think of these?

130
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,235
- They're pretty.
- Really?

131
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,219
Do they look nice on me?

132
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,347
- It's cute.
- Do I look okay?

133
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,933
Sweet, right?

134
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,062
One, two, three.

135
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,869
This is weird.

136
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,540
I'm actually nervous.

137
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,334
Me too.

138
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,927
I want to try

139
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,097
other things with you besides sex.

140
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,557
Like what?

141
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:13,896
Laughing, crying,
and getting angry over little things.

142
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:18,108
And maybe after that,
we can fall asleep together.

143
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,987
Girlfriend and boyfriend role-playing?

144
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,740
Is that your sexual fantasy?

145
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,163
How dense are you?

146
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,712
I never invite sex partners into my house.

147
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:40,839
I see.

148
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,301
To be honest, I was startled
when you invited me home.

149
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,220
Then why...

150
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,721
Why do you think?

151
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,232
When was the last time
you were in a relationship?

152
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,489
What is it? You don't want to tell me?

153
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,662
If you're talking about
briefing each other every day

154
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:15,791
and sharing what you had for lunch
for no particular reason,

155
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,418
then I can't say I've been in one.

156
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,921
You've never been in a relationship?

157
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,507
Why? Is there something wrong with that?

158
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,778
No, I'm not saying it's wrong.

159
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,053
I still know how it works.

160
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,973
Romantic relationships are predictable.

161
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,644
You fall head over heels for one another,
cry after arguments, and hurt each other

162
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:37,938
until the relationship ends.

163
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,195
Right.

164
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,788
Relationships are so predictable.

165
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,335
You should go now.

166
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,312
Has this always been

167
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,606
bitter?

168
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,503
It's so bitter.

169
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:29,048
Let me get this straight.
That hit-and-run guy who waxes

170
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,909
is the doctor who wiped off your sweat
and tucked you in?

171
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,287
That's insane!

172
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,415
What is this?
A scene from a romantic movie?

173
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,709
So what happened after that?

174
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:43,712
Well,

175
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,131
that's pretty much it.

176
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:49,593
I ended it.

177
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,932
I won't be coming around to see you again.

178
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,935
Wait, you're ending things like this?

179
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,645
Was I that bad?

180
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,021
Did you forget

181
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:02,940
that we met as sex partners?

182
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,943
The arrangement is over
when someone wants out.

183
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,986
- But--
- I had fun today.

184
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,280
Do you mind leaving now?

185
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,334
Okay.

186
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,356
You...

187
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,861
You like him, don't you?

188
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,156
I just...

189
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,079
I just want to be happy again.

190
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,335
I want to go on dates...

191
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,047
with the man I like...

192
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,135
and fall in love.

193
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,846
I want that.

194
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:20,225
Then make it happen. What's the problem?

195
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,894
Exactly.

196
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,146
What's the problem, then?

197
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,526
Did you tell him how you feel?

198
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,699
I still have a long way to go.

199
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,286
I'm scared.

200
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,372
I'm terrified, actually.

201
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,502
He won't know unless you tell him.

202
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,381
Once you tell him how you feel,

203
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:55,177
it'll be up to him to make a decision.

204
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,765
What are you afraid of?
You're the great Lee Mi-na, remember?

205
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,563
Whether you decide to tell him
how you feel or not,

206
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,525
you're free to do whatever you want.

207
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:14,196
I'll support whatever decision you make.

208
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,697
You know that, right?

209
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:17,908
Of course, I do.

210
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:21,745
Cheers.

211
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:23,580
Cheers.

212
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:33,757
So tell me.

213
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,926
What are you going to do about it?

214
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,553
About what?

215
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,263
Kang In-chan.

216
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,098
Jeez.

217
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,641
Aren't you pretty much dating?

218
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,811
We're not dating. Don't be ridiculous.

219
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,331
Is that what he said too?

220
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,624
That you're not dating?

221
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:50,959
She's right, you know.

222
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:54,087
You and In-chan have been
joined at the hip lately.

223
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,362
Are you guys together?

224
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,949
Joined at the hip?

225
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:01,970
Unbelievable.

226
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,681
So while your friend was in pain
from butthole surgery

227
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,432
and couldn't even enjoy a drink,

228
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,292
you were busy getting it on?

229
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,460
No, it wasn't like that at all.

230
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,172
And we're not together.
We're just friends.

231
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,217
WRITER KANG IN-CHAN

232
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,904
See what I mean?

233
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,346
Friends, my foot.

234
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,807
Stop. Don't you dare.

235
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,393
Hello?

236
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,645
Ms. Son, where are you?

237
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,191
Hello?

238
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,239
Why didn't you want me there?

239
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,784
The owner there and Mi-na...

240
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,411
What about them?

241
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,764
Forget it. It's nothing.

242
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,040
Why? What is it?

243
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:51,668
They kept saying that we were dating,

244
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,378
which is just absurd.

245
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,298
I just didn't want them
to get the wrong idea.

246
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,198
Do you have any sexual fantasies?

247
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,617
That's a random question. Why do you ask?

248
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,893
Because I want us to try and act them out.

249
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,605
Then what's your sexual fantasy?

250
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,360
Car and the ocean.

251
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,570
Car sex by the ocean?

252
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,408
What do you drive?
Does it have a big trunk?

253
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,285
Yes, it does.

254
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,538
Is it really big?

255
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,354
What about you?
What's your sexual fantasy?

256
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,420
I'll make it happen.

257
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,340
For me,

258
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,510
it's having sex with someone I love.

259
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,637
That's my fantasy.

260
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,599
I guess that's not something
I can help you with.

261
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,399
Is there anything else
you want to know about me?

262
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:56,900
Anything else?

263
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,152
Is there anything else I should know?

264
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,239
Of course not.

265
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,530
Look at the ocean!

266
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:26,990
- Gosh!
- It's beautiful!

267
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:30,827
Being somewhere this beautiful
with you three annoys me so much.

268
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:31,786
Seriously.

269
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,204
Don't you have a driver's license?

270
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,707
I've spent my whole life
in the passenger seat.

271
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,024
It's the story of my life.

272
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,734
Let's go!

273
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,569
It's so beautiful.

274
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,573
Make sure I look good.

275
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,010
One, two, three.

276
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,493
One, two, three.

277
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,245
One, two, three.

278
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,330
Done.

279
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:52,748
- Already?
- Yes.

280
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,018
Let me take a look.

281
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,853
Are you kidding me?

282
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,481
Put more effort into it.
Try taking it again!

283
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,423
- Again?
- Make me look pretty.

284
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,717
All right. Get on with it.

285
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,844
One.

286
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:07,429
Two.

287
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:08,698
Three.

288
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:11,308
You look like a soggy meatball
in every shot.

289
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:12,827
A meatball?

290
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,186
Or maybe an octopus?

291
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,997
I'm going to kill you.

292
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,832
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Get over here.

293
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,150
- Catch me if you can!
- Get back here.

294
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:21,360
Get over here!

295
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:30,678
WRITER KANG IN-CHAN
How's the workshop?

296
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:31,662
What's this?

297
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,622
Are you talking every day now?

298
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,101
Draw a clear line
before one of you gets hurt.

299
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,895
I told you it's not like that.

300
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,295
Unbelievable.

301
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,173
Wait a minute.

302
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,151
Isn't that Mr. Kang?

303
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,009
What?

304
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,223
- Catch me if you can!
- Get back here.

305
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:52,599
Get over here!

306
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,268
- Sir...
- You little brat.

307
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,105
Mr. Kang?

308
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:01,000
- Hi, everyone.
- Gosh, Mr. Kang.

309
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,735
I thought you couldn't come.
What a surprise.

310
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:04,945
This is amazing.

311
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:08,115
See? I told you he likes you.

312
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,577
What brings you by, Mr. Kang?

313
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:13,888
It's obvious, of course.

314
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:17,416
He's the reason
our podcast has been blowing up.

315
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,461
I would've been really upset
if you hadn't shown up.

316
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,714
A previous engagement got canceled, so...

317
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:25,650
I hope I'm not intruding.

318
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,569
Gosh, of course not.

319
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,678
It's an honor to have you here, Mr. Kang.

320
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:33,241
I booked us a table
at a nearby restaurant I know.

321
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,451
- Is that okay with everyone?
- Sure.

322
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,786
I really love hoe.

323
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,788
Do you? Shall we get going, then?

324
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,273
I want to have octopus too.

325
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,001
Shall we, Mr. Meatball?

326
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:43,859
Let's go.

327
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,162
Are you happy to see me?

328
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,331
Of course not.

329
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:11,070
Mr. Sim, have some octopus.

330
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:11,988
- Octopus?
- Yes.

331
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,805
It'll be like an octopus
eating an octopus.

332
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,825
Look at you all excited.

333
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,202
Have your fill, everyone.

334
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:18,870
- Thank you.
- Gosh, Mr. Kang.

335
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,021
You're so generous.
This stuff is expensive.

336
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:30,715
Eat up.

337
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,450
See? I told you he likes you.

338
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:39,831
Mi-na, please dig in.

339
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,710
I don't think that's the case.

340
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:46,022
Let's raise our glasses.

341
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:49,526
To the number one podcast show,
Hit the Spot.

342
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,485
Cheers!

343
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:51,903
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

344
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,220
Nice!

345
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,116
Hey, I saw that. You didn't drink any.

346
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,433
What's that all about?

347
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,231
- This melts in your mouth, doesn't it?
- Right.

348
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,151
Mr. Kang, let's play a game.

349
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,380
How about Truth or Dare?

350
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:11,238
What?

351
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,132
Truth or Dare among us five?

352
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,325
That sounds like fun. Let's do it.

353
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,912
If we catch you lying,
you'll have to drink as a punishment.

354
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,791
I'll go first. It's rated R.

355
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,420
Who has done it in a car?

356
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:31,526
Do it with an open sunroof
underneath the stars.

357
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,610
It's mind-blowing.

358
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,386
You did it in a parking lot?

359
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,265
In the parking lot of a public park
right before dawn.

360
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,809
Okay, I'm next.

361
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,436
At the top of a mountain.

362
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:45,248
What? If you want to do it there,
that means you need to hike.

363
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:50,003
The cold breeze hitting your legs
feels really refreshing.

364
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,238
Besides, you can drive up to the top.

365
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:54,364
How about this?

366
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,409
Where did you have the best sex?

367
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,179
Hold on a second.

368
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,205
You and that cutesy tone.

369
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,332
Are you dating someone?

370
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,042
Dating?

371
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,228
Why bother doing that?

372
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,670
Ms. Son, are you dating someone?

373
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:16,970
Why bother dating
when it's useless and full of obligations?

374
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:19,598
Me?

375
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,327
Don't be ridiculous. Of course not.

376
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,162
I don't believe you.

377
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:26,873
- There's something different about you.
- Like what?

378
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,815
Whatever. You big fat liar.

379
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,421
Her eyes just got huge!
Look at that expression!

380
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:34,672
Something's going on.

381
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,174
Right? I'm sure of it.

382
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,115
I agree.

383
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,535
Is there something going on?

384
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,873
There's nothing going on!

385
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,102
And you...

386
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,003
Why are you drinking so much?

387
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:51,773
This isn't good.

388
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,340
You should go to the restroom.

389
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,735
Why? I'm perfectly sober.

390
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,695
Besides, you lied. So drink up.

391
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,947
What are you talking about?

392
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,157
You really need to go to the restroom.

393
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,992
- Come on. I'll take you.
- No.

394
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,411
Move it, will you? Come on.

395
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,520
Come on. On your feet.

396
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:07,896
What the...

397
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,583
I can't believe it. How could you?

398
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:12,359
Do you have any idea how...

399
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:15,112
What?

400
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:16,905
Mi-na!

401
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:22,035
Mi-na!

402
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:27,624
What in the world? Where did she go?

403
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,856
BIG EVE CLINIC

404
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,882
BIG EVE CLINIC
EMERGENCY CARE

405
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,527
Hey, Dr. Cha.

406
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:57,988
Are you drunk?

407
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,842
Yes, I'm wasted.

408
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,327
You're so clueless
that it's not even funny.

409
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:08,248
You don't understand anything, do you?

410
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,461
Are you sure you meant to call me?

411
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:14,505
Yes!

412
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,216
Cha Woo-jae. That's your name.

413
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,642
I miss you.

414
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:40,030
I want to love you...

415
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:45,327
and be loved by you.

416
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:50,874
I know

417
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:56,171
that love can be predictable and fickle.

418
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:03,095
But I want to give love another chance
with someone like you.

419
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:05,180
Where are you right now?

420
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:08,517
Hey, Mi-na!

421
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,686
I've been looking for you everywhere!

422
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,956
Unbelievable.

423
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,439
Get up. Let's get you inside.

424
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,067
You must be freezing.

425
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:21,530
Hey, Woo-jae. Why aren't you answering me?

426
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,198
Did you bail on me again?

427
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:26,827
- Hello?
- Come on.

428
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,012
Let's go.

429
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,663
Ms. Lee. Hello?

430
00:30:58,317 --> 00:30:59,776
Let's start by holding hands.

431
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,195
Here.

432
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,082
I want to try

433
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,002
other things with you besides sex.

434
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:21,298
Laughing, crying,
and getting angry over little things.

435
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:25,552
And maybe after that,
we can fall asleep together.

436
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,748
- Are you all right?
- I'm good.

437
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:38,982
Vomiting helped, didn't it?

438
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:40,627
Right?

439
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,028
Stop asking me the same question!

440
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,197
Hey!

441
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,892
Why did you suddenly bring me out?

442
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:16,937
The others were drunk.

443
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,166
And the stars are pretty tonight.

444
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,066
Stars?

445
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,736
But I don't see any stars.

446
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:32,160
Drink it while it's hot.

447
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,121
Thanks.

448
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:36,248
This is what you like, isn't it?

449
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,256
The ocean breeze is chilly.

450
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:49,761
I'm warm, thanks to you.

451
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:00,939
I see a star over there.

452
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,084
Is that the North Star?

453
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:03,984
Where?

454
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:05,986
There's one way over there.

455
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:07,446
Can't you see it?

456
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,641
Do you want to live out
your sexual fantasy?
