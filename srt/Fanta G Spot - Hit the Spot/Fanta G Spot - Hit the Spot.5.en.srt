1
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,306
Hurry up already!

2
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,243
Seriously.

3
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:11,852
Left, right. Left, right.

4
00:00:12,978 --> 00:00:14,104
Keep going.

5
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:18,292
That's it. It'll be just this once.

6
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:20,611
Ms. Son, have you lost your mind?

7
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,655
Everyone loses it every now and then.

8
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:26,551
Let's do it just this one time.

9
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:30,704
Come on. Just this once.

10
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:42,967
When did I ever say that?

11
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:46,428
All I wanted was to climax.

12
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:50,307
I really didn't want to say this,

13
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:53,936
but the girls I've been with
liked it just fine.

14
00:01:02,402 --> 00:01:04,112
I'd like some soju, please.

15
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:13,288
What's your take...

16
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:17,584
on a relationship
that has lasted five years?

17
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:20,754
You don't try
to get to know each other anymore.

18
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:22,756
You can't be bothered.

19
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:25,592
It hurts.

20
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:29,722
I'm on my period, and my stomach hurts.

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,617
MENSTRUAL PAIN RELIEF

22
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:58,959
Are you feeling better now?

23
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:45,147
HIT THE SPOT

24
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:49,093
EPISODE 5. WHAT COMES AFTER SEX

25
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:04,399
How do I look?

26
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:08,904
You're beautiful.

27
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,144
Did I do it last night?

28
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:43,229
I did, didn't I?

29
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:44,940
I totally did it!

30
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:50,863
Did I have an orgasm?

31
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:34,406
Did he leave?

32
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:44,083
Hee-jae, open up!

33
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,086
Hee-jae!

34
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:48,378
Hey!

35
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,011
Why didn't you answer
your phone last night?

36
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,431
You won't believe
what happened to me yesterday.

37
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:01,474
I'm furious.

38
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:08,107
Mr. Hit-And-Run took off
and left me hanging again.

39
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:15,197
Hold on. What's with the bags
under your eyes?

40
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:16,865
These?

41
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,534
I was so mad that I stayed up
all night with my toy.

42
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,287
All night?

43
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:23,080
Yes.

44
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:27,501
What am I looking at here?

45
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,877
What?

46
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,964
I have a sixth sense for these things.

47
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:33,757
What do you mean?

48
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:37,594
Is that sex I smell on you?

49
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:40,198
What's the deal under there?

50
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:42,266
- Show me.
- Hey, cut it out!

51
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:43,892
Stop!

52
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:45,811
Holy cow.

53
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,147
You slept with Kang In-chan?

54
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,693
So? How was it?

55
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,462
Was it good? Did you come?

56
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:56,280
Tell me. I need details!

57
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:58,157
Well...

58
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:02,410
I don't know. I don't remember.

59
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,224
You must at least remember
what you did and how it was.

60
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:07,958
Don't you remember any of that?

61
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:10,603
He was really good.

62
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:11,562
At sex?

63
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:12,671
No, at kissing.

64
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:14,631
Kissing?

65
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:21,889
You know,

66
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:25,160
men who are good kissers
are usually good at sex too.

67
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,227
I'm sure of it.

68
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:28,270
And then what happened?

69
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:30,814
And then...

70
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,033
I honestly don't remember.

71
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,327
Are you serious?

72
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:44,870
Yes.

73
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:47,956
Ask for round two, then.

74
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:50,584
He was gone by the time I woke up.

75
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:53,479
As he should. What more is there to do?

76
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:54,462
What?

77
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:57,132
I see. You wanted morning sex too.

78
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,759
What?

79
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:16,711
IT'S YOUR OVULATION DAY, HEE-JAE

80
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,406
YOU HAVE A HIGH CHANCE OF CONCEIVING

81
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,960
What's taking you so long?

82
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:38,966
Didn't you use a condom?

83
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:40,342
What?

84
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,094
Hold on.

85
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:43,845
It hasn't been opened.

86
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:47,700
I can't believe him.

87
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:50,560
So much for his lectures. What a bastard.

88
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:53,188
I think he took out the condoms,

89
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,900
then saw how drunk you were
and didn't bother to use them.

90
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,862
No way.

91
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:04,408
This won't do.

92
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:06,910
Let's get some pills.

93
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:14,168
Hey.

94
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,044
I thought we were going to a gynecologist.

95
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:19,482
The morning-after pill
is an emergency contraception

96
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:22,319
that can be prescribed
at any medical facility.

97
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:26,114
But did it have to be a proctologist?

98
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,658
This was the closest clinic
open on the weekend.

99
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:31,018
You have to take that pill
as soon as possible.

100
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,187
Every second counts.

101
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:37,083
What if the side effects are really bad?

102
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:40,568
The last time I took one,
the side effects almost killed me.

103
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:43,840
Ms. Son Hee-jae,
please go to exam room one.

104
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:44,781
Okay.

105
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:47,493
- I'll be right back.
- I'll be waiting.

106
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,877
DO NOT DELAY YOUR RECTAL EXAMINATION

107
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,191
Cunnilingus is a must for me.

108
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:03,234
For me, it's anal.

109
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:04,902
If it's your first time,

110
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:07,471
I suggest getting checked out by a doctor.

111
00:09:12,976 --> 00:09:15,312
BIG EVE CLINIC

112
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,273
Hello. Is the clinic open tomorrow?

113
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,526
- Yes.
- Can I make an appointment?

114
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:24,547
Take the pill
right after you get it from the pharmacy

115
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,716
DR. NAM JI-HYUN
and drink plenty of water.

116
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,327
If you throw up,
you'll have to take it again.

117
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:32,413
Got it.

118
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:35,225
I got thrown a curve ball
because of my ovulation,

119
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:37,084
but it was sex that I chose to have.

120
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,670
So what comes after
is entirely my responsibility.

121
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,423
I'm well aware of this.

122
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:49,721
But at times,
it feels unfair being a woman.

123
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,745
PLAY BOOKS

124
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,289
PLAY BOOKS

125
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:59,374
Greek philosopher Galen once said,

126
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,877
"Every animal is sad after coitus."

127
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,630
There's even a best-selling book
under the same title.

128
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:09,616
We asked our listeners
how they felt after having sex.

129
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,596
"Morning sex in movies looks romantic.

130
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,622
But in real life,
you deal with morning breath."

131
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,393
"I get rid of my stress through sex.

132
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,519
But is that normal?"

133
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,646
"Always urinate right after having sex.

134
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,815
It prevents bladder infections."

135
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,691
"What does physical intimacy bring you?

136
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:28,653
Good sex followed by a smoke as you chill.

137
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,179
A post-coital smoke, that is."

138
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,950
"I always get stuck in a rut
after having sex.

139
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:35,743
It's like I'm done with that person."

140
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:39,080
"Going off the pill after my breakup

141
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:41,583
has left me with oily skin
and a muffin top."

142
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,067
"I'm anxious after having sex
with someone I love,

143
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,279
and I feel hollow inside
when it's with someone I don't.

144
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:51,384
Does sex without anxiety
or existential dread even exist?"

145
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,928
Pleasure and existential dread
go hand-in-hand.

146
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:55,371
Why don't we keep reading?

147
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:57,432
Sure.

148
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,810
This is from a listener
who finds it uncomfortable

149
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,919
to be around a coworker they had sex with.

150
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,255
What?

151
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:08,008
But Mr. Park said he'd take care of it.

152
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:11,279
I'm so sorry about that.

153
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,072
I'll take care of it right away.

154
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:14,097
Okay, then.

155
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:16,742
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

156
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:18,143
You always get me gifts.

157
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,955
"Assistant Manager Park Byung-gu
is terrible at his job,

158
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,399
and all he ever does
is socialize at work."

159
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,026
Goodness!

160
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:30,113
"Every day, he makes me
want to quit my job.

161
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,160
Like always, thanks to Mr. Park,
I had to work overtime.

162
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:43,335
Meanwhile, that moron seemed to be
reveling in his own incompetence.

163
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:55,514
That night, just as I was
on the brink of going postal...

164
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:04,273
the unthinkable happened."

165
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:07,943
- Wait, is this alcohol?
- Darn it.

166
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:09,736
Give it here.

167
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,697
Hand it over.

168
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,450
Who drinks at the office?

169
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:18,096
Give it here.

170
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,996
Stop driving me crazy, you jerk!

171
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:23,750
"Was it the alcohol?

172
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:26,086
Or was it my utter hatred for him?

173
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:30,674
I snapped, and my desire
overtook my judgment.

174
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:58,368
One thing led to another,
and we ended up having sex.

175
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,415
The problem was what came after.

176
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:38,636
I was worried we might have been
caught on the security camera.

177
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:44,933
And I wasn't sure
whether we used contraceptives.

178
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,958
The sex was great,

179
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:54,777
but it wasn't like I wanted to date him."

180
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:58,614
HIT THE SPOT

181
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:01,884
"It was a one-time-only sexual encounter,

182
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:04,578
so why did I have
so many concerns afterward?

183
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,456
What am I supposed to do now?"

184
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:11,060
Gosh, this must be
our craziest story to date.

185
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:12,961
Exactly. It's spicy.

186
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,523
But why hasn't her coworker

187
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,425
said anything to her about that night?

188
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,328
The same goes for the listener.

189
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:30,729
She's worried,
but she's not taking any action.

190
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:34,959
The responsibility that comes with sex

191
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:37,128
is just as great
as the pleasures it gives us.

192
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:40,531
Visit a medical center
and take the morning-after pill.

193
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:44,594
You and your partner should also discuss
how you felt about the experience.

194
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:46,995
You can't keep being awkward around him.

195
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:49,498
Yes, you're right.

196
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:52,042
You need to say what's on your mind.

197
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:55,587
Regardless of how you may feel,

198
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:59,675
you should be mature
and discuss what happened.

199
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,740
Let's not forget that what comes after sex
is just as important as the act itself.

200
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,100
It looks like having a healthy sex life
isn't as easy as it seems.

201
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:14,123
HIT THE SPOT

202
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,917
That was you just now, wasn't it?

203
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,943
These stories really hit home sometimes.

204
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,088
By the way, I'm getting off early
to see a doctor.

205
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:23,049
A doctor? Are you sick?

206
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:26,803
No, but I have an appointment
at the clinic we went to yesterday.

207
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:27,994
Just a quick checkup.

208
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:31,224
A checkup by a proctologist?

209
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:32,165
Hey.

210
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,126
What's wrong with
getting checked up by a proctologist?

211
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,647
Should I come with you?

212
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:39,524
Forget it. That'd be embarrassing.

213
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:40,841
I'll go by myself.

214
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:44,344
"You need to say what's on your mind."

215
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,890
And you should also sleep
in the bed you made.

216
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:49,600
Sure.

217
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:56,648
Life is full of too many twists and turns.

218
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:02,863
- Thank you.
- Good job, guys.

219
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,216
I'll see you next week, then.

220
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,199
Have a good day.

221
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:12,080
So...

222
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:14,792
Did the podcast go smoothly?

223
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:16,627
Yes.

224
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:21,799
- And that night, did you...
- Did I sleep well?

225
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,594
Let's get one thing straight.

226
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:27,429
Get what straight?

227
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:28,722
Follow me.

228
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:38,064
HIT THE SPOT

229
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,109
Why didn't you use a condom?

230
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,278
A condom?

231
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,030
Don't play dumb with me.

232
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:47,658
I had to take the morning-after pill.

233
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:50,911
Why would you take that?

234
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:53,181
"Why"? Unbelievable.

235
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,040
"Why"?

236
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,586
I admit that I was
a drunken mess that night.

237
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:02,649
But I'm not some prude
who brings up marriage

238
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:04,216
after having a one-night stand.

239
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,053
But the least you can do is be honest.

240
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:09,680
You really are a colossal jerk.

241
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,098
A colossal jerk?

242
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,870
You must be mistaken. What happened was...

243
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,228
All right, tell me.

244
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:19,147
We didn't do it.

245
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,566
What?

246
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:45,925
Just a second.

247
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:56,351
Don't forget to wear a condom.

248
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,863
I'm going to come tonight.

249
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:13,159
I need to come.

250
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:17,539
I'm going to have two orgasms tonight.

251
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,163
We didn't do it?

252
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,312
Are you serious?

253
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:24,439
Why would I lie?

254
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:26,316
Then what did I...

255
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:44,960
Hold on a second.

256
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:47,355
Did you dream about me?

257
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,672
Yes. What?

258
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,132
Of course not.

259
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:54,403
Then you should have told me we didn't.

260
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:55,971
You could have left a note.

261
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,016
I didn't know you blacked out.

262
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:01,643
I'm sorry for the confusion.

263
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,980
It's fine. It's also my fault
for assuming things.

264
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:06,899
Let's pretend this never happened.

265
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:08,126
Wait.

266
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,609
- What?
- Your phone.

267
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,118
I don't like being irresponsible.

268
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:24,250
CALLING

269
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:28,837
You can call me from now on
instead of suffering alone.

270
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:37,221
Jeez.

271
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:40,891
Does he want us to do it or not?

272
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:46,605
BIG EVE CLINIC

273
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,171
I'm sorry I bailed on you.

274
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:55,006
We can meet again, right?

275
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,258
CHA WOO-JAE

276
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,825
Seriously? Why the hell would I?

277
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,768
I'll let it slide since you apologized.

278
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:30,149
I'll be in touch.

279
00:22:36,363 --> 00:22:37,799
PROCTOLOGIST
DR. NAM JI-HYUN

280
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,075
You have piles. Grade two.

281
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,202
What?

282
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:43,429
Hold on.

283
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:46,290
- Is that the same as hemorrhoids?
- Yes.

284
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,584
It's only grade two,
so you wouldn't have felt anything.

285
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:52,379
You don't need immediate surgery,

286
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:55,090
but it'll get worse
if you don't get it treated.

287
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:58,552
Surgery?

288
00:22:58,969 --> 00:23:01,847
Will surgery cure this problem?

289
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:03,200
Yes.

290
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:06,476
Surgery is the fastest
and most effective option.

291
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,063
How long will I be in the hospital, then?

292
00:23:09,313 --> 00:23:12,858
If you have one in the morning,
you'll be out by the following afternoon.

293
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,461
I'll do it, then.

294
00:23:15,485 --> 00:23:17,630
Okay. That's a wise choice.

295
00:23:17,654 --> 00:23:20,342
- Please go to the reception and...
- How about today?

296
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:23,451
I fasted and gave myself an enema
for today's checkup.

297
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:26,163
An enema just for a checkup?

298
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,540
I like to be thorough.

299
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,585
The fastest I can get you in

300
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:34,231
is this evening.

301
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:36,524
But the on-call doctor
will do the procedure.

302
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,717
Is that doctor any good?

303
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,677
Yes. Of course, he is.

304
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,906
That's fine by me, then.

305
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,514
Just get me in as quickly as possible.

306
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:47,851
All right, check.

307
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,519
Let's see.

308
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:51,873
The second.

309
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,006
And the next...

310
00:23:53,941 --> 00:23:57,236
NEW RELEASES

311
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,196
Hello?

312
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:01,282
Surgery?

313
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:05,220
Yes. I only came in for a checkup,
but she said the faster, the better.

314
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,637
I'll head over right away.

315
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:09,599
Don't make such a fuss over it.
It's embarrassing.

316
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:11,309
No, I'll head over.

317
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,144
Don't. I'm fine right now.

318
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:15,921
Besides, I hear it's a simple procedure.

319
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:19,341
Can you apply for sick leave on my behalf?

320
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,927
I'll tell Mr. Sim myself.

321
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,656
And what about you? How are you feeling?

322
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,682
Do you feel nauseated or anything?

323
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:30,311
I'm fine, I guess.

324
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:31,895
Hey.

325
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:35,232
You know I did that
because I was worried, right?

326
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,445
I'd rather you didn't
care about me so much.

327
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:42,489
Right.

328
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:44,992
Ms. Lee, we're ready for you.

329
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,137
They're calling for me.

330
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:48,721
I'll text you once I'm done.

331
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:49,579
Bye.

332
00:25:12,102 --> 00:25:13,579
We're ready for surgery now.

333
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:15,873
We'll begin once the doctor gets here.

334
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:16,731
Okay.

335
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,028
Nurse.

336
00:25:21,528 --> 00:25:23,506
Everything will be okay, right?

337
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,867
Dr. Cha is very good at what he does.
You don't have to worry.

338
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,500
Administering anesthesia now.

339
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,903
It's an ectopic pregnancy.

340
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:47,471
I recommend immediate surgery.

341
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:49,473
It's too risky to postpone it.

342
00:25:58,482 --> 00:25:59,316
Well,

343
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:01,503
let's say we dodged a bullet.

344
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:04,297
Don't worry about money.
I'll come up with it somehow.

345
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:05,322
Dodged a bullet?

346
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,535
Don't you feel bad for me and our baby?

347
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,265
What am I supposed to do, then?

348
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:14,373
What more can I do?

349
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:18,043
And let's be honest.
I know you feel the same way.

350
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:20,670
You think you dodged a bullet too.

351
00:26:22,672 --> 00:26:23,924
Crazy bastard.

352
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:28,220
We're not done talking!

353
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:48,300
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

354
00:26:48,324 --> 00:26:50,260
- Are you okay?
- We need an ambulance.

355
00:26:50,284 --> 00:26:51,118
You're right.

356
00:27:30,324 --> 00:27:31,325
Are you all right?

357
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:39,542
Why didn't you tell me?

358
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,050
Where's Tae-yong?

359
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,522
Hee-jae...

360
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:06,610
I don't want to do this anymore.

361
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,949
I don't want to fall in love again.

362
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:18,581
I just don't.

363
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:34,012
Do whatever you want.

364
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,225
It's all right. Everything's fine.

365
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,354
It's all right.

366
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,029
On that day five years ago,

367
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,324
I learned how cruel love could be.

371
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,095
How are you? Should I go visit?

372
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,140
One at a time, please.

373
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,685
Then tell me how you are.
Are you all right?

374
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:23,520
I'm good.

375
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,148
I'll be right over. What room are you in?

376
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:29,043
I'm fine. Don't come.

377
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,193
Why?

378
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,255
I'm going to bed,

379
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,448
and I can't sleep if you're here.

380
00:29:34,948 --> 00:29:36,492
Okay. Get some sleep, then.

381
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:38,827
Call me if you need anything, okay?

Can you meet me outside?
I have something for you.

My gosh.

00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:27,626

What the...

389
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:38,387
I'm dreaming again.

390
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:43,100
Why do I keep dreaming about Cha Woo-jae?

00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,542
Mr. Cha, is that you?

394
00:31:09,876 --> 00:31:11,754
I haven't been home for a few days.

395
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:13,964
I'm a mess, right?

396
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:16,550
Were you my surgeon?

397
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:19,153
I got a call about an urgent patient.

398
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,155
The name on the chart made me wonder,

399
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,723
and it really was you.

400
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,576
I don't believe this.

401
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,853
- Don't worry. The surgery went well.
- I should get going.

402
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:30,314
Not yet.

403
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:35,068
If you leave tonight,
there could be bleeding.

404
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:38,405
You should get a day's rest
after getting spinal anesthesia.

405
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:40,717
Can you just leave for now?

406
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:43,285
Bleeding or not,
I'm about to die of embarrassment.

407
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:53,086
I don't get why you're angry with me.

408
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,357
It's perfectly normal
for a doctor to treat a patient.

409
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:59,193
You should be thanking me
for a successful surgery.

410
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,345
Jeez. Get lost already!

411
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,138
What was that?

412
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,475
Get lost, will you?

413
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:39,758
Here you go.

414
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,301
What is this?

415
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,232
How are you feeling?

416
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,275
I hear the pill can make you nauseous.

417
00:32:58,402 --> 00:33:00,070
I guess I'm all right.

418
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,447
What are you doing after work tomorrow?

419
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:07,118
I have to go see Mi-na because she's sick.

420
00:33:09,246 --> 00:33:10,622
Are you and Ms. Lee close?

421
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:14,668
Yes. Extremely.

422
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,587
How did you become friends?

423
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:21,007
We were roommates
at our college dorm when we were 20.

424
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:24,929
We got close after all that drinking
and the troublemaking we did.

425
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:30,392
Why are you smiling?

426
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:32,853
Then I guess we're friends, too.

427
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,606
How so?

428
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:38,650
We got drunk
and got into trouble together.

429
00:33:38,943 --> 00:33:40,193
So that makes us friends.

430
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,206
Would you like one?

431
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:45,258
There's some on your lips.

432
00:34:57,855 --> 00:34:59,439
Ask for round two, then.

433
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:06,655
Do you want to try again?

434
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:09,909
Try what again?

435
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,618
You said we were friends.

436
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:14,580
So let's be friends with benefits.
