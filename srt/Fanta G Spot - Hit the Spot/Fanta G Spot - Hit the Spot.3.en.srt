1
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:28,827
The time has come again.

2
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:32,873
The week in hell
created by the maker himself.

3
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,477
PURE LINE SUPER WINGS

4
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:40,088
Out of all OECD countries,
Korea's sanitary pads are the priciest.

5
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:42,776
Pads are way too expensive,

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,235
but when not changed often,

7
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:46,511
they become the source of odor
and yeast infections.

8
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:51,266
There are a few things I cope with
during this time of the month.

9
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:55,520
One of them...

10
00:00:57,063 --> 00:00:58,941
is my uncontrollable sweet tooth.

11
00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:13,473
- Yes?
- Is it that time of the month?

12
00:01:13,497 --> 00:01:14,331
Yes.

13
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:19,312
MENSTRUAL PAIN RELIEF

14
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:20,563
Thank you so much.

15
00:01:20,587 --> 00:01:22,190
What's worse is that

16
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:25,551
I'm forced to live through this
once a month.

17
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:56,265
HIT THE SPOT

18
00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:00,210
EPISODE 3. THE MONSTROUS RUSH OF HORMONES

19
00:02:04,673 --> 00:02:07,610
"Welcome back, zits.
It's that time of the month again."

20
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:09,821
"Swollen gums that hurt
when brushing teeth

21
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:11,322
is also a symptom of PMS."

22
00:02:11,346 --> 00:02:12,991
"Being cranky while on my period

23
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:15,601
helped me successfully
negotiate my salary."

24
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:19,081
"Someone I dislike bumped into me,
and I screamed."

25
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,374
"My period hits me
like a natural disaster.

26
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:23,585
Why does every month
have to be so hellish?"

27
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:27,029
"If we bled through our mouths,
we'd get off work early. What a shame."

28
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:30,550
On days like this, I hate my uterus.

29
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:32,367
You'd get rid of it if you could.

30
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:36,389
Your appetite increases,
and you're horny all the time.

31
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:39,267
Zits, mood swings, and fatigue.

32
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,020
A week in hell courtesy of the maker.

33
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:44,713
Today, we dive into
all the symptoms of our periods.

34
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:47,173
Many have written to us today.

35
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:50,112
"Last month, I had indigestion
after binge eating.

36
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,238
This month, my stomach
is on a hunger strike.

37
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:54,866
Every month, I experience
another annoying symptom."

38
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,077
I crave carbs and chocolate,

39
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:58,685
so I always gain
at least a kilo afterward.

40
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:02,355
What annoys me the most
is that there's never a fixed date.

41
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,543
It's like the uterus
is playing games with us.

42
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:08,922
It never comes when you're prepared,
but always when you least expect it.

43
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:10,614
- I mean, seriously.
- Same here.

44
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:13,802
"My breasts start hurting
three days before my period,

45
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,620
and the pain gets worse the day before.
It's killing me right now."

46
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:19,099
The slightest touch could be painful.

47
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:21,667
Even putting on a bra can be a challenge.

48
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:24,377
I can relate to every single one of you.

49
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:27,607
Here's someone with a unique PMS symptom.

50
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:28,966
Let's read it together.

51
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:32,803
"My PMS begins a week before my period.

52
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,410
It starts with feeling under the weather,

53
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:42,729
and then the monster
inside me shows itself.

54
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,109
That monster is...

55
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:50,112
my hormones.

56
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:00,747
Please sit.

57
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,002
My damn uncontrollable hormones.

58
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,880
They make my heart skip a beat
over nothing.

59
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,806
During this time,
I get bloated and easily fatigued.

60
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,392
They say baths can be soothing.

61
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,854
Maybe it's because of the bubbles
caressing my body...

62
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,401
but that's when my hormones
start to act up.

63
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:02,268
Today, I choose this guy.

64
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,771
Please sit.

65
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:27,126
I dream about him
with every fiber in my body.

66
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:31,172
Sometimes, romantically.

67
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:33,674
Sometimes, provocatively.

68
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,468
I'm free to imagine him however I want.

69
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:04,496
When my sex drive takes over,
it's as if I've become a different person.

70
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:06,665
Is this normal?"

71
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,187
Of course, it's normal.

72
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:13,214
It's your hormones that make you horny
during that time of the month.

73
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,608
After ovulation,

74
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:19,094
a hormone known as oxytocin is released
and stimulates your sex drive.

75
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,823
So our hormones were to blame.

76
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:24,326
But it's not that we actually want sex.

77
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,768
What we actually crave is to be touched.

78
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,496
- Crazy, right?
- Right.

79
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,665
Rather than wanting sex, it's more like...

80
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:31,708
How should I put it?

81
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:35,986
You crave physical contact
such as patting, caressing, and hugging.

82
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,280
You want to be patted?
What are you, a puppy?

83
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:39,489
Jeez.

84
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,676
Anyway, being horny on your period

85
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,618
doesn't necessarily mean you want sex.

86
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:45,972
When it comes to sex,

87
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,790
both parties should consent
on when and how they want it.

88
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,792
Yes. Take notes and underline.

89
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:54,438
Good luck to everyone
who is struggling with their hormones.

90
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:55,523
WHAT A FUN EPISODE

91
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:56,548
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE

92
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,017
These are so pretty.

93
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:12,874
Isn't this cute?

94
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,500
- Can I take a look at...
- Hey.

95
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:16,961
You got something similar last time.

96
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:18,653
- Did I?
- Yes.

97
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:21,907
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

98
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:29,557
May I take a closer look at this?

99
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:30,641
Of course.

100
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:33,019
Hey, aren't you going
to end it with Hyun-woo?

101
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:34,711
Why are you getting him a gift?

102
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,131
It's our fifth anniversary this week.

103
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:41,468
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

104
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,264
I've been thinking,

105
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,993
and it seems like
we've gotten too used to each other.

106
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:52,396
It's why we lost sight
of how much we mean to one another.

107
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:53,915
What a load of crap.

108
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,275
That's how it is
when you're no longer in love.

109
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:58,420
A comfortable relationship
is based on love too.

110
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,965
Not all relationships have to be
stimulating and passionate.

111
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:04,134
You talk as if you guys are an old couple.

112
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,468
I bet you didn't know

113
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:07,178
that he still carries the cheap wallet

114
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:08,954
I got him five years ago for his birthday.

115
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,807
That was expensive for you back then.

116
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:12,392
You didn't have a stable job.

117
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,393
Exactly.

118
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,752
It's why he really appreciated the gift.

119
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:19,523
That's what he still carries,
which proves what kind of guy he is.

120
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:20,900
This is cute. Can I...

121
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:21,758
Hey.

122
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,736
You already own something similar.

123
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,946
No, I don't.

124
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,263
Yes, you do.

125
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:29,909
Your impulse buying tells me
your period is about to start.

126
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,768
Damn it. Are you rubbing off on me?

127
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:35,165
You'll regret it later
when your credit card bill comes,

128
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:36,106
so just stop.

129
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,003
I'll take this.

130
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:41,236
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

131
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:49,536
Hey.

132
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,122
Did the Big O pay a visit?

133
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:54,582
- The Big O?
- Yes.

134
00:09:01,423 --> 00:09:02,799
So that's how it's done.

135
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:08,680
Awesome. What did I say
about toys never disappointing you?

136
00:09:09,556 --> 00:09:11,475
Tomorrow, you'll finally...

137
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:15,103
- Aren't you on your period?
- Yes.

138
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:18,249
But you booked a hotel room
for your anniversary.

139
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:19,525
What a bummer.

140
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:22,504
There'll be other days.

141
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,421
Hey.

142
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:26,281
I've waited five years.
Another week won't kill me.

143
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:35,350
You seem busy.

144
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,250
Hey.

145
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,711
Check this out.

PERFECT SEX PARTNER REQUIREMENTS

148
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,737
MUST GET A BRAZILIAN WAX REGULARLY

149
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:48,696
Great idea, right?

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,907
RECENT STD AND AIDS TEST RESULTS
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK

151
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:51,974
You know what?

152
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:54,477
You're so simple in some ways

153
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,496
but also picky.

154
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,938
I don't ask for much.

155
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:02,109
All I ask for is for their nether regions
to be clean and tidy.

Why are you obsessed
with men getting waxed?

161
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:18,351
Haven't you had pubic hair
get stuck in your teeth

162
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,751
while having oral sex?

163
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:22,296
- You're right.
- See?

164
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:25,715
I've lost my appetite. Let's stop eating.

165
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:31,221
As if there's anything left to eat.

166
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,101
Talking about body hair
reminds me of that jerk.

167
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:44,627
Some bastard broke
my side-view mirror and drove off.

168
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:46,838
Just thinking about it
makes me angry again.

169
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:48,738
I'm just glad you didn't get hurt.

170
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:50,800
His hair was a mess,

171
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,868
and he had the scruffiest beard.

172
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,453
Isn't that a hit-and-run?

173
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:56,473
Did you get his number?

174
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:57,599
Don't get me started.

175
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,918
He wrote his number on a copy
of his criminal background check.

176
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:03,546
Unbelievable.

177
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:07,372
Do you think he could be
the nice and neat Mr. Right

178
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:08,967
you've been searching for?

179
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:13,013
Just shut up, go home,
and give yourself a stomach massage.

180
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:17,184
Be careful, though.
There are lots of weirdos out there.

181
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,873
I need to get going.

182
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:23,524
- Bye.
- See you.

183
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:34,886
Can you send me the insurance papers?

184
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,388
I'll take care of it right away.

185
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:37,305
MR. HIT-AND-RUN

186
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,373
Right away? It's already been three days!

187
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,958
Does this jerk have no sense of time?

188
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,341
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK

189
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,260
Here you go.

190
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:53,779
Do you really need my STD test results

191
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:56,515
and a copy
of my criminal background check?

192
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:59,351
I didn't bring the documents.

193
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:07,293
COPY

194
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,712
I have everything prepared
and ready to submit.

195
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:12,131
PASTE

196
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:14,824
MR. HIT-AND-RUN

197
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:16,802
PERFECT SEX PARTNER REQUIREMENTS

198
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:18,346
No, not that one!

199
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,681
Have I lost my mind?

200
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,307
Why did I send that?

201
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:22,958
Damn it. What do I do?

202
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:28,088
Where are you going?

203
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,550
You don't have the documents.

204
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:33,802
Hold on.

205
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:35,304
Just a second.

206
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:40,601
PERFECT SEX PARTNER REQUIREMENTS

207
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,652
What a nutjob.

208
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:52,279
I must've lost my mind. What should I do?

209
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:54,781
Damn it!

210
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:02,581
Damn it.

211
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,209
I like your terms.

212
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:10,506
How about we add
our resident registration papers?

213
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:12,382
What?

214
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,893
Thank you.

215
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:28,607
Isn't it good?

216
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,152
Is this really worth 110,000 won?

217
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:36,615
Next time, let's go for Korean beef
and get our money's worth.

218
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:39,576
I think it's nice.

219
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:42,663
Good. At least one of us is enjoying it.

220
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:51,505
My mom wants to see you next month.

221
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,007
Your mom?

222
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,761
We both have stable jobs now,

223
00:13:57,094 --> 00:13:59,722
and you should get pregnant soon
since you're over 30.

224
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,099
Are we getting married?

225
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:05,102
Isn't that where we're headed?
We've been together for five years.

226
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,664
Shouldn't there be an order to things?

227
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:09,981
What's wrong? Don't you want children?

228
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,859
That's not the issue here.

229
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:15,070
Then what is?

230
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:18,616
Forget it.

231
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:32,379
Are you done? Let's head upstairs.

232
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,611
Ms. Lee Mi-na. We're ready for you.

233
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,129
He's totally my type.

234
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:21,838
Wait.

235
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:25,557
It's you, right?
License plate number 1174.

236
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,227
Did you file an insurance claim?

237
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:33,064
Right. You're the hit-and-run guy.

238
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,335
Hit-and-run?

239
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,277
What else would you call it, then?

240
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,006
Is that what it was?

241
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,490
"Is that what it was?"

242
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:43,784
Don't you owe me an apology?

243
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:48,246
Sorry.

244
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:50,374
Took you long enough.

245
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:54,354
You look different today, though.

246
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:55,420
I didn't recognize you.

247
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:57,756
I've been busy lately.

248
00:15:58,173 --> 00:15:59,633
Ms. Lee Mi-na?

249
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,593
Yes, I'm coming.

250
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:03,261
Ms. Lee.

251
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,264
Should I get my documents ready?

252
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:11,061
I'll be in touch.

253
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:21,906
- This will hurt.
- Okay.

254
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,745
Excuse me.

255
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:30,306
The guy who was just here.

256
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,307
Yes?

257
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:32,392
Did he get a Brazilian?

258
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,627
Yes. He's actually
one of our long-term clients.

259
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:37,230
Is that so?

260
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:38,463
- This will hurt.
- Okay.

261
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:52,352
Gosh, it's so pretty.

262
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:03,715
FC Seoul's defensive line was penetrated,

263
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:06,217
giving their opponents an open chance.

264
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:08,386
FC Seoul has had this problem for a while.

265
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,638
Even in their game against Incheon FC,

266
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,724
- the same thing happened.
- That's right.

267
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:15,584
One wrong pass
led to their opponents scoring.

268
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:22,483
About ten years ago,

269
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:26,279
Torres, who played in the EPL at the time,

270
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:28,597
made this exact same mistake.

271
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,224
Can't you turn that off?

272
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:32,476
What?

273
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:34,478
Sure. In a second.

274
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:42,653
Lee Sang-min passes to Park Dong-jin.

275
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:45,632
FC Seoul must be relieved
that their opponents didn't score.

276
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:46,615
That's right.

277
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,787
- Defense is down!
- Paločević has the ball.

278
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,747
Are you going to have any of this?

279
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,517
- What?
- He hasn't taken the shot yet.

280
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,292
He takes a shot with his left foot!

281
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,687
- Sure.
- It was blocked.

282
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,046
What a massive save!

283
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,347
You should know

284
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:15,143
that my gynecologist confirmed
that I don't have anorgasmia.

285
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:16,520
What?

286
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:19,272
You went to a doctor just to confirm that?

287
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,944
I just wanted to make sure.
I could've been the problem, after all.

288
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:31,660
So I tried doing it alone.

289
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:34,496
Alone? You masturbated?

290
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,018
Yes, I did.

291
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:38,918
I masturbated.

292
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,717
And it was good.

293
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:49,386
What? It was good?

294
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:52,723
You've been acting weird lately.

295
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:55,368
First, you shove a sex toy
in my face, and now...

296
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:56,936
So what if I did?

297
00:18:57,978 --> 00:18:59,396
So what if I got a sex toy?

298
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,107
So what if I masturbated?

299
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,501
There's nothing wrong with that.

300
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:07,446
There's still a line you shouldn't cross.
You're being ridiculous.

301
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,717
I'm exhausted as it is.
Don't add to my stress.

302
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:14,012
I get up every day at 6 a.m.
to take the subway to work.

303
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,122
- And all day, I'm stuck with...
- Hey!

304
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:18,707
You're not the only one.

305
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,001
I work too, you know.

306
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,670
Why is everything always about you?

307
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:27,215
I...

308
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:29,969
I was really anxious about this.

309
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:33,806
Everyone else has orgasms just fine,

310
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:38,644
so I thought it was my fault
for not being able to have one.

311
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:42,522
That's why I tried it on my own.

312
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,400
And I had an orgasm.

313
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,421
I just couldn't have one with you.

314
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:49,488
Just you.

315
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:54,618
Why have you been having sex with me
if it was that bad?

316
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:57,037
Because I liked you.

317
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,831
Shit.

318
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,792
So I was the only one who liked it?

319
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,210
You didn't?

320
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:07,840
I just liked being in your arms

321
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:11,010
and being intimate with you.

322
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,220
But what about me?

323
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:16,974
I want to feel satisfied too.

324
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,786
Why can't you understand that?

325
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,936
I see.

326
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:23,939
So I'm the one with the problem.

327
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,129
I get that you're sensitive
when you're on your period,

328
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:31,571
but there's so much that I can take.

329
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:37,703
You just want me to keep things bottled up
like I've been doing all this time.

330
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,748
Everything has to be done your way
based on how you feel.

331
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,251
What did you even do here tonight?

332
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,087
Watch TV?

333
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:48,964
Browse the menu?

334
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:54,154
Did you even bother to notice the work
I'm putting into our relationship?

335
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:55,655
Enough already!

336
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,722
Not once...

337
00:20:57,014 --> 00:21:01,077
Not once did it feel like
we were a couple in love today.

338
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:03,020
Five years does that to people.

339
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,231
We're way past the honeymoon phase!

340
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:10,652
Tell me. What did I do that was so wrong?

341
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,697
You always blame me for everything.

342
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:19,703
It's exhausting.

343
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:23,456
I get what you're saying,
so let's just end it at that.

344
00:21:38,138 --> 00:21:39,056
Sure.

345
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:41,600
Let's end it.

346
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:46,479
What?

347
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:48,857
You expect me to live like this forever?

348
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,735
No, thanks.

349
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,411
Let's talk about this.

350
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,225
I'm done here.

351
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:06,875
Let's talk back inside.

352
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:10,963
You're being overly sensitive.
It's the hormones talking.

353
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:13,215
I've seen you get this way before.

354
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,262
I get it, so let's sit down and talk.

355
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:19,387
Stop it.

356
00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:21,974
It's over between us.

357
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,476
Five years of this is enough.

358
00:22:45,873 --> 00:22:48,268
Like Hyun-woo said,
our breakup could've been

359
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:51,712
the result of my hormones
spiraling out of control.

360
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:58,569
But in some way, I owe it to my hormones

361
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:01,471
for helping me end
this already-broken relationship.

362
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,603
MISSED CALLS: HYUN-WOO

363
00:23:32,627 --> 00:23:35,547
MI-NA: HOW WAS IT LAST NIGHT?
WHY AREN'T YOU READING YOUR TEXTS?

364
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,093
ARE YOU STILL AT THE HOTEL?

365
00:23:43,347 --> 00:23:47,393
MISSED CALLS: HYUN-WOO
MI-NA: HEY!

366
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,817
MENSTRUAL PAIN RELIEF

367
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:06,161
MI-NA: ANSWER ME, OR I'LL CALL 911!

368
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,837
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

369
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,429
What? No way.

370
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,075
So the hit-and-run guy texted you back

371
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,910
and it turns out
he gets himself waxed regularly?

372
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,037
Exactly. Unbelievable, right?

373
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:32,789
That's insane.

374
00:24:32,813 --> 00:24:33,688
Hey.

375
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:36,293
Maybe he's the guy
you've been looking for.

376
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:38,485
The male version of you.

377
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,654
You seem more excited than I am.

378
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:43,341
Are you going to contact him?

379
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:44,801
Are you?

380
00:24:44,825 --> 00:24:46,052
Of course.

381
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:48,245
Why pass up a guy who waxes?

382
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:51,057
From Mr. Hit-And-Run to Mr. Brazilian Wax.

383
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,642
This is amazing!

384
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:54,126
Congratulations!

385
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,216
Look at you go.

386
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:02,968
You've lost your mind.

387
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:06,263
But I'll let it slide today.

388
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:08,992
It's good to be out and about, right?

389
00:25:09,016 --> 00:25:11,477
Yes, I'm having a blast.

390
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:14,021
I'm a free woman now.

391
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:18,359
But what was the reason
for the sudden breakup?

392
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,531
You were all sentimental about the love
that long-term couples have.

393
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:30,245
I didn't want to fake it
for the rest of my life.

394
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:33,748
Like you said,
I'm going to put myself first.

395
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,129
Good. That's music to my ears.

396
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,090
Love is just emotional labor.

397
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:44,468
You're so right.

398
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,030
- Hee-jae.
- Yes?

399
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:48,514
Let's go crazy tonight.

400
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:51,350
- Drink up!
- Drink up!

401
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,232
I am

402
00:25:58,648 --> 00:26:00,001
A dazzling

403
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,443
- Single woman
- Single woman

404
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,200
Mi-na, how about another drink?

405
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:10,594
I don't mind you going crazy tonight,

406
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:12,288
but I think I might die.

407
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:15,141
- So that's enough.
- Hey!

408
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:17,477
I'm free!

409
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:18,770
I feel ecstatic!

410
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:21,147
Things couldn't be better.

411
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:22,607
Wait for me.

412
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:24,776
- I'm going to throw up.
- More drinks!

413
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,634
Stop it.

414
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,219
Jeez.

415
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:29,972
Gosh.

416
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,226
Here comes a cab.

417
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:38,147
- I'll get going, then.
- Sure.

418
00:26:45,362 --> 00:26:46,738
Bye!

419
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:17,311
What ended was my relationship,

420
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:21,106
but what I needed to forget
were the memories we shared.

421
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:24,401
Ta-da.

422
00:27:25,735 --> 00:27:26,695
What's this?

423
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,405
It's your birthday this week.

424
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,949
No way.

425
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,410
A wallet is just what I needed.

426
00:27:34,077 --> 00:27:35,162
Thank you.

427
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,122
It's not expensive.

428
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:40,643
Next time, I'll get you a designer brand.

429
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:42,521
The price doesn't matter.

430
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:44,087
What matters is your heart.

431
00:27:44,547 --> 00:27:45,797
Thank you so much.

432
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:54,282
Hee-jae got me a wallet for my birthday.

433
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,183
Hi, guys. There you go.

434
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:00,229
You too, Hee-jae.

435
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:03,732
Thank you!

436
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:05,251
This is for you.

437
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:06,151
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

438
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:22,167
Back then, I couldn't even imagine
where we'd be in five years.

439
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:29,192
I SMELL LIKE FEET
I'M OFF WORK!

440
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:31,218
WHEN WILL YOU GET HERE?

441
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:45,982
ARE YOU STILL BUSY?

442
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:00,789
No, there's no issue with me.

443
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:04,436
You brought it up,
so the issue must be with you.

444
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,106
Did you even bother to notice the work
I'm putting into our relationship?

445
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,274
Enough already!

446
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:10,382
Not once...

447
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,137
Not once did it feel like
we were a couple in love today.

448
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:22,811
Stop it.

449
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,230
It's over between us.

450
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:27,899
Five years of this is enough.

451
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:59,097
I had to say goodbye to him

452
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:04,019
and then say goodbye to my old self
who used to be in love with him.

453
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:03,120
Hey, are you okay?

454
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,210
It hurts.

455
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:17,884
I'm on my period, and my stomach hurts.

456
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,794
EPILOGUE

457
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,330
- So...
- So...

458
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,083
You go first.

459
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:38,883
I'm sorry...

460
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:44,262
for not loving you enough...

461
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,266
until the very end.

462
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:53,313
Still...

463
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,902
My entire 20s...

464
00:33:01,488 --> 00:33:02,823
was devoted to you.

465
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:06,284
You know that, right?

466
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:35,647
I wanted you to have this.

467
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:55,584
I'm going to go now.

468
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:43,049
And just like that,
my relationship of five years

469
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:44,842
came to an end.
