1
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:09,015
- Welcome.
- Hi.

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,749
The sensation locked within me
was unleashed

3
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:17,775
the day I first got my ears pierced.

4
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:19,985
Are you worried it will hurt?

5
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:28,201
It gave me...

6
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:31,121
sexual arousal.

7
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:39,379
- Is your neck okay?
- Yes.

8
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:47,888
I couldn't hold back the feeling
no matter how hard I tried.

9
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:55,646
I even love the sound of the razor
grazing my chin.

10
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,750
I feel aroused
whenever my ears are stimulated.

11
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:18,460
Am I abnormal?

12
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:31,700
You're all done.

13
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:36,269
You're all done.

14
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:44,611
PLAY BOOKS

15
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:48,156
Our listener says he is aroused
whenever his ears are touched.

16
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,535
He's worried that he may be abnormal.

17
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:55,348
Being aroused easily
should be considered a blessing,

18
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:58,291
but it could be a problem
if you're too sensitive.

19
00:01:58,667 --> 00:01:59,644
Right.

20
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:02,647
Many people are concerned about
not being easily turned on,

21
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:06,050
but there are those who find sex difficult
because it tickles.

22
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,970
Mr. Kang, then could there be a way
to lower one's sensitivity?

23
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:13,015
I'm not a doctor...

24
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:17,978
but there isn't a way
to do that artificially.

25
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:20,397
But in one case, it can be done.

26
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:21,607
How?

27
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,251
By getting older.

28
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:25,986
As you age, your sense of touch dulls.

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,239
So it happens naturally with age.

30
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:30,550
That's right.

31
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:32,952
There's also a thing called
the spotlight effect.

32
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,623
It refers to how some people
can be more self-conscious than others.

33
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:40,309
Rather than their erogenous zones,

34
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:44,463
they might be more concerned
with how others think of them.

35
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:48,818
What you're suggesting is
that they change the way they think.

36
00:02:48,842 --> 00:02:50,343
They should be more brazen.

37
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:52,345
I guess you're right.

38
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:57,309
Erogenous zones can be vague
since they differ from person to person.

39
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,955
But since we all at least have one,

40
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,188
there's no need for you
to feel singled out because of it.

41
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:05,692
You can be aroused
by touching any part of your body.

42
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:08,236
What's your erogenous zone, then?

43
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:10,530
Mine?

44
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:13,826
My lips.

45
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:18,204
I see.

46
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:21,041
What's yours?

47
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,172
Mine is...

48
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:58,054
HIT THE SPOT

49
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:01,999
EPISODE 6. THE MOOD THAT DAY

50
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,603
Mr. Kang filled in
as our special guest today.

51
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:07,713
What was it like to join us?

52
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:11,133
Most of my readers are women,

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,428
so it was a pleasure
to hear their stories somewhat up close.

54
00:04:15,637 --> 00:04:17,305
When will we do it again?

55
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:19,516
Sorry?

56
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:21,434
The podcast.

57
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,288
When will we get to do it again?

58
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:25,939
I had a blast.

59
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:27,691
The podcast?

60
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,778
Have me over again sometime soon.

61
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,321
Is that a promise?

62
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:34,656
Sure.

63
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:39,221
That'll be all for today's Hit the Spot.

64
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,371
Next week, DJ Min will be back.

65
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,331
Thank you.

66
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:53,151
My gosh.

67
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:55,737
Mr. Kang, you should quit being an advisor

68
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:57,239
and host the show instead.

69
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,514
That was some sound advice.

70
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:00,783
Tell me about it.

71
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:02,660
No wonder he's an expert.

72
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:04,310
Mr. Kang, you're the best.

73
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:05,604
Thanks.

74
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:09,291
What do you say
to a permanent spot on the show?

75
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:10,316
I'm not interested.

76
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,712
This one time was enough.

77
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:13,737
It was fun.

78
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,697
What a bummer.

79
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:18,843
Do you have any plans today?
How about some tea?

80
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,035
Sounds good.

81
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:22,305
Enjoy your conversation, then.

82
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,789
I have some stuff to go over.

83
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:25,516
I see.

84
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,625
Yi-kyung, shall we?

85
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:28,836
- Me too?
- That's right.

86
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:31,379
I wanted to join them for tea.

87
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:32,649
Beat it.

88
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:34,442
- Just five minutes.
- It's fine. Go.

89
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:36,177
- It'll be my treat.
- Leave.

90
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,014
She just can't take a hint.

91
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:44,601
Mr. Kang, a signing event
for your book is coming up.

92
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,164
Would you be up for a brief AMA session?

93
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:49,040
- What do you say?
- At the signing?

94
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:49,898
Yes.

95
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,904
I really hope you'll agree to it.

96
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,438
PLAY BOOKS

97
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:13,797
How did the meeting go?

98
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:16,758
Were you waiting for me?

99
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:18,593
Of course.

100
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:22,306
Why? Did you need something?

101
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:25,059
It's because we're special friends.

102
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:28,478
That being said,

103
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:30,397
when will we do it again?

104
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:33,775
The podcast?

105
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:35,610
No, not that.

106
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,738
You never gave me an answer.

107
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:41,783
Do I look that easy?

108
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:44,203
I never said that.

109
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,289
You're the one
who first said that we're friends.

110
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:51,877
I take it that you want
a different kind of friendship.

111
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:56,131
Anyway, call me once you have your answer.

112
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,845
Have a pleasant night, then.

113
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:36,546
How are you feeling?

114
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:39,716
Can't you tell?

115
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,093
You seem good.

116
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,553
Have your incision disinfected
before you go.

117
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,825
You want me to show you my butt again?

118
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:49,059
No, not to me.

119
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,145
To the doctor you first consulted.

120
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,900
Why are you angry with me?

121
00:07:57,484 --> 00:07:59,153
Did I do something wrong?

122
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,365
I honestly don't know
why I'm mad at you either.

123
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:09,371
What's this?

124
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:12,207
Seaweed soup. It's good for your bowels.

125
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,376
Eating is key to a speedy recovery.

126
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:23,427
Recovery will take about two weeks.

127
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:26,096
So lay off the sex and alcohol until then

128
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:27,949
and call me in two weeks' time.

129
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,808
I'll get you my documents again.

130
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:45,657
SEAWEED SOUP

131
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:48,910
Unbelievable.

132
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:02,859
Kang In-chan has
250,000 followers on social media.

133
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:05,344
He's pretty much a celebrity.

134
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:09,282
And you asked him to be your sex partner?

135
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:10,325
Yes.

136
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,452
Why? Don't celebrities have sex?

137
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,395
They do, and they should.

138
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,164
You're all grown up now.

139
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,731
So? What did he say?

140
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:21,193
He asked if he looked easy.

141
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:27,282
Is that his way of saying that
no one has suggested that to him before?

142
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,287
But that wasn't why I asked him.

143
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,956
Wait. Maybe it is.

144
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,293
He doesn't seem easy to me.

145
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,628
But maybe he seemed that way to you.

146
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,609
It's ready. Let's eat.

147
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:47,279
What if you end up dating him?

148
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:48,845
Come on. Are you nuts?

149
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:52,224
I won't ever date him.
It'll be strictly sex.

150
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,496
Right. Well, I'm proud of you,

151
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,125
but let's not talk about sex
while I practice abstinence for two weeks.

152
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,210
Hey, dig in while it's hot.

153
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,402
And no leftovers.

154
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:05,255
But I don't want to overeat.

155
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,072
If a lot goes in, a lot must come out.

156
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,075
But you have to eat to recover.

157
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:14,347
Seaweed soup. It's good for your bowels.

158
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:16,123
Eating is key to a speedy recovery.

159
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,293
That's what he said.

160
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:21,253
Who?

161
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:23,506
It's nothing.

162
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:27,759
Do you know how much it hurts to poop
after a hemorrhoidectomy?

163
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,612
I looked it up online.

164
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:32,222
They say pooping on an empty stomach
hurts even more.

165
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:39,522
Here.

166
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,440
My heart skipped a beat just now.

167
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,543
- Out of the blue?
- Yes.

168
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,712
You know I'm a sucker for people
who care for me when I'm sick.

169
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:47,696
I do.

170
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:49,198
Now, eat up.

171
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:52,242
Good girl.

172
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:01,668
Tell me.

173
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,089
Do doctors normally wipe the sweat
off their patients?

174
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,360
I'm not sure.

175
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:11,053
It'd make sense
if you were sweating like a pig.

176
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,519
Do they tuck you in as well?

177
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,104
What's with your doctor?

178
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:22,689
I quite like this clinic.

179
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,235
He also dozed off beside me
while I was asleep.

180
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:29,321
Could he have fallen for you?

181
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,413
Does it hurt a lot?

182
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,709
I'll give you an epidural.

183
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:12,615
I'm sorry I keep leaving you

184
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,491
on your own.

185
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:22,082
Have you had an epidural injection before?

186
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,002
It makes you feel funny.

187
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,798
Something happened
at the clinic, didn't it?

188
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:32,944
No.

189
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:33,969
I'm just saying.

190
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:38,223
PSYCHOLOGY FOR HER, A TALK ABOUT SEX

191
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:43,913
KANG IN-CHAN'S BOOK SIGNING EVENT

192
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:46,440
- What's your name?
- It's Kim Young-ju.

193
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,733
Ms. Kim Young-ju.

194
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:53,298
TO. MS. KIM YOUNG-JU

195
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,091
I have a job interview lined up.

196
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:57,302
Could you wish me luck?

197
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:58,285
Sure.

198
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:03,540
Ms. Kim, everything will work out.

199
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:06,960
Even if it doesn't work out this time,
it eventually will.

200
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,629
Good luck.

201
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:11,548
- Thank you.
- The pleasure's mine.

202
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:14,217
- Good luck, Mr. Kang.
- Good luck.

203
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:18,722
May I have your name?

204
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:21,099
It's Son Hee-jae.

205
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:27,648
Are you stalking me now?

206
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:30,460
Does it look that way?

207
00:13:30,484 --> 00:13:31,753
TO. SON HEE-JAE

208
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,278
A little, I guess.

209
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:43,038
I never thought you were easy.

210
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,751
I know that I'm acting like a lunatic.

211
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,336
But...

212
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:52,256
there's something
I'm desperately looking for.

213
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,467
Can't you help me just this once?

214
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:05,352
Next.

215
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:23,829
Hello, thank you for coming.

216
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:26,206
THEN BUY ME A DRINK

217
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:29,185
- What's your name?
- It's Im Soo-yeon.

218
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:30,461
- Ms. Im Soo-yeon?
- Yes.

219
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,510
88 BIG GULPS

220
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:46,184
- Over here.
- It's been so long!

221
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:47,978
What do you think about this place?

222
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:50,939
I like the atmosphere.

223
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:53,876
I told you this place was great.

224
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,820
The whelk soup here is to die for.

225
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:58,113
How does soju sound?

226
00:14:58,656 --> 00:14:59,490
I'm in.

227
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:02,803
Ma'am, one whelk soup
and a bottle of soju, please.

228
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:05,162
- They will be right out.
- Thank you.

229
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:06,455
Thank you.

230
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,167
Thank you.

231
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:12,544
- Enjoy.
- Sure.

232
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,926
I thought you didn't drink
with people you weren't comfortable with?

233
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:24,181
So? What is it that you're looking for?

234
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:29,728
An orgasm.

235
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:34,775
I want to experience it
with another person.

236
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:37,277
Why me, though?

237
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:38,696
That's...

238
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:40,865
Well...

239
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:43,158
Because I'm easy?

240
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,410
Come on. That's not it.

241
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:49,581
For some reason,
it feels like I could tell you anything.

242
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:51,625
I feel somewhat safe.

243
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:54,211
Maybe it's because you're a psychologist.

244
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,129
A psychologist?

245
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,424
Then promise me one thing.

246
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:00,985
What is it?

247
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:02,887
You have to be honest with yourself.

248
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:04,555
And also with me.

249
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:07,349
Then it's a yes, right?
You can't take it back.

250
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,285
On one condition, though.

251
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:10,435
Fire away.

252
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:13,438
I'm looking for something as well.

253
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,482
And what's that?

254
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:17,735
I'll tell you later.

255
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:20,129
Fine.

256
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:23,240
Whatever it is, I'll help you find it.

257
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:27,077
Let's start by being friends first.

258
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:33,709
When are we going to do it, then?

259
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:38,380
Hold your horses.
There's an order to these things.

260
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:41,550
Drink to it?

261
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:44,261
- Let's.
- Cheers.

262
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:55,665

No.

LEE JUN-YOUNG

265
00:16:58,692 --> 00:16:59,902
No way.

266
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:05,323
I'm sorry I keep leaving you

267
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:07,158
on your own.

268
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:20,881
CHA WOO-JAE

269
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:25,051
I must be out of my mind.

270
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:43,463
Recovery will take about two weeks.

271
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:46,257
So lay off the sex and alcohol until then

272
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:47,825
and call me in two weeks' time.

273
00:17:48,158 --> 00:17:49,785
I'll get you my documents again.

274
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:01,254
I'm so bored.

275
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:06,802
Cheers.

276
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,191
What should I do now?

277
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,651
What should we try first?

278
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:25,612
HOW ABOUT WE GO STEADY?

279
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,846
You said your erogenous zone

280
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:53,099
was your lips, right?

281
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,688
You'll rip the book!

282
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,740
Nice!

283
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,331
Hold on.

284
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,293
Mr. Kang.

285
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:25,171
We're having sex if I beat you, okay?

286
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:32,387
Why are you so good at this?

287
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:34,306
Why can't I hit anything?

288
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:39,603
Seriously?

289
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:45,627
Lights on or off?

290
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,669
One, two, three.

291
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:47,587
On.

292
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:48,695
Off!

293
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,424
Deeper or faster? One, two, three.

294
00:19:51,448 --> 00:19:52,574
- Deeper!
- Deeper!

295
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:55,702
Cheers.

296
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:09,591
What is it that you're looking for?

297
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,635
Ancient treasure?

298
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:13,428
There's nothing here.

299
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,306
Have faith in me, will you?

300
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:23,105
What are you even looking for?

301
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:27,359
My legs are killing me.

302
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:30,320
Maybe I should run away from home.

303
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:34,258
You brat. You shouldn't say
such things so lightly.

Dad, you're always on my case.

307
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:47,671
Do you want one?

308
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:10,152
SEAWEED SOUP WITH BEEF

SEAWEED SOUP WITH BEEF
PUMPKIN PORRIDGE

310
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:31,631
Seaweed soup. It's good for your bowels.

311
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:33,884
Eating is key to a speedy recovery.

312
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:38,597
Oh, hot! Darn it.

313
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,939
Have you completely lost it?

CHA WOO-JAE

315
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,165
How's your recovery coming along?

316
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:20,347
Why did you come here at this hour?

317
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:21,974
Are you not feeling well?

318
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,767
I hurt myself.

319
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:32,585
You did well coming here.

320
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:33,944
Come in. I'll patch you up.

321
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,747
You asked me how I was doing.

322
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:47,833
Why would you text me that?

323
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,584
Because I was curious.

324
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:52,504
Do you do this to all your patients?

325
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:55,942
Give them seaweed soup,
wipe away their sweat,

326
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,301
and nurse them all night?

327
00:22:57,592 --> 00:22:58,886
Is that what you normally do?

328
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:01,222
Why are you so upset?

329
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:07,728
Why are you doing this to me
when I'm so vulnerable?

330
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,108
You can't do that. It's not fair.

331
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:18,530
Let me treat this burn first.

332
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,009
I wanted to find out...

333
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:44,139
why I kept imagining kissing him...

334
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:49,353
and not having sex with him.

335
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:02,550
I get it now.

336
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:04,845
I now know...

337
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,639
that I've...

338
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,142
fallen for him.

339
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:48,763
Luckily, the burn isn't severe.

340
00:25:53,727 --> 00:25:56,480
You asked me if I was this nice
to all my patients.

341
00:25:57,564 --> 00:25:59,858
I'm rather well known
for being considerate,

342
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,737
but I don't treat just anyone
free of charge like now.

343
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:23,173
All done.

344
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:55,164
You weren't kidding about us
being friends.

345
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,918
I can't stand
not getting a bang for my buck.

346
00:27:00,461 --> 00:27:01,462
So?

347
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,464
Did you find what you were looking for?

348
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:06,800
I think I did.

349
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:09,178
Thanks to you.

350
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,929
What was it?

351
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:13,182
Do you want to know?

352
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:16,810
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

353
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,444
It's my turn, then.

354
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:29,948
Do you like music?

355
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,279
It's been a while

356
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,532
since my heart raced like this.

357
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:25,795
A song that I hadn't heard before
tickled my ears.

358
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,842
The smell of winter, sweet wine...

359
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:36,848
and this man who said his heart raced
as he sat next to me.

360
00:28:44,814 --> 00:28:47,484
Just as all these sensations
began to feel so alien...

361
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,076
my body began to react.

362
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:06,211
What I was aroused by...

363
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:11,550
was the mood.

364
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:19,725
I...

365
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:25,772
want to kiss you.

366
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:44,601
EPILOGUE

367
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,001
Are we still not there yet?

368
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,253
We're almost there.

369
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:03,644
It's so pretty!

370
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:09,775
It was worth the hike.

371
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:24,790
I found it.

372
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,046
The reason for me to fall in love again.
