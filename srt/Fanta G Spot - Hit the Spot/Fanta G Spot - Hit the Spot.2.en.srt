1
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,772
Timing matters when it comes to sex.

2
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:19,149
Being in a relationship
with someone who isn't available

3
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,862
makes you feel lonelier
than when you were single.

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,706
When the heart is lonely,
the body yearns for physical contact.

5
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:37,461
But pleasuring myself
had never crossed my mind.

6
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:41,339
Then one day,

7
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:45,594
the pillow between my legs
roused my bundle of nerves.

8
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:51,349
It felt soft and warm.

9
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:56,313
However, the showerhead
provided something different.

10
00:00:56,688 --> 00:01:00,275
I felt like a fish in water.

11
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:04,154
It was rough and hot.

12
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:09,534
Who knew one could enjoy
such pleasure on their own?

13
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:13,663
The doors to unlimited sexual pleasure

14
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:15,165
finally opened up for me.

15
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:26,552
When or where doesn't matter.

16
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:28,554
I just want to touch myself.

17
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:32,307
I can no longer control myself.

18
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,240
Masturbating has become more enjoyable

19
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:51,451
than having sex with my boyfriend.

20
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,539
MISSED CALLS: BOYFRIEND

21
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,004
All of the feelings...

22
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,050
I kept under lock and key were unleashed.

23
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,428
And with that, I became my own person.

24
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:21,188
But my daily urges

25
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:24,068
had me hallucinating.

26
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:27,738
Get rubbing!

27
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:29,573
Am I

28
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,035
masturbating too often?

29
00:02:57,183 --> 00:03:00,186
HIT THE SPOT

30
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,273
EPISODE 2. I CAN DO IT ALONE JUST FINE

31
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,318
PLAY BOOKS

32
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,862
HIT THE SPOT SCRIPT
2ND WEEK OF OCTOBER

33
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:12,031
Would people find today's story vulgar?

34
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:14,367
I'd categorize this as a healthy pastime.

35
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:16,495
Don't you agree?

36
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:19,956
Come on, you guys.

37
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:22,583
After everything it took for me
to get him on board?

38
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,169
What's with the silent treatment?

39
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,129
You're right. It's absolutely normal.

40
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,174
Who doesn't masturbate these days?

41
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:29,466
I, for one, don't.

42
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:32,178
Really?

43
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:35,097
Don't you guys masturbate?

44
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:36,806
- Mr. Sim.
- Yes?

45
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:38,433
- Don't you?
- Masturbate?

46
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:47,399
According to this survey,
five out of ten haven't.

47
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,568
Some people just don't know how to do it.

48
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:50,736
Are you serious?

49
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:51,946
Half of these people

50
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:54,867
haven't been enjoying this
because they don't know how it's done?

51
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,913
The wrong approach to sex-ed

52
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:02,373
has left women with a conservative view
regarding masturbation.

53
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:04,084
Some go as far as to feel guilt

54
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,378
even though
they're touching their own bodies.

55
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,881
But hasn't this listener taken it too far?

56
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:10,840
I agree.

57
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:14,220
A vibrating exfoliating brush
could be hazardous.

58
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:18,056
With her, masturbation isn't the issue.

59
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:21,351
The root of her problem
is her sex life with her partner.

60
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:30,903
Sex for women begins
and ends with intimacy.

61
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,987
It's why many believe the sex was good

62
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:34,698
if their partner had a good time.

63
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,700
But that's far from the truth.

64
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:39,619
It's merely a one-sided relationship.

65
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,622
It's why this woman needs to masturbate.

66
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:47,126
Knowing what your body craves
and being able to love yourself for it

67
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:50,296
is the key to a healthy sex life
with your partner.

68
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,429
Hit the Spot shouldn't see masturbation
as a problem.

69
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,515
Maybe the hosts
can educate the listeners instead.

70
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,521
Bravo, Mr. Kang.

71
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:12,027
You saw right through
the purpose of our show.

72
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:13,987
You're the best.

73
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,700
You're great. The best.

74
00:05:23,163 --> 00:05:25,081
About that writer, Kang In-chan...

75
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:26,666
His opinions couldn't be sexier.

76
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,626
I know, right?

77
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:29,211
Maybe he lived abroad.

78
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,254
I bet he has a lot of women.

79
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:33,131
Once again, you're clueless.

80
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,090
What now?

81
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:36,176
Guys like him usually aren't womanizers.

82
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:38,012
- He probably has high standards.
- Really?

83
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,847
Mi-na, are you up for the challenge?

84
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:43,350
No, writers aren't my type.
I know from experience.

85
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:46,478
SOMEBODY LIKES YOU

86
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:51,858
SOMEBODY LIKES YOU

87
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:54,820
VICTOR, HOT CHILI,
AUSTIN'S LENS, GRINGOIRE

88
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:56,737
- You seem busy.
- Aren't I always?

89
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:58,698
Not again. What happened
to the swimming instructor?

90
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:01,285
I dumped him
because he was getting too clingy.

91
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,537
VICTOR 28

92
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,040
Where's my Mr. Right?

93
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:08,208
Are you even trying?

94
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,877
A profile pic is all I need.

95
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:12,754
I scrolled through
over a hundred guys last night.

96
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:15,256
They all seem the same to me now.

97
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:18,301
You don't waste a second, do you?
I can respect that.

98
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:20,929
How can I sleep on it
when my pleasure is at stake?

99
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,224
Anyway, you should get busy as well.

100
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:26,060
I probably should.

101
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:27,936
Talk about it with Hyun-woo.

102
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,979
Guys who can't accept sex toys

103
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,524
could have that reaction
when one is thrown at them.

104
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:37,363
Hey.

105
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:38,822
I need to get going.

106
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:40,615
- Bye.
- See you.

107
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:47,039
VICTOR 28

108
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:56,590
You don't look at all
like your profile picture.

109
00:06:58,133 --> 00:06:59,259
Do you wax?

110
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,635
Wax? Where?

111
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:04,139
I see.

112
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:07,392
Body hair is a symbol of male pride, so...

113
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,810
No, thank you.

114
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,064
HOT CHILI 32
STD test results and my criminal record.

115
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,316
Is this really necessary?

116
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:18,070
We're both willing, and now we've met up.

117
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:21,031
What more do you need?

118
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:22,157
Nope.

119
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:25,244
GRINGOIRE 30
Your eyes harbor the mystery

120
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:27,996
of the sky, stars, and moon.

121
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:32,000
Your eyes harbor the mystery
of the sky, stars, and moon...

122
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,752
No way. Absolutely not.

123
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:36,004
AUSTIN'S LENS 29
Please be my muse.

124
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:37,714
Click.

125
00:07:38,006 --> 00:07:39,133
Oh, no!

126
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:42,928
INNOCENT MUFFLER 33

127
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,806
What? Why?

128
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:47,891
No!

129
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,687
Some say that the creator
gave us pubic hair for a reason,

130
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:54,480
but that's ridiculous.

131
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:56,482
Then why do men get circumcised

132
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:59,527
when the penis was sculpted
by the creator in the first place?

133
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:05,075
- Check, please.
- Wait.

134
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,785
Do you know how hot dry firewood burns?

135
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:10,080
You'd be surprised by the reviews.

136
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,361
Jeez.

137
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:46,908
What in the world?

138
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:50,787
I thought I'd try to light up
the dry firewood,

139
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:53,248
but my hunch was right.

140
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,134
What is it?

141
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:08,096
Strawberries are your favorite.

142
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:37,042
I had too much to drink today.

143
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,546
I was neck-deep in complaints today.

144
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,968
Maybe I should just quit

145
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,262
and forget my pension.

146
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:49,555
Jeez.

147
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,850
I thought the strawberries were for me.

148
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:56,145
You're right.

149
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,105
Why haven't you had any?

150
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:03,777
Aren't you going to apologize?

151
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,529
For what?

152
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,323
You accused me of having anorgasmia.

153
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:13,786
But it's true.
I'm not the one to blame for this.

154
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:16,999
It could be you
who just can't have orgasms.

155
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:23,672
Gosh, these strawberries are sweet.

156
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:32,139
Sleep off your hangover at your own place!

157
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:58,582
He's always like this.

158
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:03,587
UPTOWN FITNESS
PERSONAL TRAINING, PILATES

159
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,860
Weekends are the best.

160
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,028
This should be my time slot.

161
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,613
Exactly. During the week,

162
00:11:30,614 --> 00:11:32,698
all we see are worn-out paper pushers.

163
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:33,742
And I'm one of them.

164
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,078
Hey.

165
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,205
- Hyun-woo doesn't work out, does he?
- What do you think?

166
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:40,957
He only does it in three positions.

167
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,335
That's his biggest issue.

168
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:45,045
Come on.

169
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,427
Are you two still on the outs?

170
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:53,596
Nothing has changed.

171
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:55,179
Jeez.

172
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,181
He came by with some strawberries

173
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:58,850
and called it an apology.

174
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,351
But you hate strawberries.

175
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,644
Tell me about it.

176
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:03,897
He still doesn't know that
I don't like strawberries.

177
00:12:04,398 --> 00:12:06,732
I've only been eating them because of him.

178
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,734
The guy's consistent. I'll give him that.

179
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:11,113
In the beginning,
that's what I liked about him.

180
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,031
Do you have to keep seeing him?

181
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:15,157
I don't know.

182
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:16,785
I forgot how to break up with someone.

183
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:30,840
Mi-na, keep it down!

184
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:32,842
Are you doing it with the bar?

185
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:35,262
Haven't you heard of a "coregasm" before?

186
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,306
You're killing me.

187
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:41,685
These workouts involve
squeezing your core muscles

188
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:43,895
and contracting your pelvis,

189
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,149
which can lead to orgasms, okay?

190
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,657
Orgasms?

191
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:57,493
They're not easy to achieve.

192
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:00,870
LOCKER ROOM

193
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:04,291
Don't let go.

194
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,716
- Holy cow.
- Oh, my gosh.

195
00:13:58,095 --> 00:13:59,722
What the heck am I watching?

196
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:02,974
This brings back memories.

197
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,310
What? You've done it at a gym before?

198
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,609
LOCKER ROOM

199
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:16,071
Gosh, I'm drained.

200
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:19,116
So that's what sex should be like.

201
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:22,828
Meanwhile, I'm being accused
of having anorgasmia.

202
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:26,248
That can't be true, right?

203
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:28,500
Anorgasmia? Is this coming from Hyun-woo?

204
00:14:31,962 --> 00:14:32,838
Seriously?

205
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,756
You never know.

206
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,633
As if that bastard knows any better.

207
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:38,676
I can't believe he accused you of that.

208
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,219
I've had it with him.

209
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,221
Let's make him eat his words.

210
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:44,015
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

211
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:47,394
ROSE WOMEN'S CLINIC

212
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,733
YOUR LABIA MINORA ARE BEAUTIFUL

213
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:55,902
LABIA MINORA SURGERY?
WE DO NOT RECOMMEND IT

214
00:14:57,404 --> 00:15:00,115
I wouldn't mind a cute nickname
for our nether regions.

215
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,451
Like how you say "wand" for men.

216
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,036
I guess there's "flower" for women.

217
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,872
That's just weird.

218
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,669
Let's come up with one.

219
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:14,755
Soft jelly.

220
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:15,922
What do you think?

221
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:18,382
That's cute. Call it whatever you want.

222
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:20,510
Ms. Son Hee-jae,
the doctor will see you now.

223
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:21,345
Okay.

224
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,096
Come on, gummy bear.

225
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:35,734
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT
LEE MI-YOUNG

226

SPECIALIST LICENSE
LEE MI-YOUNG

227
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:43,491
DIRECTOR LEE MI-YOUNG

228
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:45,160
You can get dressed now.

229
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:48,205
- How is she?
- What do you mean?

230
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,166
Ms. Son, please take a seat.

231
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,502
I don't have anorgasmia, do I?

232
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,463
You have a healthy libido, right?

233
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,715
- Yes.
- Have you been eating well?

234
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:00,049
- Totally.
- Do you sleep well?

235
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,259
All I need is a pillow.

236
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:05,722
Women sometimes develop anorgasmia
due to psychological reasons,

237
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:07,973
or they may have
a hard time being stimulated

238
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:10,267
because their labia majora
obscures the clitoris.

239
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:12,437
But neither case applies to you.

240
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:15,232
You don't have anorgasmia.

241
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,610
I'm relieved.

242
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:20,277
Good for you.

243
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,362
What a relief.

244
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:22,530
There are many women

245
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,990
who can't have orgasms
through intercourse alone.

246
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:27,952
Men still believe that
women can have orgasms

247
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,662
through basic penetration,

248
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:30,831
but that's not the case.

249
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,791
In what other ways
can you have orgasms, then?

250
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,626
Hey.

251
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:37,211
That's why you must target the clitoris.

252
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:39,172
Penetration isn't the guy's only job.

253
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,965
There are other places to explore.

254
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,092
Look who's playing doctor?

255
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:45,553
When you kids were
studying sperm and eggs,

256
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:47,305
she educated herself in oral sex.

257
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,224
Why would you say that, Mi-young?

258
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,559
Stop making me look cool.

259
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,521
Anyway, Hee-jae, it seems like
you don't know how it's done.

260
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,899
In order to have multiple orgasms,

261
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,195
you need the right balance
of external and internal stimulation.

262
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:03,238
But how?

263
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:07,324
The clitoris that is visible to us
is only the tip of the iceberg.

264
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:10,913
Around 8,000 nerve endings
are located inside the body...

265
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,875
Hold on.

266
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:20,546
Why am I telling you this
when I should be seeing patients?

267
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:23,634
Women over 30 should know this already!

268
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:25,927
Have a good day.

269
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:28,388
Masturbation is the way to go.

270
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:33,559
Mi-na! Don't you dare forget
about Dad's birthday next week!

271
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,812
All right. Got it.

272
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:38,439
A lady should take care
of her own business.

273
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,901
That's what it means to be a grown-up.

274
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:45,738
First order of business.
You're getting a vibrator.

275
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:48,282
You only bought useless things last time.

276
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,035
- Should I recommend a brand?
- Save it.

277
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:54,163
That Mr. Big of yours
has been working overtime.

278
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:55,122
Replace him already.

279
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:57,043
I'd have to be crazy to get rid of my boo.

280
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:00,671
Mr. Big never disappoints me.

281
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,215
Seriously?

282
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:05,925
Yes, seriously.

283
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:09,304
I'll put together a list of toys
suitable for beginners.

284
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:12,098
- You can drop me off there.
- Sure.

285
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,355
- See you.
- Don't forget today's task.

286
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:20,398
Okay.

287
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,150
- Thanks for the lift.
- See you.

288
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,463
What just happened?

289
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:50,846
Damn it.

290
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,226
I didn't know it was possible
to smash a side-view mirror like this.

291
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:59,104
Are you blind or something?

292
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,021
Hey.

293
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:01,899
Yes, I'm on my way.

294
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,027
There's been an accident. Nothing big.

295
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,988
Absolutely. I'll be there on time.

296
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:12,283
I'm afraid there's
somewhere urgent I need to be.

297
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,368
Mind if I take off?

298
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:15,579
You want to leave the scene?

299
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:16,705
Jeez.

300
00:19:22,086 --> 00:19:23,796
Here's my number. Call me.

301
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,340
CHA WOO-JAE

302
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:32,596
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK
CHA WOO-JAE

303
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,348
Talk to my insurance company!

304
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:37,101
Hey, wait...

305
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:41,605
You crazy bastard!

306
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,820
Has he lost his damn mind?

307
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:10,926
Jeez.

308
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:13,886
Is this it?

309
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:14,930
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE REVIEW

310
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:22,812
Can I help you find something?

311
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:24,023
- Oh, hello.
- Welcome.

312
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:26,733
Do you carry these?

313
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,278
Of course, we do.

314
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,405
Don't you know where you are?

315
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:33,532
Love.

316
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,159
Peace.

317
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,242
Sex.

318
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:37,577
We have everything.

319
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,747
- Georgina.
- Yes?

320
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,211
Can you get me
the Satisfier Pro 2 and the Every Girl?

321
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,046
Yes, ma'am.

322
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,797
- Are you a novice user?
- Yes.

323
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:50,799
Watch and observe.

324
00:20:51,257 --> 00:20:54,219
Toys can be split into three categories.

325
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,346
First, we have dildos.
Pretty, aren't they?

326
00:20:57,472 --> 00:21:00,433
Vibrators are designed
to stimulate the clitoris.

327
00:21:02,186 --> 00:21:05,981
And then we have something
that combines both worlds.

328
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,400
May I?

329
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,071
Powerful, isn't it?

330
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:13,906
Yes.

331
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:18,409
In addition to what you're looking for,

332
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,996
there are also sweet toys like this
that are good for beginners.

333
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:23,455
It's adorable!

334
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,042
It's one of our latest products.

335
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,543
Press the button.

336
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,549
Don't judge it by its size.

337
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,553
Then what about this one?

338
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:40,515
Wow, you have an eye for these things.

339
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:43,351
It's our best-seller.

340
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,147
The passion you display

341
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:50,234
is enough to warrant
a visit from The Big O.

342
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:53,486
Right?

343
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:16,968
I don't need the packaging.
I'll put everything in my purse.

344
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,594
What if you want an exchange or refund?

345
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:19,847
It'll be fine.

346
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,390
You can vouch for its performance, right?

347
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:26,435
Don't you worry.
Not everyone has used these,

348
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:28,856
but anyone who has comes back for more.

349
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:56,090
Aren't you a sweetheart?

350
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:57,425
Hi, there.

351
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,095
Gosh, you know how to shake?

352
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:04,350
Are you happy to see me?

353
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,768
Thank you.

354
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:14,609
- My gosh!
- My apologies.

355
00:23:14,985 --> 00:23:17,112
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

356
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,958
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

357
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:32,836
Wait.

358
00:23:33,503 --> 00:23:34,338
I...

359
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:37,216
Well...

360
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,677
You called it a healthy pastime.

361
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:42,846
I didn't say a word.

362
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,433
Right, of course. You didn't.

363
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:48,810
Did you know

364
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,231
that sex contributes to longevity?

365
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:54,358
That's right.

366
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,443
I see.

367
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:58,237
Live long, then.

368
00:23:58,528 --> 00:23:59,405
Right.

369
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,156
Have a good night.

370
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:18,632
Do you live around here?

371
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,426
- Yes.
- Really? Since when?

372
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:22,594
I recently moved here.

373
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:25,305
Have you been to the tent bar
at the intersection?

374
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:27,182
- It's run by an old lady.
- No.

375
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,517
Tables are set outside in the winter
and create a killer vibe.

376
00:24:30,518 --> 00:24:32,187
- The sea snail soup and...
- Excuse me.

377
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:34,606
Are you asking me out for drinks?

378
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:36,316
What?

379
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:38,319
No, I'm just saying.

380
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:40,487
I only drink with people
I'm comfortable with.

381
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:42,989
I see.

382
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,992
Right. I'll get going, then.

383
00:24:45,742 --> 00:24:46,618
Wait.

384
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:48,203
I hope

385
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:50,456
you have a very good night.

386
00:24:58,255 --> 00:25:00,966
Seriously? What a jerk.

387
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:02,884
Whatever.

388
00:25:16,357 --> 00:25:18,192
So this is my target.

389
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,286
Gosh. Head rush.

390
00:25:32,122 --> 00:25:33,040
Okay.

391
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:41,839
CLITORAL SUCKER, MULTIFUNCTIONAL, BASIC
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe.

392
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,050
BASIC

393
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,226
PLAY BOOKS

394
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:58,232
HIT THE SPOT

395
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,698
You called it a healthy pastime.

396
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:08,616
So...

397
00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:13,955
That's a pastime, all right.

398
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,545
Are they ready?

399
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:21,464
We'll begin, then.

400
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:26,927
When you want to masturbate.

401
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:30,012
When the guy couldn't satisfy you.

402
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:31,223
When you need a good night's sleep.

403
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,435
Nothing melts away stress
like masturbation.

404
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:38,771
You do it for pleasure,
not because you need to.

405
00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:41,274
When movies or books turn you on.

406
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:43,692
When there's no one
you want to have sex with.

407
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:45,112
It's still just as good.

408
00:26:45,946 --> 00:26:47,656
What's your go-to visual aid?

409
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,451
I like to use my imagination.

410
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,330
Most adult movies are filmed
from a guy's perspective,

411
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:56,373
so it's not that fun.

412
00:26:56,623 --> 00:27:00,169
We'd appreciate you sharing
some of the goodies you know.

413
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:03,464
I recommend a collaboration
of photos, videos, and novels.

414
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:04,964
Nothing beats your imagination.

415
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:07,216
The sex can be customized any way I want.

416
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:09,218
HOW DO YOU MASTURBATE SAFELY?

417
00:27:09,219 --> 00:27:11,054
Share some pointers, please.

418
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:12,930
Forget everything else.

419
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:13,931
Get yourself a toy.

420
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,392
It's capitalism at its best.

421
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:16,643
Keep your toys clean.

422
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,102
If a vibrator isn't for you,

423
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,147
I recommend finger condoms.

424
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:24,066
Always start by caressing your breasts.

425
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:26,444
Use oil or lotion
when stimulating your clitoris.

426
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:29,364
Up and down, left and right.

427
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:32,283
Open your legs wide
and touch yourself gently.

428
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,035
Do it with pride, not guilt.

429
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,787
Praise yourself afterward.

430
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:39,040
To all of our female listeners
who are tuned in,

431
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:41,544
if you haven't masturbated yet,

432
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,878
HASN'T MASTURBATED YET
get on it right now.

433
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:46,881
Why should I feel guilty
about touching my own body?

434
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:48,717
Don't feel guilty and touch yourself!

435
00:27:51,678 --> 00:27:55,265
This segment was to help us
awaken our confined senses.

436
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,393
Hit the Spot.

437
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:07,570
EPILOGUE

438
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,918
So that's how it's done.
