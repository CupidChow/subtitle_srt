00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:07,221
THIS FICTIONAL SERIES WAS INSPIRED
BY REAL PEOPLE, LOCATIONS, AND EVENTS

2
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:09,015
AND IS NOT SAFE FOR WORK
DUE TO ITS SEXUAL CONTENT

3
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:41,632
We've been together for five years.

4
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:46,010
Shall we?

5
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:47,178
What about the movie?

6
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,222
- Where's the condom?
- Right.

7
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:50,432
In my backpack.

8
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:57,688
When my boyfriend gets hard
while watching a movie,

9
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:00,692
we have sex after some brief foreplay.

10
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:13,956
Once we start, my imagination takes over.

11
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:16,042
"I'm an actress.

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,544
Do what she does, and I'm golden."

13
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:25,009
There's no plot twist
in this movie of mine.

14
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:28,303
We just play the roles we're given.

15
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:31,597
Orgasms are still a mystery to me.

16
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:33,475
I always come close, but not quite.

17
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:35,101
I wonder how it feels.

18
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:40,148
Are there women out there
who actually have orgasms?

19
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:45,821
Is it good?

20
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,031
Yes.

21
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:49,490
- It's good.
- It's never been good.

22
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,826
- Really?
- It's only my acting that improves.

23
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:52,745
It's so good.

24
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:15,266
When the movie reaches its climax,

25
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:16,977
so do we.

26
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:22,232
- I'm going to finish.
- Okay.

27
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:26,820
Was it good, you ask?

28
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,995
I only said it was good

29
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:36,956
because you liked it.

30
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,374
I guess that'd be a more honest answer.

31
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:07,861

Ms. Son.

38
00:03:48,652 --> 00:03:50,863
- Yes, Ms. Lee?
- Mr. Sim is asking for you.

39
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:52,822
- Me?
- And me.

40
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:53,657
What for?

41
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,160
Hey.

42
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,202
LEE MI-NA, SON HEE-JAE

43
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,411
What mess did you get into?

44
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:00,497
Me? Get into trouble?

45
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:01,957
No way.

46
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,500
Why is he summoning us both, then?

47
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:05,877
Beats me.

48
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,963
When have I ever caused trouble at work?

49
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,590
Hold on. He must've found out.

50
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:13,010
- Find what out?
- That you're a nutcase.

51
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:15,554
You're such a jerk.

52
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,764
Why does he want to see us both?

53
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:19,808
We'll find out soon enough.

54
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:23,229
Ms. Son.

55
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:24,730
Yes?

56
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,191
What's with the bags under your eyes?

57
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:29,942
Did you enjoy a steamy night
with Hyun-woo?

58
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:32,445
Yes, and I hardly got any sleep.

59
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,782
Is it that bad?

60
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,117
Stop going at it like rabbits.

61
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:39,119
Doesn't it get old?

62
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:40,620
Whatever.

63
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:41,996
Are you sick of it?

64
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:44,124
What? Of course not.

65
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:45,959
How can one get sick of it?

66
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:52,132
Good for you.

67
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:55,927
"I want to protect my man's pride.

68
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,804
Our sex follows a routine."

69
00:04:58,222 --> 00:04:59,598
"Hit the Spot"?

70
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,724
What are we reading?

71
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,642
It's our company's podcast show.

72
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:07,022
GENERAL MANAGER
SIM SEOK-CHUN

73
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,235
How neat is that!

74
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:15,405
All right. Hit the Spot.

75
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:17,656
I want you two to take over.

76
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:18,491
- Sorry?
- Pardon?

77
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,867
Didn't you see the news?

78
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,410
Choi Soo-a was caught in a scandal

79
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:24,038
and can't host the show
starting this week.

80
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:25,873
Are you asking us to host a podcast show?

81
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:27,792
Mr. Sim, that's absurd.

82
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,961
You went to college together
and started here in the same year,

83
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,212
so I take it you're good friends.

84
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:33,589
Yes, I guess you can say that.

85
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,258
That's all I needed to hear.

86
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:39,220
As you know, the podcast is about
the secretive sex lives of women.

87
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:41,848
You can talk to them
like you're friends or sisters.

88
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:44,185
There's no one else
better suited for the job.

89
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:46,102
Well...

90
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:49,647
What Ms. Lee has to say
won't be broadcast-friendly.

91
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:50,773
That's all right.

92
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,441
We're known for being blunt.

93
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:54,568
Ms. Son gets nervous in front of cameras.

94
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,281
That's also fine.
It'll be recorded, not filmed.

95
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,700
But we get a rush
of new books this time of year.

96
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:02,702
We're working overtime as it is.

97
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:04,246
More work would just crush me.

98
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:08,334
Crush you?

99
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:11,920
Did it sound like

100
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,007
I was asking for a favor?

101
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:22,014
My gosh.

102
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,225
Forget I said that.

103
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,934
It'll only be for two months.

104
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:29,603
Once you're done,
you'll get paid leave for a month.

105
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:30,438
What do you say?

106
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,733
Any more attitude,
and you might regret it.

107
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,194
One month of paid leave?

108
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:36,987
We'll do our best.

109
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,534
HIT THE SPOT

110
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,831
HIT THE SPOT

111
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,544
We got this.

112
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,598
There was a time when sex
was considered a taboo subject.

113
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,225
They say times have changed,

114
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,229
but old-fashioned notions
still seem to exist.

115
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,231
There's no need to be embarrassed by sex.

116
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,858
We have a right to satisfy our urges.

117
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:18,194
Do you wish to have orgasms?

118
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:20,322
Then do it until you come.

119
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:24,158
Women have the right to be satisfied.

120
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,785
We bring you more provocative stories.

121
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:26,745
This is Hit the Spot.

122
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,123
And it begins right now.

123
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,877
"Our sex follows a routine.

124
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:36,297
We only ever try three positions.

125
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:38,923
Until it's all over,

126
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:41,551
I do my best to fake it.

127
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,929
Why do I put on an act, you ask?

128
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:47,557
Because I don't want to hurt

129
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:49,810
my man's pride."

130
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,603
I'm going to finish.

131
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:53,272
- Okay.
- "Will our sex life

132
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,023
be okay if this continues?"

133
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,860
I'm not interested in dating,

134
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,779
but I want to have sex.

135
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:02,530
I know what it is to love,

136
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:06,033
but I'm lost when it comes to sex.

137
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,534
Is dating a must for sex?

138
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:08,370
Why's that?

139
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:09,955
Orgasms?

140
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:11,705
Does everyone have them?

141
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:12,958
What? Of course.

142
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,335
Come on. Be honest with me.

143
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:17,296
Everyone fakes it a third of the time.

144
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,923
Wait, is it just me? Seriously?

145
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,548
Come on.

146
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:23,302
You've all faked it before, right?

147
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:28,306
- See you at the next meeting.
- Sure.

148
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,267
- Yes. Have a good day.
- Thank you.

149
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:35,980
So what will you do on your time off?

150
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:37,023
What do you think?

151
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,524
I'm leaving the country.

152
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:39,775
What about me, then?

153
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:41,194
What am I supposed to do?

154
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:42,945
Do as you please while I travel.

155
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:44,405
Jeez. Where are you going?

156
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:46,783
- Bali.
- Bali?

157
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:48,368
By the way,

158
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,246
that woman who shared her story
really frustrated me.

159
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:53,289
- How so?
- I mean,

160
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,915
sex is a sport.

161
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,835
Nerves can cause people
to underperform at first.

162
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,380
Then it takes time
for couples to know what works.

163
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:01,588
But after the third try?

164
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,132
She should've been done with him.

165
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,468
No exceptions. The end.

166
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,469
That's pretty heartless.

167
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,554
You'll scare guys
into keeping their underwear on.

168
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:11,433
Should I be patient
and hope for the best, then?

169
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:12,893
And keep faking it?

170
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,440
You're right.

171
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,443
That's just wrong.

172
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,154
SECRETIVE BUT ELECTRIFYING
THE G-SPOT ROAD MAP

173
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:27,865
Unbelievable.
The G-spot myth is so outdated,

174
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,493
but books like these still come out.

175
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,747
You'll find more information
on online community boards.

176
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:35,416
G-spots don't exist anymore?

177
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,127
They used to, but now they don't.

178
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:40,546
What do you mean?

179
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,515
Why do you think our podcast
is called Hit the Spot?

180
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:53,891
It's because G-spots are a fantasy.

181
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:55,059
That's why.

182
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,936
People have explored vaginas

183
00:09:56,937 --> 00:09:58,938
every which way to find the G-spot,

184
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:00,022
but nothing has come up.

185
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:01,108
It just doesn't exist.

186
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:02,900
Knock, knock!

187
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,571
- Are you there, Ms. G-spot?
- Hey.

188
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:08,406
- Keep it down.
- Seriously.

189
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,117
So many women lived in anxiety
over not having orgasms

190
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:13,370
because they thought
they didn't have G-spots.

191
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:17,873
But they weren't aware
of what really matters.

192
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:18,875
What does she mean?

193
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:20,461
What really matters?

194
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,878
Come on. Let's head out.

195
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,590
What we're looking for isn't here.

196
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,037
Nothing's more important
than first-hand experience.

197
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,581
And sex is a first-hand experience
of bodies coming together.

198
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,258
TOUCH THEIR PRIVATES FOR 30 SECONDS

199
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:10,760
HAND IN PARTNER'S UNDERWEAR FOR 10 SECONDS

200
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:22,981
This place is insane.

201
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,117
- Let's start over here.
- Sure.

202
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:38,163
No way.

203
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,705
This must be new.

204
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:41,790
I love how it feels.

205
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,710
Good. It has ridges.

206
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:47,171
And it vibrates as well.

207
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:48,714
The girth is right on point.

208
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:49,716
It's nicely made.

209
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:51,927
Here. I'll show you how it works.

210
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,346
- I already know.
- Do you?

211
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:55,972
How do you use it, then?

212
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:58,141
Like this.

213
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,442
That looks good. Come on.

214
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:09,778
Take a look at that.

215
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,617
Gosh, you'll look hot in this.

216
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:16,743
I look so sexy.

217
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:18,954
- Wear it tonight.
- It even has a tail. This is crazy.

218
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:22,790
They even have candy.

219
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,041
This is adorable.

220
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:25,042
It's cute, right?

221
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:26,043
Do you know what these are?

222
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:27,713
- What are they?
- Condoms.

223
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:29,798
How adorable.

224
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,970
Hey.

225
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,221
This right here

226
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:38,013
is a penis ring.

227
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:40,808
You put this on his penis.

228
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:44,103
Then accommodate him as usual.

229
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:45,272
And then...

230
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,694
This is your one-way ticket to heaven.

231
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:53,280
You get what I'm saying, right?

232
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,340
THE SEX TOY THAT'LL GUARANTEE A WILD NIGHT

233
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:19,014
HOW TO USE A VIBRATING PENIS RING

234
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:33,487
Gosh. Oh, no.

235
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,077
You're home early.

236
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:42,412
Hey.

237
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,247
What's that on your head?

238
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,302
Are you up for it today?

239
00:13:57,969 --> 00:13:59,096
Or are you tired?

240
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,681
I was,

241
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,100
but now I'm not.

242
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,560
I'll be right back.

243
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:08,939
- Ta-da.
- What's that?

244
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,899
Give me your hand.

245
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:14,318
It's called a penis ring.

246
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,404
Apparently, the sex will be mind-blowing.

247
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:17,864
A penis what?

248
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,244
You expect me to wear this?

249
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,204
Are you not up for it?

250
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:26,290
It's not something kinky.

251
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:29,459
Once you put it on

252
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,670
- and press the button...
- This thing.

253
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,714
Did Mi-na talk you into buying this?

254
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:36,800
Will you stop letting her rub off on you?

255
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:38,385
What does she have to do with this?

256
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:40,679
I bought it so that we could have fun.

257
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,101
Forget it. I won't force you.

258
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,020
Are you on your period?

259
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:51,189
What?

260
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:53,024
I don't need toys like this.

261
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,694
Where is this even coming from?

262
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:58,905
Jeez.

263
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,117
I always wondered
who would buy stuff like that.

264
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:04,369
Jeez.

265
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:06,788
Pass the ball. Kick it! Go!

266
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:07,748
Darn.

267
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:10,208
What's wrong with buying sex toys?

268
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,961
It was for me, not you.

269
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,088
I bought this for myself.

270
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:17,090
What?

271
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:18,634
Why would you even need that?

272
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,394
HOT HOT TTEOKBOKKI

273
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,397
SOUP TTEOKBOKKI: 5,000 WON

274
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:54,687
Nothing beats carbs after a good workout.

275
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:55,731
This looks delicious.

276
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,944
- Here.
- I'm good.

277
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:02,028
Just stick to yours.

278
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:06,032
Are you going to leave straight away?

279
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:09,703
Do you want to stay the night?

280
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,457
- To make up for the room fee?
- Jeez.

281
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:15,333
Don't you want to?

282
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:17,669
Why ask the obvious?

283
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:19,797
I can only sleep in my bed.

284
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:25,844
How about we go steady?

285
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:28,305
You and me?

286
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,016
You must be insane.

287
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:32,434
Don't you want to?

288
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:34,561
No, I don't.

289
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:35,771
Why not?

290
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:40,191
Because that's been our deal all along.

291
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,361
I'll date someone else, then.

292
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:45,196
Whatever.

293
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:47,824
This was our last time, then.

294
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:48,950
How so?

295
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:50,451
My dating someone else

296
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,287
doesn't stop us from having sex.

297
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:56,792
What are you playing at?

298
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,461
It's not like you care.

299
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:02,129
Wanting to have sex without dating

300
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,174
doesn't mean I'm a morally corrupt tramp.

301
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:09,055
What you said just now proved
that you're no good to me anymore.

302
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:13,893
What?

303
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:17,771
I'm done with you.

304
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:31,243
Hey, you're here.

305
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,913
I'd like some soju, please.

306
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:46,340
Here you go.

307
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:49,594
How about some whiskey
instead of soju tonight?

308
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,137
Its subtle orange flavor
will go down smoothly.

309
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:54,432
And its finish has
the right amount of spice

310
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,602
that perfectly balances...

311
00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:00,522
I'd rather stick to what I always have.

312
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,148
Stubborn, aren't you?

313
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:05,235
Well, here's your soju.

314
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:08,654
Thank you.

315
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:10,074
Don't mention it.

316
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:29,051
Are you sure everyone heard that sigh?

317
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:32,679
What's going on? Is something the matter?

318
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:37,101
What's your take...

319
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,771
on a relationship
that has lasted five years?

320
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,151
A committed relationship of five years?

321
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,864
You don't try
to get to know each other anymore.

322
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:52,950
You can't be bothered.

323
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,078
After five years,
you're practically family.

324
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,329
You know how it is.

325
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,750
We're closest to our family,
but we can also feel detached from them.

326
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:06,045
Being close emotionally
is a different concept.

327
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:07,756
We're not curious about one another.

328
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:12,302
But once anyone notices
that emotional gap,

329
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:15,472
the relationship is over.

330
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:20,601
Of course, in some cases,
people overcome that gap

331
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,645
and live happily ever after.

332
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:24,190
But the chances of that are slim.

333
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,568
Are we perhaps talking about you?

334
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,591
Which one should I watch?

335
00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:53,134
YOUR FANTASY

336
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:54,260
MY SECRET PARTNER

337
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:55,929
A NIGHT OF DESIRE

338
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:56,763
INTO YOUR GAZE

339
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,308
A NIGHT OF DESIRE

340
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,601
Okay.

341
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:12,571
Who should I play with tonight?

342
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,242
Pink Boy, how about it?

343
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,202
Gosh, Mr. Big.

344
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:20,620
Do you also want to play?

345
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:22,581
You as well?

346
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:24,958
Gosh, you're putting me in a tight spot.

347
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,877
What should I do?

348
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,673
Mr. Big, are you up for it?

349
00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:35,969
Who's here at this hour?

350
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:40,766
Why are you here?

351
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,934
- You have booze, right?
- No.

352
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,061
Come on.

353
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:53,279
No, not that.

354
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:54,820
There's beer in the fridge.

355
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:56,240
You're so cheap.

356
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:01,911
Hey, don't you have any soju?

357
00:22:01,912 --> 00:22:03,872
I don't, and this isn't a bar.

358
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:05,707
What?

359
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,976
What is this about?
Just lay it out for me.

360
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:28,062
It's in your best interest
not to waste my time.

361
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:30,941
You kind of ruined my plans
if you know what I mean.

362
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:33,401
Hyun-woo and I...

363
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:36,864
We've been together for five whole years.

364
00:22:38,282 --> 00:22:42,619
But do you think
what we had this entire time

365
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,746
was really true love?

366
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:46,165
Did you two argue?

367
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:51,045
- Yes.
- What was it about this time?

368
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:01,055
We weren't done talking!

369
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:04,349
You just told me
I was bad in bed, damn it!

370
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,101
What more can I say to that?

371
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:09,563
When did I ever say that?

372
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:14,818
That's what you were implying.

373
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,118
All I wanted was to climax.

374
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:35,089
I really didn't want to say this...

375
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:42,888
but the girls I've been with
liked it just fine.

376
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:50,562
Maybe you have anorgasmia.

377
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:54,232
- What?
- Think about it.

378
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,983
We've been together for five years.

379
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:58,987
Not being able to come
all that time is on you.

380
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:01,365
This isn't a matter

381
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,034
of pointing fingers.

382
00:24:04,868 --> 00:24:06,161
This is about us as a couple.

383
00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:08,997
No, there's no issue with me.

384
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,667
You brought it up,
so the issue must be with you.

385
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:17,965
Of course.

386
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:23,511
All you ever cared about
was whether you climaxed or not.

387
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,596
What?

388
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,016
What did you just say?

389
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:29,893
Hey.

390
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:32,187
You once said that
you couldn't get enough of me!

391
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:52,040
So what happened?

392
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,834
Just tell me already.

393
00:24:56,086 --> 00:24:57,754
I've watched this more than ten times.

394
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:01,800
In the next scene, the girl has an orgasm.

395
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,018
Like this.

396
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,519
Have you lost your mind?

397
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:16,272
Seemed real, didn't it?

398
00:25:16,273 --> 00:25:17,232
It did.

399
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:19,693
You should've gone into acting instead.

400
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:21,611
Hey.

401
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:26,408
When you're in bed,

402
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:30,329
do you make those sounds and expressions?

403
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,206
Does it come naturally to you

404
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:34,915
because you feel pure ecstasy?

405
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:37,710
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

406
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,921
What is it? Just tell me.

407
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:45,177
All this time...

408
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,110
I've been faking it.

409
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,910
Damn it.

410
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,460
I've never had an orgasm!

411
00:26:23,424 --> 00:26:24,383
What the...

412
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:26,593
Say that again.

413
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:29,305
An orgasm.

414
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:31,932
I've never had one before.

415
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:34,059
Not even once?

416
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:38,063
Seriously?

417
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:39,814
How is that possible?

418
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,649
It's understandable when you were younger,

419
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,734
but you've been with him for five years.

420
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,778
You would've had sex hundreds of times.

421
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,322
How does this make any sense?

422
00:26:47,323 --> 00:26:49,241
- The real issue, though...
- The real issue?

423
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,827
He believed that

424
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,247
I really enjoyed it.

425
00:27:04,465 --> 00:27:05,966
But still,

426
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:08,051
why didn't you confide in me?

427
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:14,099
I never meant to fake it at first.

428
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:17,478
I didn't even know there was a problem.

429
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:22,983
Later on, I got the gist
of what I was supposed to feel.

430
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,362
I was right on the edge of getting it.

431
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:28,113
But then...

432
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:32,034
I'm sorry.

433
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:36,955
It's not something
you have to apologize for.

434
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,249
Wait. Hold on.

435
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,794
You've been faking it for five years.

436
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:45,921
How could he not have caught on?

437
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:47,674
Part of it is on me, I guess,

438
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,177
since I pretended to enjoy it.

439
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:52,262
Why are you still taking his side?

440
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:55,764
If it had been bothering you that much,

441
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:57,601
you should've come to me.

442
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,436
Or you should've talked to him about it.

443
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,480
Instead, you just kept it to yourself.

444
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,023
Unbelievable.

445
00:28:04,024 --> 00:28:06,943
I thought you were smart,
but you're actually a moron.

446
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,824
I'm tired of faking it.

447
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,619
I'm not going to do it anymore.

448
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:17,120
Gosh.

449
00:28:18,288 --> 00:28:19,206
This is so unfair.

450
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:23,586
I want to have orgasms too!

451
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:25,211
Come on.

452
00:28:25,212 --> 00:28:27,046
You're only 30.

453
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:29,507
You can start having them,
so what's the issue?

454
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:30,426
Orgasms?

455
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:32,801
Look, they're no big deal.

456
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:35,137
It's like riding a bike or swimming.

457
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:38,392
Once you learn how to do it,
your body will remember what to do.

458
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:40,936
Will I be able to have them?

459
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,356
Come on. Don't you have faith in me?

460
00:28:45,315 --> 00:28:47,316
An orgasmic experience?

461
00:28:47,317 --> 00:28:50,778
I'll have you seeing stars
that are billions of miles away.

462
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:52,029
Don't you worry.

463
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,115
Just trust me.

464
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:54,408
Got it?

465
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:58,286
All right, Hee-jae.

466
00:28:58,287 --> 00:29:01,747
In the hopes of you
having orgasms in the future,

467
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:02,999
I'll pop this champagne.

468
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:06,002
Just so you know, this is really pricey.

469
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:10,339
Why bring out the champagne
when we're just getting started?

470
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,302
How is this not a blessing?
All that's left are orgasms after orgasms.

471
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:16,012
This calls for a celebration.

472
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:18,890
Let's celebrate

473
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,644
Hee-jae's future orgasms!

474
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,728
- Come on. Join me.
- What?

475
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:24,729
Just do it!

476
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,189
One, two, three.

477
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,983
- Here's to you!
- Here's to me!

478
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:45,875
- The Big O!
- The Big O!

479
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:48,795
- The Big O!
- The Big O!

480
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:58,220
PLAY BOOKS

481
00:29:58,221 --> 00:29:59,347
HIT THE SPOT

482
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:01,684
It's this way. Not very impressive, is it?

483
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,024
Come on. Don't be lame.

484
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:10,942
Say hello.

485
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,611
I'm sure you recognize Kang In-chan.

486
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:14,111
The author of the popular

487
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,700
Psychology for Her, A Talk about Sex.

488
00:30:18,325 --> 00:30:21,203
His work has been
keeping our business open.

489
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,911
Goodness, hello.

490
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:24,664
I'm a huge fan.

491
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:26,166
Can we shake hands?

492
00:30:27,543 --> 00:30:31,003
He'll be giving us advice
on our podcast script.

493
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:32,338
I practically had to beg.

494
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,593
I set aside my pride, got on my knees,

495
00:30:35,842 --> 00:30:37,636
and begged for his help.

496
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:40,971
- No way.
- I was worried about the show

497
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,767
being run by employees,

498
00:30:43,225 --> 00:30:45,769
but having you on board as an advisor

499
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,605
is very reassuring.

00:30:48,355 --> 00:30:51,107
Those employees over there
are the show's hosts.

501
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:52,984
Ms. Son Hee-jae and Ms. Lee Mi-na.

502
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:58,364
I'm hoping to make this show
big and famous.

503
00:30:58,365 --> 00:30:59,575
I look forward to working with you.
