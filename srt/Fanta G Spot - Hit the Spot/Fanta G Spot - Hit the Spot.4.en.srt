1
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:01,485
Gosh, I needed that.

2
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,931
My relationship ended, but...

3
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:15,183
DEPARTMENT STORE: 730,000 WON
PINOCCHIO BAR: 54,500 WON

4
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:18,126
TOTAL: 3,298,300 WON
...my credit card bill still remained.

5
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:26,886
Restoring my crushed self-esteem
and my disrupted daily routine

6
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,347
are what I had to focus on
following my breakup.

7
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:40,440
HEE-JAE AND HYUN-WOO'S RESTAURANT TOUR

8
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:43,276
HEE-JAE, HYUN-WOO

9
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:49,676
Since I vowed
to put myself first from now on,

10
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,887
I'll clear out the remnants
of my past relationship

11
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,996
and figure out
what I really want in life...

12
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:58,500
in order to satisfy my desires

13
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,544
and for my own happiness.

EPISODE 4. PERFECT PARTNER REQUIREMENTS

21
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:02,331
What does Mr. Sim want this time?

22
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:03,291
Beats me.

23
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:05,067
Maybe there's a new project this week.

24
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:09,029
The workload will fall on us
since we're the easiest to order around.

25
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,076
You looked like hell these past two weeks,
but you're in a good mood today.

26
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,036
It's time I got my act together.

27
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:17,955
By the way, how did it go with that guy?

28
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,558
We agreed to meet this weekend.

29
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:22,709
This weekend? As in a date?

30
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,479
Don't be ridiculous.

31
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:26,880
This isn't some romantic rendezvous.

32
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:28,357
It's the real deal.

33
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:31,343
I need my head on straight
if I don't want to be devoured.

34
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:32,904
What do you mean, "devoured"?

35
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:34,781
This isn't the animal kingdom.

36
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:37,641
Do you know what happens
when two predators cross paths?

37
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,934
No.

38
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,244
One of them might die.

39
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:42,771
This isn't a game.

40
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,941
You're just sleeping with him once.
What's all this fuss about?

41
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,527
Who says it's a one-time thing?

42
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,071
You won't know
until you've actually done it.

43
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,676
I can feel it already.
You know how my hunches are.

44
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,493
It's me, Lee Mi-na.

45
00:03:57,786 --> 00:03:59,538
"It's me, Lee Mi-na."

46
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,706
Hey, wait up.

47
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,336
- I hope everything goes well.
- Likewise.

48
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:07,963
- Shall we get going?
- Sure.

49
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:10,150
Now, then...

50
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,567
You're here.

51
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:14,529
These two are the hosts of our podcast.

52
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:17,139
Say hello. This is Mr. Kim
from Fang Entertainment.

53
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:18,825
- Hello.
- Hello.

54
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:19,766
Yes, hello.

55
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:22,620
- I look forward to hearing from you.
- Don't you worry.

56
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:23,621
Okay, then.

57
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,397
- Mr. Kang, shall we?
- Sure.

58
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:32,029
I'll see you around, Mr. Kang.

59
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,783
- Get in here.
- All right.

60
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:40,453
Here you go.

61
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,460
18:00 KANG IN-CHAN
Isn't this Mr. Kang's seminar?

62
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:50,148
Right, the book festival.

63
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,173
I'll pass.

64
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:53,926
I have something important
lined up this weekend.

65
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:56,553
Well...

66
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:59,639
Do you need us to help out
with this event?

67
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:03,852
Like always, you're quick
to read the room.

68
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:06,622
Our podcast

69
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:10,234
is on the verge
of becoming widely popular.

70
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,027
So what do we do now?

71
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,319
Promotions!

72
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:15,197
Great timing, right?

73
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:18,575
I see. You want to set up a PR booth.

74
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:20,452
Isn't that a job for the PR team?

75
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:23,681
Why would I make the hosts run a PR booth

76
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:25,791
when you should be hosting the show?

77
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,169
- What?
- What?

78
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:32,089
You want us to host
a live episode at the festival?

79
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:36,236
Yes, it's a public broadcast.
What do you think?

80
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,530
People in their 20s and 30s
will be flooding the event.

81
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:41,682
You can interview them
and promote the show.

82
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,602
Of course, I'll make sure that
your overtime pay will be worth it.

83
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:49,857
How much are we talking about?

84
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:52,043
Ms. Son, please.

85
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,653
Do you really want to work
over the weekend?

86
00:05:54,862 --> 00:05:58,199
It will be for exactly an hour,
and you'll be paid double.

87
00:05:58,532 --> 00:05:59,550
I'm in!

88
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:00,760
Come on!

89
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:02,679
That's the spirit!

90
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:04,681
You'll get paid as much as you work,

91
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,999
so you might as well enjoy it.

92
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,270
I've arranged everything
with the event organizer,

93
00:06:10,294 --> 00:06:11,628
so get ready for the show.

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,796
Sure thing.

95
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:15,257
- Extra pay.
- Double the amount.

96
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:18,153
What a relief.

getting married to your job?

My credit card bill this month is no joke.

100
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:31,732
Why rest when we can make money?

101
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:33,835
Don't you agree?

102
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:37,463
But I already told you about
my important engagement this weekend.

103
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:38,572
It's just for an hour.

104
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:41,051
For me? Please?

105
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:42,159
Be more desperate.

106
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,889
- Please, help me out.
- My gosh.

107
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,390
Fine. You're so annoying.

108
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:49,184

That's what you told me, remember?

Your head is finally
back on straight again.

Don't tell me you're wearing
matching underwear today.

Of course, I am.

I'm so proud of you, Hee-jae.

Right. There's nothing better
than physical labor to get over a breakup.

You get it, right?

Hello, my name is Cha Sun-woo.

134
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:13,792
I literally had to beg Soo-young
to set up this date.

135
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,086
You did?

136
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:18,880
You're even prettier in person, though.

Thank you.

Excuse me. Can we get the menu, please?

I hope you enjoy your meal.

Thanks. You too.

Okay.

You must be very busy.

Do you want anything else?

151
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:28,033
How about we order some drinks, then?

152
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:29,910
I'm in the mood to drink.

153
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:35,791
Just a second, then.

154
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,084
Okay.

00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:48,678
How about we order some wine?

157
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:51,056
I'd love that.

00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:52,975

You seem tipsy. Are you all right?

162
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,587
I'm fine.

163
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:25,882
I haven't had wine in a while,
so it went straight to my head.

164
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:32,222
It'd be a shame
to part ways so early tonight.

165

Why don't we go somewhere quiet?

166
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:36,893
"Somewhere quiet"?

167
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:38,687
I'd like that.

168
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:43,293
But why haven't you had any wine?

169
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:45,569
It seems like
I'm the only one who's drinking.

170
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,340
You actually did drink most of it.

171
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:49,573
Let's raise our glasses.

172
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:50,842
Cheers!

173
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:54,304
Humans learn from their mistakes
and become better people because of them.

174
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:58,332
I decided to let my past failures
be the fuel to stoke my fire.

175
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:10,719
BABY HOTEL

176
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,436
Do you have a place in mind?

177
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,938
No, not really.

178
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,274
I was just looking for a decent place.

179
00:11:26,693 --> 00:11:28,070
How about here, then?

180
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:30,364
It looks nice and clean.

181
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,700
Here?

182
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:38,581
Can you give me a second?

183
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,375
Why? Don't you like it?

184
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,586
It looks really nice.

185
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,087
I've actually been here...

186
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:47,673
What I meant was...

187
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:50,217
Anyway, doesn't it seem nice?

188
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:51,427
Right?

189
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:53,554
- Well...
- Yes?

190
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,574
I'm really sorry,

191
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:58,016
but my mom says I shouldn't go here.

192
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:01,413
Your mom?

193
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,688
Yes, my mom.

194
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:09,379
Drinks? Then order some wine.

195
00:12:09,403 --> 00:12:10,630
No soju! Suggest someplace quiet.

196
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:13,466
A motel on your first date?
She's not in her right mind.

197
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,176
Come home. I'm worried about you, son.

198
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,743
Hee-jae, are you all right?

199
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,684
- Hey, Mom.
- You're not at a motel, are you?

200
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,686
Of course not. I said no.

201
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,336
- Really?
- Of course.

202
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:29,399
- Then hurry on home.
- Sure thing. I'll be right home.

203
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:31,592
- I love you, son.
- I love you too, Mom.

204
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,678
- Give me a kiss.
- All right.

205
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,101
Have a pleasant night, then.

206
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:42,603
Bye.

207
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:48,651
Hee-jae, next time,
I'll get permission from my mom.

208
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:52,028
What the...

209
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,176
Mom, can you call me a cab?

210
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,928
- Did she leave?
- Yes.

211
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:01,455
Good. Hold tight. I'll come pick you up.

212

219
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,573
Make sure it's centered.

220
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:39,260
Place it a little higher.

221
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:40,661
A little higher.

222
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:42,597
Ms. Lee.

223
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,164
A little lower, please.

224
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,100
- Is this good?
- It's not perfect,

225
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:47,292
but it'll be legible.

226
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:49,961
There we go.

227
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,964
I knew Mr. Sim would do this to us.

228
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:56,968
Mr. Kang gets a flashy sign,
but we're stuck in the corner.

229
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,304
We even gave up on our day off.

230
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:02,266
Isn't it nice and cozy here?

231
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,704
- What do you think, Yi-kyung?
- I love how we get to see Mr. Kang.

232
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,020
I wonder where he is.

233
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:09,957
Of course, it's always just me
who complains.

234
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,668
Work yourself off like a slave.

235
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:13,985
The only thing you'll get
in return is fatigue.

236
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:19,300
We already agreed to do this,
so we might as well have fun doing it.

237
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:21,910
Just one hour. After that, I'm leaving.

238
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:24,037
Today's an important day for me.

239
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,625
Good luck.

240
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:33,880

243
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,058
Please, take your seats.

244
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,537
Hello and welcome.

245
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:48,646
Hello.

246
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:51,106
Please take your seats.

247
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:54,586
AWESOME LOVE

248
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,278
Today, we'll be talking about

249
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:59,657
our sex partners.

250
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:02,135
We're going to pass around the mic,

251
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,886
so feel free to share your opinions.

252
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,622
Who wants to talk to us
about sex partners?

253
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,920
Over there.
The man in the blue striped shirt.

254
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,675
- Me?
- Yes, you.

255
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:19,694
HIT THE SPOT

256
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,428
Do you have a sex partner?

257
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,305
A sex partner?

258
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:29,144
No, I don't.

259
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:30,646
I'm lonely.

260
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,273
I DON'T ENVY YOU, 28, MALE
STUDENT

261
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:36,193
What are the advantages
of having a sex partner?

262
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:37,944
Convenience.

263
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,657
You're not dating, so you don't
have to celebrate anniversaries

264
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:43,826
or text each other every day.

265
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,954
Obviously, I'm talking about a friend.

266
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:49,665
It's not about me.

267
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,751
Can we also hear from the man
seated next to you?

268
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:57,106
FWB is someone you can have sex with

269
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,257
as well as attend festivals together.

270
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,176
You can even go watch a movie together.

271
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,864
Obviously, I'm talking about a friend.

272
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:05,305
It's not about us.

273
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,184
- We're just friends.
- We're just friends.

274
00:16:09,393 --> 00:16:12,288
FWB, 27, MALE, STUDENT
IT'S COMPLICATED, 26, FEMALE, STUDENT

275
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:14,415
Friends with benefits and sex partners.

276
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,692
Can you tell us how they're different?

277
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:19,754
A sex partner is someone
you only meet past 10 p.m.

278
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,113
If you can see them earlier, it's FWB.

279
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,575
But you might as well date in that case.

280
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,679
Anyway, I find it weird.

281
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:30,097

Author Kang In-chan's book talk
will begin now.

284
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:37,128
It's about to begin. Can I go?

285
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,715
Wait.

286
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:42,092
What?

287
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:47,031
Ms. Lee, I'll get going too.

288
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:49,116
You should at least help us clean up.

289
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,894
Right, of course. I should do that.

290

A GUIDE TO SEX IN THE AGE
OF SOCIAL DISTANCING, AUTHOR KANG IN-CHAN

291
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:06,116
The turnout is incredible.

292
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,178
How do you spend your free time?

293
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,722
- Having chicken and beer!
- Having chicken and beer!

294
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:11,639
That sounds good.

295
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,600
- Watching movies!
- Movies are good.

296
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:15,602
- Watching dramas.
- Traveling.

297
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,210
Watching dramas and traveling.

298
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:19,004
There's a lot to enjoy.

299
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:21,840
Then...

300
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,718
what about sex or masturbation?

301
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,869
We now live in the age
of social distancing.

302
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:36,521
Reduced human contact
has lowered our stress levels in general.

303
00:17:36,814 --> 00:17:39,125
But there's a new stress
that cannot be eased.

304
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:40,108
What would that be?

305
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:44,237
It's our sex drive.

306
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:49,343
Single people now find it difficult
to find partners due to the pandemic,

307
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:52,412
which leads them to seek more ways
of pleasuring themselves.

308
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,416
Meanwhile, couples are now
able to pay more attention to each other.

309
00:17:57,043 --> 00:18:02,882
That said, I think this is a time for us
to enjoy a more honest and fun sex life.

310
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:05,467
Do you agree?

311
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:07,594
- Yes, we do!
- Yes, we do!

312
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,265
Then why don't we come up with some rules

313
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:14,267
that will ensure a fun but safe sex life?

314
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,204
- Sure.
- Sounds good.

315
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,497
DJ Son.

316
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:19,773
How would you describe
your ideal sex partner?

317
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,696
Someone who is hygienic
and knows the importance of birth control.

318
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:28,574
One, practice safe sex.

319
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:30,969
Talk to your partner

320
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:34,305
and discuss the most reasonable
birth control method.

321
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:37,099
You can't enjoy sex when you're worried

322
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,167
about STDs and pregnancies.

323
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:41,670
Two, communicate.

324
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:43,964
Sex isn't a one-person activity.

325
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:46,526
Lock eyes with your partner,

326
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,261
and study their expressions
as well as their reactions.

327
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:52,973
It'd be good to pay attention
to each other's expressions

328
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:56,102
and indulge in pillow talk afterward.

329
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:58,437
Sex may seem like physical activity.

330
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:01,481
But would it surprise you
if I said it's also a verbal exercise?

331
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:04,878
Talk about what works for you
and what doesn't.

332
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:08,739
What you want from your partner
and what you enjoy in bed.

333
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:12,034
I want sex that involves
a healthy amount of conversation.

334
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,286
Last but not least,

335
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,455
enjoy what comes after
as much as the foreplay.

336
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:21,961
What comes after the guy ejaculates
is also part of the experience.

337
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,756
I wonder if there's someone out there
who ticks all of these boxes.

338
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,187
Should we wrap things up?

339
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,649
Should we?

340
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:45,859
Let's go.

341
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,637
- Look at all those people.
- In that sense,

342
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,996
- your choice of partner
- What?

343
00:19:57,454 --> 00:19:59,289
is a vital part of your relationship.

344
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,668
Do you want to find a good sex partner?

345
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,294
- Yes.
- Yes.

346
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,689
Do you want to practice safe sex?

347
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:08,024
- Yes.
- Yes.

348
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:11,527
Then first, you should learn to respect
your own sexual desires first.

349
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:14,638
Why is he going out of his way
to explain things that we already know?

350
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,198
Be quiet, will you?

351
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:18,224
Damn it. I'm late.

352
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,019
- I have to go.
- Come on...

353
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:21,603
See you.

354
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,959
Ms. Son, can I leave too?

355
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,151
- No.
- Here.

356
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,211
Thank you so much.

357
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:30,487
How could you?

358
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:41,498
Even though there are
many things you can enjoy alone,

359
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:45,293
I hope you can still continue
to be intimate with someone special

360
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,254
because two is always better than one.

361
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:51,133
So don't be so embarrassed

362
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:53,886
and be confident
to make demands on your partner.

363
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:57,305
Demand that they touch you.

364
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:03,269
That'll be all for today.

365
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:08,960
That was great!

366
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:09,985
Mr. Kang!

367
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:52,278
Girlfriend, boyfriend,
wife, or children...

368
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:54,238
Do you have any of them?

369
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:57,116
No. What about you?

370
00:21:58,075 --> 00:21:59,618
Same here.

371
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,080
I'm not interested in dating or marriage.

372
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,333
That's great. Neither am I.

373
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,462
I'm only telling you this
because people often mistake this.

374
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:16,093
I don't have sex with just anyone.

375
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,012
Neither do I.

376
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:22,850
All I want is to meet someone
who shares my values.

377
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:26,520
I bet it hasn't been easy
to meet someone like that.

378
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:28,563
Tell me about it.

379
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:30,983
We aren't even asking for much.

380
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,203
- Can I get another?
- Sure.

381
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,082
Does single malt work for you?

382
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,513
Cunnilingus is a must for me.

383
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:05,684
For me,

384
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:07,686
it's anal.

385
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:15,777
You haven't done it before?

386
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,280
- If you don't want to...
- Hardly.

387
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:21,491
Sounds good. I'll give it a shot.

388
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:25,972
If it's your first time, I suggest
getting checked out by a doctor.

389
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:27,998
That's just common sense.

390
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,086
Let's set a date.

391
00:23:32,627 --> 00:23:34,755
Weekends work best for me. How about you?

392
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:36,757
I'll work around your schedule.

393
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:40,510
But I can't guarantee anything
if there's an emergency.

394
00:23:41,595 --> 00:23:42,721
I see.

395
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:45,599
That explains the hit-and-run.

396
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:48,394
Are you a police officer?

397
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,145
Or maybe a firefighter?

398
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:54,733
Do I need to answer that?

399
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:56,026
Not at all.

400
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:57,945
I don't need to know.

401
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,740
I guess

402
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:04,159
we should get to know each other.

403
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:40,321
Let's just head upstairs.

404
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:06,281
Wait.

405
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,242
Let me freshen up first.

406
00:27:21,524 --> 00:27:23,526
KIM HYUN-WOO
Hee-jae, are you asleep?

407
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,450
How have you been?

408
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,452
I'm not doing so well.

409
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:35,763
YOU WERE ALWAYS BY MY SIDE

410
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,165
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE NOT WITH ME ANYMORE

411
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:41,186
THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS
I WANTED TO DO WITH YOU

412
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,563
BUT THERE'S NO NEXT TIME FOR US

413
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:46,798
KIM HYUN-WOO: I'M SORRY

414
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,665
Hello.

415
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:05,293
Hey, you're here.
You've been coming alone a lot lately.

416
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,902
Life is a lonely journey.

417
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,782
Hey! What are you doing here by yourself?

418
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:15,928
It's my afterparty.

419
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:18,598
Hold on. Do you two know each other?

420
00:28:18,622 --> 00:28:19,456
Yes.

421
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:22,227
I'm the advisor
on the podcast that she hosts.

422
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:24,604
A podcast? What is it called?

423
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:25,795
I'd like to tune in.

424
00:28:26,296 --> 00:28:27,773
- Hit the Spot.
- What?

425
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:28,715
Wait, what now?

426
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:30,717
Is it an erotic show?

427
00:28:31,552 --> 00:28:32,553
Of course not.

428
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:34,513
It isn't?

429
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,515
Do you two know each other?

430
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:40,519
He may seem like a decent young man now,

431
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:43,456
but he used to follow me around
the neighborhood all the time

432
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,898
when we were young.

433
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,877
He'd cry and tell me
that he needed to pee.

434
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:49,612
- That's enough.
- Okay.

435
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,656
Soju again, right?

436
00:28:52,906 --> 00:28:55,242
No. Today, I'm having whiskey.

437
00:28:56,743 --> 00:28:57,887
That's new.

438
00:28:57,911 --> 00:28:59,871
Why are you so surprised?
It's no big deal.

439
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,042
Come to think of it,
you seem somewhat different today.

440
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:06,420
I'll have what he's having.

441
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:08,422
Just a second.

442
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:15,113
Thank you.

443
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:16,012
No problem.

444
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:26,649
Jeez, what is this?

445
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,126
Why? Don't you like it?

446
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,652
It's top-shelf material.

447
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:31,320
I'll just have soju.

448
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:33,822
I'll try something new next time.

449
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:37,493
Sure. Go at your own pace.

450
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:40,203
Rushing into things is never good.

451
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:47,186
Here's the soju that you love so much.

452
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,420
Thank you.

453
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:51,632
I hope you two get along.

454
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:54,110
He thinks he's better than everyone,

455
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:55,511
so he doesn't have any friends.

456
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,137
Humor him a little.

457
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:00,932
How about a toast?

458
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,357
Hey, it's raining.

459
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:14,279
It's a perfect day for a drink.

460
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,574
And I know the perfect song
for a rainy day.

461
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:43,016
Mi-na...

462
00:30:48,355 --> 00:30:49,189
Hello?

463
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,524
Yes.

464
00:30:51,776 --> 00:30:52,777
Right now?

465
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:56,548
Okay. I'll be there right away.

466
00:30:56,572 --> 00:30:57,489
Okay.

467
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:34,025
SORRY, BUT I RECEIVED AN SOS
UNTIL NEXT TIME

468
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:37,195
Did he take off again?

469
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,771
I have a question.

470
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:14,065
What is it with men?

471
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:17,838
Why do they always end up regretting it
only after they've broken up?

472
00:32:17,862 --> 00:32:18,779
Why?

473
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,739
Why regret it when it's too late?

474
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:23,950
He was always so selfish.

475
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:25,786
What we ate,

476
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,413
where we went for dates, and even sex.

477
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,792
I let him have his way at first
since I liked him.

478
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,813
"We'll eat something you like next time."

479
00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:37,106
"We'll go where you want next time."

480
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,151
"Next time."

481
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,677
Next time as in when?

482
00:32:42,553 --> 00:32:44,805
That went on for five years.

483
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:49,017
That's just how people are.

484
00:32:49,476 --> 00:32:51,770
They all want to be dominant in some way,

485
00:32:52,354 --> 00:32:54,022
so they're quick to exploit
the kindness of others.

486
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:56,107
Are you like that too?

487
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,944
Of course not.

488
00:33:00,153 --> 00:33:02,656
Whatever. Everyone is like that.

489
00:33:03,156 --> 00:33:06,410
But everyone says they're different
and that they're considerate.

490
00:33:09,663 --> 00:33:11,248
I really am, though.

491
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,989
I'm saying you're all the same!

492
00:33:27,013 --> 00:33:28,324
No, we're not.

493
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:30,076
So you'll go along
with something you don't like?

494
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,059
Willingly.

495
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,437
- You don't drink soju, do you?
- I don't.

496
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:36,064
- Try it anyway.
- Hold on.

497
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:38,585
Who drinks soju after having whiskey?

498
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:40,461
See? You're all the same.

499
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,738
Willingly, my foot.

500
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:47,785
Now it's your turn.

501
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,771
There are two types of men in this world.

502
00:34:16,229 --> 00:34:18,983
Men who never use the word "sex."

503
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,986
And men who have no problem
saying the word "sex."

504
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:26,323
Unfortunately, all my ex-boyfriends
fell under the first category.

505
00:34:27,115 --> 00:34:28,199
Mr. Kang.

506
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:30,410
Do you know

507
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:34,874
what kind of expression you make

508
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:37,334
when you're absolutely ecstatic?

509
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,964
While doing what?

510
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:44,275
You know what.

511
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:45,551
That thing.

512
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,348
While having sex?

513
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,685
But he falls under the latter category.

514
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:57,897
I'm not sure.

515
00:34:59,065 --> 00:35:00,482
My expression?

516
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:03,027
I've never thought about it before.

517
00:35:08,365 --> 00:35:09,366
Mr. Kang.

518
00:35:11,035 --> 00:35:12,285
Do you want to do it with me?

519
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:16,082
Wait.

520
00:35:17,374 --> 00:35:18,500
Do what?

521
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:21,503
Let's see for ourselves.

522
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:24,048
What expressions we make during sex.

523
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,044
How do I look?

524
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:47,589
You're beautiful.
