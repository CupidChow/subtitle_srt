1
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,550
Do you want to live out
your sexual fantasy?

2
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,007
What was that just now?

3
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,475
Love.

4
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,023
I love you.

5
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,321
And just like that, I came face-to-face
with the truth I'd been trying to ignore.

6
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:41,907
And now,

7
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,409
it's my turn to make a decision.

8
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,044
HIT THE SPOT

9
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,989
EPISODE 8. THE CHOICE I MAKE FOR MYSELF

10
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,459
At 27,

11
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,004
my sex drive has hit an all-time low.

12
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,363
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

13
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,137
I used to love masturbating,

14
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:12,623
but it's not fun anymore,
and I can't be bothered to do it.

15
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,313
Rather than being with someone,
I have a lot more fun

16
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,880
- on my own these days.
- Bring it on!

17
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,257
Dating and sex might be
out of the picture,

18
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,653
but between playing video games
and self-improvement hobbies,

19
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,429
I have very little time to spare.

20
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,557
You're mine

21
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,519
You are mine, my darling

22
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,148
Here. Check out his abs.

23
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,695
Yi-kyung, you should
get yourself a boyfriend.

24
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,991
She's right. Date someone
and have some hot sex.

25
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,677
What are you, celibate?

26
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,262
Don't let your body go to waste.

27
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,889
Have as much sex as possible.

28
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,806
Exactly.

29
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,142
You'll get fewer chances once you turn 30.

30
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,477
You're going to regret it.

31
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,254
Now I'm wondering
if you have some kind of problem.

32
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,715
The people around me are my problem.

33
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,361
- She looks spiritless.
- My parents and friends

34
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,220
all worry about me.

35
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,515
Is it okay to live
without dating or having sex?

36
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,600
Does that make me weird?

37
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:16,895
What do you think?

38
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,649
What this listener needs right now

39
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,860
is definitely not a relationship.

40
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,737
Why are people interested
in other people's sex lives?

41
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,843
You shouldn't date someone
or have sex with them

42
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,554
just because someone pushed you
to make that decision.

43
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,305
It should be your own choice.

44
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,559
Right. Instead of thinking about
whether to have sex or not,

45
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,936
just let it happen naturally.

46
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,313
If you want to have sex, then fine.
If not, then that's fine too.

47
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,547
That's how it should be.

48
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,152
We have the right to enjoy sex
as much as we want.

49
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,428
But we're also free to not have sex.

50
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,740
Once we stop wondering
whether we're being weird or not,

51
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,309
then we can feel more liberated.

52
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,746
- This was Hit the Spot with DJ Son.
- And DJ Min.

53
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,856
Thanks for listening to our final episode.

54
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,723
Surprise!

55
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,266
You shouldn't have!

56
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,833
This last episode was the best.

57
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,084
Blow out the candles.

58
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,837
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

59
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,594
Dozens of listeners
write to us every week.

60
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,116
But maybe what they need
aren't solutions to their problems

61
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,601
but rather someone
encouraging them and their choices.

62
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,454
HIT THE SPOT

63
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,980
Whether you want to have sex or not

64
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,442
is completely your right.

65
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,700
Hold on. Are you crying?

66
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,161
I don't know why I'm tearing up.

67
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,556
It's okay. Just cry.

68
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,517
Just let it all out.

69
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,085
I'm not crying.
There's something in my eye.

70
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,569
- You're crying too?
- Get in here.

71
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,655
You did such a good job.

72
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,265
People might think that
I tortured you guys or something.

73
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,349
Stop crying!

74
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,357
You two went through a lot
these past couple of months.

75
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,651
I wasn't quite sure at first,

76
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,862
but thanks for pulling this off.

77
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,256
Mr. Sim.

78
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,217
Does this mean
our real vacation starts tomorrow?

79
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,094
You won't find us at our desks.

80
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,953
Don't forget you promised us a month.

81
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,790
Fine. Enjoy your month-long vacation.

82
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,477
Thank you!

83
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,669
GOOD JOB
Ta-da.

84
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,421
What on earth is this?

85
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,316
The podcast got such good ratings

86
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,218
that we got you a special vacation bonus.

87
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,780
Thank you, Mr. Sim! This is amazing.

88
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,532
You're the best.

89
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:58,932
We love you!

90
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,560
My gosh, save it.

91
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,696
Here's to a job well done, Hee-jae.

92
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,074
Same for me.

93
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:17,910
Good job.

94
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,932
Here's to our vacation time.

95
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,541
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

96
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,717
What? He loves you?

97
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,945
You little minx.

98
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,889
So much for never dating him. I knew it.

99
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,724
We're not dating, though.

100
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,285
But you like him too.

101
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,144
Just date him. What's the problem?

102
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,695
Is this because of Hyun-woo?

103
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,157
It's only been two months
since we broke up.

104
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,885
But getting right back on the horse?

105
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,845
That wouldn't be right to Hyun-woo.

106
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:01,828
Only two months?

107
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,515
It's been a long two months.

108
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,916
Besides, you already
went all the way with him.

109
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,294
But we started off as sex partners.

110
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,842
Stop beating around the bush
and just tell me.

111
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,385
What's the real issue here?

112
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,220
Damn it.

113
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,245
I don't know.

114
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,062
Dating is fine and all,

115
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,065
but I want some time to myself.

116
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,417
Finally!

117
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,986
Learn how to get to the point, will you?

118
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,697
I'm the worst, aren't I?

119
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,325
Don't ask someone who really is the worst.

120
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,428
Whatever.

121
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,639
It's your life and your choice.

122
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,641
Let me know if anyone judges you.

123
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,834
I'll teach them a lesson.

124
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,586
Forget it.

125
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,465
It sure is nice to be single, though.

126
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,361
You can eat what you want
and do whatever you want

127
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,863
without feeling self-conscious.

128
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,114
Yes, exactly.

129
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,599
You can even let out
really loud farts too.

130
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,660
Whatever.

131
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,371
So have you decided
what to do on vacation?

132
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,789
I mean, it starts tomorrow.

133
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,523
Things have been crazy these days.

134
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,859
I'll start thinking about it now.

135
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,028
- What about you?
- Me?

136
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,364
Well...

137
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,658
What is it?

138
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,746
I'm spending it with my boyfriend.

139
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:30,292
Hold on. A boyfriend? Just like that?

140
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,338
Wait. Are you dating that doctor?

141
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,182
What made you come all the way here?

142
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,602
I thought about what you said.

143
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,357
Were you saying
you wanted to start dating?

144
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,153
That was the booze talking yesterday.

145
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,572
I didn't mean much by it,
so just forget it.

146
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,786
Relationships are predictable.

147
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,580
But I'd like to give it a try with you.

148
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,546
We'll have the typical ups and downs
and even sometimes hurt each other,

149
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,131
which is something
that all couples experience.

150
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,553
But as long as I'm with you,
I think I can get through it.

151
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,182
We can laugh, cry,
and get angry over little things.

152
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,394
And maybe after that,
we can fall asleep together.

153
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,607
Do you want to give it a try?

154
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,286
I'd love to.

155
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,239
You little minx.

156
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,718
Why didn't you tell me before?

157
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,469
Like you're one to talk.

158
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,328
Right.

159
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,122
We'll call it even.

160
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:33,832
Settled.

161
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,424
I wonder how he knew
that I was there, though.

162
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,468
Did I tell him after I got drunk?

163
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,596
I don't remember.

164
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,249
- Hello?
- Hello?

165
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,943
- Mi-na?
- I'm Mi-na's friend.

166
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,237
Can you tell me where you are?

167
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,406
We're at...

168
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:13,872
What am I going to do
on my vacation, though?

169
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,433
Any ideas?

170
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,085
We'll get together soon,
so don't have fun without me.

171
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,336
I miss you.

172
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,548
Hey!

173
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,227
COUPANG TRAVEL SEARCH
GANGWON-DO ACCOMMODATIONS

174
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,610
Let's go see a Christmas tree.

175
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,128
Don't get any snot on this.

176
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,386
Why are you really here, though?

177
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,389
I told you earlier.

178
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,766
My previous engagement got canceled.

179
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,103
Why?

180
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,273
Does it bother you that
people think we're dating?

181
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,193
Of course, it bothers me.

182
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,863
Why do they have
to define our relationship?

183
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,368
Because people like
everything to be clear-cut.

184
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,416
What's your take
on our relationship, then?

185
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,211
Our relationship?

186
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,171
Well...

187
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:47,966
I'm not sure.

188
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:04,942
I could feel that
our ambiguous relationship

189
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,069
was coming to an end.

190
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,618
PLAY BOOKS

191
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,472
Mr. Kang.

192
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:20,082
Your lecture was the best.
Thank you so much.

193
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:21,893
Mr. Kang, you're so handsome.

194
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,853
All I could focus on was your face.

195
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:24,813
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

196
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:27,357
- Will there be a next time?
- See you again.

197
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,215
Sure.

198
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,720
How did the lecture go?

199
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,978
How did the meeting go?

200
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:42,938
Were you waiting for me?

201
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,523
Of course.

202
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,675
I'd like to see that one.

203
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:12,926
Sure.

204
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,319
I'll take these.

205
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:34,591
It's for someone I really like,
so I'd like it gift-wrapped nicely.

206
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:35,699
Yes, of course.

207
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,339
I don't see a tree around here.

208
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,884
But all of these are trees. See?

209
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,345
There are so many of them.

210
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:01,517
You're right.

211
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,977
They're as pretty as Christmas trees.

212
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,524
It's almost Christmas.

213
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,694
Yes, it's already that time of the year.

214
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,280
What are your plans for that day?

215
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:24,849
Excuse me.

216
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,643
Could you take a photo of us?

217
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,727
Of course.

218
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,836
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

219
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:31,606
Here we go.

220
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,923
One, two, three.

221
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,217
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

222
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,886
One, two, three.

223
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,306
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

224
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,016
Can we take yours too?

225
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,271
No, thank you.

226
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,040
I see.

227
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,566
- Thank you again.
- Thank you.

228
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,991
I think it's going to snow soon.

229
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,969
Did you know...

230
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,850
that being with you has changed me?

231
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:26,894
Really?

232
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,732
I sensed that about you,
but I guess you felt it too.

233
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,237
It was like finding myself again.

234
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:40,824
Both in bed

235
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,160
and out of it.

236
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,205
I'm really grateful to you.

237
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,172
The old me

238
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,508
wasn't sure of who I was.

239
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,720
I wasn't honest with myself.

240
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,682
I wasn't confident enough

241
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:09,686
to tell people
what I liked or didn't like.

242
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:17,486
That's understandable.
You were still getting to know yourself.

243
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,616
You were still able
to find your true self, though.

244
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,704
Now that you've been through this,

245
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,707
you'll never forget who you are again

246
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,836
because you know the way back to yourself.

247
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,676
But if you lose yourself
along the way again...

248
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,929
I could help.

249
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,728
I think that's something
I need to do alone.

250
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,566
You've done enough for me.

251
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,318
I'm grateful for everything.

252
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:06,827
But I'm also sorry.

253
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,001
What I need right now...

254
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,795
is time.

255
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,049
Time to figure out who I truly am.

256
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:29,308
I guess that means
we can't be friends anymore.

257
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:35,105
Not when I'm aware
of how you feel about me.

258
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:39,026
I can't ignore something like that.

259
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:50,996
I was true to my feelings...

260
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,666
and made my own choices.

261
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:59,546
If you're also being
true to your feelings...

262
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:03,425
I won't resent you, so don't be sorry.

263
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,054
People can't always be...

264
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,057
on the same emotional page.

265
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:17,147
Thank you for saying that.

266
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,072
I know the timing is off...

267
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:27,699
but here you go.

268
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,493
What is it?

269
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,495
Your Christmas present.

270
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,206
But I can't...

271
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,624
It's nothing much.

272
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,293
I just wanted to thank you too.

273
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:43,841
For the first time in a while...

274
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,678
my heart skipped a beat.

275
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,777
Haven't I ever made
your heart skip a beat?

276
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:11,660
Of course,

277
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:13,620
you have.

278
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:16,665
Then we're good.

279
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,300
Shall we get going, then?

280
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:25,984
I liked him.

281
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,362
And he stirred something inside me.

282
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,876
I just needed time to figure myself out.

283
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,343
What was that just now?

284
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,221
Love.

285
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,061
I love you.

286
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,777
Because I thought that
when the time came again,

287
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,780
I'd have to love myself first

288
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:16,076
in order to love someone back.

289
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,727
Thanks. I'll get going now.

290
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:06,668
Not so fast.

291
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:08,962
Ta-da.

292
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,732
What's this?

293
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:13,800
It's something that will make
your vacation perfect.

294
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:16,720
- Gosh.
- Wait.

295
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,223
Open it when you're alone.

296
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:21,433
It must be something kinky.

297
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:25,187
It took you so long to discover orgasms.
You need constant reminders.

298
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,272
Have fun.

299
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:28,982
Call me if anything happens.

300
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:30,984
I'll get going, then.

301
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,115
See you.

302
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,117
- Be careful.
- Bye.

303
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:42,913
- Seoul Station, please.
- Sure.

304
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,334
Bye.

305
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,129
Bye!

306
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:17,573
Here's to a lifetime of orgasms.

307
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,732
It's time to come to an agreement.

308
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:52,941
Like what?

309
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,670
People who like to lay out ground rules

310
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,131
feel better when they're written out,
so I made a draft.

311
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,031
Just a second.

312
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,245
Here.

313
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:07,122
RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT

314
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,124
An agreement?

315
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:13,521
THIS CONTRACT CONSISTS OF DATING RULES
FOR LEE MI-NA, THE SUPERIOR,

316
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:14,772
AND CHA WOO-JAE, THE SUBORDINATE,

317
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,632
TO MAINTAIN A REASONABLE
AND AMICABLE RELATIONSHIP

318
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,469
What's wrong? You don't like it?

319
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,888
I'm your boyfriend now,
not your sex partner.

320
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,556
Is this necessary?

321
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:28,912
I don't want to waste our time
arguing about little things.

322
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,104
It'll be nice to have
some set ground rules.

323
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:32,564
Take a look.

324
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:35,901
Okay, then.

325
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,070
"Superior" and "subordinate."

326
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,821
That's taking it too far.

327
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,865
Fine, I'll delete that.

328
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:46,137
We should exchange
our front door lock passcodes too.

329
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,872
Fine, but we're not allowed
to show up unannounced.

330
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:50,249
Sure.

331
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:54,461
I think I got enough rest.

332
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,633
How many more times are you up for?

333
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,348
As many as you want.

334
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:19,361
While I'm here, I'll leave behind the days
when I wasn't honest with myself

335
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,780
and replace them with what I've learned.

336
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:28,161
From time to time,
I'm still scared of losing myself

337
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,081
while trying to navigate through life.

338
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:33,792
And who knows? I might fail again.

339
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:37,171
Actually, I'm pretty sure I'll fail.

340
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,715
But I know that

341
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,843
wishful thinking
isn't how you find yourself.

342
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:45,721
It's up to you to seek it out.

343
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:02,696
A MONTH LATER

344
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,455
IT'S YOUR TIME TO SHINE AT PLAY BOOKS

345
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:14,058
Cheers.

346
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:16,335
I agree. Anyway, have a drink.

347
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,086
- Drink up.
- Gosh.

348
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:20,756
- All right, then.
- This is nice.

349
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,803
It looks like Mr. Kang isn't coming.

350
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,015
He no longer has a reason to come.

351
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:31,266
What? Why?

352
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:33,977
Let's raise our glasses.

353
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,688
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

354
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:38,917
We worked hard, didn't we?

355
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:39,858
But seriously?

356
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,503
Why?

357
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:42,921
Mic check, one, two,

358
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,321
Attention, everyone!

359
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:48,009
Play Book's online merchandising team.

360
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,428
You all worked very hard last year.

361
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:53,181
There's been a huge increase in sales
compared to two years ago,

362
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:56,667
and the number of podcast subscribers
has blown up as well.

363
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,354
I want to say a lot more,

364
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:02,631
but I hear you millennials and Gen Z
think that's old-fashioned.

365
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:06,277
Anyway,

366
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:10,615
I wish us all another good year in 2023.

367
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:11,557
So everyone...

368
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,016
A toast.

369
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:15,894
Here's to enjoying the new day,

370
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,331
giving in to all of our desires,

371
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:21,251
and to our youth!

372
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,901
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

373
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,112
Cheers.

374
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,786
Is he really not coming?

375
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:34,097
Stop asking already.

376
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,289
I mean, why?

377
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,509
- You made it.
- I'm a bit late.

378
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,344
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

379
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,936
This is my best friend, Hee-jae.

380
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:01,231
Nice to meet you. I'm Cha Woo-jae.

381
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:02,608
Nice to meet you.

382
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:05,110
I've heard a lot about you.

383
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:06,862
Likewise.

384
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:08,530
And thank you.

385
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:09,990
Sure.

386
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,451
What are you thanking her for?

387
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,370
- Why did he thank you?
- It's nothing.

388
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,723
What's going on?

389
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,540
I'll go introduce him to people.

390
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:19,833
Sure thing.

391
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:29,046
HIT THE SPOT

392
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,131
HIT THE SPOT

393
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:35,135
Hey, why are we back here?

394
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:36,762
Did they promise you time off?

395
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,514
What about you?

396
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,141
- How many months?
- That's a secret.

397
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,435
Jeez.

398
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:49,858
HIT THE SPOT

399
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:51,860
Hello.

400
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:59,076
HIT THE SPOT

401
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:05,874
HIT THE SPOT

402
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,547
Why do we have to feel embarrassed?

403
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:29,106
Why do we have to hide our desires?

404
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:36,089
How long do we have to fake it

405
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:38,323
or pretend to be inexperienced?

406
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,119
Isn't it about time
we did it for ourselves?

407
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:45,080
We're here to cheer on your sex lives.

408
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,809
Here's to women
having the right to be satisfied.

409
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:48,852
This is DJ Son.

410
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,562
And DJ Min's Hit the Spot.

411
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,629
And we're back with brand-new episodes.

412
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,884
HIT THE SPOT
