Remember to look after the freshmen.

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,380
You need to educate them,

100
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,680
and don't let them skip the cheerleading activities.

101
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,270
Or else, the president of the Student Union will blame us for it.

never ask the freshmen out for a drink.

107
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,300
Understand?

108
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,870
Yes.

Our No is so cool now, Aom.

116
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,580
I can't believe

117
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,679
that someone like you

118
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,150
could really be the captain of the soccer team.

119
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,230
Then don’t believe.

120
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,250
You two traitors.

121
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,220
Seriously,

122
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,000
I thought you had promised to vote for me.

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,020
But it turned out

124
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,950
that you quit the team in your second year.

125
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,530
Well, we were busy with our studies.

126
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,140
We didn't have time to practice.

127
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,080
I saw you at the barbecue restaurant.

128
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,700
You got what you wanted too, don't you?

129
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,090
Before, you were the one being chased by seniors on the soccer field.

130
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,520
Now, you're here educating your juniors.

131
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,930
You've got a lot of power now, my friend.

132
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,020
-I'll beat you up.
-You bastard!

133
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,740
Wait.

134
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,410
He has no authority.

135
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,870
The real person in charge

136
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,580
is over there.

137
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,380
If Type didn't give up voluntarily,

138
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,680
it's impossible

139
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,660
for someone like No to be the captain.

140
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,320
Look.

141
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,020
Those freshmen are wandering around again.

142
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,530
They don't listen to him at all.

143
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,430
Gosh.

144
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,260
Can't you put me in a good light?

145
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,230
Don't take your anger out at me because you lost the game.

146
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,960
People like me have infinite potential.

147
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,010
When have I ever compared myself to you, No?

148
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,960
It's a waste of time.

149
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,070
Am I right, Type?

150
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,430
I would not want to compete with him either.

151
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:47,920
See?

152
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,220
Here's my good friend.

153
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,890
Because I'm afraid that you're going to lose badly.

154
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,450
You're a bad friend.

155
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:56,810
Then...

156
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,600
Is there any freshman that plays well?

157
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,230
There's someone

158
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,560
with good limbs.

159
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,220
I brought him up.

160
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,550
Wait.

161
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,150
You or me?

162
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,350
I'm the one who helped him with his training plan.

163
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,270
You're in charge of planning,

164
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,480
and I'm the one who executes.

165
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,110
Many hands make light work, right?

166
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,150
You're embarrassing me again, bastard!

167
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,500
Wait.

168
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,360
Are you here to ask about the freshmen?

169
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,130

[Try the fried chicken. It's delicious.]

338
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,480
[I'll eat peanuts instead.]

339
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,380
Cheers.

340
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,050
Oh, my God, I'm going to get drunk.

341
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,850
[-You drank too fast.
-Drink it.]

342
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,310
What's wrong, Team?

343
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,140
[Bring me some souvenirs.]

344
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,650
Mom.

345
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,030
I'm going to pick up Tar.

346
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,090
Mom.

347
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,940
What are you cooking?

348
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,450
Tar.

349
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,300
Didn't you say that you'll arrive at 9 a.m.?

350
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,240
I arrived at the airport at 5 a.m.

351
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
Mom went to pick me up.

352
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
I wanted to give you a surprise.

353
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,130
Are you hungry?

354
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,910
I made you breakfast.

355
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,430
Tar.

356
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,340
I'm happy

357
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,940
that you're back.

358
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,270
No, I'm ecstatic.

359
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,130
Well,

360
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,880
what did you cook?

361
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,950
You've been in France for so long.

362
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,220
Did you learn how to make lasagna?

363
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,400
What lasagna?

364
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,910
I made

365
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,960
matcha thin pancake.

366
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,500
It's your favorite.

367
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,890
I'm home,

368
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,620
Brother Tum.

369
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,740
Welcome home.

370
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,210
My beloved brother.

371
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,720
Yes.

372
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,230
[Where are you, Kentaro?]

373
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,960
[I told you not to call me Ketnaro.]

374
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,200
[I'm going to your house.]

375
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,460
[Last time, I hit your brother. This time, I'll do my best in front of your dad.]

376
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,650
[You're so cute, Kentaro.]

377
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:59,840
[Tin, you bastard!]

378
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:06,670
Tin!

379
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,050
I guess

380
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,020
you are texting Ken, right?

381
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,440
You’ve always been on your phone lately.

382
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,380
I told him

383
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,770
that he'll be punished if he replies late.

384
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,230
Oh.

385
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,830
Is that why you replied in a second,

386
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,670
especially after he kissed you last time?

387
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,340
He's been very possessive lately.

388
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,270
So you've been having fun lately, right?

389
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,800
Why ask when you already know it?

390
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,660
Study materials?

391
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,490
Thank you, Tin.

392
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,680
How is it?

393
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,630
I've been running into you lately.

394
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,640
I heard that you're taking that white monkey home.

395
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,300
He told us that he's not going to the training on the phone.

396
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,370
He kept talking

397
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,420
until No fell asleep listening.

398
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,480
He kept asking

399
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,090
what should he do when he goes to your house.

400
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,790
This is not his first time already, though.

401
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,580
Tin.

402
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,080
I think Ken takes this matter very seriously.

403
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,060
It's not like I'm saying anything about him.

404
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,990
What's wrong, Brother Type?

405
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,070
Nothing.

406
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,890
I just thought of something.

407
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,650
I'll get going, then.

408
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,510
Okay.

409
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,150
Wish Ken good luck for me.

410
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,350
I’m hungry.

411
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,630
What should we eat?

412
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,190
I don't want spicy food.

413
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,250
I know.

414
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,350
No spicy food, no raw food,

415
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,470
and no fruits on your rice.

416
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,810
You're such a picky eater.

417
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,210
But I think

418
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,510
that I chose the right person to eat.

419
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,990
That's after dinner.

420
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,970
I said I'm hungry.

421
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,010
So, it means

422
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,970
we can do it tonight, right?

423
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,860
We'll talk about it later.

424
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,120
Why are you laughing?

425
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,020
Do you remember the first time you went to my house?

426
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,850
Of course.

427
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,590
I can't forget it.

428
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,270
Why do you ask?

429
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,200
I met Ken's boyfriend today.

430
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,420
He said he would take Ken home.

431
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,490
But No said Ken has been there several times.

432
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,260
I don’t understand what he’s nervous about.

433
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,510
Have you forgotten

434
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,970
how you felt when you first came to my house?

435
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,480
I remember.

436
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,360
Someone lied to me that day,

437
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,960
saying their parents weren't home.

438
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,930
But when I arrived,

439
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,510
I saw his mom, his dad,

440
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,040
his brother and his sister.

441
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,830
To be fair, I didn't lie to you.

442
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,520
At that time,

443
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,380
I didn't know that Thanya

444
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,700
would call my parents and ask them to come home.

445
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,670
Well,

446
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,130
what should we eat?

447
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,740
You choose.

448
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,640
Help me carry my bag.

449
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,560
Okay, honey.

450
00:25:48,410 --> 00:26:06,110
[Soccer commentary]

451
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,910
Type.

452
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,070
So,

453
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,720
is your junior going to his boyfriend's house?

454
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,720
Yes, and I don't know what Ken is nervous about.

455
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,590
What are you laughing at?

456
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,110
I just remembered

457
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,710
when my dad chased you around with a machete.

458
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,230
You can't forget, can you?

459
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,350
Yes, I can't.

460
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,070
It's been years.

461
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,060
Why is he still unwilling to accept me?

462
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,150
You go talk to him, then.

463
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,530
Actually, you're his daughter-in-law,

464
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,780
not son-in-law.

465

At first,

466
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:12,860
you said that after dinner, we're going to...

467
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,300
Wait until I finish the game.

468

00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,700
No.

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,310
I'm watching the game.

You can watch it later.

00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,760
After that,

473
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,550
I'll watch it with you.

474
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,610
You're so willful.

475
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,430
Pick up later.

476
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,460
The ringtone is my dad calling.

477
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,950
Just kidding.

478
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,220
Wait.

00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,690
It's really my dad.

480

[Son, are you going home this month?]

482
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,900
Maybe.

483
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,660
Maybe not.

484
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,710
[That toy boy is next to you, right?]

485
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,070
[He instigated you not to go home, right?]

486
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,550
What does it have to do with him, Dad?

487
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,670
[Why not?]

488
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,520
[He's a bad guy who instigated you not to go home.]

489
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,750
Dad, don't be prejudiced against him.

490
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,450
[So you're really together?]

491

[Don't take him home.]

Dad, Tharn isn't a coconut.

494
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,840
He's so big.

495
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,030
I can't carry him.

496
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,080
[I don't care.]

497
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,540

499
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,040
Hello, uncle.

500
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
[Who's your uncle?]

501

[You don't have to say hi to me. I won't accept it.]

[Don't come to my house.]

503
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,200
[That's it. I don't want to talk to you.]

504
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,720
Okay.

505
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,520
My dad is actually more bark than bite.

506

He only treats you well.

507
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,660
What's going to happen this time if I go to your house?

508
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,790
Are you still going back with me?

509
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,520
If you go home,

510
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,530
I'll go too.

511
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,170
I remember the first time my dad saw you,

512
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,850
he kept praising how good-looking you were.

513
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,210
And his face fell as soon as he found out about us.

514
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,860
Every morning, noon and night,

515
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,580
he was planning to kill me.

516
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,160
Come on.

517
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,990
I'll stop watching the game.

518
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,600
Let me comfort you.

519
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,710
But I don't think I'm in the mood now.

520
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,750
Are you sure?

521
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,700
Come on.

522
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,260
All right.

523
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,580
Okay.

524
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:16,080
[Three years ago]

525
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,850
Are you leaving me alone in Bangkok?

526
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,350
You've been complaining for 3 weeks.

527
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,530
I told you, I must go home.

528
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,700
But you have to go back for 3 weeks.

529
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,820
Do you want to go back with me, then?

530
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,510
Sure.

531
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,570
Are you sure?

532
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,270
Book a ticket for me.

533
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:45,520
Okay.

534
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Come with me if you want to.

535
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,700
I'll book a ticket for you.

536
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,630
I'm so excited.

537
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,460
I've always wanted to see your parents.

538
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,790
Let me see.

539
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,960
Two seats are added.

540
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,050
Let's book the tickets.

541
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,900
Don't be so worried.

542
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,450
Okay?

543
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,910
Didn't you say that you wanted to meet my parents?

544
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,560
It's normal for me to be anxious.

545
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,440
I only told them

546
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,830
that I would bring my partner back.

547
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,430
Now you know

548
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,250
how I felt when I was tricked into your house.

549
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,610
You deserve it.

550
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,810
Well,

551
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,170
do your parents

552
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,440
hate

553
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,220
gays?

554
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,980
I don't know.

555
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,730
I don't know what they think

556
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,050
about gays after that incident.

557
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,890
What?

558
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,650
You will break up with me

559
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,800
if my parents don't agree?

560
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:24,940
No.

561
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,340
But, it's just...

562
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,200
What if your parents

563
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,360
are the same as you were before?

564
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,130
Then I'll be in trouble.

565
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,480
Stop complaining.

566
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,120
I shouldn't have bought you a flight ticket.

567
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,500
I should've bought you a bus ticket so that you'd be numbed from the sitting.

568
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,380
Tharn, we're outside.

569
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,710
Just give me some encouragement.

570
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,940
You almost broke my back last night.

571
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,770
Not that kind of encouragement.

572
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,469
If you don't hurry up,

573
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,460
we'll miss the flight.

574
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,500
My parents are not fierce.

575
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,380
They are kinder than your father.

576
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,610
I won't let them bully you.

577
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,139
Let's go. Get in.

578
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:41,650
Okay.

579
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,250
Hurry.

580
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,690
Hurry up!

581
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,210
Type, you brat!

582
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,020
Dad.

583
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,590
I got up at 4 a.m. and waited for you here.

584
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,220
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you'll be this late?

585
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,190
Why do you have to wait so long, Dad?

586
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,700
I happen to be free today,

587
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,180
so I'm here to give you a surprise.

588
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,050
Where is your girlfriend?

589
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,210
Hello.

590
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,520
Why didn't you tell me you'd bring a friend?

591
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,900
Then only I can prepare a room for him.

592
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,130
It's okay. Let him sleep in my room.

593
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,940
You don't have to waste time preparing for another room.

594
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,030
What?

595
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,960
You brought your friend all the way here.

596
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,080
I must treat him well.

597
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,240
By the way, your friend is handsome too.

598
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,150
But he's not as handsome as my son.

599
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,720
My son is the most handsome.

600
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:55,790
Yes.

601
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,160
Type is the most handsome.

602
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,690
That's right.

603
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,600
He's the most handsome.

604
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,370
He got it from me.

605
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,770
Your friend is really nice.

606
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,890
What's your name?

607
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,960
I'm Tharn.

608
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,700
Tharn?

609
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,740
Is he mixed-race?

610
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,240
He has a big nose.

611
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,460
My father is mixed-race.

612
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,080
I took after more of my father compared to my siblings.

613
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,000
That means he has siblings.

614
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,740
I have a brother and a sister.

615
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,040
I'm the second son of the family.

616
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,340
That's great. It sounds bustling.

617
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,640
As for Type, he's my only son.

618
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,270
After he went to Bangkok,

619
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,060
it's been quiet in our house.

620
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,450
If I knew this would happen,

621
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,280
I should have had a daughter.

622
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,260
But nowadays, all dads are worried about their daughters.

623
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,300
And they're possessive of them.

624
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,590
I went too far.

625
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,280
Where's your girlfriend? I can't wait to see her.

626
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,270
My partner is here, Dad.

627
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,580
Where?

628
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,050
Or she's going to arrive later?

629
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,370
You can't do this, son.

630
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,720
It's dangerous for a girl to come alone.

631
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,070
No, Dad.

632
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,940
We came together.

633
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,920
What?

634
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,560
I only saw your friend.

635
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,980
It's him.

636
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,970
My boyfriend.

637
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:23,660
You...

638
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,520
Don't ask me if I'm joking.

639
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,700
I'm serious.

640
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,940
We've been together for a while.

641
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,360
So I'm here to introduce him to you.

642
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,470
Hello, uncle.

643
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:42,840
Oh, my God.

644
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,800
Type.

645
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,910
Did he pass out?

646
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,370
Tharn, hold my dad.

647
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,030
Take him to my mom.

648
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,820
My dad is quite heavy.

649
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,840
Put him down, kids.

650
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,420
Gosh.

651
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,690
How is it?

652
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,270
Let me see.

653
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:09,910
Type.

654
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,900
You won't pass out like dad, will you?

655
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,240
I was going to pass out too.

656
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,930
Mom.

657
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,820
I almost fainted

658
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,310
to see my son

659
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,380
have such a handsome boyfriend.

660
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,820
Be honest with me.

661
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,350
Did you trick him?

662
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,210
No.

663
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,910
Let me tell you, Tharn.

664
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:35,050
Type is impatient and hot-tempered.

665
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,960
He's a little jerk.

666
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,090
It's not too late to change your mind.

667
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,610
How could you say that?

668
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,290
Shouldn't you be on my side?

669
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,440
I'm not your dad, I won't always be on your side.

670
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:51,340
He got up at 4 a.m. and waited for you at the dock.

671
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,030
I don't know what he's so excited about

672
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,760
when it's just our son coming back.

673
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,880
He is driving me crazy.

674
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,190
Tharn.

675
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,770
The conditions here

676
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,090
are not as good as at a high-end hotel by the beach.

677
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,660
Tell me if you need anything.

678
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,900
Thank you.

679
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,680
Look at him.

680
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,340
Not only is he handsome,

681
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,590
but also polite.

682
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,460
Why don't you learn from him?

683
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,550
Why are you not against it?

684
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,850
You know that I brought a boyfriend home, right?

685
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,430
Why should I?

686
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,820
It's nothing strange.

687
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,630
Let me tell you.

688
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,460
The next door's son was proposed to by a boy.

689
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:28,970
What?

690
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,780
Don't look so shocked.

691
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,170
He's a handsome foreigner.

692
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,440
He gave him 10 million baht of betrothal gifts.

693
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,640
I even told your father

694
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,720
that if someone gives my son 10 million baht,

695
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,260
I'll sell my son to him and let them get married.

696
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,120
Aren't you supposed to be worried?

697
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,620
That's your dad's business.

698
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,850
But I support you.

699
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,200
Well,

700
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,720
let's get down to business.

701
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,500
I'm your mother.

702
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,050
So, no matter who you love,

703
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,800
I will love him too.

704
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:07,770
If you ask me

705
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,220
whether I've fully accepted it or not,

706
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,090
I'm afraid that I can't say "yes".

707
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,790
I still feel a bit uneasy.

708
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,100
But if you ask me

709
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,000
if I want to see my baby cry because of this,

710
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,080
then the answer is definitely "no".

711
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,440
I raised you.

712
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,990
But I have no right to decide who you like

713
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,320
or who you don't like.

714
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,940
What I need to do is to accept the fact,

715
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,110
right?

716
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,470
Do you remember what happened before?

717
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,700
I was scared.

718
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:45,500
I was afraid that my son would cry, and he was in pain.

719
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,860
But today,

720
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,540
you brought Tharn to our house.

721
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,420
And I knew you've made up your mind.

722
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,990
My son has a bad temper,

723
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,020
but he's not stupid.

724
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,070
So, why should I say no?

725
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,010
Right?

726
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,110
Thank you, Mom.

727
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,100
Because you're my son.

728
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,760
Thank you, aunt.

729
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,490
Oh, my. Just call me Mom.

730
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,780
I'm more than happy to have this handsome guy as my son.

731
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,320
Are you serious, Mom?

732
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,720
Of course.

733
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,500
Tharn, let me say one more thing.

734
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,720
Don't forget the 10 million baht of betrothal gifts.

735
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,090
Here's a reminder,

736
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,890
my son is very stubborn,

737
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,310
and hard to take care of.

738
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,640
That's all I'm asking for.

739
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,000
Then...

740
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,220
I'll study hard, work hard,

741
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,320
and save money for the betrothal gift, mom.

742
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,090
Okay.

743
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,190
Enough!

744
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,270
I should propose to you instead.

745
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,360
No one is allowed to propose.

746
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,460
-Get lost.
-Did you have a nightmare?

747
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,310
Get out!

748
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,260
Who asked you here to propose to my son?

749
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,860
But I really love Type.

750
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,280
Who would believe that?

751
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,510
How old are you?

752
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,400
What do you know about true love?

753
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,150
Wait, honey.

754
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,540
Have you forgotten

755
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,360
that I was only 19

756
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,970
when you proposed to me?

757
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,840
Don't side with him.

758
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,900
What are you whispering about?

759
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,030
Don't take his side.

760
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,680
I'm not siding with him. I'm telling the truth.

761
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,600
Then what should I do

762
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,020
to make you believe me, uncle?

763
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,310
Don't call me that.

764
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,170
Dad, stop it.

765
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,990
Enough. Stop being so possessive of our son.

766
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:41,610
Sit down. Don't be like this.

767
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,160
Okay.

768
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,020
Don't say I'm ruthless.

769
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,660
I'll give you 3 days.

770
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,250
Don't show up again

771
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,510
if you can't do it.

772
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,290
If he gets through it,

773
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,790
you'll accept him, right?

774
00:42:59,070 --> 00:42:59,820
No.

775
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,830
If he gets through it,

776
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:03,910
he will be tested

777
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,830
for another 3 weeks, 3 months, and 3 years.

778
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,110
Let's get through these 3 days first.

779
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,870
I'll teach you a lesson.

780
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,890
Don't mind what he said, kid.

781
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,000
Give him some time to think about it.

782
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:30,240
In fact, he's very nice and kind-hearted.

783
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,680
But he's as stubborn as Type.

784

Hang in there, kid.

Okay.

You'll be dead meat.

787
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,960

00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,890
Because I won't let you die under my dad's feet.

846
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,860
You must be crushed to death by me.

847
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:22,770
On top of you?

848
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,500
You'll let me die on top of you?

849
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,980
It's so hard.

850
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,580
But I'm happy too.

851
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:41,020
Don't act cute.

852
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,770
I'm telling the truth.

853
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:48,220
I

854
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,970
can do anything for you.

855
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,830
Even if your stomach hurts from eating my dad's food?

856
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:03,090
Alright, just hang in there.

857
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,000
I'll treat you to a delicious seafood feast tomorrow.

858
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:11,520
Is it spicy?

859
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,480
Not so spicy that you can't eat it.

860
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,310
I'll follow you then.

861
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,680
But I think

862
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,150
you should go to bed now.

863
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,070
Judging from your look,

864
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,150
you won't be able to have a physiological reaction.

865
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,730
Wouldn't I?

866
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,420
Do you want to try

867
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,010
and see if I can have a physiological reaction?

868
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:41,420
Can you do it?

869
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:44,970
Try it.

870
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:01,650
What's wrong?

871
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,410
I'm going to have diarrhea, Type.

872
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,750
You deserve it.

873
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,450
You asked for it.

874
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,610
Hurry up. My dad might see us.

875
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,190
Won't your dad get mad if we do this?

876
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:35,050
Forget it.

877
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,110
Are you okay?

878
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:53,160
You said you were afraid of my dad,

879
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:54,770
but you still held me like this.

880
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,930
I feel uncomfortable.

881
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,330
Give me some love.

882
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,010
I'll beat you up.

883
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,770
Hold tight.

884
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,280
Wait.

885
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,990
-Where are you going?
-Bye, Dad.

886
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,760
Type, wait!

887
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,480
Type, you brat.

888
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,800
Here. Eat up.

889
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,800
You still have a lot to deal with tonight.

890
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:43,100
To be honest, your dad wants me dead.

891
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,510
Enough.

892
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,070
You've never been here

893
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,780
if you didn't eat the Southern curry.

894
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,710
If I must eat your dad's spicy curry when I'm here,

895
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,310
I'd better not come.

896
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,080
I apologize for him.

897
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,580
It makes me laugh

898
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:04,010
to imagine the music majors' reaction

899
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:07,970
if they saw the handsome, godly drummer, Tharn,

900
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,960
crawling out of the toilet like that.

901
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,390
So miserable.

902
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:24,020
Here.

903
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,300
There are many challenges awaiting tonight.

904
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,400
You peel so fast, huh?

905
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,580
I've been peeling it since I was a kid.

906
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,420
My dad said

907
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,380
that I can peel it for the girl I like.

908
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,400
I'm so sorry

909
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,970
that the girl you like has become me.

910
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,560
Don't think too much.

911
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,530
And don't be upset.

912
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:50,040
If I regretted it,

913
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,180
I wouldn't have brought you to my parents.

914
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,440
If you think that I'm still hesitant,

915
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:58,390
I'll pinch you with crab pincers.

916
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,730
That means

917
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,380
the person you like

918
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,430
is me, right?

919
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,870
Don't trick me into saying those words.

920
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,930
It's okay.

921
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,620
Because you said

922
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,290
that you peel crabs for the person you love.

923
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,500
So it must be me.

924
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:25,300
You want to play like this?

925
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,710
Yes, Brother Tharn.

926
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,400
I really like you.

927
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:30,820
Are you satisfied?

928
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:36,850
Very satisfied.

929
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:46,290
But when it comes to regret,

930
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,740
I do have one.

931
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,800
My friend.

932
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:54,400
Kom.

933
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,640
I just want my best friend

934
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,010
to accept the real me.

935
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,380
Maybe I'm asking for too much.

936
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,390
I'm sorry.

937
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,590
I'm gay.

938
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,920
I want to apologize to him.

939
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,560
This has been lingering in my mind for months.

940
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,330
So,

941
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,730
you brought me here

942
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,310
because of this, right?

943
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:39,630
I'm more afraid of seeing Kom than telling my parents.

944
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,890
He's been hearing my bad words towards gays.

945
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,210
All this time, I didn't know that I was scolding him.

946
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,280
I wanted to apologize to him.

947
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:58,140
But I don't know what to do when I see him.

948
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,040
My boyfriend

949
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,790
has always been fearless, and he would correct his mistakes, right?

950
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,020
Thank you.

951
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,030
You're welcome.

952
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,040
Here.

953
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,700
Eat up.

954
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:55,600
Mhut, you bastard, you're leaving your job to me again.

955
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:04,130
Type!

956
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,320
You...

957
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,060
Why are you back?

958
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,880
Do you have time, Kom?

959
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,150
I have something to tell you.

960
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,250
Is that your friend?

961
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,060
Are you interested in him?

962
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,630
It's not like that.

963
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,820
That's not what I meant.

964
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:35,380
He's my boyfriend.

965
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,090
But he's a guy?

966
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,620
Yes.

967
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,470
But he's the man I love.

968
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:52,730
I'm sorry, Kom.

969
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,230
I apologize for everything I did.

970
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:00,190
All my curses,

971
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,740
all my prejudice,

972
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,330
and everything I've done.

973
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:10,610
I didn't mean to hurt you.

974
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,050
But you hate gays.

975
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,950
I haven't completely let go of my prejudice.

976
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:29,010
But he taught me

977
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,490
that I can see a bigger world

978
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,720
if we ignore the genders.

979
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,360
That's true.

980
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,860
Not everyone is bad.

981
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,530
At least...

982
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,480
There are still Tharn

983
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:46,780
and you.

984
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,310
I know

985
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,300
you're different from the people I curse at.

986
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,390
So,

987
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,630
can you forgive me?

988
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,430
You can scold me

989
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,900
or hit me if you want to.

990
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,540
Because I've really been a jerk before.

991
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:18,890
Your boyfriend?

992
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,110
What's wrong with him?

993
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,910
He's amazing.

994
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,370
He's really amazing.

995
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,990
You've changed a lot.

996
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,580
You don't have to apologize to me.

997
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:39,750
I know you didn't mean to curse at me.

998
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,090
Thank you for coming back.

999
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:45,710
I thought

1000
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,060
I would lose you.

1001
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:53,550
I should thank you for forgiving me instead.

1002
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:54,820
No.

1003
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,450
It's fine, Type.

1004
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,530
No matter what,

1005
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,310
you'll always be my best friend.

1006
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:09,910
Well,

1007
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,390
introduce your boyfriend to me.

1008
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,120
Tell me first.

1009
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,850
Are you interested in him?

1010
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,990
Then only I know what to do.

1011
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:23,000
Don't worry, I have a crush on someone else.

1012
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,050
Come on. Let me introduce him to you.

1013
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:36,020
I should thank you.

1014
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:39,730
My first love.

1015
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:07,870
Type.

1016
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,910
Your friend has a nice personality.

1017
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,450
Why?

1018
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,700
Are you saying that you like him?

1019
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,060
That's not what I meant.

1020
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,430
Wait.

1021
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:23,660
You said you like my figure and skin color.

1022
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:25,470
Then Kom is your type, too.

1023
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:27,510
That was before.

1024
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:30,440
But now, you're the only person

1025
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,180
I like.

1026
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,780
Aren't you afraid that I'll dump you?

1027
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:38,360
How could you say that?

1028
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,520
Come back and make it clear, Type.

1029
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:44,140
How dare you talk so loud to my son?

1030
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,120
It's not like that, Dad.

1031
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,560
We were just chatting.

1032
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,570
Type, why are you still defending him?

1033
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,230
Do you have any respect for me?

1034
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,460
You will stop us from being together no matter what, right?

1035
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:56,290
Yes.

1036
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:59,210
I don't want a son-in-law.

1037
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,740
I want a daughter-in-law.

1038
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:04,970
How do you know that Tharn is your son-in-law?

1039
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,510
Because he's a man.

1040
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:09,980
If Type brings him back,

1041
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,830
that means he's Type's wife.

1042
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:15,610
So you only want a daughter-in-law?

1043
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:17,220
Yes.

1044
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,630
I want a daughter-in-law.

1045
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,250
What will you do if you have a daughter-in-law?

1046
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,190
What do you mean?

1047
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,400
Type is our son, right?

1048
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,220
And he took Tharn home,

1049
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,770
so Tharn is your daughter-in-law.

1050
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,240
It'll ruin his reputation.

1051
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,200
So you must prepare a betrothal gift for his family

1052
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,120
and let Type propose marriage.

1053
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,620
Is that okay?

1054
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,310
Am I right?

1055
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:47,670
Are you happy now? Have you gone stupid?

1056
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:53,540
Dad, just accept it.

1057
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,610
It's been months since I lost my reputation.

1058
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:58,360
Yes.

1059
01:02:59,240 --> 01:02:59,770
Oh, my God.

1060
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,410
Wait.

1061
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:03,910
Wait.

1062
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:04,530
What?

1063
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:09,430
So you have a male wife?

1064
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,050
Honey, you said that.

1065
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,720
You said

1066
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,340
that in this family, we never go back on our words.

1067
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:20,870
What's wrong?

1068
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:22,550
What are you doing?

1069
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,960
Fine.

1070
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,450
I'll keep my word.

1071
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,810
If Tharn is the wife,

1072
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,400
I'll accept it.

1073
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:36,540
But,

1074
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,620
if Type is the wife,

1075
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,390
I'll kill your husband.

1076
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,120
Are you the wife or the husband, Type?

1077
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,400
Let's get out of here.

1078
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:55,640
Where are you going?

1079
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,950
-Let go!
-Leave him alone.

1080
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:01,220
Type, come back and make it clear.

1081
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,530
You're always spoiling him. That's why he's like that.

1082
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,780
We're leaving, Dad.

1083
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,110
We're not coming home tonight.

1084
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:08,010
We're going out to do what married couples do,

1085
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,620
in case you peep at us at home.

1086
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,690
Did you hear what he said?

1087
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:12,720
Accept the reality, Dad.

1088
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,100
I won't break up with Tharn no matter what.

1089
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,980
-Bye.
-You little...

1090
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:21,320
-Stop.
-Come back, you brat.

1091
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,690
Stop.

1092
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,280
I'm exhausted.

1093
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:26,920
-Are you going to stop?
-I'm tired too. Aren't you tired?

1094
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,300
-Can you stop now?
-Stop.

1095
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:28,960
Okay.

1096
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:45,700
I don't know

1097
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,250
if I should laugh at my parents or not.

1098
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:50,630
One is so stubborn,

1099
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,320
while the other one

1100
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,930
just accept it so easily because you're handsome.

1101
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:59,080
You're lucky to have such a good look.

1102
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,410
When I first saw you,

1103
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:03,810
I was thinking

1104
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,640
that a handsome man like you

1105
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:07,330
must be very attractive to girls.

1106
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,750
I don't care about anyone who likes me.

1107
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:16,200
Because no matter what,

1108
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:18,080
I only have you.

1109
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,790
Don't curse at me

1110
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,020
if you think I'm right.

1111
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:27,780
You bastard.

1112
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,420
Remember.

1113
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,050
You only belong to me.

1114
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:44,230
Be it my brain, my body, or my heart,

1115
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,450
I'll give them all to you.

1116
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,160
Drink it.

1117
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,430
Bastard.

1118
01:05:58,550 --> 01:05:59,700
I'll get shy too.

1119
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,360
To be honest,

1120
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,060
it's not easy to love you.

1121
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,080
Did you just know?

1122
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,050
I have known it for a long time.

1123
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,650
But I can't stop loving you no matter what.

1124
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:31,020
I hate it when you're bootlicking.

1125
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:34,280
-That means...
-Enough.

1126
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:37,320
I won't talk about it today. There's no more quota.

1127
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,140
What do you want to do, then?

1128
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:46,890
Let's do it.

1129
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,770
Seriously?

1130
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,240
Come on.

1131
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,530
My dad slept early today.

1132
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,560
Do you want to exchange positions?

1133
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,780
Maybe my dad would change his mind.

1134
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:39,410
Dream on.

1135
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:48,920
No matter what, tonight,

1136
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,170
I'll be your husband.

1137
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:48,950
I've never brought anyone here.

1138
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:54,550
From now on,

1139
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,340
you can only bring me here.

1140
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,540
From now on,

1141
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,990
I will never break up with you.

1142
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:15,020
Promise me.

1143
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:20,360
You're not the only one who can't leave me.

1144
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:26,030
I can't lose you too.

1145
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,530
Type.

1146
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,280
I love you.

1147
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,620
Screw it.

1148
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:53,140
What kind of dream is this?

1149
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,670
What time is it?

1150
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:08,730
It's 6 a.m.

1151
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,990
Go back to sleep.

1152
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,880
I can't.

1153
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:21,280
I dreamed of the first time I saw your dad.

1154
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:22,810
Really?

1155
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,370
We had the same dream.

1156
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:27,300
You too?

1157
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,140
Yes.

1158
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:30,740
If you ask me,

1159
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,720
it must be because of what we talked about before sleeping.

1160
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:39,800
The scene where my dad was holding the machete is still vivid to me.

1161
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:43,120
I can still feel the shiver running down my spine now.

1162
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:51,160
Since we're awake,

1163
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:54,750
then

1164
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,790
let's do something.

1165
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,550
What are you playing at again?

1166
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:16,350
Here.

1167
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,420
Put it on for me.

1168
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:19,870
Are you out of your mind?

1169
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:21,080
Cat ears?

1170
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:22,550
Dream on.

1171
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:24,760
Type.

1172
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:27,500
What are you doing?

1173
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:29,170
Put it on.

1174
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:31,340
No, no.

1175
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:31,990
Please?

1176
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:33,660
No.

1177
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,750
Wear it yourself.

1178
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:41,730
Let's wear it together.

1179
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,150
Be a man, okay?

1180
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:45,690
I'd rather not be a man.

1181
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:47,850
So you admit defeat?

1182
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,450
No matter what you say, I won't wear it.

1183
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,860
You can't even fulfill such a small request for me.

1184
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:57,190
Stop pretending to be angry.

1185
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:58,890
You bastard!

1186
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:02,390
You can't even do this for me.

1187
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:22,040
Are you satisfied?

1188
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,980
Grant me one more request.

1189
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:28,580
What now?

1190
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:33,850
Can you meow for me?

1191
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:34,860
No way.

1192
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,000
Please, Type.

1193
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,110
-No.
-Please?

1194
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,830
No, I won't.

1195
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:45,310
-Just once.
-I already put it on.

1196
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,540
-Please?
-No.

1197
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:51,150
Fine, it's my fault.

1198
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,970
I asked you to do something impossible.

1199
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,970
I'm going to take a shower.

1200
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,030
Meow.

1201
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:03,790
Meow.

1202
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,620
What did you say?

1203
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:12,000
Meow.

1204
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,280
Are you satisfied now?

1205
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,880
You're the cutest, Type.

1206
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,210
Meow.

1207
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:27,490
I'd better not go out today.

1208
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,530
Tharn.

1209
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,050
You're so cute.

1210
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:40,140
Tharn.

1211
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:49,530
Hey, Princess.

1212
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,080
I bought you a chocolate cake.

1213
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,440
Do you want something else?

1214
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,970
Okay, I'll just take the cake.

1215
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,970
See you in the evening.

1216
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:08,870
Lhong.

1217
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:11,780
Brother Thorn.

1218
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:15,690
Why are you avoiding me?

1219
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:20,540
Hello.

1220
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,560
Are you free?

1221
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,480
I want to talk to you.

1222
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:26,480
I...

1223
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:29,740
It's been years.

1224
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,340
Are you still going to reject me?

1225
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,130
Didn't you say that I'm your brother?

1226
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,570
Long time no see.

1227
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,030
How have you been?

1228
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:57,030
I...

1229
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,040
I'm doing well.

1230
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,720
I'm glad to hear that you're doing well.

1231
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,460
How's your study?

1232
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,300
I don't live in Thailand anymore.

1233
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,820
After that incident,

1234
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,430
I moved abroad with my sister.

1235
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:21,660
We just came back last week.

1236
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:23,300
That means

1237
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,550
I'm in luck to meet you today.

1238
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,010
-Then...
-Tharn, right?

1239
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:33,660
He's good.

1240
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:39,090
-Okay.
-He's fine.

1241
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,480
He's still dating Type.

1242
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,500
As long as I know he's doing well,

1243
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:51,470
it is enough.

1244
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,960
If you're really okay,

1245
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,740
why do you look so sad?

1246
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,490
You're already an adult, you know?

1247
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:05,100
Brother Thorn.

1248
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:07,960
To be honest,

1249
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,050
are you really not angry with me? Don't you hate me?

1250
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:16,110
I've done such terrible things to Tharn.

1251
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:22,680
How can I be angry at you or hate you?

1252
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:25,420
Look at you.

1253
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:28,260
You must have been blaming yourself for all these years.

1254
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:31,190
Have you figured it out now?

1255
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:34,600
I don't know either.

1256
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,220
But these past few years

1257
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,420
have been very painful for me.

1258
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,670
You knew it would hurt, so you learned your lesson.

1259
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:56,560
Don't do that again.

1260
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:58,120
Do you understand?

1261
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:05,240
Thank you

1262
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,380
for not being mad at me or hating me.

1263
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:15,250
Lhong, I told you

1264
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:18,100
that you're like a brother to me.

1265
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:21,180
Why would I be angry with you? Why would I hate you?

1266
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:26,530
Thank you so much.

1267
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:29,000
Also,

1268
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:32,450
I apologize for what I did before.

1269
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:36,190
I think

1270
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:39,040
I should leave first.

1271
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:41,550
Fine.

1272
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:44,720
Good luck.

1273
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:50,190
I hope that you will be happier the next time I see you.

1274
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,730
I also hope that day will find me soon.

1275
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,690
-Pete.
-What?

1276
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:17,960
What are you doing here?

1277
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,190
Why aren't you going to the soccer field?

1278
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,590
It is too noisy there.

1279
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:25,730
I have an exam tomorrow. It would be better to have my revision here.

1280
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:29,090
Pete, let me ask you something.

1281
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:32,480
Tin went to Ken's house, right?

1282
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:33,490
Yes.

1283
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:36,350
So, what happened?

1284
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,560
I asked both of them.

1285
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:41,780
Tin told me that it's good.

1286
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:44,050
If Tin said it was good,

1287
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:45,490
then it must have gone smoothly.

1288
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,410
Besides, Ken told me

1289
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:50,180
that Tin's father has agreed to let him call him "dad".

1290
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:53,250
He's allowed to call him dad now?

1291
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:54,540
Are you jealous of him?

1292
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:56,960
A little.

1293
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:00,540
Ken has such good luck.

1294
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,730
It's much more than that.

1295
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,040
What's wrong, senior?

1296
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:07,890
Nothing.

1297
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:10,480
He's just jealous.

1298
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:17,440
I think you two are more enviable.

1299
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:20,120
No told me

1300
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,660
that you've been dating since freshman year, right?

1301
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:24,710
I had no choice.

1302
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:27,020
Type, you're really...

1303
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,060
Then...

1304
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:34,170
I hope you have no choice but to stay with me.

1305
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:38,240
That's right, seniors.

1306
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,280
That's why you guys are more enviable.

1307
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,530
Enough.

1308
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:44,640
We won't disturb you.

1309
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,100
Bye.

1310
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,290
-Okay.
-Bye.

1311
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:47,950
Bye.

1312
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:11,160
What are you thinking?

1313
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:15,780
I'm thinking about a lot of things.

1314
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:18,470
Are you sure?

1315
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,830
You and I,

1316
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:31,060
how did we get this far?

1317
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:38,310
I don't know.

1318
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,530
By the time I realized it,

1319
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,930
we had been dating for 4 years.

1320
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:49,400
Yeah. I know, right?

1321
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:56,940
Don't tell me that you're still jealous of Ken.

1322
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:02,370
A little.

1323
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:11,030
Hear out my motto:

1324
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:14,190
5 points for confidence and 10 points for good looks.

1325
01:25:14,190 --> 01:25:16,900
Made your husband fall for you, and you got a perfect score.

1326
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,110
If you're so obsessed with me,

1327
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,700
you should keep trying to win my dad's support.

1328
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:28,260
Wait, from what I remember, isn't your motto

1329
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:32,560
"you get what you hate"?

1330
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,700
That's why you became my husband.

1331
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,780
That's how much you love me?

1332
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,740
You leave me no choice.

1333
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:20,360
Type.

1334
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:23,790
Let's go home.

1335
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:25,960
Let's go.

1336
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:51,580
♫I know you never had feelings for me♫

1337
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:55,810
♫No matter what I do, you won't care about me♫

1338
01:26:55,810 --> 01:27:02,280
♫But I won't give up easily♫

♫You can see my shining point♫

1340
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:10,220
♫But I don't seem to be the person you need♫

1341
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:12,800
♫I'm willing to give everything♫

1342
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:18,440
♫To make you fall in love with me♫

1343
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:22,720
♫I won't let you leave with others♫

1344
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:27,320
