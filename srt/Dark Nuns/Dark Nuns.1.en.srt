1
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:59,352
You have preserved, protected and saved
the three holy children...

2
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:07,165
Speak!

3
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:09,100
Speak! Why have you come here?!

4
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,835
You summoned me!

5
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:15,214
Protect us from the power
and the curses of the devil!

6
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:06,099
I’m from the Liberation Order.

7
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,605
Marco!

8
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:22,198
Sister Giunia!

9
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:35,962
Father!

10
00:02:55,273 --> 00:02:56,733
How dare you show up here?

11
00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,819
You brash little bitch!

12
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:02,446
Let’s wash you up first.

13
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:10,496
Is all that holy water?

14
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:22,967
A wretch who hasn’t
even been ordained!

15
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,803
Mom’s spank hurts the most,
doesn’t it?

16
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:26,679
You damned mass of cursed energy!

17
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:32,060
That won’t come out.

18
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,477
Not until the exorcism is over.

19
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:35,438
Prepare a Franciscan bell, please.

20
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:37,148
You vile filth!

21
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:40,819
Ring it, and resume the prayer.

22
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,695
Who performs an exorcism
so incompetently?!

23
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:49,911
Coward, taking over a child’s body...

24
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:55,499
Expel yourself.

25
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:56,960
Protect us from the rulers
of the dark world

26
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,046
and from the evil spirits
under the heavens.

27
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,048
Come to the aid of the human soul,

28
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:05,301
redeemed at great cost
from Satan's oppression.

29
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:11,557
Lord, have mercy.

30
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:12,809
Exorcism: A Roman Catholic ritual
to free someone from evil spirits

31
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:16,687
Lift up Your mighty hand
and extend Your powerful arm,

32
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,397
Nun: A woman who vows chastity, purity,
and obedience, living celibately in a convent

33
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:23,111
send forth an angel of peace
and strength,

34
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:25,488
Priest: An intermediary between God
and humans, officiating at Mass and rites

35
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:28,157
to visit and protect Your servant,
made in Your image.

36
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:31,619
Let all malice and wickedness,

37
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:32,203
Possessed: A person with
an evil spirit residing within

38
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:37,625
brought by envious and
destructive forces, be overthrown.

39
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:41,087
Grant that Your servant,
safeguarded by Your mercy,

40
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,797
The Rosicrucianism: An exorcism group
created by the Vatican to combat evil spirits

41
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:48,219
may raise their voice
in gratitude and proclaim:

42
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:49,678
12 Manifestations: Types of evil spirits
classified by the Rosicrucianism

43
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:54,809
The Lord is my shepherd;
there is nothing I shall fear.

44
00:04:54,809 --> 00:05:00,398
Lord of peace, Master of all creation,

45
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:03,484
and God of my ancestors.

46
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:08,156
Look upon Your servant
and deliver them from every evil

47
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:11,826
and every threat that comes
from the enemy.

48
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:14,537
Protect Your image

49
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:16,580
from all harm and danger.

50
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,295
Through the intercessions of
the most holy,

51
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:26,841
and the ever-virgin Mary,
the radiant archangels,

52
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:30,845
and all Your saints, we pray to You.

53
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:34,974
We pray in the name of

54
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:35,892
Amen.

55
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,269
the radiant archangels and all your saints.

56
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:39,979
Amen.

57
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:54,243
You will die.

58
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,128
The most wretched death
among humans.

59
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:10,093
You’ll burn in pain, crying
and cursing your God as you die.

60
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:13,471
The blood of all the demons
slain by your hands

61
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,639
will echo in your womb
like a drum.

62
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,479
Let’s end this,
what’s your name?

63
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:31,906
My subordinates,
whom you cast into hell,

64
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,328
asked me to tell you that
you will never see spring again!

65
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,958
What a load of shit.

66
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:47,088
Father! Father!

67
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:01,644
It went into hiding again.

68
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:16,034
DARK NUNS

69
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:18,744
Not at all.

70
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:23,499
He doesn’t seem like
a patient like that at all.

71
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,626
Thank you for graciously
sharing the room.

72
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,130
We’ll move him to a private room
as soon as one is available.

73
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,632
There’s no need.

74
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:34,885
Even if he’s possessed
or whatever,

75
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:38,056
this hospital is under
God’s protection.

76
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:50,234
Father Paolo is the new attending
for Patient Choi Hee-joon.

77
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:02,163
A physician who denies possession...

78
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:04,040
Michela, what do you think?

79
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,919
Does possession really not exist?

80
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:17,303
There’s a saying: the existence of evil
proves the existence of good.

81
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:19,138
It’s the result of a combination

82
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:22,891
of dissociative disorders and
borderline personality disorder.

83
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:26,479
With a supportive environment,
regular therapy,

84
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,982
and medication, it’s a condition
that can fully recover.

85
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:39,158
We already have enough
similar clinical cases.

86
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:40,701
Wow.

87
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:43,412
You really are Father Paolo’s protégé.

88
00:08:43,412 --> 00:08:45,373
Alright, very well.

89
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,460
Is she human?

90
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:52,588
She spoke like an AI.

91
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:53,839
She felt so cold.

92
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,842
You’ve even performed
a Buddhist rite?

93
00:08:58,344 --> 00:09:03,682
I’ve heard of a renowned
monk in Busan...

94
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:06,685
I just thought we should
try everything...

95
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:13,776
Mrs. Choi.

96
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:18,822
A series of events beyond
human understanding

97
00:09:18,822 --> 00:09:21,159
can occur at times.

98
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:25,246
If you flip a coin ten times
and it comes up heads every time?

99
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:29,041
It’d be an astonishing coincidence.

100
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,086
But imagine that
instead of coin flips,

101
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:36,507
unfortunate events are
happening to our loved ones.

102
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:43,681
Weak humans seek answers
in the occult, superstition,

103
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:49,019
or in the baseless doctrines
of charlatans.

104
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:52,440
God tests us in these ways.

105
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:54,942
Your faith in Him.

106
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:01,490
Psychoanalysis and Treatment
of Possession

107
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,452
What your son needs is,

108
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:08,331
psychiatric counseling
and proper medication—that’s all.

109
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:12,543
But Father Andrea said...

110
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:14,962
and the nun from Liberation Order...

111
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:15,713
A nun?

112
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:21,677
An unordained nun performed
an exorcism on the child?

113
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:23,846
We must hurry.

114
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:26,807
Father Kim in Rome
must be contacted.

115
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:29,810
If not him, at least Father Choi.

116
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:37,109
Personally, I’m not entirely
against exorcisms,

117
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:42,490
but everything has its procedures.

118
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,491
A nun, though...

119
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:47,620
Father Andrea called
to request my help.

120
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,499
And you personally approved
the exorcism that day.

121
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:54,585
I’m not denying it, but...

122
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,712
the situation right now...

123
00:10:57,338 --> 00:11:00,924
Even the Seoul Archdiocese is
expressing disapproval.

124
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:03,427
You’re infuriating.

125
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:04,220
Easy!

126
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,304
Sister Giunia!

127
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:12,060
Why don’t you wait
at the convent for now?

128
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:17,024
If you keep dodging like this,
you won’t be able to handle it later.

129
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:20,611
Sister Giunia.

130
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:26,575
Ignoring a confirmed possession
is also a form of murder.

131
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:36,669
Father Kim taught her his way.

132
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:39,838
But they say her prayers
are pretty effective.

133
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:42,758
She’s still just a nun...

134
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:47,263
What will you do
back in your hometown?

135
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:50,057
I’ll teach some English
to the folks there.

136
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,602
These are Hee-joon’s.

137
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:04,196
He attempted suicide?

138
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:07,325
He probably thought
everything would end if he died.

139
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:17,000
How could the boy know that
dying doesn’t get rid of the devil?

140
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:21,046
The chief spirit inside that child...

141
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:25,301
it’s not just some minor ghost
or wandering soul.

142
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:29,388
Did the boy draw these?

143
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:30,264
Yes.

144
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:40,274
There was just one other case
very similar to this child.

145
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:42,818
You know, the unofficial one.

146
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:45,654
All the records were destroyed.

147
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:51,577
Devils that deny God and commit
heinous acts using human bodies,

148
00:12:54,288 --> 00:12:57,333
that one is definitely
of the 12 Manifestations.

149
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:43,671
You haven’t been getting
regular checkups, have you?

150
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:46,799
Just tell me.

151
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,175
Haven’t you...

152
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:52,220
noticed anything unusual
with your uterus?

153
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:58,561
The cancer is rapidly spreading
to surrounding areas.

154
00:13:58,561 --> 00:13:59,687
Doctor.

155
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:01,939
Yes, Sister.

156
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:06,777
Am I dying?

157
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:12,991
Sister!

158
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,993
Your next appointment--

159
00:14:14,993 --> 00:14:18,205
I need to meet with Father Paolo.

160
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,126
Exorcism is a cultural practice
shaped by the needs of its era.

161
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:24,795
It has been long since degenerated.

162
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:31,802
Those who believe they possess
spiritual powers and can confront evil

163
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:35,389
call themselves “Light Workers.”

164
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:40,352
I heard about your nickname too:

165
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:41,437
“Dark Nun.”

166
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,194
I’d like to discuss possession,
not get a lecture, Father.

167
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:56,034
Mystics who believe they’re special
often possess egos far stronger than average.

168
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:58,954
That intense ego,
bordering on obsession,

169
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:03,166
can sometimes create illusions
that people think are miracles.

170
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:10,007
I’m not well-educated,
so this is hard for me.

171
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:15,053
Hee-joon created these illusions
in response to bullying and ostracism.

172
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:17,389
Possession isn’t real.

173
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,026
- Yes, ma’am...- Hello?

174
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:29,943
Mrs. Choi?

175
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,532
Call it a devil or an illusion,
whatever you want,

176
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,950
what matters is saving the child.

177
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,702
He’s in tremendous pain.

178
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:44,291
Rituals won’t save him,
only medical treatment will.

179
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:48,712
Without extensive medical records,
getting exorcism approval is impossible.

180
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,798
He’s had all possible
psychiatric treatment.

181
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:56,136
It is unfortunate that he came to me
so late, but my treatment starts now.

182
00:15:56,136 --> 00:15:58,263
Delays could put him
in more danger.

183
00:15:58,263 --> 00:16:01,642
A rushed exorcism could
endanger the child too.

184
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:03,143
That’s already happened, hasn’t it?

185
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,814
Do you even know
what day it is today?

186
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:07,397
Yes, ma’am...

187
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:08,649
Will you ever pay me back?

188
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:09,399
Of course!

189
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,903
If you keep this up,
we can settle this legally!

190
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:16,824
Please, just give me
until the end of this month.

191
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:18,784
I’m working to get another loan...

192
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:21,787
Same old story!
Are you sure this time?

193
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:23,914
Yes, yes, of course, ma’am.

194
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:27,710
Fucking ignorant bitch!

195
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,546
You killed off your hubby,
it’s a matter of time for your son.

196
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:31,797
Sister.

197
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:33,966
There are lines
that should not be crossed.

198
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:38,470
Have you heard of the 12 Manifestations?

199
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,763
Sister Giunia!

200
00:16:40,514 --> 00:16:44,685
Either whore yourself,
or sell your organs, bitch!

201
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:47,938
I took pity on you
because of your crazy son!

202
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:52,025
You and Hee-joon are
fundamentally the same.

203
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:54,402
God is with neither of you.

204
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:55,904
He exists solely in heaven.

205
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,554
Let me make it official once again,
Sister Giunia.

206
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,976
So long as he’s under my care,
exorcism will not be approved easily.

207
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:31,982
You should start by learning respect
for the church and its teachings.

208
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:36,444
Sister Michela!

209
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:38,238
I’m sorry, Father.

210
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:41,158
Patient Choi Hee-joon has...

211
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:47,080
...jumped off the roof.

212
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:09,227
And the boy?

213
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,564
He’s been sedated.

214
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:15,192
He may be at risk of self-harm
when he wakes up,

215
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:17,986
ensure the staff takes shifts
monitoring him.

216
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:18,946
Yes, Father.

217
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:52,520
You impure spirit, in the name of
Lord Jesus Christ, I command you:

218
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,523
depart from here at once.

219
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:58,401
And never return again.

220
00:18:59,152 --> 00:19:03,073
You shall no longer trouble us.

221
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:08,662
You have no place
in this sinner’s body, depart now.

222
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,447
Let’s go together.

223
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:45,699
Sorry?

224
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:48,660
I'll drive you to Mrs. Choi’s funeral.

225
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:10,140
I have a hearing impairment.

226
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,603
It’s congenital,
but only in my right ear.

227
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:20,233
Without an earphone, it’s hard
to enjoy phone calls or music.

228
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:26,824
But when it comes to evil spirits,
I can hear even their whispers.

229
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:31,578
Some claim to see spirits,
feel chills or warmth,

230
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:34,289
or sense them intuitively.

231
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,253
They call that having “spiritual sight.”

232
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:43,799
What do you mean...

233
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:52,057
What about you?
Do you see or hear spirits?

234
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,563
I know you’re one of us.

235
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:02,734
You’re spiritually gifted.

236
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:09,825
Those who reject the path of shamanism
decide to become nuns instead.

237
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:13,078
Did a shaman tell you that working in
a hospital could make up for it?

238
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:16,498
You’re being very rude!

239
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:20,752
Before the funeral ends,
the exorcism must be performed.

240
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:24,672
The mother’s death can distract
Father Paolo for a while.

241
00:21:25,382 --> 00:21:28,593
Why are you so invested in this?

242
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:32,639
Because he’ll die
if we leave him alone.

243
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:42,107
I can’t do it alone.

244
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:45,652
You’re Father Paolo’s protégé.

245
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,404
What exactly do you
want me to do?

246
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:51,158
At least with you,
he won’t be suspicious.

247
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,836
Father Paolo always said...

248
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:08,591
that the possession doesn't exist.

249
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,011
Moron.

250
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:12,470
What?

251
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:17,184
Did I ask you to perform
the exorcism?

252
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:19,144
Just help me smuggle the boy out.

253
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,066
Go over this and think about it.

254
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:41,833
Shit...

255
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,045
Who does she think she is?

256
00:22:49,174 --> 00:22:50,842
Demon!

257
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:52,344
Say your name!

258
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:53,803
I am...

259
00:22:53,803 --> 00:22:57,390
your stepfather,
your mother’s enemy,

260
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,685
the root of your faith,
despicable fool!

261
00:23:03,105 --> 00:23:05,107
Do not be swayed
by the demon’s tongue!

262
00:23:06,358 --> 00:23:07,692
Marco, snap out of it!

263
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:13,615
Psychoanalysis and Treatment
of Possession

264
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:01,496
The Hanged Man.

265
00:24:01,496 --> 00:24:07,419
Don’t you think he could
free himself and escape?

266
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:10,755
Su-young, you can break free too.

267
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:18,221
You like drawings, don’t you?

268
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:19,097
Keep them.

269
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:22,309
But don’t let the nuns catch you.

270
00:24:23,351 --> 00:24:26,729
Especially not Father Paolo.

271
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:34,154
Who is it?

272
00:25:08,688 --> 00:25:11,399
Do you know what people
call kids like us?

273
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:15,320
“Cursed.”

274
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,242
A cursed child born of
a human and a demon.

275
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:38,403
Who is it?

276
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:42,157
Had a nightmare?
What could this crying sound be?

277
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:45,118
A goat for you too?

278
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:49,539
Must be.

279
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:50,957
Did you think it over?

280
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:59,382
Why won’t you tell me
where we’re going?

281
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:03,470
To Juan in Incheon.

282
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:06,889
Hyo-won Altar.

283
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:07,974
What?

284
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:13,355
Hyo-won used to be a nun
in the same Order as me,

285
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:18,193
she’s a highly skilled
and experienced shaman.

286
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:19,361
A shaman?

287
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,614
Are you insane?

288
00:27:24,574 --> 00:27:29,579
To most people, you, me,
and shamans are all lunatics.

289
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:32,957
You’re unbelievable.

290
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:35,210
Is there anything
a nun like you wouldn’t do?

291
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:37,920
If it helps with the exorcism.

292
00:27:53,895 --> 00:27:57,190
W-w-which name
is the reservation under?

293
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,442
The nun tunic doesn’t suit this place.

294
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:00,902
There are plenty of eyes here.

295
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:04,197
Was she really a nun before?

296
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:10,828
Did you take in a child of the spirit?

297
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:14,416
He’s a temple orphan,
his mom was a shaman,

298
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:18,085
so I took him in,
but he's spiritually dull.

299
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:24,217
He’s not mute,
but stutters badly.

300
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:25,843
His fortune-telling isn’t great either.

301
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,557
What about that girl over there?

302
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:34,769
She’s struggling with her identity.

303
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:38,940
Let’s have a smoke first.

304
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,793
Cake.

305
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:03,631
H-h-his n-n-name.

306
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:14,141
Rice Cake

307
00:29:22,942 --> 00:29:24,944
Birth chart confirms it,

308
00:29:26,696 --> 00:29:30,450
I see a hint of a snake,

309
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,329
but also a dragon prince
from the Underwater Palace.

310
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:35,913
A fallen spirit...

311
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:40,084
I think you’re right, a demon.

312
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:46,591
Even if we exorcise it successfully,

313
00:29:46,591 --> 00:29:49,927
his family’s guardian spirits will
end up inhabiting him instead.

314
00:29:49,927 --> 00:29:51,846
There’s no other way.

315
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:55,224
He’s bound to be a shaman,
just like the Cursed.

316
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,727
“Cursed”?

317
00:29:57,727 --> 00:30:00,688
A child conceived during
the mother's possession.

318
00:30:00,688 --> 00:30:01,939
He’s bound to be a shaman.

319
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:08,988
That might be better than dying...

320
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:13,075
He wasn’t born to be a shaman,
but forced to become one.

321
00:30:16,704 --> 00:30:24,546
Who are you to judge
and decide things so freely?

322
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:25,880
You’re right.

323
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:30,051
We acted too hastily.

324
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:37,058
If one came from water,
we’ll handle it with water.

325
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:40,353
Should we contact Master Dam-eon?
We’re running out of time.

326
00:30:44,732 --> 00:30:47,068
The brat has quite a pretty face.

327
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,614
Dress him in ceremonial robes
and he’ll shine in the ritual.

328
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:08,798
Away, away, evil energy!

329
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:13,511
Suri, suri, masuri!

330
00:31:31,696 --> 00:31:33,030
Sung-ae.

331
00:31:35,908 --> 00:31:36,826
Why?

332
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,041
Do nuns get free
health checkups too?

333
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:49,005
Why? Do you see
the Grim Reaper near me?

334
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:53,676
Go get one, you idiot.

335
00:31:56,554 --> 00:32:01,976
I took you for a greedy shaman,
but you’ve still got the gift.

336
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:06,939
It’s been fading for a while now.

337
00:32:08,107 --> 00:32:13,404
I bow in reverence to
the complete and exalted one.

338
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:17,324
May the sacredness be
illuminated and fulfilled.

339
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:37,094
Let’s start the ritual!

340
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,766
Will you save this child
kneeling before you?

341
00:32:44,894 --> 00:32:46,896
Yes, don’t worry.

342
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:49,566
My poor, sick child,

343
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:51,818
I’ll soothe your restless
ancestors and banish

344
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:57,615
the spirits that invaded you,
so you can live in peace!

345
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:31,899
Onward!

346
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:35,862
The waters of the East and West Seas,
the South and North Seas!

347
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:37,947
Are you the Dragon King
of the Four Seas?

348
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:40,282
The Seven Stars Dragon King
reigns in the air!

349
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:43,369
- Stop it already... stop!
- The Mountain God and Dragon King!

350
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:44,537
It’s hurts, Sister!

351
00:33:44,537 --> 00:33:46,413
Flowing Dragon King,
Rising Dragon King,

352
00:33:47,414 --> 00:33:49,626
- On the black earth, where are the people,
- My Lord, my God.

353
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:52,629
my people are no longer mine.

354
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:58,009
Today, I will clear the fog
in this child’s mind,

355
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:02,972
and bring him peace and clarity!

356
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:39,926
You stupid nun!

357
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:42,219
Do you think you can cast us out?

358
00:34:45,514 --> 00:34:46,891
No! Hee-joon!

359
00:35:17,088 --> 00:35:19,548
He’ll just sleep for the time being.

360
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:21,592
But not for long.

361
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:25,012
Leave him to Father Paolo.

362
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,310
If he stays in the hospital,
others will be in danger.

363
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:40,027
Playing hero, are you?

364
00:35:40,027 --> 00:35:43,155
What’s your justification for
being so fixated on exorcism?

365
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,871
Do you need justification
to save lives?

366
00:35:55,542 --> 00:36:00,214
As you know,
I can’t help anymore.

367
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:09,390
I’m truly disappointed in you.

368
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:11,809
Where exactly did you
take Hee-joon?

369
00:36:14,478 --> 00:36:17,564
I thought he should at least see
his mother’s last moments.

370
00:36:17,564 --> 00:36:20,151
Are you a funeral director?

371
00:36:20,151 --> 00:36:21,152
I’m sorry, Father.

372
00:36:22,862 --> 00:36:25,907
We’re clergy, yes.

373
00:36:25,907 --> 00:36:28,200
But you and I are
also medical professionals!

374
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:34,623
Don’t tell me you met that nun.

375
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:41,297
It’s practically a cult
founded by Father Kim.

376
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:45,509
I know you drew these
back in the day too.

377
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:50,807
Be honest with me.

378
00:36:50,807 --> 00:36:54,351
Do you think Hee-joon is like you?

379
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:14,789
Are you...

380
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:19,543
seeing visions again?

381
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:24,215
Of course not.

382
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:28,469
Michela.

383
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:33,808
Hee-joon can be saved.

384
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:37,812
I’ll do it, no matter what.

385
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:39,438
Yes, Father.

386
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:43,150
You’re the proof of it.

387
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:57,706
Sister Michela.

388
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,756
I’m going to Chungju
to be with my son.

389
00:38:05,756 --> 00:38:09,385
Is that right?

390
00:38:09,385 --> 00:38:11,220
Thank you for everything.

391
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:25,734
Park Myung-ja...

392
00:38:27,694 --> 00:38:29,446
Park Myung-ja...

393
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:43,210
Patient Park Myung-ja,
time of death, 10:15 a.m.

394
00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:10,029
The midday temperature reaches 42°C.

395
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:15,451
Enduring the heat and ash
is no easy task for the bats.

396
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:25,127
Some find sanctuary under
the inner leaves of palm trees,

397
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:31,884
but others must search for
shade elsewhere.

398
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:33,928
This sometimes causes fights.

399
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:47,274
Exhausted by thirst
and territorial disputes,

400
00:39:47,274 --> 00:39:51,904
the bats can move to nearby areas
where water remains abundant.

401
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:46,333
H-help... Help me...

402
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:52,798
Father Paolo... he took Hee-joon
to the cloistered monastery...

403
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,052
Monastery?

404
00:40:56,052 --> 00:41:00,431
He wanted to try treating him
with the monks there.

405
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:05,102
The situation there must be bad.

406
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:11,108
Is that where you’re from?

407
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:14,403
Over 15 years ago.

408
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:16,322
It was a prayer center back then.

409
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:26,327
Father Paolo!

410
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:31,081
Michela...

411
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:32,124
Where is the child?

412
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:42,301
Possession doesn’t exist,
but you’ve barricaded this door tightly.

413
00:44:11,288 --> 00:44:14,250
You came back with two masses
of cursed energy?

414
00:44:18,629 --> 00:44:22,424
Did you think I’d be
your guinea pig like her?

415
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:27,721
You thought a bigger cross
would solve everything?

416
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:32,768
Did you meet your friend
on the way here?

417
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:42,068
You cunning fool!

418
00:44:43,487 --> 00:44:45,322
She says hello.

419
00:44:45,322 --> 00:44:48,242
She asked me
how you two are doing.

420
00:44:51,161 --> 00:44:52,829
Michela.

421
00:44:53,872 --> 00:44:56,041
Hee-joon can be saved.

422
00:44:57,251 --> 00:44:59,295
I’ll do it, no matter what.

423
00:44:59,295 --> 00:45:03,382
You’re the proof of it.

424
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:14,226
You have glorified your honor
by my non-existence.

425
00:45:14,226 --> 00:45:19,898
Soon, you’ll lose that petty name
of yours that you fear most.

426
00:45:19,898 --> 00:45:23,694
And your nephew will die
fleeing from the military,

427
00:45:23,694 --> 00:45:27,364
shot by mistake,
his head blown apart.

428
00:45:27,364 --> 00:45:30,867
Your beloved sister will
hang herself the next day!

429
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:32,994
Like that bitch.

430
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:38,208
And you’ll go mad,
just like your mother did!

431
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:41,378
Father Paolo!

432
00:45:41,378 --> 00:45:42,296
Father!

433
00:45:43,422 --> 00:45:44,673
Please, get a grip!

434
00:45:44,673 --> 00:45:45,757
Father Paolo!

435
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:50,178
Father Paolo!

436
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,806
Father Paolo!

437
00:45:52,806 --> 00:45:53,223
Father Paolo!

438
00:45:53,223 --> 00:45:55,559
Father, snap out of it!

439
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:56,560
Father...

440
00:46:00,105 --> 00:46:01,732
Father, please!

441
00:46:03,984 --> 00:46:05,068
Father!

442
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:11,032
With even one drop of Christ’s blood,

443
00:46:11,032 --> 00:46:13,744
we believe the whole world
can be saved.

444
00:46:37,934 --> 00:46:40,771
Is this child’s body so precious?

445
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,402
Sister Giunia!

446
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:49,738
You despicable bastard!
Exploiting the child’s body--

447
00:47:49,506 --> 00:47:51,508
It’s okay, it’s okay.

448
00:47:53,927 --> 00:47:55,345
Sister...

449
00:47:58,139 --> 00:47:59,600
Kill me...

450
00:48:01,184 --> 00:48:02,853
Please, kill me...

451
00:48:06,189 --> 00:48:08,525
Don’t give up, Hee-joon.

452
00:48:08,525 --> 00:48:10,902
Let’s not give up.

453
00:48:10,902 --> 00:48:17,618
No... I can’t do this anymore.

454
00:48:17,618 --> 00:48:19,786
I just want to go to my mom.

455
00:48:21,997 --> 00:48:25,208
No, I’m not giving up on you.

456
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,424
We can do this together.

457
00:48:32,424 --> 00:48:36,011
Just hang on a little longer,
please, Hee-joon.

458
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:40,181
I want to live.

459
00:48:44,144 --> 00:48:46,354
I want to live...

460
00:49:26,853 --> 00:49:28,897
Is this a non-smoking area?

461
00:49:45,997 --> 00:49:48,750
Maybe this worked like
a talisman and saved his life.

462
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:03,348
Why do you fight so hard?

463
00:50:15,443 --> 00:50:16,820
A monster...

464
00:50:19,405 --> 00:50:21,074
Like a monster.

465
00:50:24,285 --> 00:50:30,375
You’re a monster,
and so am I...

466
00:50:32,794 --> 00:50:37,883
Perhaps God knows why
we were born as such monsters.

467
00:50:47,517 --> 00:50:49,936
I came this far...

468
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,860
I fled and survived everything...

469
00:51:01,489 --> 00:51:03,408
Just face it head-on.

470
00:51:19,465 --> 00:51:21,467
What’s the key?

471
00:51:22,552 --> 00:51:24,638
The key to completing the exorcism.

472
00:51:28,016 --> 00:51:29,350
Confession.

473
00:51:39,235 --> 00:51:41,655
The monster’s true name.

474
00:51:43,907 --> 00:51:47,452
I’m Sung-ae,
Kang Sung-ae.

475
00:51:58,672 --> 00:52:02,300
The Major Arcana card 5,
the Hierophant.

476
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,805
The Hierophant is seen with
two priests.

477
00:52:06,805 --> 00:52:09,474
Each card has dozens of keywords,

478
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:13,269
but Hierophant is often drawn
when the situation is constrained.

479
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:15,021
Constrained situations?

480
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:15,814
Yes.

481
00:52:15,814 --> 00:52:19,525
The original meaning of this card
isn’t strictly the Hierophant—

482
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:22,112
it symbolizes one who has
experienced the divine.

483
00:52:24,698 --> 00:52:27,242
This deck is from the Golden Dawn.

484
00:52:27,242 --> 00:52:30,620
Monks from the Middle Ages
who studied mysticism within the church.

485
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,122
Like the Rosicrucianism.

486
00:52:33,123 --> 00:52:33,874
Take a look.

487
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:37,878
If you see here—

488
00:52:37,878 --> 00:52:42,758
when the Knight of Evil appears,
the Emperor is already dead.

489
00:52:42,758 --> 00:52:45,802
But the Hierophant is
standing against it, very much alive.

490
00:52:45,802 --> 00:52:47,721
The Knight of Evil...

491
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:52,934
The Emperor dies, and the one
who experienced divinity stands up to it?

492
00:52:58,064 --> 00:52:59,274
You’re quite the expert.

493
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:05,822
Also,

494
00:53:05,822 --> 00:53:09,159
what’s under the Hierophant
is called Saint Peter’s Keys.

495
00:53:12,495 --> 00:53:14,164
Card 4, the Emperor...

496
00:53:14,164 --> 00:53:16,041
Card 5, the Hierophant...

497
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:18,251
Then what’s Card 6?

498
00:53:24,966 --> 00:53:27,635
Card 6 is the Lovers.

499
00:53:27,635 --> 00:53:29,554
Six represents union
and completion.

500
00:53:35,643 --> 00:53:39,272
Sister! Where are we going now?

501
00:53:39,272 --> 00:53:41,066
The Hierophant, the two men
receiving baptism,

502
00:53:41,066 --> 00:53:43,568
which means, we need a third.

503
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:48,031
You don’t mean the shaman, right?

504
00:53:50,033 --> 00:53:51,952
Do you know any
exorcist priests nearby?

505
00:53:53,203 --> 00:53:55,246
No way, tell me I’m wrong.

506
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:13,223
Hail Mary

507
00:54:13,223 --> 00:54:19,938
full of grace

508
00:54:19,938 --> 00:54:36,079
the Lord is with thee.

509
00:54:47,215 --> 00:54:51,386
Weren’t you going to
teach English to the locals?

510
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:53,889
People often get sick when their
lifestyle suddenly changes.

511
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:57,225
Just stick to what Father Kim
taught you.

512
00:54:57,225 --> 00:55:00,979
What more can you want
from a coward like me?

513
00:55:02,522 --> 00:55:07,318
You said the 12 Manifestations
take animal forms.

514
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:17,245
A serpent that symbolizes Satan,

515
00:55:17,245 --> 00:55:21,541
a goat for the sacrificial lamb—

516
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:26,629
Maybe those aren’t demons after all.

517
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:38,308
Whether it’s God or a demon,
never trust the manifestations

518
00:55:38,308 --> 00:55:41,061
that non-human beings take.

519
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:42,312
Giunia!

520
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:46,399
Because those manifestations
are just clues.

521
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,905
You taught me that.

522
00:55:51,905 --> 00:55:54,824
You’re far too rude to ever be...

523
00:55:57,827 --> 00:56:00,121
a proper clergywoman.

524
00:56:01,122 --> 00:56:03,166
Thank you for your guidance.

525
00:56:06,252 --> 00:56:07,837
Father Andrea.

526
00:56:08,922 --> 00:56:14,219
Granted the power and mission
by God to crush the head of Satan,

527
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:18,514
O great Queen of Heaven,
Lady of Angels,

528
00:56:18,514 --> 00:56:23,937
humbly I implore you to send
the heavenly army at your command

529
00:56:23,937 --> 00:56:29,025
to drive the demons into hell,
fight them across the earth,

530
00:56:29,025 --> 00:56:31,319
subdue their insolence,

531
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:35,073
and ultimately cast them into hell.

532
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:36,074
Amen.

533
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:13,403
Father Kim and Father Choi
cannot be here to perform the rite.

534
00:57:13,403 --> 00:57:15,696
I deeply regret this point.

535
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:24,872
They are currently occupied
with other missions,

536
00:57:24,872 --> 00:57:28,709
and I am unable to disclose
further details due to confidentiality.

537
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,720
Both Father Kim and the Rosicrucianism

538
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:45,060
believe that the entity possessing
the boy is one of the 12 Manifestations.

539
00:57:48,688 --> 00:57:51,149
This is Father Kim’s message.

540
00:57:55,778 --> 00:57:59,324
“The 12 Manifestations will
continue to appear.

541
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:10,293
Save the boy by any means possible.”

542
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,714
Can’t you join us for the exorcism?

543
00:58:14,714 --> 00:58:16,757
You’re a priest from the Rosicrucianism,
aren’t you?

544
00:58:25,141 --> 00:58:27,435
I’m sorry, but I am not allowed.

545
00:58:31,564 --> 00:58:34,984
As a servant of God,
I must follow our Lord’s plans.

546
00:58:36,736 --> 00:58:39,239
We need Saint Peter’s Keys
to seal the 12 Manifestations,

547
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:41,782
as well as the Gospel of Peter.

548
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:54,587
Those are sacred objects.

549
00:58:54,587 --> 00:58:57,465
Moreover, they are kept
by the Vatican.

550
00:58:58,091 --> 00:59:01,094
These entities are capable of
possessing even priests.

551
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:18,694
I will help you in every way I can.

552
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:38,631
Kim, you son of a bitch...

553
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:40,175
Isn’t he your mentor?

554
00:59:41,259 --> 00:59:43,010
You may curse me later.

555
00:59:45,346 --> 00:59:46,597
Okay...

556
01:00:08,161 --> 01:00:10,746
On the first day of the lunar month,
at the hour of Zi,

557
01:00:10,746 --> 01:00:13,999
that is when all forces
converge to destroy it.

558
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:16,461
You must finish before
the hour transition to Chou.

559
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:20,047
Otherwise, its power will grow
even stronger.

560
01:00:22,175 --> 01:00:23,843
Should we call Master Dam-eon?

561
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,095
No...

562
01:00:30,141 --> 01:00:35,104
All the shamans are fully booked
for that day because of the by-elections.

563
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:42,069
Are you serious?

564
01:00:43,779 --> 01:00:46,449
You call that an excuse?

565
01:00:51,787 --> 01:00:55,416
That’s the day when
all ancestral spirits are on the move.

566
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:00,338
Let’s go.

567
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:06,177
I’m sorry, Sung-ae.

568
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,096
Sister Giunia!

569
01:01:21,734 --> 01:01:26,531
So, have you found a place
to conduct the rite?

570
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:28,908
I plan to perform it
at the boy’s residence.

571
01:01:28,908 --> 01:01:31,494
It’s a remote area.

572
01:01:31,494 --> 01:01:37,958
The Archdiocese of Seoul has approved
the unofficial exorcism of Choi Hee-joon,

573
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:40,920
and Father Paolo will be participating.

574
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,964
But he isn’t even ordained
for exorcisms!

575
01:01:43,964 --> 01:01:48,969
The Archdiocese has permitted it,
and as the bishop here, I approve it.

576
01:01:48,969 --> 01:01:51,096
Father Paolo has received

577
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:57,978
special permission to oversee
Choi Hee-joon’s unofficial exorcism.

578
01:01:57,978 --> 01:02:01,941
He doesn’t even
believe in exorcism!

579
01:02:01,941 --> 01:02:05,528
And a nun is not qualified
to perform an exorcism.

580
01:02:07,196 --> 01:02:11,909
Father Paolo is a priest
of deep faith and knowledge.

581
01:02:11,909 --> 01:02:15,746
Plus, he’s a medical doctor.

582
01:02:15,746 --> 01:02:19,417
Didn’t you send a letter
to Father Kim?

583
01:02:21,252 --> 01:02:24,297
I only requested sacred items
needed for the exorcism.

584
01:02:24,297 --> 01:02:28,259
We cannot recklessly entrust such
sacred items for an unofficial exorcism.

585
01:02:29,802 --> 01:02:34,349
Father Paolo will personally bring
the sacred items and oversee it.

586
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:36,684
This is insane...

587
01:02:36,684 --> 01:02:38,936
Keep in mind that from now on,

588
01:02:38,936 --> 01:02:43,065
everything you do
violates the church law.

589
01:02:43,065 --> 01:02:47,737
Your abilities and spirituality are
only vouched for by Father Kim,

590
01:02:47,737 --> 01:02:51,031
you’re not even a priest
of the Rosicrucianism.

591
01:02:52,283 --> 01:02:55,453
If I contact the Rosicrucianism,

592
01:02:55,453 --> 01:02:58,122
could they hand over
the sacred items to me directly?

593
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:03,669
That might be harder than
performing the exorcism itself.

594
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:20,102
The Day of Exorcism

595
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:12,572
That was Father Kim's
personal opinion,

596
01:04:12,572 --> 01:04:14,990
the Rosicrucianism holds
a different view on the matter.

597
01:04:15,366 --> 01:04:18,578
In exchange for our full support,

598
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:24,750
you must eliminate the demon
by all means necessary.

599
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:25,585
This

600
01:04:26,544 --> 01:04:28,295
is our will.

601
01:04:28,504 --> 01:04:32,842
Even if the child might not survive?

602
01:05:42,995 --> 01:05:44,288
Malodore.

603
01:05:45,122 --> 01:05:48,626
It’s the distinct stench of possession.

604
01:05:48,626 --> 01:05:52,505
It means the demon within
has decayed to its very core.

605
01:05:52,505 --> 01:05:54,507
Couldn’t you have told me sooner?

606
01:05:56,425 --> 01:05:58,678
Would that have helped you prepare?

607
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:02,306
That stench can’t be washed away.

608
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:06,936
It’s the main reason the possessed
are ultimately abandoned.

609
01:06:06,936 --> 01:06:11,398
Thankfully, the human sense of smell
is the dullest of all, a blessing from God.

610
01:06:13,568 --> 01:06:15,486
What a know-it-all.

611
01:06:17,863 --> 01:06:19,574
Watch your tone.

612
01:06:25,996 --> 01:06:29,249
You should quit smoking.

613
01:06:29,249 --> 01:06:31,544
Secondhand smoke is worse.

614
01:06:55,985 --> 01:06:58,738
The air feels too cold today.

615
01:07:31,771 --> 01:07:33,230
What about the manual?

616
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:37,067
Is this a surgery?
There’s no manual for a Dark Nun.

617
01:07:37,067 --> 01:07:38,402
Right.

618
01:07:38,402 --> 01:07:40,696
There’s only one rule
for this exorcism:

619
01:07:40,696 --> 01:07:42,990
use any means necessary.

620
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,448
It’s begun.

621
01:09:08,367 --> 01:09:10,285
What’s that?

622
01:09:10,285 --> 01:09:11,912
Cotton flowers.

623
01:09:13,622 --> 01:09:15,916
They symbolize the Goddess of Birth.

624
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:16,792
What?

625
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:21,505
She’s the ancestral deity
who oversaw Hee-joon’s birth.

626
01:09:21,505 --> 01:09:24,466
He’s destined to be a shaman.

627
01:09:24,466 --> 01:09:27,887
His ancestors will lend their aid.

628
01:09:27,887 --> 01:09:29,638
Are you a shaman or a nun?

629
01:09:34,643 --> 01:09:37,938
Never disregard any information
about a possessed person.

630
01:09:37,938 --> 01:09:40,691
Still, we’re nuns, you know?

631
01:09:40,691 --> 01:09:45,738
Even in Europe, they summon
guardian spirits during exorcisms.

632
01:09:45,738 --> 01:09:48,991
Getting approval for an exorcism
is nearly impossible anywhere.

633
01:10:15,059 --> 01:10:18,938
Lord, even though we use
any means necessary,

634
01:10:18,938 --> 01:10:22,482
our hearts remain true to You,
please, help us.

635
01:10:33,869 --> 01:10:35,913
Check him again.

636
01:10:35,913 --> 01:10:38,207
What?

637
01:10:38,207 --> 01:10:40,667
You’re a doctor, aren’t you?

638
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:41,961
Yes.

639
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,542
Even the demon knows.

640
01:11:24,711 --> 01:11:26,255
It knows what you fear.

641
01:11:52,948 --> 01:11:55,034
It shows you visions.

642
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,496
It makes you relive your trauma,

643
01:11:59,496 --> 01:12:01,081
driving you to want to die.

644
01:12:14,094 --> 01:12:18,223
And you, son of man,
do not be afraid of them,

645
01:12:19,016 --> 01:12:22,602
do not fear their words,

646
01:12:22,602 --> 01:12:26,606
for they are rebellious
and deceitful around you,

647
01:12:27,482 --> 01:12:33,280
and even if you dwell
among scorpions and thorns.

648
01:12:33,822 --> 01:12:38,660
Do not be dismayed at their faces,

649
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,745
for they are a rebellious house.

650
01:13:14,696 --> 01:13:20,827
May your faith save this child.

651
01:13:20,827 --> 01:13:23,705
May God's blessing be with you.

652
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:28,668
Bach Cantatas BWV140 –
Wake, Awake, for Night is Flying

653
01:13:31,796 --> 01:13:33,715
Are you ready?

654
01:13:33,715 --> 01:13:35,800
It’s all over when we find out its name.

655
01:13:36,927 --> 01:13:38,470
Yes, Sister.

656
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:41,390
Try not to look directly into his eyes.

657
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:45,477
If you start experiencing visions,
hide behind the icon

658
01:13:46,436 --> 01:13:48,647
or stand behind me.

659
01:13:48,647 --> 01:13:49,731
Yes, Sister.

660
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:56,613
Begin the prayer.

661
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:09,043
Lord, have mercy.

662
01:14:09,043 --> 01:14:12,421
Lord, our God, King of all ages,
Almighty Father,

663
01:14:12,421 --> 01:14:16,300
who created all things
and change them

664
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,801
according to Your will...

665
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:19,678
...who in Babylon turned
the burning flames

666
01:14:19,678 --> 01:14:21,430
Sister...

667
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:23,015
Thank you...

668
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:25,059
of the furnace into refreshing dew...

669
01:14:25,059 --> 01:14:27,186
I’m okay now...

670
01:14:33,025 --> 01:14:35,110
Where’s my mom?

671
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:37,487
I want to go to my mom...

672
01:14:38,363 --> 01:14:42,284
Lord, have mercy.

673
01:14:42,284 --> 01:14:44,744
I want to see my mom...

674
01:14:44,744 --> 01:14:46,246
Sister...

675
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,252
It’s suffocating...

676
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:55,839
Can you untie this, please?

677
01:14:56,881 --> 01:14:58,592
Sister Kang Sung-ae...

678
01:15:02,429 --> 01:15:05,515
When did I ever tell you my name?

679
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:09,811
You fucking bitch!

680
01:15:12,106 --> 01:15:15,734
Lord, who is the salvation of all,
and who cleanses all sorcery and witchcraft,

681
01:15:15,734 --> 01:15:19,779
may Your servant sing with gratitude
under Your protection and faith.

682
01:15:25,744 --> 01:15:27,037
I hate it...

683
01:15:27,037 --> 01:15:32,334
I hate being unable to move
my hands and feet...

684
01:15:32,334 --> 01:15:34,669
I’m so scared...

685
01:15:34,669 --> 01:15:36,338
Please, let me out of here...

686
01:15:36,338 --> 01:15:39,841
The bullies, they’re coming after me!

687
01:15:39,841 --> 01:15:40,842
Please, save me...

688
01:15:41,385 --> 01:15:48,392
Lord, Almighty
and Master of all ages,

689
01:15:48,392 --> 01:15:51,436
You created all things
and change them

690
01:15:51,436 --> 01:15:53,522
according to Your will.

691
01:15:53,522 --> 01:15:56,400
You, who saved and protected
the three holy young saints

692
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:02,406
from the fiery furnace
engulfed in flames in Babylon...

693
01:16:02,406 --> 01:16:04,324
- You are the healer of our souls
- I can’t... I just can’t...

694
01:16:04,324 --> 01:16:07,077
- and the salvation of those who seek You.
- I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t!

695
01:16:18,255 --> 01:16:19,881
Piss off, you filthy bitch!

696
01:16:26,888 --> 01:16:29,015
Raise the breaker,
and relight the candles.

697
01:16:39,568 --> 01:16:41,069
Just turn it off!

698
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:42,571
Yes, Sister.

699
01:16:53,623 --> 01:16:55,209
Sister...

700
01:16:56,751 --> 01:16:59,671
This isn’t a demon...

701
01:16:59,671 --> 01:17:01,715
It protected me...

702
01:17:02,966 --> 01:17:05,552
It killed your mom.

703
01:17:05,552 --> 01:17:08,054
It hurt your friends.

704
01:17:08,054 --> 01:17:12,434
It’s a spirit protecting me...

705
01:17:12,434 --> 01:17:17,481
You understand, don’t you?

706
01:17:17,481 --> 01:17:20,108
It’s a demon.

707
01:17:20,108 --> 01:17:21,818
It will never protect you.

708
01:17:21,818 --> 01:17:25,864
Don’t doubt me,
I won’t disappoint you.

709
01:17:27,532 --> 01:17:29,909
You still want me, don’t you?

710
01:17:29,909 --> 01:17:33,163
I slaughtered your bitch mother.

711
01:17:33,163 --> 01:17:36,416
I slaughtered your bitch mother.

712
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:38,877
I slaughtered your bitch mother!

713
01:17:38,877 --> 01:17:41,546
You conniving bitch! Whore!

714
01:17:43,215 --> 01:17:44,716
How long have you starved?

715
01:17:50,389 --> 01:17:52,599
It’s dirty! Filthy!

716
01:17:52,599 --> 01:17:56,144
Remove your hand!
It’s filthy!

717
01:17:56,144 --> 01:17:58,272
You whore!

718
01:17:58,272 --> 01:17:59,439
Remove your hand!

719
01:18:06,905 --> 01:18:08,365
Useless shit!

720
01:18:08,365 --> 01:18:11,618
- How dare you!
- And the savior of those who seek You.

721
01:18:11,618 --> 01:18:12,952
We beseech You...

722
01:18:16,873 --> 01:18:19,251
You deceitful woman,
lying about your god!

723
01:18:20,627 --> 01:18:23,338
Whore!
Filthy bitch!

724
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:26,716
Your humble servant may sing
under Your protection and faith.

725
01:18:33,807 --> 01:18:35,934
Protect us from every curse,

726
01:18:35,934 --> 01:18:38,687
from the malicious gazes
of the wicked!

727
01:18:38,687 --> 01:18:41,773
And from every wicked act
committed against Your servant!

728
01:18:41,773 --> 01:18:44,192
Extend Your powerful hands and
Your highest and strongest arms,

729
01:18:44,192 --> 01:18:46,403
and come to aid and visit this Your image,

730
01:18:46,403 --> 01:18:49,030
and send upon it Your angel of mercy,

731
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:51,408
a strong and faithful guardian of soul and body.

732
01:19:21,062 --> 01:19:23,815
You are trash!

733
01:19:23,815 --> 01:19:26,985
You drool all night, lusting to kill
whenever you see young ones!

734
01:19:26,985 --> 01:19:31,531
Demon, I command you—
reveal your true identity.

735
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:33,867
Demon, I command you!

736
01:19:34,033 --> 01:19:36,077
Tell me who you are!

737
01:19:36,077 --> 01:19:39,163
Asking for my name this early?

738
01:19:39,163 --> 01:19:42,417
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you to reveal your name!

739
01:19:42,459 --> 01:19:46,212
In the name of Jesus Christ,

740
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,714
reveal your name!

741
01:19:48,382 --> 01:19:53,595
In the name of Jesus Christ,

742
01:19:53,595 --> 01:19:55,555
reveal your name!

743
01:19:56,473 --> 01:19:58,141
Don’t you get it yet?

744
01:19:59,017 --> 01:20:01,144
I won’t be fooled by your tricks.

745
01:20:01,144 --> 01:20:03,730
You’re just a snake
slithering out of the sea.

746
01:20:05,649 --> 01:20:07,442
You will die!

747
01:20:11,405 --> 01:20:17,702
The son of Mary died
nailed to the cross,

748
01:20:17,869 --> 01:20:23,291
you’ll die with a tumor
in your womb,

749
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:25,794
unable to even bear children.

750
01:20:34,594 --> 01:20:37,305
Possessing a faithless child,

751
01:20:37,305 --> 01:20:39,724
you’re a pathetic creature
that only hunts the weak!

752
01:20:39,724 --> 01:20:41,976
Lord, have mercy.

753
01:20:43,687 --> 01:20:45,397
Pretending to react to the cross,

754
01:20:45,397 --> 01:20:49,776
only to slither away like an eel.

755
01:20:50,902 --> 01:20:54,489
You’re just a deceitful,
insignificant spirit!

756
01:20:54,489 --> 01:20:56,032
A lowly beast’s soul at that!

757
01:21:13,383 --> 01:21:14,426
Sister!

758
01:21:15,635 --> 01:21:19,013
We’ve been waiting for 233 years.

759
01:21:19,013 --> 01:21:24,394
I was there in 1791,
1846, and 1866.

760
01:21:24,853 --> 01:21:28,064
We were involved in the deaths
of the 103 martyrs you revere.

761
01:21:28,314 --> 01:21:29,733
And now...

762
01:21:31,818 --> 01:21:34,362
we will kill the children!

763
01:21:34,362 --> 01:21:38,157
Starting with this child,
we will kill 292, then 471,

764
01:21:38,157 --> 01:21:40,577
until the number reaches 2,340!

765
01:21:40,577 --> 01:21:44,581
The children will perish on land,
in the mountains, and in the skies.

766
01:21:45,999 --> 01:21:49,377
Mark my words:
this child is the beginning.

767
01:21:50,294 --> 01:21:53,131
The beginning of your
devastating defeat.

768
01:21:56,635 --> 01:21:57,677
“We”?

769
01:21:59,387 --> 01:22:01,723
There’s just one of you.

770
01:22:01,723 --> 01:22:04,851
We are one and all.

771
01:22:05,769 --> 01:22:07,896
Foolish woman!

772
01:22:07,896 --> 01:22:09,939
Clinging to your pitiful prayers...

773
01:22:09,939 --> 01:22:12,859
You pathetic humans lost
the ability to think for yourselves!

774
01:22:13,568 --> 01:22:16,780
A beast protected by a filthy legion!

775
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:18,573
Tell me your name!

776
01:22:19,491 --> 01:22:22,744
You always start with commands,
never with a plea!

777
01:22:22,744 --> 01:22:24,120
Stupid wretch!

778
01:22:25,204 --> 01:22:27,624
Say your name!

779
01:22:30,376 --> 01:22:34,047
Do not fear, my son,

780
01:22:34,047 --> 01:22:36,174
for I am your father.

781
01:22:36,841 --> 01:22:40,094
Then tell me with your own mouth.

782
01:22:40,094 --> 01:22:41,555
What is your name?

783
01:22:42,388 --> 01:22:46,726
If you’re going to command me,
do it with some authority!

784
01:22:46,726 --> 01:22:50,980
You dare face me?

785
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:55,318
How dare you pray?
Kneel to me instead!

786
01:22:55,318 --> 01:22:57,612
I am the sacred one
you must kneel to!

787
01:23:01,616 --> 01:23:03,535
Worship me instead!

788
01:23:03,535 --> 01:23:05,244
Shut up and say your name!

789
01:23:05,954 --> 01:23:10,416
God created mankind?

790
01:23:10,416 --> 01:23:12,210
What nonsense!

791
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:15,797
Is this Almighty God’s masterpiece?

792
01:23:15,797 --> 01:23:20,719
Pathetic fools, drunk on power
and slaughtering each other?

793
01:23:29,352 --> 01:23:34,273
Forget about us—
just tell us who you are.

794
01:23:34,273 --> 01:23:37,777
Who are you,
and why are you here?

795
01:23:37,777 --> 01:23:39,738
I told you, didn’t I?

796
01:23:41,114 --> 01:23:44,033
I hated you.

797
01:23:45,493 --> 01:23:48,204
I hated you!

798
01:23:48,204 --> 01:23:50,707
I hated you! I hated you!

799
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:52,834
I hated you! I hated you!

800
01:23:52,834 --> 01:23:54,210
I hated you!

801
01:23:54,836 --> 01:23:56,462
I hated you!

802
01:23:57,338 --> 01:23:58,965
I hated you!

803
01:23:59,257 --> 01:24:02,677
I hated you! I hated you!

804
01:24:29,537 --> 01:24:31,372
Bring me Saint Peter’s scripture
and the keys.

805
01:24:32,582 --> 01:24:33,958
Hurry.

806
01:24:46,304 --> 01:24:47,430
Hey!

807
01:24:56,731 --> 01:24:58,817
What do we do now?

808
01:24:58,817 --> 01:25:05,448
You’re a shaman who should’ve died
performing a ritual,

809
01:25:05,448 --> 01:25:08,952
so why are you here
cloaked in the rags of Jesus?

810
01:25:10,244 --> 01:25:14,248
You’re possessed
by a spirit, so, why?

811
01:25:14,248 --> 01:25:18,419
Why don’t you ask the cards
you worship more than God?

812
01:25:18,419 --> 01:25:19,796
Shut up!

813
01:25:24,884 --> 01:25:26,886
It’s not over yet.

814
01:25:26,886 --> 01:25:28,512
We can’t end it like this.

815
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:31,933
Sister, please,
just tell me what to do!

816
01:25:31,933 --> 01:25:35,519
I’ll do whatever you say, Sister!

817
01:25:36,312 --> 01:25:38,064
No one born of a woman...

818
01:25:38,064 --> 01:25:39,065
Sister, please!

819
01:25:39,065 --> 01:25:40,984
can oppose us!

820
01:25:44,153 --> 01:25:48,700
Profound Dharma,
rare to encounter.

821
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:55,248
By fortune, I now find it.

822
01:25:55,248 --> 01:25:59,168
Who’s this worthless shaman?
Shut the hell up!

823
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:02,380
I seek the Tathagata's truth.

824
01:26:10,179 --> 01:26:12,891
Want to save a person with me?

825
01:26:14,308 --> 01:26:16,102
What?

826
01:26:16,102 --> 01:26:19,355
Hee-joon, remember him?

827
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:26,696
We’re going to exorcise him,
but we need another priest.

828
01:26:26,696 --> 01:26:29,615
Me... m-m-me?

829
01:26:29,615 --> 01:26:34,704
The essence of prayer is
sincerity, isn’t it?

830
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:42,045
To be honest,
it’s my first time too.

831
01:27:03,149 --> 01:27:04,317
D-don’t die!

832
01:27:06,277 --> 01:27:07,737
Hee-joon!

833
01:27:07,737 --> 01:27:11,574
I... c-can’t write a talisman yet...

834
01:27:11,574 --> 01:27:13,910
So... so here...

835
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:16,955
at least t-t-take this...

836
01:27:25,254 --> 01:27:30,760
Mantra of the Dharma Treasury,
Om Aranam Arada.

837
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:34,931
Om Aranam Arada.

838
01:27:35,849 --> 01:27:37,641
You damn pests!

839
01:27:37,641 --> 01:27:40,478
Shut up before I rip
your mouth apart! Shut it!

840
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:45,358
Great mountains, small mountains,
mountain spirit gods.

841
01:27:45,358 --> 01:27:49,070
Great strikes, small strikes,
mountain spirit gods.

842
01:27:49,528 --> 01:27:51,447
Great evils, small evils,
vanish from this place.

843
01:27:51,447 --> 01:27:53,449
His stuttering is gone.

844
01:27:56,953 --> 01:27:59,956
Those who’ve experienced divinity,

845
01:27:59,956 --> 01:28:01,082
three.

846
01:28:09,007 --> 01:28:11,843
Bow to the guest spirits,
spirits of the land.

847
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:15,138
Shut up already!
Shut that fool’s mouth!

848
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:20,351
Bow to the mountain spirits,
let go of all obstacles.

849
01:28:20,351 --> 01:28:22,979
Spirits of the soil,
protect with sacrifice!

850
01:28:30,736 --> 01:28:35,074
Today, at this very moment,
we seek blessings to go far.

851
01:28:35,074 --> 01:28:39,245
Each and every place,
beyond a thousand miles.

852
01:28:43,624 --> 01:28:46,335
Otherworldly beings, do not return.

853
01:28:46,335 --> 01:28:49,380
Hurry, follow the law of the cycle, Svaha!

854
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:53,134
Hurry, follow the law of the cycle, Svaha!

855
01:28:56,762 --> 01:28:58,639
Lord who loves humanity.

856
01:28:59,515 --> 01:29:01,725
Protector of souls and bodies.

857
01:29:01,725 --> 01:29:04,770
Send the angel of peace
and strength,

858
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:08,732
visit and aid this child,
created in Your image.

859
01:29:10,985 --> 01:29:13,071
In the name of the Son
and the Holy Spirit...

860
01:29:29,753 --> 01:29:32,756
I have not come to ruin your lives!

861
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,095
I am your savior!

862
01:29:38,721 --> 01:29:42,225
He stole the scripture and fled?

863
01:29:42,225 --> 01:29:47,188
Master, should I send my men
to catch that bastard?

864
01:29:48,022 --> 01:29:49,357
Leave it.

865
01:29:51,985 --> 01:29:56,530
Everyone there is going to die today.

866
01:30:11,754 --> 01:30:13,047
Crazy bitch...

867
01:30:13,047 --> 01:30:16,050
Bow to the guest spirits,
spirits of the land.

868
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:18,677
Protect with the self-sacrifice
of the household.

869
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:48,624
Today, at this very moment,
seek blessings to go far.

870
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:52,253
Most holy and glorious Mother of God,

871
01:30:52,253 --> 01:30:55,423
eternal Virgin Mary and
the Archangels who radiate light,

872
01:30:55,423 --> 01:30:58,926
I plead in the names of
all Your saints.

873
01:30:58,926 --> 01:31:02,221
- Be with us brothers always and everywhere.
- Shut up!

874
01:31:02,221 --> 01:31:03,931
- In the name of the Father, the Son,
- Shut up!

875
01:31:03,931 --> 01:31:05,141
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

876
01:31:10,188 --> 01:31:11,189
I ask you,

877
01:31:12,231 --> 01:31:13,774
what are your names?

878
01:31:14,775 --> 01:31:16,777
First murderer.

879
01:31:16,777 --> 01:31:18,279
Where did you come from?

880
01:31:20,031 --> 01:31:23,242
Even in the muzzle of the guns
you humans point at each other,

881
01:31:23,242 --> 01:31:27,913
in polluted wells,
and in cities built on deserts...

882
01:31:28,456 --> 01:31:31,917
in all places where gravity exists,
I have been with you.

883
01:31:35,421 --> 01:31:40,551
O humans, who cannot
fully understand gravity,

884
01:31:40,843 --> 01:31:43,054
I am the God...

885
01:32:03,616 --> 01:32:06,494
It hurts... Please save me...

886
01:32:07,578 --> 01:32:11,499
Sister... Please save me...

887
01:32:13,459 --> 01:32:17,546
The Lord is my shepherd,
with Him, who can harm me?

888
01:32:17,546 --> 01:32:21,008
I do not fear because
I am with You, my God.

889
01:32:23,136 --> 01:32:27,265
Sister... Please save me...

890
01:32:27,265 --> 01:32:29,100
You’re right.

891
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:33,771
I’ll imprison you within my womb.

892
01:32:37,191 --> 01:32:38,359
How dare you...

893
01:32:40,236 --> 01:32:44,823
even consider forcing me
into your rotten womb?

894
01:32:48,952 --> 01:32:53,499
The filthy womb where you
promised purity to Him?

895
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:58,712
Consider it an honor,
you worthless horse head.

896
01:33:02,633 --> 01:33:06,053
You crazy wench,
go ahead and try!

897
01:33:06,053 --> 01:33:09,848
Come, embrace me!
I'll be reborn as a demon!

898
01:33:09,848 --> 01:33:12,435
I'll honor you as my mother!

899
01:33:18,107 --> 01:33:22,069
Mountain spirits of the western
and southern mountains!

900
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:33,247
Mountain spirits of the great
and small mountains!

901
01:33:34,081 --> 01:33:36,125
Spirits of great strikes
and small strikes!

902
01:33:36,542 --> 01:33:37,460
Great evils and small evils,

903
01:33:40,003 --> 01:33:42,131
What’s your name, you vile spirit?

904
01:33:45,634 --> 01:33:47,803
Sister...

905
01:33:47,803 --> 01:33:49,180
Your name.

906
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:51,224
Call me ‘Annihilation.’

907
01:33:51,224 --> 01:33:54,727
You’re bacteria that make
rotten fruit decay even further.

908
01:33:54,727 --> 01:33:55,936
Your name!

909
01:33:55,936 --> 01:33:59,898
I existed everywhere
since the beginning.

910
01:33:59,898 --> 01:34:02,526
Those who fear us call us
the 12 Manifestations.

911
01:34:03,819 --> 01:34:06,489
Do you dare call yourself
the 12 Manifestations?

912
01:34:18,334 --> 01:34:21,712
Hee-joon... Hee-joon...

913
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:31,847
Hee-joon! Please hang in there!

914
01:34:31,847 --> 01:34:35,309
Come forth, come forth!

915
01:34:40,523 --> 01:34:44,109
You cowardly spirit dwelling in
a weak child! Pathetic wretch!

916
01:34:45,027 --> 01:34:49,240
You’re nothing more than a bug,
found in every corner!

917
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:53,452
A worthless shadow at night,
a minion of the 12 Manifestations!

918
01:34:53,452 --> 01:34:57,290
A servant of evil bowing
before an unordained nun!

919
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:59,124
A mere pony of Marbas!

920
01:34:59,124 --> 01:35:04,255
How dare you call me a lowly spirit...

921
01:35:04,255 --> 01:35:06,674
You, of all people...

922
01:35:06,674 --> 01:35:10,969
You arrogant wretch...
You filthy woman!

923
01:35:13,597 --> 01:35:16,350
I am none other than
the Grand Duke of Hell!

924
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:17,518
Tell me your name.

925
01:35:18,477 --> 01:35:22,273
Tell me and make me
tremble in fear!

926
01:35:22,273 --> 01:35:27,361
I am the Grand Duke of Hell.

927
01:35:28,529 --> 01:35:30,448
I am Gamigin!

928
01:35:46,589 --> 01:35:50,551
Granted the power and mission
by God to crush the head of Satan,

929
01:35:50,551 --> 01:35:53,429
O great Queen of Heaven,
Lady of Angels,

930
01:35:53,429 --> 01:35:57,891
humbly I implore you to send
the heavenly army at your command

931
01:35:57,891 --> 01:36:02,104
to drive the demons into hell,
fight them across the earth,

932
01:36:02,104 --> 01:36:04,315
subdue their insolence,

933
01:36:04,315 --> 01:36:07,651
and ultimately cast them into hell.

934
01:36:07,651 --> 01:36:08,402
Amen.

935
01:36:09,778 --> 01:36:15,743
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, I command you,

936
01:36:15,743 --> 01:36:18,579
Gamigin! Come out of there!

937
01:36:53,196 --> 01:36:57,284
Lord, humans feel such sorrow...

938
01:37:03,874 --> 01:37:07,127
yet the sea remains so blue.

939
01:37:23,101 --> 01:37:26,271
Thank you, Sister.

940
01:37:28,441 --> 01:37:30,484
You’ve done well.

941
01:37:37,282 --> 01:37:40,453
Lord, hear our prayers.

942
01:37:40,453 --> 01:37:43,121
Saint Michael, hear our prayers.

943
01:37:43,121 --> 01:37:45,624
Saint Gabriel, hear our prayers.

944
01:37:45,624 --> 01:37:48,085
Saint Raphael, hear our prayers.

945
01:37:49,169 --> 01:37:51,714
Lord, hear our prayers.

946
01:37:51,714 --> 01:37:53,256
Saint Michael, hear our praye...

947
01:37:57,511 --> 01:37:58,637
Sister...

948
01:38:01,056 --> 01:38:02,265
Are you okay?

949
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:06,311
Good job.

950
01:38:43,557 --> 01:38:45,100
Look after Hee-joon first.

951
01:39:13,962 --> 01:39:17,049
Take him to the nearest church.

952
01:39:17,049 --> 01:39:21,011
Gamigin will try to return
to Hee-joon’s body.

953
01:39:21,011 --> 01:39:22,930
Hurry, go.

954
01:39:23,388 --> 01:39:24,473
What about you?

955
01:39:26,892 --> 01:39:30,437
Ring the church bell
three times from the tower.

956
01:39:30,437 --> 01:39:31,855
So that I can hear it.

957
01:39:31,855 --> 01:39:33,524
What about you?

958
01:39:43,701 --> 01:39:45,578
For heaven’s sake...

959
01:39:46,036 --> 01:39:50,248
Go, there’s no time.

960
01:39:50,248 --> 01:39:51,834
You need to save Hee-joon.

961
01:39:51,834 --> 01:39:57,047
I... I don’t want to.

962
01:39:57,047 --> 01:39:59,007
No... Let’s find another way...

963
01:39:59,007 --> 01:40:01,969
There must be another way, please?

964
01:40:01,969 --> 01:40:04,847
Save Hee-joon.

965
01:40:08,016 --> 01:40:10,268
You’re insane...

966
01:40:13,438 --> 01:40:16,775
You crazy bitch!

967
01:40:40,382 --> 01:40:46,805
In the name of Lord Jesus Christ
and the Virgin Mary,

968
01:40:46,805 --> 01:40:51,268
I command you, leave at once.

969
01:40:59,234 --> 01:41:00,736
Lord...

970
01:41:00,736 --> 01:41:07,618
Delay judgment and grant me
the wisdom to save my neighbor.

971
01:41:07,618 --> 01:41:09,411
Bestow upon us
the grace of salvation.

972
01:41:10,621 --> 01:41:15,458
Lord, please watch over us.

973
01:42:16,144 --> 01:42:18,271
Step aside! Please, step aside!

974
01:42:18,271 --> 01:42:19,439
I’m sorry!

975
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:20,941
I’m sorry! Please move aside!

976
01:42:20,941 --> 01:42:23,026
Please move!

977
01:42:23,026 --> 01:42:23,861
Make way! I’m sorry!

978
01:42:23,861 --> 01:42:24,820
Out of the way!

979
01:42:25,696 --> 01:42:26,905
Shit!

980
01:42:26,905 --> 01:42:27,781
Is this nun crazy?

981
01:42:27,781 --> 01:42:28,657
Let me go!

982
01:42:28,657 --> 01:42:30,450
I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

983
01:42:31,493 --> 01:42:32,119
Shit!

984
01:42:32,828 --> 01:42:33,787
Are you insane?!

985
01:42:58,645 --> 01:42:59,646
I’m okay...

986
01:43:02,232 --> 01:43:03,400
Get going!

987
01:43:04,818 --> 01:43:06,069
Just go!

988
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:16,663
Leave us,

989
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:19,875
and never return to this place.

990
01:43:21,584 --> 01:43:24,587
Never touch us again.

991
01:43:25,839 --> 01:43:28,133
Never hurt the children again.

992
01:43:29,885 --> 01:43:33,722
Lord Jesus Christ, Holy Virgin Mary,

993
01:43:33,722 --> 01:43:39,102
and Saint Michael the Archangel,
fight for us, please.

994
01:45:00,809 --> 01:45:02,060
I’m sorry...

995
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,311
I’m sorry.

996
01:45:06,606 --> 01:45:07,941
Just a moment!

997
01:45:11,194 --> 01:45:12,070
Hee-joon!

998
01:45:15,365 --> 01:45:16,366
Hee-joon!

999
01:45:32,007 --> 01:45:35,510
Go to the hospital with Hee-joon.

1000
01:45:36,344 --> 01:45:40,140
I need to go to Sister Giunia.

1001
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:42,100
N-no, you can’t!

1002
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,644
I have to go check on her!

1003
01:45:50,358 --> 01:45:51,651
Sister, are you okay?

1004
01:45:51,651 --> 01:45:54,029
It’s okay, I’m fine.

1005
01:46:27,062 --> 01:46:30,065
O Immaculate Virgin,

1006
01:46:30,065 --> 01:46:34,111
angels and archangels,

1007
01:46:34,111 --> 01:46:36,238
all the saints in heaven,

1008
01:46:37,948 --> 01:46:39,782
descend upon me.

1009
01:46:43,996 --> 01:46:47,624
Melt me, renew me,

1010
01:46:47,624 --> 01:46:53,380
cast all evils into the fires of hell,

1011
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:57,425
fill me with Your presence
and use me as Your tool...

1012
01:47:00,095 --> 01:47:03,390
So that they may
never again touch

1013
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:05,308
any of the creatures
of this world.

1014
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:12,024
Please protect us.

1015
01:47:36,506 --> 01:47:41,970
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son,

1016
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:44,097
and of the Holy Spirit.

1017
01:47:49,186 --> 01:47:50,270
Amen.

1018
01:48:11,374 --> 01:48:14,252
The Rosicrucianism Parish

1019
01:48:14,252 --> 01:48:16,546
I didn’t think you’d come
in person.

1020
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:21,634
I’m the one responsible
for the rite in question.

1021
01:48:22,219 --> 01:48:24,012
How is the boy?

1022
01:48:24,596 --> 01:48:26,473
I heard you’ve been taking care
of him personally.

1023
01:48:27,015 --> 01:48:33,771
He’s recovering quickly
but it will still take a long time.

1024
01:48:36,191 --> 01:48:37,650
Yes! But...

1025
01:48:40,778 --> 01:48:41,779
Yes?

1026
01:48:42,322 --> 01:48:47,619
I heard you weren’t
particularly fond of us...

1027
01:48:51,414 --> 01:48:55,793
Let’s just say we were
very cautious about the rite.

1028
01:48:58,588 --> 01:49:00,465
I wasn’t serious...

1029
01:49:01,549 --> 01:49:06,596
We all have freedom,
free to choose.

1030
01:49:07,347 --> 01:49:09,391
Both you, me,

1031
01:49:09,807 --> 01:49:11,934
and Sister Giunia.

1032
01:49:20,068 --> 01:49:30,620
Kang Sung-ae
Sister Giunia

1033
01:50:19,752 --> 01:50:20,878
Where are we going?

1034
01:50:22,839 --> 01:50:26,968
Wherever the 12 Manifestations show up.

1035
01:50:31,681 --> 01:50:33,600
Do you think I can do this?

1036
01:50:37,645 --> 01:50:39,397
You’ve already learned everything.

1037
01:50:41,858 --> 01:50:46,488
I was told Sister Giunia taught you
everything you need to know.
