1
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,360
woke up

2
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,199
Don't move

3
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,759
Don't move

4
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,719
I'll shake it for you

5
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
The doctor said

6
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,639
Alcohol poisoning

7
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,879
Severe gastric mucosa damage

8
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,000
You can't drink wine like this

9
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,680
This is to damage your body

10
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,039
Lying down today and don't move

11
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,840
Dad takes care of you

12
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,840
How is Dad's factory

13
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,759
fine

14
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,039
Backlog of products

15
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,560
All of them have been departing in the past two days

16
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,599
Don't worry

17
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,680
Some time ago I was obsessed with it

18
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,960
I've been lying in the hospital

19
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:50,199
It's also my worthy lesson

20
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,520
The most important lesson to be learned

21
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,560
It's Qian Hongming

22
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,478
If he hadn't bewitched you

23
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,639
How come so many takeoffs

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,599
A messy thing

25
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,360
dad

26
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,759
I'm an adult

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,759
Take charge of your own affairs

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,360
Why do you blame Hongming?

29
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,080
Don't talk to him anymore

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,159
I'll tell you

31
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,599
Qian Hongming, this kid

32
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,080
Smart is quite smart

33
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,159
But it's not a good thing.

34
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:16,239
I'll tell you

35
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,759
Don't ask where

36
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,079
He kept a house in Shanghai

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,800
Young girl

38
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,719
He made his sister very angry

39
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,680
You don't know

40
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,039
How can dad say this nonsense

41
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,879
Hongming only has Jiali in his heart

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,360
No one else knows

43
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:31,599
Can I still not know

44
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,639
Why am I talking nonsense

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,759
You don't understand

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,879
This has nothing to do with who he is in his heart

47
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,439
Got it

48
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,159
He and he's in that circle

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,840
You can make a little girl

50
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:45,639
He doesn't feel embarrassed

51
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,360
It's a shameful thing

52
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,439
His circle

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,800
It's this bad atmosphere

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,159
Right

55
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,800
Early ice ice

56
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,560
Come on

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,840
You haven't changed your clothes, either

58
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,680
Eat bread

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,080
If you don't eat, I'll pour you some coffee

60
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,159
OK Thank you

61
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,680
I've never seen this skirt

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,600
New

63
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,480
Not bad

64
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,120
Bought by Jinguang Department Store

65
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,839
It turns out that it is a woman who pleases her.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,399
I see you've been buying clothes recently

67
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,399
Is it with your boyfriend?

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,000
It's going very smoothly

69
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,279
He's not my boyfriend yet

70
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,360
Not yet

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,319
You've known each other for half a year

72
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,399
I think you often play together

73
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,360
Watch movies together

74
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,800
He's still old and go to your house for dinner

75
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,279
You did it for him

76
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,079
So detailed funding plan

77
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,079
Then why is it now

78
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,000
The relationship has not been confirmed yet

79
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,759
What you just said

80
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
It can exist among ordinary friends

81
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,480
Of course I'm in his heart

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,360
Definitely better than ordinary friends

83
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,199
Being a good brother

84
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,399
Why does it sound discouraged

85
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
This is not like you

86
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,920
I'll admit it to you

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,120
I used to be stubborn

88
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,120
I always say what to meet a good man

89
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,519
Just hold on

90
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,120
But I really think of this person

91
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,519
When it appears before your eyes

92
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,480
You think again

93
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,720
Barely meaningless

94
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,519
Just eat something

95
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,439
Don't eat it anymore

96
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,279
It's hard to wear this skirt

97
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,519
My sister called me just now

98
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,600
But I've scolded me so badly

99
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,879
I must let you out of the hospital

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,480
You see, let go of everything

101
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480
How about it

102
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,680
I'll treat you to lunch

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,879
I'm just right

104
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,759
I can't do it, I'll take a break first

105
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,120
You help me get that one

106
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,199
The air conditioner in the car is turned on

107
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,720
OK

108
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,160
I'll serve you

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,399
Do you think you're drinking this little wine?

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,480
Director Liu

111
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,240
Please

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,519
Come

113
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
I'll ask you

114
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,560
I heard you're outside

115
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,279
Some flowers, plants and plants

116
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
It's true or false

117
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,360
Who's chewing your tongue

118
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,319
Who asked me is not the point

119
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,159
The point is Jiali

120
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,560
If she knew

121
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,920
If you are not loyal to her

122
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,399
It's deadly to her

123
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,480
You should know this more than me

124
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,959
I haven't answered yet

125
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,120
You convict me first

126
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
How am I to Carrie

127
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,360
You know the most in your heart

128
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,319
Business Site

129
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
Drink some wine and sing some songs

130
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,000
Someone is looking for a girl to accompany you

131
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,360
But this is a social event

132
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,600
Are you making a show

133
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,079
Of course, I know these are all social events

134
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,439
So I'm not talking about this

135
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,319
What else

136
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,439
In Shanghai

137
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,959
I heard you and a young girl

138
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,600
I don't care about your words

139
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,199
Where did you hear it

140
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,199
I just want to tell you

141
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,600
The person who passed this is dirty enough

142
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,360
All right

143
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,000
I was in Shanghai last year

144
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,279
Bought an apartment

145
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,079
But this is an investment

146
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,560
I haven't lived in one day

147
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,439
I'm just

148
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,959
Rent this house

149
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,600
The tenant happens to be a little girl

150
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,680
Why did this gossip come out

151
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,120
Too imaginative

152
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,320
Liu Jun

153
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,679
Carrie is my life

154
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,679
The most important person

155
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,759
I won't hurt her

156
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,720
When we came, we were all water on the way

157
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,080
The municipal management network can't stand it anymore

158
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,399
How is your workshop

159
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,720
Our soaring drainage design

160
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,799
It is according to Donghai City

161
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,600
It's made of precipitation once in fifty years

162
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,120
Be able to fight typhoons perfectly

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,600
Ensure the workshop dryness

164
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,679
It sounds like it's not cheap

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,639
I've been laughed at a lot at that time

166
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,279
I'm a cement head for jokes

167
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,639
But time proves that I'm right

168
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Taste the new beans

169
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,200
Delicious

170
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,879
You say it

171
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,519
What financial problems are encountered again

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,759
Please sit

173
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,799
Look

174
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,240
Two pieces of land

175
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,279
You want it all

176
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,120
Your investment is extremely high

177
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,279
So I want to ask you for advice

178
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,080
Here is the quote for these two plots

179
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,399
This part can still be installed

180
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,679
Can't installment

181
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
You won't get a land certificate if you installment

182
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,080
With your company's current qualifications

183
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,000
You can't get a loan without a land certificate

184
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,120
The Science and Technology Park

185
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,480
Why is it so cheap

186
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,919
Have you found out if you've found out

187
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,559
Is there any major flaw

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,720
I've already

189
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,120
I asked my government friends

190
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,399
The reason for the low price is because

191
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,399
There are no competitors at all

192
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,440
Why

193
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,519
Look at this land

194
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,480
Two face water

195
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,080
The scenery is particularly good

196
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,120
But

197
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,120
The opposite shore is the main entrance of a temple

198
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,799
Local old sayings

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Poor in front of the temple and rich behind the temple

200
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,679
Now I'm getting land everywhere

201
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,279
They are all engaged in real estate development

202
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,919
Pay special attention to Feng Shui taboos

203
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,840
But I'm different

204
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,440
I'm the Construction R&D Center

205
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,000
This is what you want

206
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,679
An environment that can think quietly

207
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,240
If it is a R&D center

208
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,480
That's not just

209
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,840
The land payment problem

210
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,720
You need to raise additional construction funds

211
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,399
I've been doing these two days

212
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,000
Just like playing a jigsaw puzzle

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,039
No matter how you fight, it's a funding gap

214
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,679
Expert

215
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,679
Please advise

216
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,879
Tired

217
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,200
Something

218
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,039
Sister-in-law

219
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,720
You really want to take your kids to the United States

220
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,919
Is there any problem

221
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,519
I'm worried that you're not by my elder brother's side

222
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,120
Don't know what it will become

223
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,120
Actually, I've never

224
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,360
Really changed your elder brother

225
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,600
If you think there is

226
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,600
That's your illusion

227
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,320
Lin Chuan

228
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,919
Marriage is a big event in life after all

229
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,919
Have you really made up your mind

230
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,759
I know in comparison

231
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,440
Xiao Chen is a very ordinary person

232
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,840
But he has a sunny personality

233
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,600
People are considerate

234
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,600
Actually, it's more suitable for me

235
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,759
Choose a husband

236
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,120
Good people are the first

237
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,720
Then your wedding

238
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,519
Will Liu Jun be invited

239
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,000
This is the flying

240
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,399
Production arrangements for this year

241
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,559
Payment date

242
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,799
There is also an estimated plan for next year

243
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,960
The red part is

244
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,679
Must spend production funds

245
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,320
Do you think there is anything else you need

246
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,720
All that's enough

247
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,159
I'll take these away first

248
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,440
I've been a little busy lately

249
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,039
Give me a week

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,919
I'll make plans and send them to your email address

251
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,919
Thanks Thanks

252
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,399
This is a great human relationship

253
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,320
This is hard to get

254
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:09,840
Mr. Song said

255
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,799
Take off will definitely take a step forward

256
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,320
The road to government attention

257
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,720
This will give you better policies

258
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,120
But there will be more

259
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,960
Greedy eyes and twilight branches

260
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
He hopes I'm now

261
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:23,919
Just be prepared

262
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,799
How do I feel

263
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,519
You've been in a bad mood today

264
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,440
Is there anything wrong with me

265
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,519
I do have one thing

266
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,639
Want to tell you today

267
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,039
What's the matter

268
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,519
I decided to leave the Industrial Bank

269
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,840
A one to Shanghai

270
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,600
Joint-stock banking job

271
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,600
This

272
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,480
Why

273
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,720
ICBC is a state-owned enterprise

274
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,039
What a stable job

275
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,519
Why do you say that you give up?

276
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,519
When you manage the factory yourself

277
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:22,919
Don't be afraid of risks

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,399
Knowing to innovate

279
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,840
How did you get here

280
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,960
Stability has become a big advantage

281
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,799
this

282
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,600
The price of stability is stagnation

283
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,720
In the Shanghai side

284
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,159
Give me one

285
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,759
Very good job

286
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,840
Better development

287
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,759
Are you

288
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't want me to go

289
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,159
certainly

290
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,358
Of course it's your career development

291
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,358
More important

292
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
And Shanghai is here

293
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,400
Not very far

294
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:15,960
After the new highway is activated

295
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,358
Just three hours drive

296
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,759
Not much different from now

297
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,598
No matter how convenient the transportation

298
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:25,200
A longer distance

299
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,039
A stronger bond is bound to be needed

300
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,160
Maybe for you

301
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,759
Stay in this state

302
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,759
You're very comfortable

303
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,359
But I can't

304
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,480
At least it won't work after going to Shanghai

305
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,039
I'll leave first

306
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,519
Miss Lin

307
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,640
Good evening

308
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,359
Congratulations

309
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,759
Neighbors on the same floor

310
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:12,960
I didn't know in advance

311
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,839
You've done such a confidentiality job well

312
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,319
only

313
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,599
I happened to be on a business trip in Shenzhen that day

314
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm afraid I can't participate

315
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,519
Miss Lin

316
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:30,759
Can you allow me

317
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,839
Give red envelopes in advance

318
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
No

319
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,920
Don't you have wine at home

320
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,720
Have a drink with me in advance

321
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,480
May I

322
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:43,640
sure

323
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,119
Is it OK

324
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,160
Very good and delicious

325
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,519
Liu Jun

326
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,559
After that incident

327
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,759
Have you ever thought of taking revenge on my elder brother

328
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,960
No chance

329
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,400
That's thinking about it

330
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,039
No wonder my elder brother has been worried

331
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,920
Always beware of you

332
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,440
Beware of what I do

333
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,359
He invests in five-star hotels

334
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,799
I'm afraid you should care more

335
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,240
His own balance sheet

336
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,079
My eldest brother

337
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:01,920
I thought you

338
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,559
Just a white-faced scholar

339
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,359
Can't withstand any setbacks or storms

340
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,200
Unexpectedly

341
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,880
You can persist

342
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,279
He must be very regretful now

343
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,000
Don't say it

344
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,000
Why don't you drink it

345
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,079
This is a blessing to me

346
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,799
You don't want me to be happy after marriage

347
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,480
I believe

348
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,160
A girl as open-minded as you

349
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,279
The person you choose will definitely not be wrong

350
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,279
No need to worry at all

351
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:49,920
Come

352
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,319
Wish you a blessing

353
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm really that good in your heart

354
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,680
If it weren't for my elder brother

355
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,920
The grudge between you

356
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,119
Will you pursue me

357
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:10,880
Liu Jun

358
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Why are you here

359
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,519
Bingbing, you're right

360
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,319
A longer distance

361
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,240
A stronger bond is bound to be needed

362
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,279
You wait a moment

363
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,359
You haven't told me yet

364
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,799
How did you figure it out suddenly

365
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Unexpectedly

366
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,400
You and Lin Chuan have such a story

367
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,240
Lin Chuan just now

368
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,640
When asked me that question

369
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,319
All I think of is you

370
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,319
I've been thinking

371
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:25,599
If the same situation

372
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,200
It happened to Bingbing

373
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,240
It's obvious

374
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,279
The answer will not be the same

375
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,440
How do you and Lin Chuan feel in my heart

376
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,079
Totally different

377
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:50,039
I'm so afraid of losing you

378
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,599
I want to cherish you

379
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,799
in any case

380
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,039
Want to be with you

381
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,240
The reason for this feeling

382
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:02,880
What is it

383
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,079
Because I'm your financial expert

384
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,960
Because I cook delicious

385
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,400
because I love you

386
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,559
Mr. Liu swallowed two plots in one breath

387
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
Wait until this year

388
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,000
It must be enough for us to work hard

389
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,079
There's nothing I can do

390
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,160
The financial expert said

391
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,559
This is the most economical way

392
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,599
Mr. Liu

393
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,960
By next year's Spring Festival

394
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,640
Our R&D center

395
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,599
Can you move to

396
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,440
Go to the Science and Technology Park

397
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,599
It will take less than a year

398
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,079
I plan to be at the end of October

399
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,279
I heard of the new park

400
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,279
Talent Policy

401
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,200
As long as our employees

402
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,079
Enrolled for one year

403
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,039
You can have a city resident

404
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,880
True or fake

405
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,079
Of course it's true

406
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,680
I chose that land

407
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,279
This is one of the main reasons

408
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,359
That's great

409
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,519
You said we are doing research and development

410
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,359
Arrived at this level

411
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Who is not middle-aged

412
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,400
Let's take care of your family

413
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,480
Have a collective household registration

414
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,160
That kid can go to the good school district

415
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,279
yes

416
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:48,920
Give me one

417
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,359
Have been busy for a whole year

418
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,240
Finally, I can rest for a few days

419
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,160
You all can rest

420
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,000
I have to treat you to a meal

421
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Welcome to see

422
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,759
Can't stop until New Year's Eve

423
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,079
Are you the boss

424
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,000
The year is coming

425
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,559
The more I worship the gods

426
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,480
The last one

427
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,279
right

428
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,720
Let's walk

429
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:12,400
good

430
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,880
Who is the old factory manager calling?

431
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,160
Don't know

432
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,279
It's been more than half an hour

433
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Not finished yet

434
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:36,680
Anyway, it's like this

435
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:37,680
I'll call you back

436
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,119
Finished posting

437
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,920
Good

438
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,160
That's OK

439
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,799
Then you all go back to celebrate the New Year

440
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,440
Greetings to you in advance

441
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,759
Good wishes to you early years

442
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:48,680
Say hello to your family

443
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:49,240
OK OK OK

444
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:49,920
Go and go and go

445
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,519
Leave

446
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,440
Go and go and go

447
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,920
See you after the New Year, the old factory director Liu

448
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,519
See you after the New Year

449
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,440
Come back on time

450
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,759
Who are you calling

451
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,200
An old friend

452
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,078
Uncle Pi Uncle Pi

453
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,480
It's the New Year

454
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,559
I can't stop calling

455
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:08,480
Walk home

456
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,759
I won't go home with you

457
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,720
I'm going to pick Bingbing up

458
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,359
Then will you come back tonight or not

459
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:16,720
Let's talk about it

460
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,240
The fireworks are so beautiful

461
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,160
It's really good

462
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,319
Although this gift is old-fashioned

463
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,960
But I know to pick me up from the station

464
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,960
Worth praise

465
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,759
I'm sensible

466
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,039
It's OK

467
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,759
Director Liu

468
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,200
You're not going right

469
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,039
This is not the direction of our family

470
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,759
Stop pretending

471
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,759
We were both so busy before the New Year

472
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,960
Two consecutive weekends

473
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,960
You haven't even returned to Donghai

474
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,799
I don't believe you don't miss me

475
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,839
I don't miss you

476
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,480
And I finally had a New Year holiday

477
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,200
My parents are still waiting for me at home

478
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,640
I just picked you up

479
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,559
But it was frozen at the exit for half an hour

480
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,839
All feet are numb

481
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,880
You shouldn't

482
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:32,759
Reward me

483
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,599
Bingbing got up and had a meal

484
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:09,880
Don't eat

485
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,000
I finally had a rest

486
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,559
Let me sleep in

487
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Then you sleep for a while

488
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,440
Ice Ice

489
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,240
Are three enough

490
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,359
Enough

491
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,200
You didn't go home yesterday

492
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,759
I didn't hear it

493
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,160
Your parents call you

494
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,680
I knew there was a robber

495
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,720
Want to block the road and grab people

496
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:48,920
So I told my parents

497
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,960
Go back today

498
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,880
After dinner

499
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,160
I'll send you back

500
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,599
Today is New Year's Eve

501
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,680
You're sure you're going to be on such a day

502
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,720
Meet my parents

503
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,960
I'm kidding

504
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,240
We two are not in a hurry

505
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,359
Take your time

506
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,160
By the way

507
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,240
I made an appointment to go to Hongming

508
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,640
Someone also wishes New Year's greetings

509
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,000
They both have to argue

510
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,160
I want to see my girlfriend

511
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,559
Can you go with me

512
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,160
No problem

513
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,640
Come here Come here

514
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,759
Good New Year

515
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,119
Please come in Please come in Please come in Please come in Please come in Please come in Please come in Please come in Please come in Please come in Please

516
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,839
Receive it

517
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,519
Lose weight

518
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,240
And this one

519
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,200
Haven't heard of it before

520
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,799
No gifts can be given during the New Year greetings

521
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,440
Then I'll take it back later

522
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,079
Why are you so stingy

523
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,680
This one is

524
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,079
Formal introduction

525
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,079
Cui Bingbing

526
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:07,440
Qian Hongming

527
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,240
Shen Jiali

528
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,279
Have seen it

529
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:10,839
This is the first time you met Hongming

530
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,559
yes

531
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,400
Hello welcome

532
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,079
Hello

533
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,039
I often hear Liu Jun mention you

534
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,000
So do I

535
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,960
Liu Jun kept showing off to me

536
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,200
He has a girlfriend who understands finance

537
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,759
I've also saved up a lot of financial problems

538
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,680
Ask you for advice

539
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,079
This is the New Year

540
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,519
I've emptied my mind

541
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:26,640
You ask me now

542
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,000
I can't answer anything

543
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,160
Both of them are very stingy

544
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:31,960
What to say

545
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,240
Come on, come on, don't stand

546
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:33,880
You guys come here to sit

547
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,400
I'll pour you some water

548
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,079
good

549
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,000
Come and sit here

550
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:39,039
What about uncles and aunties and little peaches

551
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,480
My parents have lived there

552
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,319
This community is

553
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,720
They brought Xiao Taozi in the morning

554
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,240
I've been greeting my neighbors

555
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,559
It's quite convenient to move here

556
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:47,319
Come

557
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,079
Eat fruit

558
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,000
Drink water

559
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,319
How about your futures

560
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,240
You're welcome

561
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,119
Haven't asked for a long time

562
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:53,960
Well enough

563
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,240
Just want to tell you

564
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,000
After you exit

565
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,440
The market is very good

566
00:33:59,039 --> 00:33:59,799
This is half a year

567
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,160
Almost double the profit

568
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,319
Make money every time

569
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,960
I can't help but feel sorry for you

570
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,000
Come

571
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,839
Show it to you

572
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,159
My transaction record

573
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,000
have a look

574
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,360
Don't scare you

575
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,280
This really scared me

576
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,239
I've never seen so much money

577
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,960
No tuition fees will be charged for studying hard

578
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,920
Very awesome

579
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,880
Well enough

580
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,800
Bingbing eats fruit

581
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,360
OK Thank you

582
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,199
You're welcome

583
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,079
You keep coming back to operate

584
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,960
This wall is really creative

585
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,000
Did you take this?

586
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,559
I took it all

587
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,440
I also made an album

588
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,440
Do you want to take a look

589
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,320
Of course I want it

590
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,159
Your photography skills

591
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,239
I've seen it

592
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:45,360
I'll give it to you

593
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,159
good

594
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,518
I can't do this

595
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,159
Telephone

596
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,360
Director Huang

597
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,599
Good New Year

598
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:00,800
not busy

599
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,039
Friends are coming to your house to pay New Year's greetings

600
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,079
I wish you a happy new year at home

601
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,360
Thanks Thanks

602
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,800
You're too polite

603
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,000
I've seen it

604
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:12,079
This is so beautiful

605
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,039
Then that's it

606
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,440
Where does this look like a foreign country

607
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,079
What a foreign country

608
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,519
This is the beach west of Donghai Harbour

609
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,920
There is a beach

610
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,159
I don't know

611
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,400
I'll reply to a few New Year greetings

612
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,719
Hiroaki

613
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,199
I have a feeling

614
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,000
Are my dad and your sister?

615
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,440
In dating

616
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,280
They haven't cut off contact yet

617
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,199
It's too cold outside

618
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,360
You go into the house and sit

619
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,280
What kind of relationship are you talking about

620
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,679
This is impossible

621
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,079
My sister knows it very well

622
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,920
She can fall in love with anyone

623
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,039
I just can't go with your dad

624
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,360
I won't agree

625
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,000
What time has this been

626
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,119
Your sister is an independent adult woman

627
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,280
What does she do

628
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,159
Do you still need your consent?

629
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,719
Don't pretend to be open to me here

630
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,880
Who went abroad in those years

631
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,320
I've been gone for six years and never come back

632
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,159
What's wrong

633
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,719
Now it's an understatement

634
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,199
Be calm

635
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,199
I've experienced a lot over the years

636
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,599
I understand that one person will succeed

637
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,960
It's inevitable that something will come across

638
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,039
Calling helpless

639
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,880
We can't be the same as before

640
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,719
Imature

641
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:30,960
Maybe you can see it

642
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,079
But I can't

643
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,679
Those years you've been abroad

644
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,679
My sister's reputation on her back is a mistress

645
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,840
The whole family goes out

646
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,400
Can't even raise your head

647
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,280
Rumors have finally faded over the past few years

648
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,480
If they were really together

649
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,639
Isn't that true?

650
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,360
Who would believe my sister's innocence

651
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,280
You've reacted so much

652
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,039
It's because of this

653
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,519
Isn't this reason enough

654
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,079
It's not the same environment as before

655
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,960
A few gossipers

656
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,480
Say something behind the scenes

657
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:05,519
Is it necessary to care so much

658
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,920
You've never suffered such humiliation

659
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,440
You don't understand

660
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,000
Hiroaki

661
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,400
People always look forward

662
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,159
Something

663
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,400
You, I can disagree or support

664
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,760
But if you have to

665
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,519
Stand in the middle and forcefully oppose

666
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,360
Finally, it became a family conflict

667
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,079
I think it seems

668
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,159
There is no need for that

669
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,119
What do you think

670
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:10,880
sister

671
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,840
Yesterday, Liu Jun went to his house to pay New Year's greetings

672
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,280
Get me an apple

673
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,039
I look quite fresh

674
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,719
I'll send it to you

675
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,559
I took a look

676
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,159
Very big

677
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,639
Here I

678
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,320
There are many apples

679
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,199
Who to date is your private life

680
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,360
You don't have to worry about my feelings

681
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,480
Hiroaki

682
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,079
But let me go

683
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,679
Just look from your perspective

684
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:51,320
His Liushitang

685
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,719
Not the best candidate

686
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,880
He's almost sixty

687
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,880
Some people who are better than him outside are

688
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,360
You're not willing to consider

689
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,519
Have some contact with others

690
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,480
Try it

691
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,400
Really tried

692
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:10,079
But I don't know why

693
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,639
When you are with others

694
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,199
Always feeling very tired

695
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,000
Very tiring

696
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:23,039
Like acting every day

697
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,440
Only with him

698
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,760
I can only

699
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,558
Really relax

700
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,800
No burden in my heart

701
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:47,880
Something

702
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,440
Although it has been many years

703
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,800
But we can't

704
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,039
When it hasn't happened

705
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,400
sister

706
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,239
Our family has been doing these two years

707
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,239
It's been a little more comfortable

708
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,880
I don't want to add new trouble to you

709
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,119
But I really have no way to Liushitang

710
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,840
Get along with him like a relative

711
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,400
At least not now

712
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,599
Just think of it as self-deception

713
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,679
You let him avoid me in the future.

714
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,639
Everyone is at ease

715
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Invisible is pure

716
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,079
Is it OK

717
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,199
Those days

718
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,440
It's the two of us

719
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,760
Stand through together

720
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,280
Liu Jun

721
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:54,239
He and his dad don't understand you

722
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,880
But my sister understands

723
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,880
I understand

724
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:11,039
Come here Come here

725
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,119
Please come in quickly please come in quickly please come in quickly

726
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:13,920
Please come in Please come in Please come in

727
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,639
Good New Year

728
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,519
Happy New Year

729
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:17,440
Hello Hello Hello

730
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:19,760
This is my girlfriend Chen Qifan

731
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:20,760
lawyer

732
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,360
Partner of Pucheng Law Firm

733
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,280
I've filed a lawsuit, I know

734
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,840
Pucheng Law Firm is Donghai City

735
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,920
The first-ranked law firm

736
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,719
Miss Chen is really young and promising

737
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,599
No, no

738
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,760
I haven't sued, I know

739
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,280
Become a partner at such a young age

740
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,320
It must be very awesome

741
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,679
Two have been awarded

742
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,639
I heard from Liu Jun

743
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,559
Ms. Cui is in the new bank

744
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,320
Promoted again

745
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,320
I have a company in Shanghai

746
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,320
Maybe we will go back

747
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,599
All can have business connections

748
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,880
Then let's decide

749
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:46,239
I'm carrying a business card

750
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,039
Put my business card

751
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,239
To your Shanghai person in charge

752
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,400
Just ask him to contact me

753
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,119
Give it to me

754
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:52,480
Dongfu's legal business

755
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:53,800
All are represented by our law firm

756
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,559
What's the average

757
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,960
It is because both parties have intention to cooperate

758
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,400
Intervened early

759
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,320
If you are willing

760
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,519
Now we can talk

761
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,239
No problem

762
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:06,039
In the early stage of bank-enterprise cooperation

763
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:06,960
There was a lawyer involved

764
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:08,519
This is my favorite way
