1
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,997
What do you know

2
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,999
Who tells the truth in business

3
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,559
Anyway, do you know what I know

4
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,240
Dad, is this your thing?

5
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,799
Dad, please

6
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,520
OK

7
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,320
I'll get a small book in the future

8
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,880
Remember all your lies

9
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,320
You will definitely not forget this

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,880
You boy you

11
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:01,199
I'm here

12
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:11,960
Manager Qin

13
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,999
Director Liu, right?

14
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,319
Hello, Manager Qin

15
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,800
Mr. Liu just called me

16
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,079
Just want to arrange someone to pick you up

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,759
Manager Qin

18
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,159
Don't be so polite in the future

19
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,719
What factory manager is not a factory manager

20
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,159
Called Lao Liu

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,279
I'm all familiar with your factory

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,960
Come often

23
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,960
They all call me Lao Liu

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,360
You're welcome

25
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,920
Don't be polite

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,960
This one is

27
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,240
My son

28
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,319
Koyanagi

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,719
I've returned from studying in Germany

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,680
Hello Hello Hello

31
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,279
This is the sample

32
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:42,800
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes That's it

33
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,240
OK, come with me

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,120
OK OK OK

35
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,360
Korean workers

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,200
Come and take the sample over

37
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,200
Fill in the form number

38
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,439
OK Manager Qin

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,079
Wait for a while

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,960
Hello, Korean worker

41
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,680
Please trouble you

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,479
This is a bit heavy, it's a bit

43
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,479
It's okay

44
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:03,680
in addition

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,719
Thanks for your hard work

46
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,039
You are kind, you are kind

47
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,159
Do I want me to go with you?

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,878
Let's walk

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,599
well

50
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:30,240
Thank you

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,039
Ajun's size is OK

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,719
dad

53
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:38,879
Actually, you don't need to

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,240
I have confidence in my design

55
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,800
The performance of the product is certain

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,800
If you do this, let's know

57
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,240
Instead, it will become suspicious

58
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,800
I think there is something wrong with that data

59
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,879
You, you

60
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,439
Come and sit

61
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,559
If not

62
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,680
Dad really can't afford it

63
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
I really want you to fall a few more times

64
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:00,680
Memorize for a long time

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,479
You really think

66
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,520
I'm sending someone

67
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,599
Put a few data

68
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,719
Then get away

69
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,960
Not so

70
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,520
Things that don't work are not

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,999
No one dares to do anything randomly

72
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:13,879
No one dares to take this risk for you

73
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,039
Then you do

74
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,279
What is that doing

75
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,238
First of all, you need to go to the queue

76
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Didn't you hear it

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,239
There must be a number for testing

78
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,599
You don't have a good relationship with others

79
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:29,840
You really go queuing by number

80
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:32,000
Then we have to go until the year of the monkey and the month of the horse.

81
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,960
Right

82
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,760
In addition

83
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,279
Dad just wants

84
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,039
Let them test it well

85
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,239
Just use this

86
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,880
Ask to test objectively and impartially

87
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,359
The machine doesn't turn on

88
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,400
Fill in a few numbers casually

89
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:50,119
Send us

90
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,000
This won't work

91
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:52,560
I want them

92
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,080
Test it seriously

93
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,640
How is my son's level

94
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,760
Is it only like you

95
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,520
Will they do the tests well

96
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,200
Can you guarantee not to do this

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,880
Can they test it well

98
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
Bought all the horses

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,719
Don't worry about sadness anymore

100
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,799
Yes

101
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:16,239
What about Lao Liu having a meal

102
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,840
Mr. Liu

103
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,279
Lao Liu is a regular visitor

104
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,079
Koyanagi

105
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,679
This is the first time I'm here in our company

106
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:23,719
Yes Yes Yes

107
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,479
This trip is here

108
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,640
I found that your company is very large

109
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,479
And Mr. Liu is willing to use it

110
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,239
Our company's products

111
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,719
Your company is not only of scale

112
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,880
Very courageous

113
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,880
Xiao Liu can talk

114
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,599
So that's it

115
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,799
If interested

116
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,159
After get off work in the evening

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,919
I'll send someone to take you around

118
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:42,880
Visit

119
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,080
Very interested

120
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,479
I like to see the factory the most

121
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,279
OK, that's it

122
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:48,919
Old Liu

123
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,239
It's time to consider giving way to the successor

124
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,279
Yes Yes Yes Yes

125
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,919
If you want it, you won't want it

126
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,719
You eat

127
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,119
OK OK OK Then you can do it first

128
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:06,560
Seen or not

129
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
As long as you have the strength

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,359
No need for those evil ways

131
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,679
People will naturally approve it

132
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,879
What do you know

133
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,239
I've made an appointment with him

134
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,960
Meet alone at night

135
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,239
People are afraid

136
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,640
You guy is here

137
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:21,520
Can't tell clearly

138
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,679
Found a high-sounding reason

139
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,679
Send you away

140
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,119
What are you beautiful

141
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,279
I'll tell you

142
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,119
Strength is strength

143
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:31,840
The way is the way

144
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,080
You don't think it's a good match

145
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,279
But none of them are missing

146
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,599
Run out secretly this time

147
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,279
What excuses did you find again

148
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,760
Open and upright

149
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Walked out of the front door

150
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,239
My mother-in-law is here

151
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,799
Someone cared for Carrie

152
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,159
These days, it's delicious and delicious

153
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,959
After eating, sit on the sofa

154
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:37,359
Watch with them

155
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,000
"Hand Hand" (TV series)

156
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,520
Are you a little fat

157
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,640
Be fat and look good

158
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:46,200
Come

159
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,560
Congratulations on your first victory

160
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,560
cheers

161
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,640
Still decided to let the city go

162
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:02,440
I've helped you with OEM

163
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,560
I felt quite awkward at first

164
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,440
One is worried about imitation

165
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,599
Second, such a high profit

166
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Give up half of it

167
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:11,760
later

168
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:13,919
Calm down and think about it

169
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,719
It's useless to be awkward

170
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,960
You still have to find a way to solve the problem

171
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
How to solve it

172
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,359
now that

173
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,039
Breach of contract and imitation objectively exist

174
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:32,320
I still have to find a way to deal with it

175
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,039
This is the contract I have proposed for the city

176
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,320
I'm still willing to believe

177
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,159
In this society

178
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,080
More people who abide by the law

179
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,560
That means

180
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,519
You still believe it

181
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,040
The binding force of the spirit of contract

182
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,160
Of course

183
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,639
This basic trust

184
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,560
If not

185
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,719
Then this society

186
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,960
How can it continue to work

187
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,639
Look at my contract

188
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,160
Confidentiality terms

189
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,399
Anyone who is not allowed to produce similar products

190
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,440
Terms of Compete

191
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,519
How about it

192
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,999
Is it very perfect?

193
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,599
You thought you were holding this contract

194
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,599
Can you defend against Lin Yue?

195
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,879
Director Liu

196
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,479
Is there anything wrong

197
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,560
I just came back from Shanghai

198
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,840
Bring you something small

199
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,840
That

200
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,680
No no

201
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,920
It's not too late now

202
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Or let's go out for a walk

203
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,440
I know you like light colors

204
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,840
So it's special

205
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,840
I picked a beige for you

206
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,320
Salesman said

207
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,639
This is Australian cashmere

208
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,040
Extremely advanced

209
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,840
Shipped from the southern hemisphere

210
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,960
Come and try it

211
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:09,999
Director Liu

212
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,080
No reason

213
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,639
I can't accept your gift

214
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
Why is it for no reason

215
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,639
You're for me during this time

216
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,239
Running mortgage and urging loans

217
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,560
What a great deal of this

218
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,080
Director Liu

219
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,639
I'm taking a commission

220
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,239
Getting commission is one thing

221
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,680
Human favor is another matter

222
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,280
It's different, right

223
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,519
you

224
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,840
Hirohide

225
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,440
Someone helps me like this

226
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,200
I want to thank others in this way too

227
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,200
I'm doing things

228
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,479
That's the style

229
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,759
What's more, we've been so many years

230
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,160
We've known each other for so many years

231
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,280
You can't let me

232
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,160
This is your concern

233
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,440
Can't express it

234
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:52,800
Yes or no

235
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,280
Then how could I feel happy?

236
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,200
You try

237
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,840
I

238
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,080
Come

239
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,200
nice

240
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:10,800
warm

241
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,560
I'll tell you Liu Jun

242
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,840
I'll tell you clearly today

243
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,999
Find a city-wide OEM

244
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,719
You can only stare at it step by step

245
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,440
Then make the worst plan

246
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,599
Don't think you signed this contract

247
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,960
All are gone

248
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,080
In the eyes of Lin Yue

249
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,999
this

250
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,479
Nothing different from a stack of waste paper

251
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,879
You're too exaggerating

252
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,879
I've not only signed a contract

253
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,519
I also applied for a patent

254
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,200
Contract and patent

255
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,359
Double insurance

256
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,519
No contract is useful

257
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,399
What is the use of a patent

258
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,359
They are essentially the same

259
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,879
I believe in the law

260
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,119
If Lin Yue dares to breach the contract

261
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,719
I'll sue him in court

262
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,200
Liu Jun, what's your brain

263
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,440
You're really half a day

264
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Half a fool

265
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,119
You want to sue others

266
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,719
Ask your dad

267
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,440
If he encounters such a thing

268
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,519
He solved it himself

269
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,080
Or go to court to sue

270
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,960
My dad doesn't understand the law at all

271
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,359
He knows better than you

272
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,080
You should

273
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,280
Clearly recognize

274
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,680
You're no longer a simple

275
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,960
Senior engineer

276
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:25,359
You're dealing with businessmen

277
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
The nature of a businessman is to pursue profits

278
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,800
Lin Yue peeps at your behavior

279
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,040
How blatant it is

280
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,920
Did you forget so soon

281
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,479
If you want to live

282
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,359
It should be always

283
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,479
Be prepared

284
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,280
Can't relax for a moment

285
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,879
But how can I be prepared for it

286
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,920
I know

287
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,840
I'm always used to it

288
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,680
Use the worst malicious intention to guess others

289
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,800
So today I've been singing opposites with you

290
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,280
pour cold water on

291
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,759
But the human heart

292
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,999
Always yearn for light

293
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,719
I hope someone like you

294
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,800
More and more

295
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,919
I hope you are going now

296
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,840
Become a real future

297
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,399
Be prepared for the worst

298
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,200
Let's go on

299
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,160
Hope for hope

300
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,119
Respectful future

301
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,239
Lao Fang, your account is good

302
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,399
Three 8

303
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,719
Why can't I touch it?

304
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,840
Gagagala

305
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,639
255 Three 8

306
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,320
255

307
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,560
Added

308
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,560
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK

309
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,800
A few people have been added

310
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
Already eight

311
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
My sister-in-law has passed you

312
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,440
You'll be able to chat in a while

313
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,639
I'll use this to chat with her

314
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,239
Why where do I go

315
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,239
I have to carry a computer

316
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,239
Maybe

317
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,239
Your phone will be installed in the future

318
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,960
What's the use of installing this on your phone

319
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,359
You can't even type Chinese characters in your phone

320
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,920
If that happens

321
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:45,119
Can you send voice

322
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,759
Then call me

323
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
yes

324
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:48,680
right

325
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:49,800
Too

326
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,639
elder brother

327
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,440
Ogawa

328
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:53,519
Yes, Mr. Lin

329
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,280
That happens to be

330
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:54,759
You took your

331
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,519
OICQ (Internet Instant Communication) Number

332
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,238
Give me some

333
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,840
I'll add this

334
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,680
Yes, right, go to

335
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,879
Brother, I heard that Mr. Lu is coming

336
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,840
OK, go, go

337
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,320
I'll come I'll come

338
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,440
I'll try it

339
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,280
You do it

340
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,840
Tell me your number

341
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
I'll add it now

342
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,160
Is there anything wrong with Mr. Lu?

343
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,160
fine

344
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,840
Which contract to enter the factory

345
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,040
Do I have to let

346
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,119
Lu Guangfa took a look

347
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,320
National People's Congress Shareholder

348
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,239
Listen to others' opinions

349
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,440
Shiyiji has no flagship products now

350
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,560
Production plan

351
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,960
Never waited for less than two months

352
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,119
Now Liu Jun is throwing this big order here

353
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,959
At least a CNC workshop

354
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,280
One quarter output

355
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,080
Mr. Lu doesn't care about daily operations

356
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,200
There will be no objection

357
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,080
Is there any objection his business

358
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,560
It's my business whether to inform or not

359
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,560
Don't look at the factory

360
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,039
These hard work and tiring work

361
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,280
I'm staring here

362
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,560
Lu Guangfa invested a lot of money

363
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,239
Yes

364
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,840
That's the high stake

365
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,999
What major decisions are there

366
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,320
Don't dare not tell him

367
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,759
Little sister

368
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,639
That's how it is doing business

369
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,560
Or do it alone

370
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,920
Have a partner

371
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,999
That's a boss

372
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,239
You can't do it

373
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,759
Whatever you want to do

374
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,239
Your sister-in-law sent a message to ask

375
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,960
Will you go back for dinner

376
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,560
times

377
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,280
good

378
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,719
times

379
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,999
Mr. Lu is here

380
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,239
bring it on

381
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:37,119
Leave with the contract

382
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,079
Foreign businessmen I've come into contact with

383
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,358
There are also conditions that are particularly harsh

384
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,079
How to operate

385
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:10,679
As an attachment to the contract

386
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,280
But it doesn't matter

387
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,720
As long as there is reasonable profit

388
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,959
The profits of this product are quite valuable

389
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,800
The market potential is also very large

390
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,118
I just have doubts about these two items

391
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:26,000
Confidentiality and restrictions

392
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,599
The default content is so detailed

393
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,800
This is obviously guarding against you

394
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:33,919
He can write if he likes

395
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,800
This is the term of Lao Lu

396
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,679
When did you see it take effect?

397
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,439
Who is Party A?

398
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:44,679
Party A

399
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,159
How to say it

400
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,599
A scholar

401
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,240
His dad is a sloppy boss

402
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,159
The boss has nothing

403
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,080
Slips show that he understands the rules

404
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,520
On the contrary, the book business is more difficult to do

405
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,080
Sometimes this kind of person is rude

406
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,840
Not easy to deal with

407
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,439
What's hard to deal with

408
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
I'll stay with him whatever he wants

409
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,639
A young man who has not been beaten

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,879
How big a wave can he draw

411
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:20,840
I know you have a way

412
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,199
I'm just a reminder

413
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,359
This contract

414
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,959
Just do as Mr. Lin wants to do it

415
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,639
OK

416
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,280
you say

417
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:39,560
I'm waiting for Liu Jun

418
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,679
Put that whole series

419
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,159
All developed and started

420
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:44,280
Let's take one to count

421
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,159
What should I do

422
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,679
It all depends on the market

423
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:49,359
Look at you

424
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,560
You're like your sister-in-law

425
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:51,919
Just like to say something

426
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,599
Very correct nonsense

427
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,840
Isn't this market obvious

428
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,840
The Liu family father and son went out for a walk

429
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,159
Get such a big order

430
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:00,760
This market is not good

431
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,240
No problem, I'll tell you

432
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,560
What am I afraid of now

433
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Don't let me be here alone

434
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,240
Waiting for Liu Jun's full series

435
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,520
Then someone else takes action first

436
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,720
When we want to do it

437
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,439
Then all factories in the country will do it

438
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,679
Then to the end

439
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,320
You said I'm now

440
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:16,679
Just take him a condom

441
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,919
This profit is still

442
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,199
Very limited

443
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,359
Very contradictory

444
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:25,439
Big brother

445
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:26,760
Since we have

446
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,199
Have some information

447
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,280
Can this time

448
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,280
Develop other sets by yourself

449
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,439
What international jokes

450
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,119
Unless this

451
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:36,000
The person who does core research

452
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,959
It's our Lin family

453
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,599
I won't hold this in my hand

454
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,040
I'm never going to be involved

455
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,359
Is it good looking

456
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,000
nice

457
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,800
OK, little girl

458
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,359
I can't do such a thing

459
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,959
Spend millions of

460
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:00,520
Work hard to study

461
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,560
They spent hundreds of thousands

462
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,760
I'll poach you with the results

463
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,679
What to do

464
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:06,040
Am I a fool

465
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,439
You're afraid that others will copy you

466
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,159
But you're going to copy someone else

467
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,158
Such competition

468
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,000
Very low-level

469
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:15,359
Low level

470
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,000
What are the low-level and advanced money?

471
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,919
Then tell me which advanced one

472
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,280
Liang Sishen's kind

473
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,480
Correct nonsense

474
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,599
OK OK OK

475
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,560
You go back to the contract quickly, okay?

476
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,879
Go back to the contract

477
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:48,919
Send to the factory

478
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:49,959
OK Mr. Lin

479
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,599
You

480
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,520
get off work

481
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,760
Do you want to give it to you

482
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:36,040
Introducing an auto repair shop

483
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,800
Our car is repaired there

484
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,639
It's not me bragging

485
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,080
To talk about cars, especially German cars

486
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,000
The whole East China Sea knows more than me

487
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,000
There shouldn't be many

488
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:50,439
The auto repair master works every day

489
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:51,919
You just understand the theory

490
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,599
Haven't repaired a few cars

491
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,040
I'm not afraid of repairing it

492
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:56,439
Isn't the car just for playing?

493
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,199
Could it be that I still have to offer it

494
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,280
Let's talk about it

495
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,639
Who am I

496
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,119
How can you make such a low-level mistake

497
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,800
Is it your personality

498
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,159
Still someone from abroad

499
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,080
All are so proud

500
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,000
Don't dare to be a word pride

501
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,080
I'm just about the car and the technology

502
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:17,280
Can you have this confidence

503
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,800
To the person

504
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,040
Really can't see through

505
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,119
Too complicated

506
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,560
Actually, it's not that complicated

507
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,520
People suspect each other

508
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,119
Many times

509
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,199
It's just a mess

510
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:39,679
Yeah

511
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,639
Then I'll take it as my suspicion

512
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,879
Please answer me honestly with Miss Lin

513
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,760
My machining kit in the city

514
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:55,720
Will your brother plagiarize it in the end

515
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,439
This is just re-examined

516
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:03,959
Orders for this month

517
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:12,919
Such a big order

518
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,919
Why did the discharge leak

519
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:15,720
this

520
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,399
Reduce this item

521
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:18,439
Our department

522
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,959
Not to mention the evaluation this quarter

523
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,280
Can't even meet the standards

524
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,119
Do you understand

525
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
I understand I understand

526
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,720
This is indeed the following

527
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,199
No matter what you say

528
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,159
Have to find a way to make up for it

529
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,760
How to remedy

530
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,480
this

531
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,919
You are not the same as the city

532
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,840
Are you familiar

533
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,520
See if you can walk on the back door

534
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:37,800
Take this order

535
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:38,720
Crush into their month

536
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,679
Production plan

537
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,959
This may be still time

538
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,760
You can't control it

539
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:53,800
So funny

540
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,560
What do you mean you can't control

541
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,800
The reality is that not only you will encounter problems

542
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,240
We will also encounter it on a plane in the city

543
00:23:59,399 --> 00:23:59,720
good

544
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,199
Then what are your problems

545
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:03,800
Your processing parts

546
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,359
The day when the last process came out

547
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,280
Our factory

548
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,679
There must be a large number of technical workers

549
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,040
Poached by other factories

550
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:09,840
Isn't this counting

551
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:10,679
We'll take your order

552
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,439
Is it a joint loss?

553
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:11,879
good

554
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,560
Those employees who resigned and leaked their secrets

555
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:14,560
You can sue them

556
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:15,760
All are asking for money

557
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:16,439
One deadly

558
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,119
What can I sue them

559
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,599
Then the confidentiality clauses in my contract

560
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:19,599
Since you can't do it

561
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,399
Why do you still have to sign

562
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:21,679
Aren't you afraid of breach of contract?

563
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,800
Or you guys

564
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,720
Didn't take the contract seriously

565
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,679
Mr. Liu

566
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,439
My elder brother in hand

567
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,439
Not only the city

568
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,760
This industry

569
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,720
But he put his energy into the nearest

570
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,879
All are placed in the city

571
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,399
Have tried very hard

572
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,399
Confidentiality cannot be implemented

573
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,439
We are victims too

574
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:36,119
You see the problem

575
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,040
Can it be more comprehensive

576
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:37,480
No no no no

577
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,599
I think you need to know more

578
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,800
What is the spirit of contract

579
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,879
contract

580
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,480
Both parties who have to sign the contract

581
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,760
Strictly implement

582
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,159
Otherwise it would be a breach of contract

583
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:46,720
You're not reasonable

584
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:47,959
I'm unreasonable

585
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,679
Who is unreasonable

586
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:50,879
Since you have signed the contract

587
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,359
The contract is the promise signed

588
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,959
Conform to your own promise

589
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,119
Isn't this an adult

590
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,280
Should there be a character

591
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:58,159
You're accusing us of not keeping our promises

592
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,040
No character

593
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,159
Isn't it

594
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,800
Liu Jun opens the door

595
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,800
Here comes

596
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,599
Why did this point come here

597
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,480
Don't go home for dinner after get off work

598
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:26,399
Have some difficulties at work

599
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:27,879
Need a help from you

600
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,199
Change clothes

601
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:31,199
What clothes to change

602
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,080
Where to go

603
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,320
I don't understand your work

604
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,599
Need to borrow something from you

605
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,359
No money to borrow

606
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,959
Borrow your face to change clothes

607
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,679
What exactly do you do

608
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,280
Our company has an emergency order

609
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,958
I have to ask the city to open a back door

610
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,800
Add a plug

611
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,560
So Mr. Liu

612
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,439
Please trouble you

613
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,399
Help me and your good neighbor, Mr. Lin

614
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,679
Please, can you please?

615
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,159
I'd known I won't repair the car

616
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,480
All followed

617
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,720
What's your card?

618
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,918
This is called a rash

619
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,399
Sister, come

620
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,158
Come on, come on, come on, you first

621
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,800
I'll go through this first

622
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,119
Awesome

623
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,040
You'll pass this one first

624
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,359
Accompany you one by one

625
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,760
Is it so good that you are enough

626
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,639
You'll open the last one

627
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Play Lin Chuan

628
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,320
Don't want to hit you guys

629
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:36,720
Lin Chuan, you are the host

630
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,959
It's been this night

631
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,399
Don't talk or play cards

632
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,599
Who of us recruits you

633
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,159
No one asks me

634
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,599
I don't care

635
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,760
But you said you want to play cards

636
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,720
We're here

637
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,520
If you feel annoyed, we'll withdraw

638
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,119
It has nothing to do with you

639
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:05,399
I said I don't care about you quarrel

640
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,119
You still know something

641
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,878
East China

642
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,599
You have also studied abroad.

643
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,639
It's after you return home

644
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,520
Do you feel uncomfortable?

645
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,439
I didn't mean I've been studying

646
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,919
I've been on a tour for four years

647
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:26,760
If you really say you have any discomfort

648
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,959
Anyway, I don't get used to it

649
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,399
Who will mess with you

650
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,720
Is it us

651
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,040
no

652
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,840
Also a study abroad

653
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,599
I've studied abroad

654
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,080
Then I understand

655
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,520
I'll tell you

656
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,399
After studying this

657
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:49,000
More or less a bit sick

658
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,639
I think so

659
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,919
You have a big problem Dr. Liu

660
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,080
You're fine with Lin Chuan

661
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,199
What's more true

662
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,199
You can't develop a gentlemanly manners

663
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,560
Let some girl

664
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,959
The truth is not clear

665
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,320
And this kind of thing

666
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:07,119
Age and gender should not be distinguished

667
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,119
Treat everyone equally

668
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,599
It's the true gentlemanly

669
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,240
What's your relationship

670
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,399
Are the pros and cons of the debate competition the opposite side?

671
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:17,840
I'll chat with you

672
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,439
Why is it getting more and more difficult

673
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,359
Go to apologize

674
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,599
I won't go

675
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,919
Where is Liu Jun

676
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,280
You're so well-off

677
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,359
Life's big face

678
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,119
Entering society, I have to beat you

679
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,119
Is Lin Chuan your soul mate?

680
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,359
It's necessary to talk to others

681
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,959
Are high standards and strict requirements?

682
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,240
Yu Gong

683
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:39,679
She is your partner

684
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,639
For private

685
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,240
She's your next neighbor

686
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,040
Look down and see

687
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,000
You make this relationship

688
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,159
Get along more harmoniously

689
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,599
Is there any disadvantages

690
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:49,359
But the spirit of contract

691
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,000
Issue of principle

692
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:50,679
First

693
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,599
The espionage breach has not occurred yet

694
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:53,679
second

695
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,240
The root of the problem of principle

696
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,320
Is it Lin Chuan?

697
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:06,240
Go change clothes

698
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,599
Your neighbor

699
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,000
It's quite interesting

700
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,439
Tell the truth

701
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:12,599
Actually, he

702
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,760
The anger of disorderly competition

703
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,040
It's not unreasonable

704
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,040
Do you agree with him

705
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,720
Do you disagree

706
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,520
If you don't agree at all

707
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,240
It won't be awkward until now

708
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,000
Of course there is another possibility

709
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,800
You just don't agree with his point of view

710
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,159
but

711
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,040
Do you like others?

712
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:42,639
I

713
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:44,280
Like him

714
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:55,760
Who is it

715
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,840
Don't know

716
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:57,639
Good evening

717
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,560
Mr. Qian

718
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,919
Are you in trouble

719
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,919
Say those words in the database today

720
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,720
It's really a bit irritating

721
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,119
After thinking about it, I feel

722
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:18,919
It's me wrong

723
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,439
I should come here to apologize

724
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,560
sorry

725
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
You're here to apologize

726
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,399
Just admit that you are not right

727
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,480
Yeah

728
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,879
Because in view

729
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,840
I have nothing to apologize for

730
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,240
So many people enter society

731
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,000
All can learn to follow the crowd

732
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:10,280
Just don't want to fight reality

733
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm afraid I'll fall and my head will be bleeding

734
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:14,119
Why can't you do it

735
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,399
Maybe it's because of my personality

736
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,639
Too serious

737
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:21,520
Have professional problems

738
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
I don't want to give in

739
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:28,879
Actually, I myself

740
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,199
I've told my elder brother too

741
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,199
Such competition

742
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
It's really too low

743
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,199
you're right

744
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,639
People should still stick to it

745
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,800
Noble character

746
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,240
I accept your apology

747
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,080
Thank you Miss Lin

748
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,080
Have a companion who agrees with your views

749
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,359
I'm not lonely

750
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,280
What does it mean is almost the same

751
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,119
Ensure product quality

752
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:47,639
It must achieve the specified accuracy

753
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,760
This is the basic principle

754
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,679
I said, "Doctor".

755
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Are you a little bit

756
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:53,399
I've picked the bones in the eggs

757
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,240
I've been doing production for so many years

758
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,080
It's not that I don't understand

759
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,320
All the brothers under their hands have experience

760
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,159
Just a little

761
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,560
A little deviation

762
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,720
How does it affect your quality?

763
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,560
Shadow does not affect speaking with data

764
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:06,480
Have you read the results of the quality supervision random inspection?

765
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:07,800
What is the current waste rate

766
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:08,639
Do you know

767
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,919
Then what are you yelling to me

768
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,040
You don't have to bear the cost

769
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,359
But too much rework

770
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,439
What to do if the construction period is delayed

771
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,119
Anyway, this won't work

772
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,240
Workers are not in place

773
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,159
Must be rectified

774
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,720
Change it from time to time

775
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,639
You're right

776
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,879
Just change as you said

777
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,439
I'll go down and tell them to go

778
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,840
But the ugly thing is ahead

779
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,040
Once the construction period is missed

780
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:26,159
Don't cry for me

781
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:11,599
Big brother

782
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,478
What's wrong

783
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:15,800
Call me over on the big weekend

784
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,679
Didn't he have a smooth place?

785
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,679
What's going well

786
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,399
Liu Jun has started the first day of construction

787
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:21,998
Stayed in the workshop

788
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,359
Don't go home even after night shift

789
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,600
He reasoned with the workers

790
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,998
My voice was hoarse

791
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,639
Get in the car and go over and take a look

792
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,280
What car is there? No two steps to get on

793
00:34:30,438 --> 00:34:31,600
My sister-in-law said you're fat

794
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,359
Come down

795
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,159
It's really sleepy

796
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,359
Leave

797
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,120
It's not what he told them

798
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,399
Is that a reasonable person?

799
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,280
You've said this a few words

800
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,438
Even if the rectification is completed

801
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,639
I didn't follow your instructions

802
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,958
Then what's the problem

803
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:51,159
OK

804
00:34:51,518 --> 00:34:53,159
If you can't control it, I'll take care of it for you

805
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,518
My worker's turn is not your turn to care about it

806
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,078
Let's stop my subordinates from coming and going

807
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:57,160
Stop

808
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,840
Stop work

809
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,559
What work should I stop working?

810
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,439
No rectification is completed today

811
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:02,439
No one can start work for me

812
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:02,999
come over

813
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,840
Don't finish your work today

814
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:04,760
No one can go home

815
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:05,519
Why don't you say it

816
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,359
Come and have a meeting

817
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:07,640
What's the noise

818
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:08,959
I'll listen to you outside the gate

819
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:09,760
Noisy

820
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,800
What's wrong

821
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,840
Mr. Lin

822
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,200
Many problems

823
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:15,800
Not meeting the operating standards

824
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:16,840
There are seven items in total

825
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,559
I've listed it all for you to see

826
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,959
This goes on

827
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,760
The scrap rate will definitely exceed expectations

828
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,200
Not only will it delay construction time

829
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:24,439
It will also affect costs

830
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,999
Affects the cost

831
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,640
Not to be

832
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,079
You can't read

833
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,959
They'll mark it out for you one by one

834
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:35,680
You can't do it

835
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,200
You're here to have a fresh meal

836
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,160
Okawa, please notify the accountant

837
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,800
Everyone deducts a monthly bonus

838
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,519
All of you

839
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,840
The bonus this month is gone

840
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,720
Deducted, heard

841
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,600
Mr. Lin

842
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,280
I'll deduct you two months

843
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:53,959
Is there any problem

844
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,039
tell me

845
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,879
No

846
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,160
I'll check it again

847
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,399
If your pass rate fails to meet the criteria

848
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:07,439
I'll continue to deduct

849
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:08,760
Affects my cost

850
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:09,760
How much influence do you

851
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:10,800
How much is spitting out

852
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:11,760
Did you hear

853
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,559
Go Ogawa

854
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:24,879
Work

855
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,479
Slowly

856
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,840
Slowly slower slower slower

857
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:36,240
Does it hurt?

858
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,200
No feeling

859
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:38,280
Slower

860
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,359
The doctor said it

861
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,439
Expected delivery date

862
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,240
Not like an alarm clock

863
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:45,680
On time

864
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,359
Two days earlier and two days later

865
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,559
All are normal

866
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,600
Slow down

867
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,720
Come on and lean on

868
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,359
I'll peel an apple for you

869
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:58,999
You'll stop busy

870
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:00,240
You go to work quickly

871
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:01,800
Mom calls you if you have something to do

872
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,559
All right

873
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,720
The little baby is about to be born

874
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,840
Dad is going to work to make money on milk powder

875
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,280
Remembered

876
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,640
A few days ago

877
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,280
I'm on a business trip

878
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,919
I bought one for you

879
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,200
Lucky little hairpin card

880
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:26,479
Bless you to have a smooth and smooth life

881
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,399
Peaceful and safe

882
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:29,320
I'll wear it for you

883
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:36,200
Is it good looking

884
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,800
nice

885
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,479
Leave

886
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,320
You drive slowly

887
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,879
Hongming is going to work

888
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,280
I'm leaving, you're worried.

889
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:53,160
Don't worry

890
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,559
New card issuance

891
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,120
Is it good looking

892
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,359
Hiroaki's

893
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,280
Look at your beauty

894
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,359
The doctor said

895
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,959
The clothes we bought are too thick

896
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:10,760
Look at it

897
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:12,079
I bought two more

898
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,680
This one is a little thin and smaller

899
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,760
This looks good

900
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,200
It's too hard to take care of children at work

901
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,680
Hongming is so good to you

902
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:24,519
I said you just listen to him

903
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,479
Resign

904
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,680
But I've also been to college

905
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,320
I also have my own major

906
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,760
I always think

907
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,519
Just give up

908
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,079
What a pity

909
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,879
What a pity

910
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,999
You want to break out

911
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,439
What career can you do

912
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:43,879
The most important thing is to be successful in my husband

913
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,079
You take care of your family and your children

914
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:48,999
It doesn't matter whether you go to work or not

915
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,280
Come on, Dr. Liu

916
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,079
It works

917
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,760
You said I'll go to the workshop

918
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,280
Get rid of these people

919
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,399
Are you more honest

920
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:24,959
It really works

921
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,919
The yield rate in the afternoon

922
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,959
Beyond my imagination

923
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:35,359
But I don't understand

924
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,359
You said these workers

925
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:39,039
He's not from

926
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,720
I can't do it well due to my ability

927
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,079
Why can't they

928
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,840
Be more positive

929
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:46,399
Must be lazy

930
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,519
Come and treat the work

931
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,039
You said they didn't have any

932
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,320
Self-esteem and responsibility

933
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:54,600
This is not to be called or listen

934
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,959
Still in a wilderness

935
00:39:56,078 --> 00:39:56,999
Management method

936
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,999
It's not right for Dr. Liu again

937
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,959
But there is no way this is reality

938
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,079
Dr. Liu

939
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,879
Your knowledge

940
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,800
In managing these people

941
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,359
That won't work

942
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:11,999
Don't worry, I'm here

943
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:13,200
Take your time

944
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,800
Now in the eyes of workers

945
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,160
I'm already a whistleblower

946
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:21,359
The next on-site quality monitoring

947
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:23,600
It's definitely more difficult

948
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,519
You don't have to worry about this

949
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,079
Processing workshop heat treatment workshop

950
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,439
The three groups of people working in shifts

951
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:33,160
I'll knock it again

952
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,399
Can you be honest

953
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:35,320
How many days do

954
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,879
You can follow your own standards

955
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:39,160
How to ask for it

956
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:42,680
Thank you Mr. Lin

957
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,399
But I

958
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,320
There is another one

959
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:51,959
Things to worry about

960
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,079
What do you say

961
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,079
Don't know this processing

962
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
After the end

963
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:00,240
No chance in the city

964
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,359
According to the contract

965
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,680
Never imitate my products

966
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,919
How is the contract agreed

967
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,280
I'll do it

968
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:15,399
Surely do what you say

969
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:20,680
but

970
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:22,240
I think Ogawa may

971
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:23,479
I've also reminded you

972
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,079
if

973
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,079
The worker took this

974
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,359
Technical secrets leaked

975
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:34,120
I've no way

976
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,359
Do you know

977
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,760
After all, I can't drag people out

978
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:40,120
Beat it to death with a stick

979
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:42,479
Although the possibility is small

980
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,079
but

981
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,760
I have to wake you up, too

982
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,680
Then I understand what Mr. Lin means

983
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,959
OK

984
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,399
That's good

985
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,680
I wish you the next research and development

986
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,240
Everything goes well

987
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:10,840
I invest so much in R&D

988
00:42:12,478 --> 00:42:13,200
So since it looks

989
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,559
If it cannot be kept secret at all

990
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:16,879
Then the meaning of me continuing

991
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,559
What is it

992
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,720
You're not talking about this research and development

993
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,280
Is it your interest and ideal?

994
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:24,640
But my interests and ideals

995
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,959
Environmental protection is also needed

996
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,640
friend

997
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,879
The environment is created by oneself

998
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,720
We came out to fight.

999
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,039
What environment is there

1000
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:33,519
Since you have identified a goal

1001
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,240
You just do it wholeheartedly

1002
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,038
Persist to the end

1003
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:39,240
Will win

1004
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:52,959
This is the case

1005
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:54,760
Forty-eight more items will be available tomorrow

1006
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:56,039
You tell them to adjust the packaging as soon as possible

1007
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,640
I inspected the second and third workshops

1008
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,479
Discovered some

1009
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,479
Issues that need to be rectified

1010
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,039
Do you see if you have any comments

1011
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,640
You asked us to implement

1012
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,760
Don't dare to have any objections
