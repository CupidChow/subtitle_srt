1
00:01:43,598 --> 00:01:44,759
Then you're alone in Shanghai

2
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,039
Pay attention to safety

3
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,400
Know well

4
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:51,719
Ah Jun

5
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,439
Then I'll help you

6
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:55,158
good

7
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,319
Hello

8
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,079
Hello sir

9
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,840
Five points mature

10
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,840
Feifeili

11
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,759
Five-point cooked maker

12
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,719
By the way

13
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,120
Two servings

14
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,840
Two servings

15
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,520
good

16
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:17,280
vegetable

17
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,039
Vegetable salad

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,759
By the way

19
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,639
Two copies

20
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,599
No, no, no, no, no

21
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,800
A good deal

22
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,560
Thank you OK

23
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,039
I'm speaking Shanghai dialect well

24
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:30,159
Authentic Shanghai Lao Kele

25
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:30,960
Thank you

26
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,599
What does Old Klee mean

27
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,000
Old Ker

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,918
Didn't he say I'm old

29
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:41,879
Please help me take a look

30
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,960
One is different

31
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,039
A little lower

32
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,000
here

33
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,199
Lower

34
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:48,918
here

35
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,520
OK

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,319
good

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,240
Your dad retires

38
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,280
Life is so comfortable

39
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,840
Can't come and help

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
New Year's Eve is now

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,960
Didn't live with us

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,639
Are you

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
I don't want to be your dad

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,599
The feeling of loss needed

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,039
Lost not

46
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,439
I just don't know

47
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,120
What is he busy with

48
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,319
Last year, Donghai No. 1

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,840
The most tense and critical moment

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,800
Even you can't help but argue with me

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,120
He didn't say anything

52
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,039
What can he be doing

53
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,319
One is stock trading and the other is love

54
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:33,719
Hongming

55
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,199
Hello Hongming, you're back

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,400
No

57
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:39,800
I'm still in Shanghai

58
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,918
Go back tomorrow for the New Year

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,918
I'll ask you something

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,280
Do you have five million on hand

61
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,599
Five million

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,079
I'll take a look

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,079
Wait a moment

64
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,879
You have an urgent need

65
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,680
I only need twenty days

66
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,520
I have an old customer who wants to turn a position

67
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,400
Very stable

68
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,000
I just don't want him to contact others

69
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,360
Don't let me break away from him

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,240
If you can help me

71
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,759
Twenty days later

72
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,478
You can pay back the capital and profit

73
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,639
OK

74
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,759
But I don't

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
Five million so many

76
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Is three million enough

77
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,279
Three million responsibilities

78
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,560
It would be great if it could solve the big head

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,600
Please help me ask Bingbing

80
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,600
How to withdraw cash

81
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,600
No loans between legal entities

82
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,680
The check cannot be taken

83
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,680
Bingbing must have a way

84
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,279
The sixth day of the year is almost the same

85
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,959
Did you pick it up in person

86
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,198
Just right

87
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,040
You move a new home

88
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
I haven't seen it yet

89
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,079
Then the sixth day of the year

90
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,439
On the sixth day of the Chinese New Year, I and I were taking care of the children

91
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,720
Go and play with you

92
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,360
See you then

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,079
OK, then do this first

94
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,920
Bye-Bye

95
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,439
Big brother

96
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,480
You can borrow three million if you say you want

97
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,000
Isn't this normal

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,519
When I was the most difficult time

99
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,680
Hongming lends me money

100
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,759
That's so straightforward

101
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,920
No extra words to ask

102
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,839
And it's a friend

103
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,920
He's here with me

104
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,399
There is still a reputation of millions

105
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,239
His profit is high

106
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,800
But the risk is also great

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,199
He is not like you after all

108
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,399
It's physical

109
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,319
I've told people

110
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,839
Anyway, you can borrow it if you want

111
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,240
He's here with you

112
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,680
After all, it's no better than others

113
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,720
You're the best

114
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,680
Come and kiss one

115
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,759
You start

116
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,920
But I'll tell you in advance

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,120
I'm not trying to hide from him

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,959
I'm going to work on the sixth day of the Chinese New Year

119
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,879
Okay, President Cui, please be busy

120
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,240
I'll treat him

121
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,920
Can you help with some work

122
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,199
Come here Come here

123
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,439
Hang it

124
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,560
Where to hang

125
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,399
Hang on my nose

126
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,399
This is a restaurant

127
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,000
Look here

128
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,879
Walk

129
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,800
The lighting in the living room is so good

130
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,680
yes

131
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,680
There is also a slide here

132
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,279
The living room is so big

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,079
Going to play

134
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,319
Let's take a look

135
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,319
Playground

136
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,199
Slow down you two

137
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,480
One, two, three

138
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,319
Small bubbles slide down

139
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,720
Slide down

140
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,199
How did I design it

141
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,199
all right

142
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,680
Very detailed

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,680
Coffee is on the table

144
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,600
Thanks

145
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,399
Can you take a picture of your phone clearly

146
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
What about the digital camera before

147
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,159
The shotgun has been replaced

148
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,040
New phone N93

149
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,120
Three million pixels

150
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,959
Digital universal disc-level image quality

151
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,480
Professional

152
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,560
You can change one too

153
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,199
You know a new one has been released recently

154
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,279
Is the touch screen mobile phone?

155
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:51,839
I know

156
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,399
Very cool, I plan to change that

157
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,800
Can you understand without buttons?

158
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,879
You're quite professional anyway

159
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:00,800
Not bad

160
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,680
Be careful

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,639
Let's do it again

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,480
careful

163
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,319
The single-family villa in the Science and Technology Park

164
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,399
Big and quiet

165
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,519
Why don't you stay

166
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,680
Why did you think of moving back to the city

167
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,480
Of course I'm willing to live

168
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,839
The villa in the park

169
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,160
But she needs it

170
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,600
Contact with peers

171
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,560
Need to know society

172
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:22,920
We are adults

173
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,120
I can only feel wronged

174
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:24,879
yes

175
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,759
Is the beans OK

176
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,839
OK so sour

177
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,279
Just sour

178
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,199
The balcony is really big

179
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,439
Something is wrong

180
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,199
Carrie New Year's Eve

181
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,360
Let me help her

182
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,680
That I know I know

183
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,439
What about the money

184
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm just giving Carrie peace of mind

185
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,439
Let her feel

186
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,159
For this little family

187
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,959
Some contributions have been made

188
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,120
Make her heart

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,040
A little satisfied

190
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,439
Let it go there

191
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
You couple

192
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,079
I really don't understand

193
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,480
You'll understand first

194
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,839
Your President Cui

195
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,160
Don't understand

196
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,519
Dad is here

197
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,000
Can't hear

198
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,519
Double-layer soundproof

199
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,759
So advanced

200
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,120
Why don't you be bulletproof?

201
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,399
All three highs

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,159
Eat less oil like this

203
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,480
Snacks high in sugar

204
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,600
Tianjin mohua given by a friend

205
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,519
It doesn't matter

206
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,360
Ah Jun

207
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,360
I remember when we first opened the factory

208
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,600
There is a car parked below

209
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,879
And our cars

210
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,159
Look at it now

211
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:06,840
Not sure

212
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,279
Another one comes

213
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,919
I've never seen any car

214
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,960
You see, all new models are new

215
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,120
Almost full

216
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,440
Good home

217
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,879
Whose car is this 015

218
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,759
Better than my car

219
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,679
Our parking lot

220
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,600
All have been done

221
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,960
A landscape in the industrial area

222
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,559
Everyone knows Tengfei Factory

223
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,360
Business booming employees are rich

224
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,360
Ah Jun

225
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,439
What do dad think

226
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,519
You give this employee

227
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,840
This treatment was decided

228
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
Too high

229
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,519
I've been doing business for so many years

230
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,399
Haven't seen any boss like you

231
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,759
Give employees twice a year

232
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,840
Going crazy

233
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,080
What's the year now?

234
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
You still care about that little money

235
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,799
Really build a business

236
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,519
It depends on working together to achieve success

237
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,600
I've been in the past six months

238
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,720
Give employees a bonus

239
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,639
Don't mention how good this incentive policy is

240
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,080
You stop eating

241
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,799
You've all fallen into my floor

242
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,759
Anyway

243
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,679
Don't eat this after eating it

244
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,919
Anyway, now

245
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
Dad can't get it

246
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,679
I'll concentrate on it

247
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,600
Make my stocks

248
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,240
To Ajun

249
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,840
In our circle of speculators

250
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,039
Dad is now the Donghai Stock God

251
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,159
How much money have you made

252
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,200
Even speculators and gods

253
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,799
Please let go Please let go

254
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,240
Anyway

255
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,399
Show me

256
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,000
Work clothes need to be washed

257
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,559
Please see dad's account

258
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,360
How about it

259
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,039
Is Dad very capable?

260
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,639
dad

261
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,360
You're hacking into someone else's account

262
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,720
I have that ability

263
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,039
What other stocks do I have

264
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,639
Look

265
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,600
Calculate according to the proportion of the capital scale

266
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,440
Dad made money in the past six months

267
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,080
It's twice as much as you

268
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,200
Mr. Little Liu

269
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,679
Call me Liufett in the future

270
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,080
I'll tell you

271
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,759
Your dad will be a capital crocodile in the future

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,039
Tell my dad if you are short of money

273
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,720
Remember to turn it off for me

274
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,399
Haven't seen each other for only two weeks

275
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,720
Why did Mr. Sun gain weight?

276
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,480
Do you get a lot of dividends at the end of the year?

277
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,759
Eat so well during the Chinese New Year

278
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,039
You checked me

279
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,960
Sun Gong's dividend

280
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,480
Where can I finish eating alone?

281
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,840
I think I'm going to buy a house

282
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,559
You're really sure

283
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,279
I did buy one

284
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,039
Not bad house

285
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,159
Is that where is it

286
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,559
Just on the Yongjiang River

287
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,519
More than one hundred square meters

288
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,919
More than 10,000 per square meter

289
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,320
The full payment is definitely not enough

290
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,600
I got a 50% mortgage

291
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,559
After paying the down payment

292
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,960
I found a little left

293
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,399
I'll just throw it into the stock market

294
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,080
Try the water

295
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,399
Mr. Sun, do you also trade stocks?

296
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,960
Come and see me this one

297
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,360
Five-piece

298
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,279
Now it's seven yuan

299
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,399
All are here

300
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,840
President Liu

301
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:15,960
Sit and sit

302
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,799
Everyone looks good

303
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,919
It looks like this year

304
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,080
Have a comfortable life

305
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,519
Today is us

306
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,879
The first regular meeting after the year

307
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,600
It's equivalent to a heart-to-heart meeting

308
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,639
I won't decide on the meeting topic

309
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,639
Let's report each

310
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,440
The latest work situation

311
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,558
Luo Qing, you talk first

312
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,240
good

313
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,360
What about April

314
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,960
The Canton Fair is about to begin

315
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:54,559
Hello

316
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,360
This is Jiali

317
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,879
This is my good friend Chen Qifan

318
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,039
Hello Qifan

319
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,759
Hello

320
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,120
Qifan wants to see it too

321
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,240
Villas around this

322
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,120
But their model rooms have been demolished

323
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,120
I'll say

324
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,600
Why don't she see your house type

325
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,119
OK

326
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,200
Disturbed

327
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,600
You guys are so polite

328
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,000
There is a rare visitor to our family

329
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,120
No way to disturb

330
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,879
Please come in soon

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,639
Let's go

332
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:16,480
Where is the little peach

333
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,879
Taozi went to school

334
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,559
You just mentioned export

335
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,320
Now the Internet is becoming more and more developed

336
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,480
Exporting can also use a letter of credit to get a loan

337
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,919
That follows the trend this year

338
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,480
We developed it for Donghai No. 1

339
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,519
Robot project

340
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,200
Can we further explore

341
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,159
Export Market

342
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,759
I've investigated this

343
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:41,879
Our products

344
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,960
Not much difference with international advanced level

345
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,039
Plus

346
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
Donghai Group's experience

347
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,879
It should be very marketable

348
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,759
But this export is indeed my weakness

349
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,639
This exam-oriented education

350
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,960
I've learned mute English

351
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,919
I want to make up for it

352
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,799
But in this moment

353
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,679
Can't make up for it either

354
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,399
It doesn't matter

355
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,240
I can do this part first

356
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
My friend Mr. Qian

357
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,279
Don't you know each other, too

358
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:05,080
He is foreign trade

359
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,919
Old world

360
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,840
What do you don't understand

361
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,879
You can ask him just

362
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,279
After we get the foreign order

363
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,639
You can also hand it over to his agent

364
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:11,960
That's great

365
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,039
I'll contact him afterwards

366
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,840
OK

367
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,240
Mr. Liu

368
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,720
Since I decided to export

369
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,840
We can't call it anymore

370
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,279
Donghai No. 1 segment project

371
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,919
Give me a new name

372
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,759
yes

373
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:22,960
yes

374
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,360
Mr. Liu, please give me one

375
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,840
You can give one

376
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,559
Then follow us

377
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,759
The naming system of stoke

378
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,279
Call

379
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,200
F1

380
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,440
F1

381
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,360
Our series

382
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,759
Continue to research and development

383
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Then no one will come out in the future

384
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,879
Meteor Garden F4

385
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,840
Then let's work hard according to F4

386
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,440
Good F4

387
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,799
This environment is really good

388
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:49,960
fine

389
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,360
Very fragrant

390
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,960
Very fragrant

391
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,360
You said your friend

392
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,840
What kind of business is it

393
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,559
Do foreign trade

394
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,360
Have been doing it for more than ten years

395
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm afraid it's not just foreign trade

396
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,639
Are you still getting some loans

397
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,039
Water collection (intermediary fee) and so on

398
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,879
How did you guess

399
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,159
Didn't you notice

400
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,158
Residents of villas

401
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,519
It's normal to do a security set

402
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,960
But her one

403
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,360
Security system standards

404
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,360
Let me tell you this

405
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,679
If it's not because of a weak heart

406
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,440
What to be prepared for in a targeted manner

407
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,960
It is impossible for ordinary people to be cautious

408
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:33,840
This is the

409
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
That's not necessarily true

410
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,639
Her husband is often away from home

411
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,600
Inside this room

412
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,240
A woman brings a child

413
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,600
Be cautious, it's OK

414
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,320
It is also possible

415
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,759
Here comes

416
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,000
Such a big box

417
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,159
I've just come back from this business trip

418
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,639
What's going on

419
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,320
This is your money to pay back

420
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,679
Twenty days

421
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,960
Not too much a day

422
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,799
Why did you get my home?

423
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,840
What about Bingbing

424
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,720
Coax the child to sleep

425
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,720
Pour me a glass of water and I'm so thirsty

426
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,279
Give

427
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,200
Thanks

428
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,879
What is this

429
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,960
Interest

430
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,320
so much

431
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,879
Private lending

432
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,279
This is the interest rate now

433
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,200
I didn't give you much, either

434
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,640
It's only three million

435
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,358
Only twenty days

436
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,559
There is such a high interest rate

437
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,279
It's harder than me to run a factory

438
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:14,319
It's so much money

439
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,318
If you have plenty of money

440
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,680
You can also leave my money here

441
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,720
I'll do it for you

442
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:19,839
Now

443
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,720
When many companies have extra money

444
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,240
Do it in private

445
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,519
Forget it, I'll be more restrained

446
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,680
Be more restrained

447
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,559
Boldly enlarge your mind

448
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,159
Take off that F1 device

449
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,400
Isn't exporting agent?

450
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,079
Foreign manufacturers heard

451
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,599
Which equipment has Donghai Group used?

452
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,799
The order quantity is very high

453
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,680
I just checked the ledger today

454
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,759
Amazing total

455
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,880
Can fully operate the letter of credit to cash out

456
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,359
Borrow eggs by chicken

457
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,319
Just lending

458
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,000
Not a beast

459
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,279
So many years

460
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,599
How many companies are engaged in private financing

461
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,359
besides

462
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,359
I'm talking about exports not only

463
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,599
As soon as your Tengfei Factory can increase its production capacity

464
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,480
Demand for imported raw materials

465
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,559
Will be very big

466
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:05,680
Seeing these resources price

467
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,000
Rising straight

468
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,319
You've never thought about it

469
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,319
Is hedging in the futures market?

470
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,319
I've told you

471
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,039
As long as you can drive it

472
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:17,839
Letter of credit for imported copper

473
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,920
I know

474
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,039
The cash out funds are operated by you

475
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,279
I don't have to worry about anything

476
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,079
It can be based on the proportion

477
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,680
Get a piece of profit

478
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,160
You know everything

479
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,359
What are you hesitating about

480
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,920
The capital flow of Tengfei Factory

481
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,119
Always so nervous

482
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,319
Cash out is no worse than pure loan

483
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,519
And the price of raw materials in recent years

484
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,640
Rising all the way

485
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,279
Why don't you do it

486
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,640
The method you said

487
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,279
Of course it's good

488
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,559
But I

489
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,480
But he has

490
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,039
No extra letter of credit

491
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,799
The child is asleep

492
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:51,799
Got asleep

493
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,640
I'm sure I won't waste it

494
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,319
What amounts to take out exports

495
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,799
Issued his account and found out

496
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,720
Doing stocks with his dad

497
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,680
That's it

498
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:02,839
Hiroaki

499
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,880
If you want to

500
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,839
The three of us can be together

501
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,079
Since your dad is inside

502
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,680
Then forget it

503
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,000
I won't mix

504
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,559
Unexpectedly

505
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,319
President Cui has taken action

506
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,319
I thought

507
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,119
Are you not familiar with import and export networks

508
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,519
I just learned it recently

509
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:27,720
It's not too early

510
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,720
I'll go back first

511
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,480
Then I'll give it to you

512
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:31,480
Go away

513
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,558
Be careful on the road

514
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,319
Whether to make a letter of credit is a trivial matter

515
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,880
But you should really think more about it

516
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,279
Financial operations are carried out

517
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,759
You have to admit it through market performance

518
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,319
This inflation

519
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,480
Very likely

520
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,119
It's the reality of the next few years

521
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,160
The wealth you create

522
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,559
Have to think of a way

523
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,359
Avoid it depreciating

524
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,759
Economics is a big issue

525
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:09,400
Let's discuss it carefully another day

526
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,000
Walk slowly

527
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:11,720
Leave

528
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,039
Sent away

529
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,400
It's you

530
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,000
no

531
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,079
You can't tell Qian Hongming

532
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,000
Is that difficult

533
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,079
I have to come out and be this evil man

534
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,799
Hongming is also kind-hearted

535
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,680
When I gave him a gift

536
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,519
He also reminded me

537
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,400
Be careful about inflation

538
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,039
I object to illegal cash out

539
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,680
But he said the inflation view

540
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:44,720
I agree

541
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,960
A large influx of foreign exchange bets on appreciation

542
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,519
The country is afraid of affecting exports

543
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,759
Keep the exchange rate again

544
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,920
This wave of inflation

545
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,720
It shouldn't be stopped for a while

546
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,759
Your dad's recent stocks

547
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,880
Good returns

548
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,599
Don't think about it

549
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
It's definitely more profitable than running a factory

550
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,759
Now as long as it is an individual

551
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,240
It seems that you can make money by trading stocks

552
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,359
Global enterprises

553
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,279
It seems that they are all batoned by Wall Street

554
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,759
Being led by shareholder value

555
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,960
When I was working abroad

556
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,160
Those presidents

557
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,920
They are all technically from experts

558
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,240
Now listed companies in the United States

559
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,079
Just flip

560
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,839
Many CEOs learn

561
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,680
Financial or business administration

562
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,920
Enterprise value-added does not rely on innovation at all

563
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,720
All rely on financial operations

564
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,079
But in the stock market

565
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,319
Everyone recognizes these

566
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,119
Economic data that works

567
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,279
Too abnormal

568
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,480
Too in line with economic laws

569
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,720
If it really doesn't match

570
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,319
Why is the whole world doing this

571
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,359
And it worked for so many years

572
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,559
You ask me

573
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,680
I can't understand either

574
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,079
Or it's Adam Smith's

575
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,519
The concept is outdated

576
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:56,599
Or

577
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,799
It's not the time for the collapse

578
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,160
Crash

579
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,279
The global trend is improving

580
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,160
Our bank's forecast in the second half of the year

581
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,480
Continue to grow

582
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,319
You

583
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
It's just that sometimes it's too pessimistic

584
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,599
OK OK OK

585
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,680
Anyway, the current economic situation

586
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,880
I really can't understand

587
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
I'll gossip you.

588
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,839
Has Qian Hongming been there recently

589
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,319
Safety for family

590
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,640
Especially worried

591
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,759
It seems to be true

592
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,599
He asked me

593
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,599
About household sirens

594
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,680
But he has a high risk of lending

595
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,680
There will inevitably be some personal grudges

596
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,240
Carrie is so soft and weak

597
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,799
It's really worrying

598
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,960
I also manage loans in the bank

599
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,359
Why didn't I see you worry about me

600
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:49,680
how

601
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,119
Just because I am not as weak as Carrie

602
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,839
Why do you even eat this kind of vinegar?

603
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,839
I love to eat sour recently

604
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,240
Are you pregnant again

605
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,200
You're pregnant again

606
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,920
Don't talk to me

607
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,960
You kept talking to me

608
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,559
I can't learn it anymore

609
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,559
Mr. Qian, don't worry

610
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,039
I've sent additional security patrols

611
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,839
Surely not

612
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,240
Let idle people outside the residents come in

613
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,119
You'd better send someone to check it twice

614
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,920
This is a high-end community

615
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,680
What if there is a theft case

616
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,440
Not good for your property reputation

617
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,200
Yes, you are right

618
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,119
Go quickly

619
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,599
Is it still painful? No more bleeding

620
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,279
Hiroaki

621
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,519
How to say

622
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,799
The security guard has checked

623
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,119
Even if someone really gets into the community

624
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,559
It's impossible to enter our house

625
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,240
It's very safe here

626
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,599
It's okay

627
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,799
Hiroaki

628
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,680
You won't have anything wrong

629
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,400
What can I do

630
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,960
Don't think about it all

631
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,880
Once my sister got angry with you

632
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,200
She said you're too brave

633
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,920
She won't say that for no reason

634
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,400
Did you do something

635
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,440
Something scary

636
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:54,079
All I do is legal business

637
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,960
Nothing scary

638
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,279
Let's talk about it

639
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,200
There is no zero risk in business

640
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,880
Only through moderate adventure

641
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,720
Only by gaining profitable space

642
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,319
This is the norm for all business owners

643
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,680
fine

644
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:15,839
Hiroaki

645
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,960
You know me best

646
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,880
You know I'm not a strong person

647
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,440
What happens to our family

648
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,079
I definitely can't stand it

649
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,119
I definitely can't survive

650
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,599
knew

651
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:39,720
I'll be careful

652
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,559
It's okay

653
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,200
blueberry

654
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,519
Momberry

655
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,000
blueberry

656
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,680
blueberry

657
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,759
Mama

658
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,519
Male Blue

659
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,680
blue

660
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,680
Raspberry

661
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,599
Raspberry

662
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,400
blueberry

663
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,359
Slowly raspberry

664
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,960
Absoluteness

665
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,759
Oh my god

666
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,640
egg

667
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,920
egg

668
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,319
egg

669
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,680
egg

670
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,720
Very delicious

671
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,519
very nice

672
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,119
very nice

673
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,160
See what news is today

674
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,559
You see, too

675
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,960
Liu Jun

676
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,559
Liu Jun

677
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,160
I'm brushing my teeth

678
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,559
Come out quickly

679
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,839
Wait a moment

680
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,119
Dad comes out Dad

681
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,640
What's wrong

682
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,519
Dad is here

683
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,759
You see

684
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,640
Securities transaction stamp duty rate

685
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,038
From one thousandth of the current

686
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,440
Adjusted to three-thousandth

687
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,440
What's the meaning

688
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,680
The stock market is too hot. This is called

689
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,559
Negative

690
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,720
Look at the short term

691
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,559
It's a big bad

692
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,720
Today's stock market is probably a bit miserable

693
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:53,519
Hongying

694
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,200
Hello, are you looking at the market

695
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,440
Stop looking

696
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,599
Already like this today

697
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,960
You can't change it any more

698
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,240
Turn off the computer quickly

699
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,319
Beware of your blood pressure

700
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,799
You don't have to worry

701
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,599
What a bad news

702
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,000
A decline is normal

703
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,759
I'll tell you

704
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,160
I'm mentally prepared

705
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,359
Don't be in a hurry

706
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,640
I'm stable

707
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,119
You're busy with yours

708
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,880
Don't watch it anymore

709
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,839
I'll make you delicious

710
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,519
Good worship

711
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,680
To further promote

712
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:44,440
The healthy development of the securities market

713
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,079
Approved by the State Council

714
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,799
The Ministry of Finance decided to start from May 30, 2007

715
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,319
Adjust the stamp duty rate for securities transactions

716
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,880
From one thousandth of the current

717
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,759
Adjusted to three-thousandth

718
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,400
Is this a serious matter

719
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,480
Does it affect you

720
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,839
I don't trade A shares either

721
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,319
No direct impact

722
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,240
only

723
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,200
It's just that I have some clients

724
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,160
I'm afraid the repayment

725
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,640
Problems are about to arise

726
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,640
You see

727
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,240
Whatever you say

728
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,240
Mr. Gao

729
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,000
See, see

730
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,319
How many days of grace is fine

731
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,920
But it won't be too long

732
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,960
My funds are also tight

733
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,000

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,400
It's so low-key today

780
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,079
I see the brand in your hand

781
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,480
I only took two rounds together

782
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,200
I found out when I arrived at the scene

783
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,759
Twelve real estate developers

784
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,880
Not only do you seem to be sure

785
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,160
Others are not very motivated

786
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,759
We obviously can't fight

787
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,519
Of course, I can only run quietly with you

788
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,519
I heard someone say

789
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,880
Such a hot market

790
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,519
Your brother actually took Shanxi Coal Mine shares

791
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,519
Sold all

792
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,000
I took a few more mines to build nickel mines

793
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:06,680
Why

794
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,720
Did he listen to some wind

795
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,559
Many of my brother's thoughts

796
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,920
Never tell me

797
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,480
When my sister-in-law is here

798
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,799
Will discuss with my sister-in-law

799
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,799
As for now

800
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:20,680
I don't know either

801
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:23,960
Your brother is very mysterious

802
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,519
You only knew

803
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,200
Let's go first

804
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,039
goodbye

805
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,599
Mr. Lu

806
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,480
Kobayashi

807
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,240
Long time no see

808
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,440
I'll ask your brother to sit together one another day

809
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,880
Good Mr. Lu, I'll invite you someday

810
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:42,720
good

811
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,640
Then I'll leave first

812
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,079
Ten,3800 yuan

813
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,680
Is this floor price too high

814
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,480
You're a little fierce today

815
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,559
You really don't have to worry about this

816
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,680
I've been researching it lately

817
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,039
Urban development direction

818
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,880
This No. 3 parcel

819
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,559
It's a unique plot

820
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,559
Wait for October 1st

821
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,719
After the Property Law comes into effect

822
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,880
The demolition costs in the old city will be higher

823
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,800
The government is more willing to build a new city

824
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,000
Instead of demolishing the old city

825
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,039
This means

826
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,119
Land in the old town

827
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,920
It will be an extremely scarce resource

828
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,719
Scarcity is the greatest value

829
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,599
We already have it now

830
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,960
Thirteen percent of the East China Sea

831
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,719
Land reserves

832
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,280
Take this land king again today

833
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,960
When selling prices are set in the future

834
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,400
We will have a greater say

835
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,559
From a long-term perspective

836
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,840
All benefits are harmless

837
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,559
Mr. Luo is back

838
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,039
Luo Qing

839
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,519
Mr. Liu

840
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,239
It's stock again

841
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,239
Didn't this just get off the plane?

842
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,159
Just watch it for a while

843
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,960
Now I see the K-line chart

844
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:10,800
I'll be angry

845
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,280
Workshop schedule

846
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,079
Everyone rushes to avoid the night shift

847
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,079
For fear of affecting the market during the day

848
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,440
And how can you connect with you now

849
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,679
All started to trade stocks in a crazy way

850
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,280
This atmosphere of stock trading for the whole nation

851
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,000
Is it normal?

852
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,840
Stop being angry, boss

853
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,960
Look, I never delay my work

854
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,760
I'm just watching it on the road as a pastime

855
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,599
pastime

856
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,760
You don't know

857
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,239
Our factory is nothing

858
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,679
My father-in-law and mother-in-law and their unit

859
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,719
And my wife and their department

860
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,119
That's why the fry is so great

861
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Every morning at 9:30

862
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,719
Until 3:00 pm

863
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,920
Watch the trends in front of the computer

864
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,159
Even not long ago

865
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,280
That five-three zero big drop

866
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,880
Not extinguished

867
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,079
This is the enthusiasm of the whole people to trade stocks

868
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,039
Have you finished speaking

869
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,000
It's finished

870
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,960
After saying that, change your clothes and eat

871
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,039
OK

872
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,960
Don't be angry

873
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,599
A piece

874
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,679
See you in the cafeteria later

875
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,480
OK

876
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,960
I'm going to Beijing this time

877
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,519
I've been with the customer

878
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,480
Set the quantity

879
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,480
But when signing the contract

880
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,559
Suddenly, three hundred more sets were added

881
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,400
Come

882
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,159
Said it was made for the coal mine

883
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,239
What's the follow-up

884
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,960
Also, you have to keep an eye on chasing

885
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,480
There is no other reason

886
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,400
These requirements

887
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,880
They all exist in reality

888
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,800
The economic situation is so hot

889
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:37,199
Mr. Liu

890
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,480
The company's production capacity

891
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,360
It has now been enlarged to the limit

892
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:43,159
The staff went down in three shifts

893
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
Machine rotation

894
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:46,760
Then the orders are still endless

895
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,440
Want to break through the bottleneck of productivity

896
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,960
Follow the market demand

897
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,719
Then it must be expanded

898
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,599
Upgrade production capacity

899
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,960
Have encountered this problem before

900
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,679
All are short of money

901
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,400
Our F1 equipment is now profitable

902
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,639
No shortage of money

903
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,760
I'm a little worried

904
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:08,719
Our expansion

905
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,559
Would it be too radical

906
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:09,760
Would it be too radical

907
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,000
You see

908
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,840
You won't let me tell you about stocks

909
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,400
But I just want to talk about stocks

910
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,599
The current market situation

911
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,079
Same as the stock market

912
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,320
Watching the curve rise

913
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,599
You're willing to let this go

914
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,880
Is it a great time to make money

915
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,280
So everyone goes to stocks

916
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,840
The market capacity is so large

917
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,400
We're conservative

918
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,159
There will be a large number of people joining in

919
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:33,480
Be a familiar customer

920
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,679
Give it to someone else

921
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,320
Want to regain the future

922
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,880
Then you have to spend more money

923
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:40,920
Have you ever thought about it

924
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,559
One question

925
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:43,800
Currently this

926
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,280
The sudden amplification of demand in the market

927
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,519
Is it true or not

928
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,039
Can it last

929
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,320
If so

930
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,039
What is the reason for it to continue

931
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,960
How long can it last?

932
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,719
I believe it

933
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,320
The market has the ability to self-regulate

934
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,559
Near the saturation point

935
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,960
It will slow down on its own

936
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,559
We are manufacturing

937
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,320
Far from speculators

938
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,559
It's unlikely that

939
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:18,840
The phenomenon of ups and downs

940
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,199
Let's take a step back

941
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,480
Existing old customers

942
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,679
We have to meet the demand for growth

943
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,679
So in my opinion

944
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,360
This is not radical

945
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,880
But at least

946
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,159
The most conservative approach

947
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,000
It's strange to say

948
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,280
It's obviously caught up

949
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,559
Such a good era

950
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,079
In my heart

951
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,000
Instead, it's not stable

952
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,599
Mr. Liu

953
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,760
Then we will hold a shareholders' meeting tomorrow

954
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,760
Let everyone discuss and discuss

955
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'll fly to Guangzhou in a while

956
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:52,639
You forgot

957
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:54,360
Lu Huadong introduced me

958
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,320
Two foreign businessmen

959
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,480
At least half a month no time

960
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,400
Then we can use the company's email address

961
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,320
Collect opinions

962
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,920
There are still people going with the flow at the conference

963
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,639
Written comments submitted separately

964
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,800
It's more real

965
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,239
All right

966
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,599
I'm trying to jump out of our circle

967
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:21,760
Don't look at the business for now

968
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,559
Don't look at the order

969
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,000
Don't look at stocks

970
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:26,239
Explore it

971
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,679
The most essential economic life

972
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,159
Early in the year

973
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,440
Pork prices are the fuse

974
00:39:32,198 --> 00:39:33,079
Consumer Prices

975
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,280
An unexpected emerged

976
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,159
A sharp rise

977
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,199
Although the country has introduced a series of

978
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,719
Measures to ensure stable supply prices

979
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,719
But some important livelihood products

980
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,360
Prices rise

981
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,639
Impact on low-income families

982
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,559
Still very big

983
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
It has been sent out above

984
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,679
Preventing economic overheating signals

985
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,079
When the turning point arrives

986
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,480
What situation will the company face

987
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
Current comprehensive prosperity

988
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,679
It's a mirage

989
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,840
Still a reality with foundation

990
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:15,039
What to write

991
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,119
Family livelihood

992
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,039
You want to choose a NPC representative

993
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,840
Serious

994
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,079
You're doing economics

995
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,280
I want to hear your opinion

996
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,239
You have this point of view

997
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,519
Something makes sense

998
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,400
But it's still too pessimistic

999
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,639
Just today

1000
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,920
I just took it

1001
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,519
A land king in the city center

1002
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,480
Floor price 13,800

1003
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,719
This is not going to catch up

1004
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,320
Is the price of existing houses in the city?

1005
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,920
So what?

1006
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,239
Since the hot economic situation

1007
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,559
Give me plenty of funds

1008
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,360
Why don't I take advantage of the situation and make a move

1009
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,159
Hold the chips in your own hands

1010
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,039
In this world

1011
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:17,079
Even if there is more excess production capacity

1012
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,639
Top ones are always scarce

1013
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:22,039
Then scarcity is the guarantee of value-added

1014
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,559
Didn't you say this to me

1015
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,679
Your land king might say that

1016
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:36,159
But my heat treatment center

1017
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,800
Not the same thing at all

1018
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:39,840
Liu Jun

1019
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,000
At the lowest point before

1020
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,679
Your technological advancement in taking off

1021
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,000
All have absolute confidence

1022
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,119
Why is the current economic situation

1023
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:48,920
Better getting better

1024
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,280
You're guilty

1025
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,119
I don't know either

1026
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,599
Maybe I'm thinking too much

1027
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,840
I don't understand

1028
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,880
Orders are now piled up

1029
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,440
It will only be more and more in the future

1030
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,960
How can you not eat enough

1031
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,519
I don't understand this

1032
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:18,800
Let's talk privately

1033
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:23,440
Say it privately

1034
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,719
Do you think

1035
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,760
There are problems with the business focus of President Liu

1036
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:30,960
Initial

1037
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:33,000
When developing this F1

1038
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,639
That risk is no greater than now

1039
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,679
Haven't seen him hesitate so much

1040
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,480
Now

1041
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,800
Requirements for expanding heat treatment centers

1042
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,960
Already in front of you

1043
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,239
Why are you afraid of this and that

1044
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,440
Fear of wolves in front and tigers in the back

1045
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,079
I think

1046
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,440
This is focusing on research and development rather than production

1047
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,559
Can't say that

1048
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:49,239
this

1049
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
R&D F1

1050
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:51,960
That's Tengfei Factory

1051
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,400
The key to whether you can continue to survive

1052
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,280
Not the same as now

1053
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:57,400
and

1054
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,519
After a big bet

1055
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,639
Mr. Liu's mentality has begun to turn conservative

1056
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:03,119
I can understand this

1057
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,840
You understand

1058
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,599
I don't understand
