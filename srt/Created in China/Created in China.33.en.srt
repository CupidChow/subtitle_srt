1
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,000
Liu Jun

2
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,239
Before

3
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
When the pressure is the most

4
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:53,959
I've scolded Hongming

5
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:56,039
I asked him

6
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,039
Why do you want to bet

7
00:01:58,158 --> 00:01:59,400
Don't leave yourself a way out

8
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,840
I understand now

9
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,480
turn out to be

10
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,759
You're the way he left behind

11
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,079
Let's go

12
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:28,919
Officer Sun

13
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,719
What do you think is necessary

14
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,120
I have to stay here

15
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,240
I'm not familiar with this house

16
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,639
What do you ask for?

17
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,478
I don't know either

18
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,719
Feel sorry

19
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,478
Know that Mr. Liu is an entrepreneur

20
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,199
Busy work

21
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,680
I'll get my colleagues to speed up

22
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,079
Please understand more

23
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:47,680
All right

24
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,280
Hello

25
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,719
Liu Jun

26
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,719
It's me

27
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,279
Hello Hello Hello

28
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,120
Do you know now

29
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,399
Are there police around you

30
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,560
You know you've called

31
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,839
you

32
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,199
Do you want to surrender?

33
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,240
Give the phone to the police

34
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,639
I'll tell them

35
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,639
Hello

36
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,360
Mr. Qian

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,800
This Liu Jun is in contact

38
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
What kind of friends are they

39
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,560
Illegal fundraising and money running away

40
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,120
Don't he know how many people he has harmed

41
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,480
Qian Hongming

42
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,360
It's just that the investment failed

43
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,000
Not what you thought

44
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,519
Don't argue with me

45
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,319
Scam money and force life to death

46
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,560
Isn't this a fact

47
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Don't worry

48
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,600
Liu Jun and I

49
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,120
It's within the scope of the law

50
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,920
Have fulfilled the friendship that friends should do

51
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,959
We dare not do it

52
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Things that violate laws and regulations

53
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,439
Thanks to you,

54
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,399
There is no need for me to destroy my relatives for justice

55
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,920
The suspect has pleaded guilty

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
But he refused to surrender

57
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,319
He's going to talk to you now

58
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,639
Try to persuade him

59
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,639
This is not a death sentence

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,680
There is no need to commit suicide

61
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,759
Qian Hongming What do you want to do

62
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,040
You have a wife and a child

63
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,839
You're only thirty-nine years old

64
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,800
what are you up to

65
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,519
I'm the main culprit

66
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,079
As long as the main culprit dies

67
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,040
Other small characters don't matter

68
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,800
This case will be concluded soon

69
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:22,920
Hiroaki

70
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:23,680
The police officer just now

71
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,360
They investigated

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Not only your case

73
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,720
You can provide

74
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,399
Information and records related to the case

75
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,160
These are all

76
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,040
Evidence of applying for leniency

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,639
All can be punished and made meritorious

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,639
I know what you said

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,720
But I'm on my hands

80
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,399
No critical information

81
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,439
That post

82
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,680
That's all I know

83
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,759
I can't make a contribution

84
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,480
Can't reveal more

85
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,639
Then what do you want to do

86
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,040
Don't be stupid

87
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,399
I can hire a lawyer for you

88
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,680
Those accounts

89
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,519
Can raise funds slowly

90
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,279
Slowly

91
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,000
right

92
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,920
You can fight the lawsuit slowly

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
The money can be paid back slowly

94
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,680
All can be solved slowly

95
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,360
There is always a solution to things

96
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,078
You don't have to do this

97
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,360
What is the solution to the end

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,959
Don't I still have to go to jail

99
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,879
Yes, even if it is

100
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,519
That

101
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,600
That would definitely not be a death sentence.

102
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Why don't you surrender

103
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,680
I will never surrender.

104
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,120
My sin

105
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,959
It will take twenty years to sentence

106
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,800
For such a long time

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,759
I'm going to wear a prison clothes

108
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,920
Living a life without dignity

109
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,839
When you come out

110
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm almost sixty years old

111
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,040
You let me go back to the past

112
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Go back to the days that were before

113
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,800
Start over?

114
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,680
I don't want to live like that

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,319
No matter how you want to live

116
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,759
You have to survive first, too

117
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,759
I don't want to survive

118
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,279
I don't want to survive

119
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,040
Don't you understand what I said

120
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,399
I can't choose

121
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
The era in which I live

122
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,519
The only option I can choose

123
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,839
It's how to respond to it

124
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,399
This is my response

125
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,199
You can start over

126
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,959
I can help you start over

127
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,560
I don't want to start over

128
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,279
Is this my responsibility?

129
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,399
You don't have to do this

130
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,639
I can hire a lawyer for you

131
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,560
If I don't do this

132
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,480
I don't know how to solve this

133
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,680
I can

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,839
I can sell factories and houses

135
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,519
I know a lot of rich people

136
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,560
It can always pay off this money

137
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,319
It's not worth it if you pay your life

138
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,079
You still have hope

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,639
You still have hope

140
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,199
hope

141
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,600
Just let others take action

142
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,519
I don't want to do this anymore

143
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,000
Added to someone else

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,879
No matter you

145
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,320
Or anyone

146
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,039
I'll miss you

147
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,039
Farewell forever

148
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,519
Officer Sun

149
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,759
Found

150
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,480
Found

151
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,120
Can I go and see him

152
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,279
No need

153
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,399
You're still in the funeral home

154
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,639
See him for the last time

155
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,039
Hongming is a decent person

156
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,440
He certainly doesn't want you

157
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,039
See what he is now

158
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,799
Officer Sun

159
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,600
The person has left

160
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,679
Can he let his wife and sister

161
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,879
Let's go out to cook the next thing

162
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,679
See you for the last time

163
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,519
From the overall perspective of the case

164
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,000
Parts related to Qian Hongming

165
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,000
Not complicated

166
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,200
Two families want to apply for bail pending trial

167
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
It is also possible

168
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,919
You ask the lawyer

169
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,120
good

170
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,840
Thank you Officer Sun

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,639
You're welcome

172
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,240
Officer Sun invites you

173
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,879
receive

174
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:20,759
I'll come here now

175
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,080
Thanks for your hard work

176
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,600
This community

177
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,000
It is the dormitory of the Port Authority

178
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,799
Catched up with the first batch of house renovations

179
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,039
I've found someone

180
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,519
According to internal cost price

181
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,159
Bought it

182
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
A square meter is less than a thousand dollars

183
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,720
You're among our classmates

184
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,639
The first one to buy a house

185
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,600
There are quite a few who have divided the rooms

186
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,519
I'm indeed the first one to buy a house

187
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,919
Come and take a look

188
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,120
See how our yard is like

189
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,240
There is also a large sky garden.

190
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,519
My wife learned design

191
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,159
These are here

192
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,080
This is all her work

193
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,120
And this sun room

194
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,159
Look here

195
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,080
Does it look like Monet's garden

196
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,759
Come on

197
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,720
You have no water here

198
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,000
Still so good at talking

199
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,360
Don't worry soon

200
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,360
dad

201
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,639
Hirohide

202
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,480
Please trouble you

203
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,279
fine

204
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,240
Where is Carrie

205
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,600
Can't she be released on bail?

206
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,120
The police notified her

207
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
News from Qian Hongming

208
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
She can't accept it

209
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,039
Sent to the hospital after a mental breakdown

210
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,919
Hiroaki

211
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,360
Why did she come back

212
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,679
Why did she come back

213
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,759
Uncle and aunt

214
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,598
Liu Jun

215
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,759
you

216
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,480
Get some fruit

217
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,440
Thank you

218
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,720
Aunt

219
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,358
Carrie hasn't woken up yet

220
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,400
In the morning

221
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,200
woke up

222
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,680
Later, his sister Hongming came

223
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,920
Calling her a damnation

224
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,319
Carrie cried and shouted

225
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,920
Have to go find Hongming

226
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,200
This is Hongming's suicide note

227
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
You waited for her to wake up

228
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,319
Show it to her

229
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,960
What's wrong

230
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,359
Come on, let me see

231
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,000
What's wrong

232
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,680
Don't worry, don't worry

233
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,720
Come on come on

234
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,839
A little mouth

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,839
What do doctors say about Jiali's condition

236
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,559
How long does it take to be hospitalized

237
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,400
The doctor said he could go back to rest

238
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,519
My dad and I have discussed it.

239
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,640
Prepare to bring Carrie and Xiao Taozi

240
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,279
Go back to your hometown first

241
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,200
There are too many enemies here

242
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,160
News will be out in two days

243
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,920
That debt collector

244
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,640
Don't chase here

245
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,720
Then I've returned to my hometown

246
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,720
What to do with children's education

247
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,200
There is a primary school in the county

248
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,400
The teacher is pretty good too

249
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,599
But Carrie looks like this

250
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,039
Uncle is in poor health

251
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,079
You two elders have to take care of the sick again

252
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,279
Have to take care of the children

253
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,279
Can you care about this

254
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,440
You guys

255
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,559
Leave it to me to take care of

256
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Conditions in the East China Sea

257
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,039
No matter how good it is, it is better than the county town

258
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,559
Don't worry

259
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,599
In the future, no matter who the child is raised

260
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,680
She will always be Carrie's child

261
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,960
It's also your granddaughter

262
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,839
good

263
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,440
Let's think about it again

264
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,359
Think about it again

265
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,440
Ice Ice

266
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:12,839
sorry

267
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Don't be angry

268
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,319
Ice Ice

269
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,599
I should indeed have spoken before

270
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,680
Discussed with you

271
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,079
I've figured it out

272
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,160
You just say it nicely

273
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,000
In action

274
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,640
Do whatever you want

275
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,119
Never respected my thoughts

276
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,839
My rights

277
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,039
It's all my fault

278
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,558
I'll admit my mistake to you

279
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,920
But you've seen it too

280
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,119
Hongming didn't mention anything else in his suicide note

281
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,759
Just hope I

282
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,039
Care for Xiao Taozi's education

283
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,720
Bingbing, don't do this

284
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,880
Ice Ice

285
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,160
Bingbing, don't close the door

286
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,839
Ice Ice

287
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,960
I'm not thinking well

288
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,839
Can we discuss it carefully

289
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,319
Ice Ice

290
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:58,960
Ice Ice

291
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,319
Hongming and I used to be

292
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,480
When I was going to school together

293
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,920
He studied very hard

294
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,279
Don't play basketball

295
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,240
Don't mess with girls

296
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Because he believes

297
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,119
He believes in getting into a good university

298
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,559
It can change your destiny

299
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,319
He is like this to himself

300
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,720
I believe his wish for Xiao Taozi

301
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,720
The same is true

302
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,160
That's why he

303
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,440
Entrust the child to me

304
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,759
Ice Ice

305
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,559
My best friend is dead

306
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,920
I can't have his last wish

307
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,119
Ignore it

308
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,599
If you disagree

309
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,160
I

310
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,359
I'll tell Carrie's parents

311
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,720
I said we won't take care of the child.

312
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,599
But in the future, the children will follow them

313
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,359
Living expenses and tuition fees

314
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,839
It's up to us to bear it

315
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,279
OK

316
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,920
I'm sure you'll agree

317
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
I'm a little sad

318
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,359
I'll go out for a walk

319
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,519
OK

320
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,640
This child's learning is already in Australia

321
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,799
It's been delayed by one semester

322
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,400
See when will you have time recently

323
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,920
Take her to find a school

324
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,920
Thank you

325
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,160
Ice Ice

326
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,400
The sales office was smashed

327
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
When did it happen

328
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,960
Just this morning

329
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,720
I heard it was their first phase owner

330
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
House prices are at the highest point

331
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,119
The second phase has been reduced now

332
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,359
One square can have a thousand yuan

333
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,720
No wonder they can't accept it

334
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,680
But this is all market behavior

335
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Developers take the initiative to reduce prices

336
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,079
Only then can you recover funds

337
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,240
Otherwise, how can I survive

338
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,119
This real estate is in a cold winter

339
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,839
More than just the real estate industry

340
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,000
The same goes for our manufacturing industry

341
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,119
You see

342
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:12,920
This month's operating rate hit a new low

343
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,240
The old order is gradually completed

344
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,839
New orders are getting harder

345
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,240
Lu Huadong

346
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,720
Is it a wiretap?

347
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,559
How did he know we were talking about him

348
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,200
Feed Dongdong

349
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,159
Tonight

350
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,880
Come out for a drink with me

351
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,160
OK

352
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,200
where

353
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,200
Come

354
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,680
Drink beer

355
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,920
Why don't you go to Ireland

356
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,160
You don't know

357
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,039
Irish bars collapsed last month

358
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:50,599
Fall

359
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,079
Economic downturn

360
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,519
This kind of high consumption place

361
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,279
A large number of them have fallen

362
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,119
I've heard about your sales office

363
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,480
Still making trouble

364
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:00,839
How to solve it

365
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,960
The person who smashed the stuff has been caught

366
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,480
The group meeting in the afternoon

367
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,039
Decide to reduce the price and promote

368
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,119
Ensure cash flow

369
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:10,920
These days

370
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,640
Cash is still the king

371
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,519
yes

372
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,279
How is Tengfei doing lately

373
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,680
Is the operating rate okay?

374
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,519
Have you started laying off employees?

375
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,640
Layoffs

376
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,720
Unless it is absolutely necessary

377
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,839
I won't lay off employees

378
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,960
The reason why the flying is flying

379
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,519
Except for those hardware

380
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,359
The most important thing is this team

381
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,839
Liu Jun

382
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,599
Have you been in the past few months

383
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,359
Just worry about Qian Hongming

384
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,319
I didn't pay attention to the international situation at all

385
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,319
What international situation

386
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:44,920
Isn't it the United States

387
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,319
Have you lost a few big investment banks?

388
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,599
The subprime mortgage crisis has begun a second wave

389
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,119
Don't underestimate this second wave

390
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,880
It's bigger and more intense than the first wave

391
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,799
Have begun to develop in depth

392
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,160
A financial tsunami has formed

393
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,079
In my opinion

394
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,319
The US economy will be within a year or two

395
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,160
Can't stabilize

396
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,000
It is influenced by it

397
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,960
It is difficult to see improvement in a short period of time

398
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,519
We have tens of thousands of employees in Dongfu

399
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,160
If it really takes care of one or two years or two

400
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,599
That won't kill us

401
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,960
I think you're too pessimistic

402
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,319
Most domestic crises

403
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,680
All are input type

404
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,480
Wait for the elimination of a group of bubble-type enterprises

405
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,720
The business volume will definitely

406
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,200
Surviving enterprises come to concentrate

407
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,440
Wait for this reshuffle to pass

408
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,920
Normal demand

409
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,000
It will always be reflected

410
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,720
It won't stand for a year or two

411
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,119
Brother

412
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,519
You think I'm pessimistic

413
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,279
I think you

414
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,559
Too naive

415
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:40,920
You think

416
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,880
Are all high-debt companies?

417
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,519
no

418
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,160
Some bosses have no debt at all

419
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,880
They choose to close their sleep

420
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,880
Please leave all the employees

421
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,880
Current expenditure will be minimized

422
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,480
Once the economy starts to recover

423
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,599
People have money

424
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,200
Can recruit people to the factory at any time

425
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,599
Turn the machine back on

426
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,079
And what about you

427
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,880
By then you've already consumed

428
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:05,160
End of ammunition and food

429
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,960
What to compete with others

430
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,759
Too naive

431
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,160
But take off

432
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,680
Most of them are senior technicians

433
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,119
It is the most lacking talent in the industry

434
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,279
If I really quit them

435
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,240
When you need it

436
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,119
Where to find it

437
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,559
That's right

438
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:23,920
Our city one machine

439
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,720
Not as many elite soldiers as you

440
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,920
I plan to put the current staff

441
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,279
Cut one third

442
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,359
Those old ministers who can't keep up with the times

443
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,960
I've wanted to deal with them long ago

444
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,359
Take this opportunity

445
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:38,920
Take them all home

446
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,319
You're the old man who's fighting the country

447
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,200
Drive them all away

448
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,200
Aren't you afraid of hurting people

449
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,640
People's hearts are excuses

450
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,440
When speaking at the annual meeting

451
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,240
Just talk

452
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,599
You must not take it seriously

453
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,400
They're following you now

454
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,720
It's so beautiful that the moon is full when you are in front of you

455
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,519
You can't pay next month

456
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,960
Look at their faces again

457
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,720
Ensure you are eye-opening

458
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,160
waiter

459
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,440
Is there anything else to drink?

460
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,039
You get one

461
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,039
Get me a drink order

462
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,079
Very soon

463
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,519
OK

464
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,519
I think we should stop talking

465
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Different entry points

466
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,079
Everyone has their own reasons

467
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
No one can convince anyone

468
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,480
yes

469
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,519
We have no conflicts

470
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,440
What are you talking about

471
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,000
Drink it

472
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:26,599
Change some

473
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,079
Height number

474
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,160
What to do

475
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,839
Send him back

476
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,960
There are two children waiting at home

477
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:56,799
Have to go back quickly

478
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,880
How can I give him

479
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,000
Then what should he do

480
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,599
Throw it here

481
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,559
This is not good

482
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,799
fine

483
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:17,920
I'm here

484
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,599
Then let's go

485
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:22,720
Good worship

486
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,880
You don't need

487
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,880
Scare me

488
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,599
You

489
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,759
Dongdong

490
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,559
Dongdong

491
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,519
Can you leave

492
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,079
You're here

493
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,519
Drink too much

494
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,319
Unhappy

495
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,480
Drink too much

496
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,759
Do you know

497
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,079
I'm willing to admit it until today

498
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,039
I am really different from Liu Jun

499
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,200
What did you say

500
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,960
He has his own ideals and career

501
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:48,759
Where is me

502
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,200
My biggest advantage

503
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,559
There is one

504
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,839
Dad who can help me clean up the mess

505
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,559
You guys

506
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,720
When crazy, he is arrogant

507
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,440
When you are discouraged

508
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,279
I wish I could lie on the ground

509
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,599
Have you seen it long ago

510
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,640
I've seen it long ago

511
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,680
Nothing to do

512
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,000
That's why I don't want to marry me

513
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,720
What's wrong with you

514
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:10,320
Tiaodong says

515
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,518
His land king

516
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,119
It was taken at the highest point

517
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,079
Squeeze a big piece

518
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,320
The company's working capital

519
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,159
In the end, there is no way

520
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,518
It's his dad

521
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,280
Help him stabilize the situation

522
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,719
Their family is very strong

523
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,719
A project's pit is nothing

524
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:38,000
Besides, this land is not gone

525
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,360
It's just two years later

526
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,480
Just spend money on his son

527
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,518
Buy a lesson

528
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,239
yes

529
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,679
The greatest pain of the

530
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,000
It's just a drunk

531
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,760
Okay Hiroaki

532
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,679
But he lost his life

533
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,840
Their mistakes are different in nature

534
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,679
If you compare this

535
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,719
Not fair to things

536
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,760
I know

537
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,360
I was just a little sad all of a sudden

538
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,480
Companies have been laying off employees recently

539
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
But I don't want to cut

540
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,679
Mainly don't want to

541
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
So irresponsible

542
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,719
Get rid of employees as burdens

543
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,480
But now the economic situation

544
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,559
Everyone knows it

545
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,119
Whether to lay off employees

546
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,320
It's not just my word

547
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,559
so

548
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,559
What do you think

549
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,519
Propose

550
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,760
Let's discuss it

551
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,199
See how we can overcome difficulties together

552
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,599
Anything you want to say is raised

553
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,440
Discussion and discussion

554
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,400
The heat treatment center was built last year

555
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,519
I'm the most active

556
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,159
It seems now

557
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,719
It's already a company

558
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,320
The biggest asset burden

559
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,639
I'm willing to accept punishment for this

560
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,960
No bonus this year

561
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,360
The salary is cut by half

562
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,079
You're off topic if you say that

563
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,440
Building a heat treatment center is a collective decision

564
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,639
The last board I took

565
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,519
Why just punish you

566
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,719
yes

567
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,920
But I understand what Luo means

568
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,159
I'm willing to cut his salary with him, too

569
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,920
And give up this year's bonus

570
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,199
I'm willing, too

571
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,719
I'm one

572
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,199
Me too

573
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,119
I'll hold this meeting today

574
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,679
Not for indirect

575
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,039
Let everyone take the initiative to reduce their salary

576
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,679
Salary cuts are the last resort

577
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,960
There is no way

578
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,679
Before this

579
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,239
I think we still

580
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,239
Discuss other solutions

581
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:08,480
That's it

582
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:09,840
I'll say first

583
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,000
Our sales strategy

584
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,880
Always talk more about technology

585
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,719
Then from now on

586
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,880
We must change this strategy

587
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,599
Next, the focus of the sales department

588
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,960
Must be put on robbing business

589
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,800
Whether it is high-end customization

590
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,039
Or a second-tier brand

591
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,719
Even without technical content

592
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,480
Main road goods

593
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,599
As long as the price cost can be kept equal

594
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,800
You must grab it all for me

595
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,519
Mr. Liu means

596
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,239
Let's fight the price war

597
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,039
Yes

598
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:44,840
certainly

599
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,920
I understand everyone's ideas, too

600
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,639
There is no point in fighting a price war

601
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,239
But what we are facing now

602
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,639
It's a world economic crisis

603
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,559
Only take unusual approaches

604
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Only then can you find a way out

605
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,519
Then next

606
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,199
Manager He of the Finance Department will announce it

607
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,719
Specific plans for companies to reduce costs

608
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,000
This is the first one

609
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:11,840
It's the seal

610
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,079
In the future, this type and copy must be double-sided

611
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,400
Cancel the color ink cartridge

612
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,440
second

613
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,239
Stop indoor green plant rental

614
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,679
What's the third

615
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,840
Our canteen has water, electricity and coal

616
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,039
Subsidy or the same

617
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,119
But what about this dish

618
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,199
Let's cut it by half

619
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,440
fourth

620
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:27,960
Public bathroom

621
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,360
No longer open hot water all day

622
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,079
Replaced to be open for a limited time

623
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:35,920
Mr. Liu, please read

624
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,639
I'm not trying to suppress your price

625
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,119
Come to me this year

626
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,159
The owner of the luxury car mortgage

627
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,239
Too many

628
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,000
I've already filled up that library

629
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,239
This place

630
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,239
It's my new rent

631
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,679
In addition to venue fees

632
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,559
I have to hire a security guard to see the scene

633
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,280
So there is no way

634
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,599
You baby

635
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,840
I can't give a high price

636
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,360
Only 50% off

637
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,599
Mr. Liu seems to know Boss Qian, too

638
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,280
When he arrived, he arrived

639
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,079
I must have a clear idea in my mind

640
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,480
Just signed with me

641
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,079
Then come at the price you mentioned

642
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,920
But you have to get the money right away

643
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,440
no problem

644
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,639
Real Estate Real Estate

645
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,000
How about the economic crisis

646
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:45,920
It's been over a year

647
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,280
Still just focusing on real estate

648
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,599
So much money for investment

649
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,840
All invested in real estate

650
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:57,199
Don't tell me anything

651
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,079
Trailer news

652
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,800
I think it's very likely that it's true

653
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,519
You can speak softly

654
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,800
Just fell asleep

655
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,920
OK OK OK

656
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,719
I won't tell you anymore

657
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,960
Has hung up

658
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,440
OK

659
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,079
Don't be too anxious, either

660
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,920
From the bank's perspective

661
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,840
Current investment trends

662
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I can understand, too

663
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,599
Investment confidence in manufacturing

664
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,039
It's too difficult to recover for a while

665
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,320
I think

666
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:44,760
After more than a year

667
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,880
The situation is ups and downs

668
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,239
It should be able to see clearly

669
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,000
The current unbalanced development structure

670
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,679
Shouldn't the economy be slowed down

671
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,239
Do you try to reverse this trend

672
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,159
The disadvantages you can see

673
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,559
Others can see

674
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:04,679
It's just that the economic problem is too complicated

675
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,719
Long-term strategy and short-term profit

676
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,199
Between market demand and enterprise benefits

677
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,440
All need to be weighed

678
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,079
Not to mention the unbalanced development of the industry

679
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:18,239
The development of various places is unbalanced

680
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,679
Want to solve all problems in one step

681
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,079
I don't think it's possible

682
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
For manufacturing

683
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,039
Especially high-tech transformation

684
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:30,800
This aspect

685
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:33,800
I really hope the country can have it

686
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,280
More policies to support

687
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,119
Only this

688
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,360
I can realize it

689
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,519
That little wish

690
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,559
What wish

691
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
I hope one day

692
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
When we hold the product

693
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,880
When competing internationally

694
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,079
You can also pat your chest

695
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,400
Say to foreign colleagues

696
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:11,840
You see

697
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,559
We China

698
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:15,400
Not only do I produce shirts and toys

699
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,320
We also have independent research and development

700
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,119
high tech

701
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,679
We can also stand

702
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,119
The forefront of industrial development

703
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:27,480
You

704
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,599
The tone is getting worse

705
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,679
Such a big ambition

706
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
I'm afraid it can't be considered

707
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,599
A small wish
