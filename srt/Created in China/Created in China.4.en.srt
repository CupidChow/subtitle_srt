1
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,919
This way, shut down the factory

2
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:49,880
Go back to Germany

3
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:51,680
you

4
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,799
you

5
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,199
Where is Ajun

6
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,680
My heart is uncomfortable

7
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,400
No

8
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,639
120 Kombat 120

9
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,760
Can't get angry

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,079
Dad, I'll tell you serious things

11
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,240
Can you stop making trouble with me

12
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,400
120 is that fast

13
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,439
Who are you

14
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,120
Hello, I am the neighbor next door

15
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,999
I'll look for it

16
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:15,799
Lin Chuan

17
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,480
Why are you here

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,240
Miss Lin

19
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,039
Recognize the name for a long time

20
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,800
I listen often

21
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,840
Our Ajun mentioned you

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,319
You guys are pretty serious.

23
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,240
Is that easy to talk now?

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,840
Convenient and convenient

25
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,719
Come come come come come come come come come in

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,640
Is there a target?

27
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,240
Our Ajun is still single

28
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:34,759
Distant relatives are not as good as close neighbor girls

29
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,800
Dad, didn't you make an appointment?

30
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,879
When did I make an appointment

31
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:37,719
Have an appointment

32
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,599
That Ah Jun

33
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,719
Dad bought oranges

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,120
Please enter

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,559
In the kitchen

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,879
Remember to give it to the girl

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,520
Dad bought red wine

38
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,599
You're too late

39
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,279
A little longer

40
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,159
Let's go quickly

41
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,439
Go away now

42
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,120
That Ah Jun

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,920
Go quickly

44
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:52,920
Talk to girls

45
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:53,400
Bye bye bye bye

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,279
I won't give it to you

47
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,478
Goodbye, uncle, goodbye

48
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,559
Eat some oranges

49
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,920
I've been to your house

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,599
Yeah

51
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,120
when

52
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,719
Model house

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,520
I've seen it when I bought a house

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
I think it's pretty bad

55
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:31,439
I think so

56
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,200
Isn't there any red wine?

57
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,559
Don't listen to my dad's nonsense

58
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
He's kidding

59
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,800
Then your dad said

60
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,999
You often mention me

61
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,039
It's also a joke

62
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,120
Really OK

63
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,478
Say it

64
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,640
What's the matter for me

65
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,719
I'm here to thank you very much

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,039
Thank me

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,079
Thank you for helping us

68
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,599
Solved a big problem

69
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Chief Engineer Wang said

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,960
What about Dr. Liu

71
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,159
To restore the last visit

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,640
Rather think about it

73
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,319
Give our products suggestions

74
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:11,719
Don't want to waste time

75
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Have a meal with us

76
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,360
Then I had to come to express my gratitude

77
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:17,759
That Chief Executive Wang

78
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,159
It must be a joke

79
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,399
Didn't I say it all before

80
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,879
Say you want to treat you to a meal

81
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,279
See when will you have time

82
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:24,559
I can do it anytime

83
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,679
Anytime

84
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:27,560
yes

85
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,799
Your friend's funeral

86
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,119
Have you finished working

87
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,919
Can he come out for dinner?

88
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,159
Qian Hongming

89
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,960
Yes

90
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,119
My elder brother is their company

91
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,719
A big customer I've always wanted to sign

92
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,200
Opportunities to meet and have dinner

93
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,039
Not much

94
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,239
That day he came to hand in the business card first

95
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,239
Obviously there is

96
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,479
What is the meaning of building a relationship

97
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,279
how

98
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,719
You didn't plan to bring him with you

99
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,960
Planned

100
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,840
Planned

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
Have the meal been ready

102
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,880
It'll be fine soon

103
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:20,719
Hungry

104
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:21,919
Hungry

105
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,080
Salty or not

106
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,880
Not salty

107
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:11,760
Hiroaki

108
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,400
You know I never use perfume

109
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:26,880
You said that

110
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,799
That was the gift I prepared for Liu Jun.

111
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,359
He will go to the city's first machine manager Lin tomorrow

112
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Have a meal together

113
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,159
Let me accompany you

114
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,159
What about him

115
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,719
I can't remember to bring something to others

116
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:40,640
So I'll give it to him

117
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:41,719
Prepare a gift

118
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,440
Let him give it to Miss Lin

119
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Then you think

120
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,760
It's possible for Liu Jun and her to

121
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,159
Now

122
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:54,840
not yet

123
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:56,799
But what if one day

124
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,279
What other meanings are derived

125
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,080
That boy Liu Jun

126
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,239
No need to go back to Germany

127
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,919
Isn't that good, too

128
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,159
Yes or no

129
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,000
This dish is still a bit salty

130
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,119
I won't put so much salt next time

131
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:28,679
Here comes

132
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,640
Here comes

133
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,279
I learned to send flowers

134
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,320
Have made progress

135
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:40,039
I'm not a savage

136
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,560
Still too simple

137
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,760
Add this

138
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,000
Mr. Lin’s business card

139
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,760
Manager of the second export department

140
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,159
Young and promising

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
Don't be restrained

142
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,200
Homemade meal

143
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:01,840
All right

144
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,640
What about us today

145
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,119
Just follow Dr. Liu

146
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,840
This habit of returning from abroad

147
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,080
Don't drink

148
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,760
good

149
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:09,479
Eat more dishes

150
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,200
All right

151
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:10,840
OK OK OK

152
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:11,640
Come on come on

153
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,599
This is a popular dish this year

154
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,118
Boiled fish

155
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:18,840
Although I don't understand

156
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:19,919
Why is it called boiled fish

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
I look like a fish

158
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:23,840
But it can be popular

159
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,080
There must be a reason for it

160
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Come and taste it

161
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,719
Can you eat spicy food

162
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,479
Can eat or eat

163
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,320
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK

164
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,239
Come on your own

165
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,200
Come on come on

166
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,719
Thanks

167
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,440
Manually

168
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:34,919
You're welcome

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,719
Come on your own

170
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,679
I'll try it too

171
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,519
Taste is really good

172
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,080
Can

173
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:43,919
sure

174
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Give me some vinegar

175
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,119
Come

176
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,160
Feeling a lack of flavor

177
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,560
this

178
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,879
This is clever

179
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:57,519
this

180
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,239
It's good to add some vinegar

181
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,080
Do you want to come some

182
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,840
I'm not here anymore

183
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,680
well

184
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,719
Do you want it

185
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,599
No thanks

186
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,040
Ours

187
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Chief Engineer Wang

188
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:11,280
That's a lot of praise to you

189
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:12,879
Yeah

190
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:15,680
They said they had followed your proposal

191
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,160
Redesigned the mold

192
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,399
It's true that one less process

193
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,280
Why no one thought of it before

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,680
Everyone told me

195
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,080
If I want me to dig you over

196
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,359
Will come or not

197
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,280
Sorry, Mr. Lin

198
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,719
I've agreed with my family before

199
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,999
Only stay in the country for one year

200
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,879
I'll go back to Germany a year later

201
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,840
You're quite adaptable

202
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,999
This foreign life

203
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,999
good

204
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,879
I'm in the United States

205
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,040
I've been there for three days

206
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,359
No limit

207
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,800
After all, this is still

208
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,440
Does the land and water support the other

209
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,840
Come and eat vegetables

210
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,200
Then you'll be next

211
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,599
This year in the country

212
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,719
What are your plans

213
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,440
I plan to do this year

214
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,680
Help my dad develop some flagship products

215
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,119
Yeah

216
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,399
What product

217
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:14,960
RF Series

218
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,239
I heard from Chief Executive Wang before

219
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,800
City One Machinery has tried it before

220
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,599
Don't mention it

221
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,239
This old Wang must do it

222
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,200
Get rid of me for more than 500,000 at once

223
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,879
That's really not even touching the door frame

224
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,239
Just try a pile of scrap steel for you

225
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,440
Buy it for more than 10,000 yuan per ton

226
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,960
That one thousand or more is sold

227
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,639
You said this is a blind man touching an elephant

228
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,719
That person has an elephant

229
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,440
Standing there

230
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,920
He's a headless fly

231
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,840
Do it randomly

232
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,719
Actually, I think

233
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,280
It's not a blame on General Manager Wang

234
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,479
RF series It is a high-precision product

235
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,920
Invest in half a million

236
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:52,800
Surely not enough

237
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,320
Double is not necessarily

238
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,119
Then say so

239
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,119
You've figured out the trick

240
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,599
Can estimate the total cost

241
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,840
It can be roughly estimated

242
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,080
Possibility of increasing budget midway

243
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,879
Also relatively high

244
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,040
Your dad told you to do this so rudely

245
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,440
Little Liu

246
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,440
You are a technician

247
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,320
What you need to study the most

248
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,599
Just how to do it as soon as possible

249
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:25,080
Transform this technology into benefits

250
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,840
We open a company and run a factory

251
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,119
After all, it's not a scientific research institution

252
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,800
yes

253
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,160
You don't have the money above to support it

254
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,879
No one can afford it, right

255
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:36,879
Mr. Lin

256
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,160
Logic of developing new products

257
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,200
It's not like this

258
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,879
In the long run

259
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:42,719
well

260
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,840
Your factory

261
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,239
Then I don't have to talk too much, right

262
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,399
I'll take care of it

263
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,519
My city is fine, right

264
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:50,960
Eat food

265
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,599
Come to Liu Jun to eat food

266
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,560
Come on come on

267
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:56,440
Manually

268
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:56,960
You're welcome

269
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:57,840
Come on your own

270
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,479
Isn't it a bit done

271
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,599
or

272
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,320
Let's have a drink

273
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:12,920
good

274
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,320
This is not drinking

275
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,800
It feels like barefoot wearing leather shoes

276
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,359
Anyway

277
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:19,399
I'll have a drink with Mr. Lin

278
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,999
OK OK OK OK OK OK

279
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,399
Take two wine glasses

280
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,040
Come on come on

281
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:24,840
I'll come I'll come

282
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,800
One, same

283
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,800
Come to you this cup

284
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:28,759
Thanks

285
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,920
Come to Liu Jun to try this

286
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,840
good

287
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,040
Come on, I'll give you a cup

288
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,719
After this glass of wine

289
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,200
The atmosphere came up all at once

290
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:42,800
Yes

291
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,599
yes

292
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:44,960
Small money

293
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,879
I'll talk to you Mr. Zhao last week

294
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,840
Have eaten once

295
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,080
He told me

296
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,759
Thanks Thanks

297
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,639
Don't look at this time

298
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,840
The Asian financial crisis is very serious

299
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,359
But it seems to be for you

300
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,560
No impact

301
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
This performance throughout the year

302
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,440
Still pretty good

303
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,599
Thanks to the country's policies

304
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,800
Thanks too

305
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,879
Big customers like Mr. Lin

306
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,479
I'll treat Mr. Lin to one cup

307
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,040
If you want to cooperate with the city Yiji

308
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,999
This Lin Yue

309
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,080
You have to be careful about him

310
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,399
He is the gold digging machine

311
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,160
Work with him

312
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:30,759
You can't take any advantage

313
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,040
rest assured

314
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,320
He doesn't want to pay attention to me at the dinner table

315
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,920
How could there be any cooperation?

316
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,960
Such a big boss doesn't appreciate you

317
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,519
You

318
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,200
I feel a little uncomfortable

319
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,800
No

320
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,160
Really no

321
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,800
Don't hold on

322
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Really no

323
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,239
You really think

324
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,119
I'll care about a boss like this

325
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,800
Don't agree with me

326
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,999
You really don't know me

327
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,200
OK I see you are not busy either

328
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:05,399
Come with me

329
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,599
Where to go

330
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,479
You'll know when you get in the car

331
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,479
Come

332
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,399
Take a look

333
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,599
You really built a laboratory

334
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,599
This is my paradise

335
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,320
I'd rather be here

336
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,399
Stay for ten hours

337
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,999
I don't want to spend an hour either

338
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,479
Go and have a drink with Boss Lin

339
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,320
Not yours

340
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,599
Sorry Sorry Sorry Sorry

341
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,519
Thank u

342
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,239
Drink with my guests

343
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,840
Look at my laboratory

344
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,479
Although it's not as good as it is for the time being

345
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,040
Test workshop of City One Machine

346
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,239
But it's not bad

347
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,759
this

348
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,440
Imported from Germany

349
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,040
Take it lightly

350
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,280
This is very expensive

351
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,399
The price of a car

352
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,200
Then what did you just say

353
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,879
RF Series

354
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,280
All can be solved here

355
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,160
I'm an amateur when I hear you say this

356
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,399
Tests that cannot be done by RF series

357
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,680
Have to go on the market

358
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,920
Borrow their test equipment

359
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,519
Even mass production

360
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,320
Everyone has to find a big factory like them

361
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,239
Go to OEM

362
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,599
But I believe

363
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,639
These are just temporary

364
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,239
The factory will definitely be able to move forward in the future

365
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,759
Independent research and development and production

366
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,759
Ideal is beautiful

367
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,119
But the current situation of the industry

368
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,399
Not as beautiful as you ideally

369
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,319
Your new series

370
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,719
Find city-one machine experiments and OEMs

371
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:47,160
There may be a lot of trouble in the future

372
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,840
yes

373
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,999
My dad warned me too

374
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,759
Say it's useless even if I sign the contract

375
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,359
Up to one or two months

376
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,639
Will be copied completely

377
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,238
He said conservatively

378
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,759
I've heard of it

379
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,879
One week

380
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,560
There are similar products

381
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,680
Listing cases

382
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,560
After coming back

383
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,840
Bad news heard

384
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,719
More good news

385
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,359
Yeah

386
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,879
The current situation of manufacturing is so bad

387
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,999
Can you just go with the flow?

388
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,680
Any time when a new era comes

389
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,479
There will be a labor pain period

390
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,119
But someone has to go forward

391
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,160
Now that I'm back

392
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,040
I don't want to make one

393
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,040
People who go with the flow

394
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,200
I want to be a leader

395
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,199
No matter how many objections there are

396
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:18,480
Decision on independent research and development

397
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:19,679
I'll never change

398
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:22,720
Going forward to the factory must go

399
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:24,319
A different road from other factories

400
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,079
Who is right and who is wrong

401
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:30,639
I believe

402
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
Time will finally give an answer

403
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm almost broken

404
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,720
No, no, no

405
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,840
Take a break for a while

406
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,679
Buy all the accessories

407
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,119
Temperature control

408
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,599
Compensation wire

409
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,480
Thermocouple

410
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,959
Step on my feet

411
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,119
I'll wipe it for you

412
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,159
Plus those delivered

413
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:05,959
Almost all

414
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,080
All

415
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,199
You said you chose these accessories

416
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,359
How does it

417
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,599
All are so expensive

418
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,159
this

419
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,878
And this one

420
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,840
Such a broken thing is 6,000

421
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,399
Add it, add it, let me tell you

422
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,720
Your heat treatment furnace

423
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,080
Can't make a 50,000 yuan

424
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,520
I've told you a long time ago

425
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,879
Our R&D data

426
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,240
Sooner or later it will be cracked

427
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:25,919
Want to make this time

428
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,240
Move back as much as possible

429
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,959
We must make the most critical

430
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,679
Heat treatment data

431
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,639
In your own hands

432
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,040
You think I bought these

433
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:32,840
OK OK OK

434
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,480
Heat treatment furnace is important

435
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:35,840
Dad supports you very much, right

436
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,439
Isn't this buying?

437
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,040
Heaven and Earth Conscience Dad

438
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,040
I've gotten from the heat treatment workshop

439
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,359
Give it to the heat treatment furnace

440
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,840
You don't think about it either

441
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,119
How much does a heat treatment workshop cost

442
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,040
Not expensive

443
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:49,040
Good son

444
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,560
Dad suddenly felt it wasn't expensive

445
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,599
Go and have a meal

446
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,000
Dad invites you something delicious

447
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,399
OK

448
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,639
Thank you

449
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,599
This is the big meal you treat me to

450
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:01,800
There is really no good around here

451
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,840
Wait for the return to the East China Sea

452
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,240
I'll invite you to the East China Sea

453
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,760
Mr. Zhang

454
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,520
Lao Zhang

455
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,320
Old Liu

456
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:19,280
Why are you here

457
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,560
I'm here to see the exhibition

458
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,280
You'll come to the exhibition, too

459
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:22,240
Watch the exhibition

460
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:22,919
Walked all morning

461
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,959
Legs are almost broken

462
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:24,919
Come on come on

463
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,679
Sitting together

464
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,158
Eat together

465
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,760
Come one piece by one

466
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,320
OK OK OK

467
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,399
That's a coincidence

468
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,119
My son Liu Jun

469
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,959
This is your Uncle Zhang

470
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:33,679
Dad friend

471
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,439
Hello Uncle Zhang

472
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,000
This is that

473
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,599
Studying a PhD in Germany

474
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,679
The son of an engineer

475
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,560
Yes Yes Yes

476
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:41,399
Come back and help me

477
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:42,639
I called him back

478
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,119
What a blessing

479
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,399
Good luck, good luck

480
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,280
Lao Zhang

481
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
I heard you're starting to do it now

482
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:49,480
It's a punch

483
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,800
Yes

484
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:51,840
Not doing that now

485
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:52,959
Are there many small jewelry?

486
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,040
This kind of instrument punch is very easy to sell

487
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:55,520
Yeah

488
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,840
There are so many orders to complete

489
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,879
Yes

490
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,840
There are no outsiders today

491
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:01,959
I'll tell you the truth

492
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,359
I went out to find one

493
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,399
Advanced original machine

494
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,800
I'll take it apart

495
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,439
Imitated for half a year

496
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,480
Completed

497
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:11,439
The punches are pretty good

498
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:17,439
Uncle Zhang

499
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,480
Listen to you

500
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,760
That one should be a rough imitation

501
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,760
I guess this imitation

502
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,879
It should be better than the original machine

503
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,439
At least twice as large

504
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,599
More than twice as much

505
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
More big

506
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:31,320
But it doesn't matter

507
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,679
We can't be like them

508
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,080
Used on the table

509
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,240
But I added a basic

510
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,159
I'll put those four feet

511
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:39,919
Fixed with anchor bolts

512
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,040
Can be used the same

513
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:44,320
What you are talking about is

514
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,520
The biggest problem with rough imitation

515
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,240
I'll tell you this

516
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:50,800
For example, this is an axis

517
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:51,800
Due to the material

518
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,000
Or other design issues

519
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,520
Causes it to be insufficient

520
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,159
But the imitation

521
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,439
I won't study why

522
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,520
Just simply by bolding

523
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:02,040
Or a lengthened way

524
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,280
To increase its stress

525
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,199
This turns out to be a little more

526
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,119
Then add a little more

527
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,080
A small punch

528
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,439
Finally give

529
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,280
Imitated to become a giant

530
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,119
What's this?

531
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,399
You must be right

532
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,240
But I'll make a rough imitation

533
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:26,800
I've lived a pretty good life

534
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,959
Domestic market does not have to worry about selling

535
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,119
Can also export to Southeast Asia

536
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,959
I can't finish the order even if I want to

537
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,639
Not bad

538
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,439
Yes

539
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,840
This is pretty good

540
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:36,800
Ah Jun

541
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,199
This is a way

542
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,439
dad

543
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:40,359
If

544
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,599
If it's really easy to imitate

545
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:42,959
That must be your imitation today

546
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,040
I'll imitate tomorrow

547
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,399
In the end, everyone will do it

548
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,280
Only one cost price

549
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:47,240
Thank you for your hard work

550
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:55,439
Young man

551
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,119
You know the Chinese market

552
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:57,959
How big is it

553
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,080
Do you know the types of mechanical products

554
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,999
How many are there

555
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:02,399
We're one or two years

556
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,439
I'll imitate one

557
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,040
I'm enough to eat and drink

558
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,000
you mean

559
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:08,599
I'll leave it with a good day

560
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,199
I'll ask for trouble

561
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,760
But people live

562
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:13,959
Don't you still want to make a sigh

563
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,560
You can't always follow others

564
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:16,359
Pick up food

565
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:18,800
Stop talking

566
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:20,199
Eat and eat now

567
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,040
OK, then you can eat slowly

568
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,199
I have something to do, I'll leave first

569
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,280
Waiter

570
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:27,359
Lao Zhang, look

571
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,040
No, no

572
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:28,919
I'll come I'll come I'll come

573
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:29,879
Sorry

574
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,439
My child is quite straight

575
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,320
Don't mind

576
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,879
Old Liu

577
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Your son is a good son

578
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,280
Very competitive

579
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,119
But

580
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,560
Do you want to be successful or not

581
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:42,279
Leave

582
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:44,679
Contact us by phone

583
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,080
Goodbye Uncle Zhang

584
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,240
Say it's so satisfying

585
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,159
You kid

586
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
I'm right

587
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:15,800
Liu Jun

588
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,280
I'll bring you dinner

589
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,679
Thank you Aunt Fu

590
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,879
What are you doing

591
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,119
this

592
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,199
The scientific name is a bit irritating

593
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,800
You just call it a big oven

594
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:34,080
It's really like a big oven

595
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:34,959
Yes

596
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,280
Then I'll leave

597
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,560
You remember to eat

598
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,359
knew

599
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,399
What to look at

600
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Our young master is working hard enough

601
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,080
After returning from Shanghai, I spent time in the workshop

602
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,599
I haven't seen him rest

603
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,399
Have you heard of it

604
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,359
He put our small conference room

605
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,800
Change to a laboratory

606
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,840
There are imported instruments inside

607
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,280
What a precious

608
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,800
Say something straight

609
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,359
Don't go around

610
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,399
Let's learn craftsmanship first

611
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,480
Become an apprentice

612
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,679
How many years will it take to become a teacher

613
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
Have you heard of it

614
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,439
Now imported machine tools

615
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,959
A young man only needs to study for two days

616
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,080
The finished product

617
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,359
Extremely high accuracy

618
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:50,399
Our craft

619
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,760
Is it becoming more and more useless

620
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,280
I know the machine tool

621
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,240
Since the Japanese left

622
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:05,560
One plane in the city

623
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:06,800
Haven't started

624
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,480
What's more, our factory

625
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:11,199
Go home for dinner

626
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:13,280
Go to my place to have a few drinks

627
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,399
Another day

628
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,999
Didn't go home yesterday

629
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,399
That's too hard

630
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:44,919
Thank you Uncle Huang for your concern

631
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:46,399
I didn't live here last night

632
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,800
I've just arrived a little early

633
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:50,800
This kind of rough work

634
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:51,720
And do it yourself

635
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,639
You give me a command

636
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,040
Just let us workers do it

637
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:55,199
Actually the shell

638
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,599
All of them are processed in our workshop

639
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,199
This is the temperature control part

640
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,760
Use temperature control components with chips

641
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:02,599
I'm the only one who can do the whole factory

642
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
I won't bother you

643
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:08,840
That's not it

644
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,280
What's all money

645
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,320
Dad, don't move around

646
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,320
No, no

647
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:57,919
Prepare to power on

648
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,240
Ajun Ajun

649
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:02,119
Ajun Ajun

650
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:02,599
What to do

651
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,280
Wait a little later

652
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,159
Wait a minute

653
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,119
What are you waiting for

654
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,280
You check it again

655
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,000
What to check

656
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,879
No need to check

657
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,199
You've all made money

658
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:10,959
If you turn on the power

659
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,879
Cracking

660
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:12,760
When I assembled it

661
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:14,040
Very meticulous

662
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,399
Are you questioning my technology

663
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,080
without

664
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,039
I'll ask

665
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:17,919
Take it

666
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:18,840
Powered on

667
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,080
Don't worry, dad

668
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,280
Or let's check it out again

669
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,320
I'll check it again

670
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:41,879
Very expensive

671
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:06,919
One-time fit

672
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,800
Then what's next

673
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,040
Do you have to continue

674
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,280
Test every fifty degrees

675
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,119
Until the upper limit of 9000

676
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,240
If there is still no error

677
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,919
It's completely completed

678
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:20,040
Very good

679
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:20,879
Hurry up the time

680
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,560
No hurry

681
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:22,639
There are two hours left

682
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,359
for how long

683
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:38,720
I said Ajun

684
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,359
Is this a match?

685
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,840
Fu

686
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,080
Director Liu

687
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,119
I succeeded

688
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,919
Success

689
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,879
Success

690
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,760
My RF series

691
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,159
Finally, research and development is about to begin

692
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,000
It's beginning

693
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,560
Yes Yes Yes

694
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:51,520
Just started

695
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,439
I thought it was over

696
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,280
You see, happy

697
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,760
Right

698
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,919
Help me drive the car back

699
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,359
Then how do you go back

700
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,599
I'll run back

701
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:01,959
There are so many stations

702
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,439
Going crazy

703
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:05,480
Going crazy

704
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,320
Do you know what this is

705
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,280
This is money

706
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:20,879
This money is worth spending

707
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:37,000
That's the past, present and future

708
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,320
Thirty thousand

709
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,320
It's 30,000 yuan

710
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,359
Ten thousand

711
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,159
Seven cakes

712
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:00,959
Feed Liu Jun

713
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,080
Ah Jun

714
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,560
This is yours

715
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,399
Baked from a large oven

716
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:50,919
Yes

717
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,720
What's this

718
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:56,119
C260

719
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:57,959
857

720
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,800
This is the temperature

721
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,720
These are just numbers

722
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,000
What temperature steel number

723
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,399
Of course, it has to be locked in the safe.

724
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,840
How could it be on the surface

725
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,639
You did it very well

726
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,679
Confidentiality is important

727
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:12,639
Good

728
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,639
Dr. Liu

729
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:21,760
Ask you something

730
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:24,199
Dr. Liu

731
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,599
I heard that your lab

732
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,959
New equipment has been added

733
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,480
What are they

734
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,199
Just a flaw detector and roughness meter

735
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,959
You'll be a gambler in a while

736
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,840
A gala in a while

737
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,080
How much does that cost

738
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,399
How much does it cost

739
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,959
I'm going to the lab, dad

740
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,720
Look at this kid

741
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:44,720
I'll run away as soon as I get the money

742
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,760
I'll tell you Ah Jun

743
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,639
I'm not urging you

744
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,080
All profits in the factory are now

745
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,159
Almost all hit

746
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,119
Your project is here

747
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,639
When will you be the first

748
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,800
It's almost the first month

749
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:53,639
dad

750
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,599
I know it's overspending now

751
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,199
So I plan to take some risks

752
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,199
Optimize experimental steps

753
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,119
Take the exclusion method

754
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,720
You believe me

755
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,879
Give me two more days

756
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,879
I'll give you two days

757
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:04,480
run

758
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:05,359
You run again

759
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,599
You run away

760
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,359
Where to run

761
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,480
Just this level

762
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,719
Dare to challenge your father

763
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,040
I've convinced you

764
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,480
What do you think of

765
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,800
What do you want

766
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:27,800
How long did I tell you

767
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,800
Look at how long it has been

768
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,600
Come here for me

769
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,639
But it took more than ten minutes

770
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:46,879
How big a problem can there be

771
00:34:47,478 --> 00:34:48,438
Almost OK

772
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,280
You go

773
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,039
Go back to the workshop

774
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,998
No need for you here

775
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:01,240
Let's go

776
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,840
Ajun, I

777
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,999
Ajun, I'll tell you

778
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,479
Dad, stay away

779
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,760
Be careful

780
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,680
Be careful

781
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,640
Ah Jun

782
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,879
Is the problem serious?

783
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:35,840
Dad asked you what you mean

784
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:36,999
Is the problem serious or not

785
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,599
Scrapped

786
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:44,200
Scrapped

787
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,200
right

788
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,039
Ah Jun

789
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,640
Do you know this batch of steel

790
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,399
How much does this cost this sample

791
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,840
Of course I know

792
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,439
But the test results are now

793
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:56,840
Already affected

794
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:57,879
No matter how much it costs

795
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:58,680
This batch of steel

796
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,720
All have to be scrapped and started again

797
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,760
Then you have to spend more money to buy

798
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,200
right

799
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,280
right

800
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,160
OK Dad

801
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:10,320
These two days

802
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:11,879
I'll watch the experiments in the factory myself

803
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,479
You go home to help me

804
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Take the changed clothes

805
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:15,800
OK OK OK

806
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:16,680
Then I'll go back now

807
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:17,760
Wait a minute

808
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,479
Check all the computers in the factory

809
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,280
All the games were deleted for me

810
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,320
This idea is good

811
00:36:22,439 --> 00:36:23,359
This idea is good

812
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:24,720
Each department room

813
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,998
Turn on my computer

814
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,760
Chief Engineer Wang is looking for you

815
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,680
Liu Jun called and said

816
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,479
He wants to borrow our test workshop

817
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,479
Do some experiments

818
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,479
You know this

819
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,319
I know

820
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,879
He is paying for use

821
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:44,680
Just like the others

822
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,079
Just like renting equipment

823
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,879
The factory can handle it according to the customs

824
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,039
That's how General Manager Wang

825
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:51,399
My elder brother said

826
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,240
What about Liu Jun's experiment

827
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,959
He wants someone to accompany him

828
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,240
I understand what Mr. Lin means

829
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,200
But I still hope

830
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,359
You explain to him

831
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,039
Tests like this

832
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,280
You just follow it

833
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,120
I can't see any tricks

834
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,959
Chief Executive Wang

835
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,919
For the development decisions in the factory

836
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,879
Are you a little disappointed

837
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,959
Chief Engineer Wang refused to say more

838
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,640
Is it because my surname is Lin?

839
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,280
A lot of unpleasant words

840
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,879
I've long been

841
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,800
He said it in front of Mr. Lin

842
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,320
It's useless to say

843
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,479
so what

844
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,919
I'd better pay less and useless talk

845
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,640
I understand what you think

846
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,079
Compared with Liu Jun and his team's Qianjin Factory

847
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,280
Development investment of the city's first machine

848
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:51,439
Too few

849
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,479
Mr. Lin

850
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,720
This is not just a

851
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,840
The issue of investment

852
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,240
Our factory

853
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,439
No new projects have been available for a long time

854
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:00,079
Our technical team

855
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,840
Or you are digesting the purchased drawings

856
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,680
Or plagiarism and imitation

857
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Someone else's finished product

858
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,399
You can't be there

859
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:09,079
Gain experience during development

860
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,160
How can I get it

861
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,479
Improve and improve

862
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,959
This is a professional

863
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,359
Not used for a long time

864
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,359
People will be ruined slowly

865
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:23,359
Actually, this problem

866
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:24,959
Not unique to the city

867
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,320
It is a common problem in the entire industry

868
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,320
But some people

869
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:29,680
There is no common problem

870
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:31,079
Compared with Liu Jun

871
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,919
Our factory's technicians

872
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,479
No matter the old or young

873
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,479
No longer discussing professionalism

874
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,160
No more pursuit of progress

875
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,120
But Lin Chuan

876
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,999
Decisions made by senior company leaders

877
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,120
That's it

878
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,600
You don't give a target

879
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,640
Not motivated

880
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:47,800
Can you blame them for not being enthusiastic

881
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,200
outrageous

882
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:54,519
Why do you do this day all night

883
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,479
Ah Jun

884
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Don't check it, don't know

885
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,320
There are several computers

886
00:38:59,359 --> 00:38:59,840
Walk

887
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,280
This factory is used as a game hall

888
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:03,399
Look at it like the words

889
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:08,999
So fast

890
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,760
I thought I'd like to apply for a test center

891
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,879
Have to wait a few days

892
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:15,200
Thanks Thanks

893
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:17,359
Then I'll remember it

894
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,519
You said

895
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,999
Ministry of Import and Export Trade

896
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,079
Yu Shanshan

897
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,840
Wait wait wait wait wait

898
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,879
Shan is Shan next to Wang

899
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:31,160
Extended number two and one three

900
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,079
OK Thank you Miss Yu

901
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:34,919
Goodbye Goodbye

902
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,879
All the games have been deleted

903
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:42,120
Go back and get my clothes for me

904
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,919
Ministry of Import and Export Trade

905
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:45,320
This should be

906
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,680
What about the test center

907
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,359
How could one

908
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:48,200
People from the Ministry of Import and Export Trade

909
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,039
Contact you

910
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,439
Who knows

911
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,280
It is estimated that after foreign capital withdrawal

912
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:53,519
This department is idle

913
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:54,800
No, right

914
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:58,919
Although Shi Yiji has now become a private enterprise

915
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,240
Can be managed or used

916
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,559
The old state-owned enterprise

917
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,519
It will never be dispatched across departments

918
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,559
This Yu Shanshan

919
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,439
I'll tell you this name

920
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,439
Probably a pretty girl

921
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,879
A name

922
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:12,640
You'll know

923
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,999
Are they beautiful girls?

924
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,079
Then you see

925
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,079
By the way

926
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:17,478
Dad reminds you

927
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,479
Lin Yue

928
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,240
It's always a bit

929
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:21,039
that

930
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,359
Be careful that he will play beauty tricks for you

931
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:25,240
Dad, your imagination

932
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,519
Isn't it too rich

933
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,760
I haven't seen any beauty

934
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:30,680
Restoring the beauty plan

935
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:33,559
Hello, is it Liu Jun?

936
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:36,120
Hello, I am Liu Jun

937
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
I am Yu Shanshan

938
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,160
Hello Miss Yu

939
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:41,640
Please sit

940
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,240
I've contacted the test center

941
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:48,320
According to our factory system

942
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:48,958
This experiment

943
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,439
You must be with me to enter

944
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:51,919
No more than three people each time

945
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,519
No, no

946
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,840
No one else

947
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,079
Just me

948
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:57,160
Testing Center

949
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,320
Free time this month

950
00:40:58,559 --> 00:40:59,999
It's from 5:00 to 8:00 pm

951
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,680
This is each type of test instrument

952
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,519
By unit time

953
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,680
Price list

954
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,240
Mr. Liu can take a look first

955
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,840
If you have any questions, please ask me

956
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:16,399
Nothing else is wrong

957
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,519
That's it

958
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,640
From five to eight o'clock

959
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,320
It seems inconvenient

960
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:23,120
sorry

961
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,399
This is the test center

962
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:25,280
Approved time period

963
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:26,280
Cannot change

964
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,399
All right

965
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,479
Then let's follow Ms. Yu's arrangement

966
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,640
I heard you are here

967
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,559
Chief Executive Wang

968
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,359
Is it going smoothly

969
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,079
Smooth

970
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,160
Very well arranged

971
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,959
What I arranged for you is

972
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,640
From 5:00 to 8:00 pm

973
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,079
Not very convenient

974
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:01,879
Actually it's OK

975
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,439
It's just this time period

976
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:04,600
Also relatively pure

977
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,559
Less disturbed

978
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Easier to live

979
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:09,120
Do you want to see me

980
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:10,439
Newly made samples

981
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,280
OK

982
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,359
This is just the first batch of experimental samples

983
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,959
Has been heated

984
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,879
Is it fast enough

985
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,999
I used to be like you

986
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,120
What a pity

987
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Insufficient funding

988
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:35,559
Still the same sentence

989
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,760
Have a hobby

990
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:37,959
Have strength again

991
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,320
I really envy you

992
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:41,840
Chief Executive Wang

993
00:42:42,078 --> 00:42:42,879
Xiao Yu

994
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:45,600
how

995
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,240
Did you take him to do the experiment?

996
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,919
The leader arranged for me to take charge

997
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,079
good

998
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:52,959
Mr. Liu

999
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:53,999
The procedures have been completed

1000
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,919
We can go in

1001
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:56,200
OK

1002
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:58,479
Borrowing a test center is not easy

1003
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,840
The cost is not low

1004
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,760
I won't delay you

1005
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,959
Time is precious

1006
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,959
To use it on the blade

1007
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,879
Talk less and do more

1008
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,320
I understand

1009
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,959
Thank you, Chief Executive Wang
