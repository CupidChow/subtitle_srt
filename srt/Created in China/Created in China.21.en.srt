1
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,479
taxi

2
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,640
Get on the bus

3
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,280
Don't think about getting in the car

4
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,878
You sit in there

5
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,200
Let's go Bingbing

6
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,840
Where did the car park

7
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,680
Just take a turn

8
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,680
I've had a drink today

9
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,719
I'll take a taxi back

10
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,199
Come and open tomorrow

11
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,319
What taxi do you take

12
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,719
My car is here

13
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,439
I'll send it back to you first

14
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,439
pony

15
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,439
Send him first

16
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,759
I hate myself a little

17
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,039
You said I can't

18
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,520
As cool as him

19
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,918
Why am I so unscrupulous

20
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,919
So easy to be upset

21
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,879
Because when you're thinking about marriage

22
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,520
It's about taking it with love

23
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,759
Connected together

24
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,319
But many men are not like this

25
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,400
They are at the stage of wanting to get married

26
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,478
I think you are the most suitable for you

27
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,199
I'd like to spend the second half of my life with you

28
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,199
Look more optimistic

29
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,120
Liu Jun is at least sincere

30
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,400
Want to marry you

31
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,800
That's why we propose at the same time

32
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,280
Start planning your married life now

33
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,918
People live to a certain age

34
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,599
Even naivety is shameful

35
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,560
Not for the world

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,319
Not even tolerated by friends

37
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,120
It's really sad to think about it

38
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,759
Let's go

39
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,759
What can you say until he waits

40
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,599
You can all be here

41
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,439
Why can't he

42
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,279
yes

43
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,600
Since it's a cool-off period

44
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,720
Then I'll calm down, too

45
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,439
What's so anxious

46
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,079
I haven't woken up yet

47
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,800
After listening to our words

48
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,920
Make sure you sober up

49
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,000
President Liu

50
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,120
Early Early

51
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
You can sit first

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,399
Tell me what's going on

53
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,439
After I go home

54
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,560
Have considered it carefully again

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,839
We've done it

56
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,680
It has been developed for several years

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Rich experience

58
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,720
And undergraduate engineers

59
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,040
Good math skills, too

60
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
It's actually possible to get all the manpower

61
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,240
It's Sister Tan who is right

62
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,040
The last time the imported CNC machine tool

63
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,279
When repairing by yourself

64
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,720
We are still under the leadership of President Liu

65
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,560
Modeling the transfer function

66
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,040
Very good dynamic stability

67
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,000
The entire team

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,319
Have a certain foundation

69
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,079
In addition

70
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,360
It's the robot system

71
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,279
R&D ideas

72
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,279
It can be used in our manufacturing industry

73
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,639
The most profound and cutting-edge

74
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,279
Machine tool design and manufacturing

75
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,560
in other words

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
We just want to make one

77
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,680
Precision CNC machine tool blank

78
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,279
We just discussed it

79
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,879
Everyone has personal resources

80
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,360
Can mobilize classmates and friends

81
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,159
Help with calculations

82
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,519
Save as much money as possible

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,480
Make R&D expenses

84
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
Reduce 30%

85
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,240
I can understand you more than anyone else

86
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,519
You are all experts, too

87
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,040
Calculus to use this time

88
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,560
Partial differential data analysis

89
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,079
General function analysis

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,680
That's a large amount

91
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,039
It's just about finding friends to take advantage of your face

92
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,360
Can you get it over?

93
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,759
Scientists must first

94
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,800
Analyze feasibility with a scientific attitude

95
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,959
This project

96
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,040
With the current financial capabilities

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,199
How much saving

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,519
Can't take it down, either

99
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,959
Say

100
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,240
Our company's technical transformation environment

101
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,519
Already very good

102
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,839
If we can't do it

103
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,879
Not to mention other homes

104
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,079
The more I think about it, the less hope

105
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,519
I understand what you mean

106
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,959
Technically possible

107
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,199
The key is the funding issue

108
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
To be precise

109
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,560
Technically I have some confidence

110
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,040
It's just not 100% guaranteed

111
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,639
But if there is no funds

112
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,920
That's completely impossible

113
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,959
sit

114
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,120
years ago

115
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,920
We have also proposed a domestic production

116
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,000
You know the equipment dealer abroad at that time

117
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,079
What are the reactions

118
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,560
They can say they don't care

119
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
Totally indifferent

120
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,160
Because at that time

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,480
They believe

122
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
China can't do it at all

123
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,839
Any independent research and development

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,879
But this time

125
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,160
I proposed to develop Donghai No. 1

126
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Less than a month

127
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,240
Foreign equipment dealers

128
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,759
It's already started to react fiercely

129
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,639
Not only do multi-party spy project parameters

130
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,600
Also revealing his opinion in public

131
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,759
You know

132
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,840
Does this mean anything

133
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,840
This means

134
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,159
We already have the foundation

135
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,519
And there is a possibility of final success

136
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm collecting

137
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,120
Information from all parties

138
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,399
Also prepare to hire an expert

139
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,279
Discussing the great significance of Donghai No. 1

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,279
Hope this can be obtained

141
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,759
National financial support

142
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,559
Your engineers

143
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,080
Now that you have started to draw up your ideas

144
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
This is a good thing

145
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,360
When you can't give up

146
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,279
It's better not to leave early

147
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,679
Is that true

148
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:31,919
I remember

149
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,960
It seems this one

150
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,360
No one

151
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,639
Didn't you be at home

152
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,320
peach

153
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,960
This is what people have worked hard to plant.

154
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,519
We can't pick it casually

155
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,120
Who are you looking for

156
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:57,720
I am

157
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,759
Who are you looking for

158
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,600
Sorry

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
My daughter first met

160
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Tomatoes growing in the ground

161
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,119
Just picked one

162
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Or I'll pay you money

163
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,399
Taozi quickly say sorry to grandma

164
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,440
quick

165
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,639
The children in the city have never seen these

166
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,360
If you like it, pick it, don't pay

167
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,320
The saying that if you fall behind is beaten

168
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,159
Before I go back to China

169
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,519
Haven't had a deep understanding

170
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,200
I thought as long as I had money

171
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,960
It can be taken for granted

172
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,519
Buy your favorite equipment

173
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,799
But in fact

174
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,840
We're not only going to encounter

175
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,879
High-tech embargo

176
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,120
Also faced with international equipment manufacturers

177
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,039
Offensive and Defensive Alliance

178
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,440
Especially that

179
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,639
There are only a few equipment that can be used

180
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,039
That's even more outrageously high

181
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,200
They unite

182
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,240
Violate market rules

183
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,240
Extremely arrogant towards Chinese buyers

184
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,039
What is shame

185
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,159
Being behind is shame

186
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,240
You really want to do it

187
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,279
Of course I thought about it

188
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,279
But I have the will but not the strength

189
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,039
You can't fight hard without food and grass

190
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,240
Have you ever thought about it

191
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,558
Introduce funds to participate in the stake

192
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,639
I don't think so, it's useless

193
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,679
Who is willing to invest

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,159
Who dares to invest

195
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,240
This question

196
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,159
I'll think about it again

197
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,600
the same as you

198
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,960
It's a good thing to have passion

199
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,679
But to be technically

200
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
Make a real breakthrough

201
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,759
You still have to grasp the overall situation

202
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,000
Have a rigorous planning

203
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,200
And various plans

204
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,320
You don't want it to be the end either

205
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,480
Let's lose all

206
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,679
Cut it a little smaller for me

207
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,440
good

208
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,559
Let's do it again

209
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,480
Come

210
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,559
I want this to be smaller

211
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,240
To mom

212
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,440
Aunt

213
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,559
You eat

214
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,519
Looks like I'm just a small piece

215
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,399
Your tomato is so delicious

216
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,080
Much better than what we bought in the supermarket

217
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,039
You people in the city eat

218
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,759
They are all in vegetable greenhouses

219
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,960
The ripening thing

220
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,399
Picture fast growth high yield

221
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
I eat and grow myself

222
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,559
The sun slowly burns

223
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,159
Of course the taste is different

224
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,039
Aunt

225
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,080
You planted it in the vegetable field

226
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,080
Vegetables, peppers, etc.

227
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,399
It's definitely much better than the ones in the market

228
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,159
We can't buy it if we have money

229
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,360
I want to buy more today

230
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,759
Do you see the price?

231
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,039
No money

232
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,120
These dishes have grown

233
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,679
Like to pick it yourself

234
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,840
Just a few dishes

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
It's OK to have no money

236
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,000
You hold it

237
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,639
Not only these dishes

238
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,159
I'm still optimistic that you'll raise this chicken

239
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,480
You can take this money first

240
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,559
Just think it's the deposit for buying a chicken next time

241
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,120
You can take more refunds and less compensation

242
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,519
Thank you

243
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,559
She didn't recognize you

244
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,759
I only happened when you first returned home

245
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Have seen her twice

246
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:51,840
So many years

247
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,000
Didn't recognize it

248
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,039
sit

249
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,720
Then before you go

250
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,919
Why didn't you call me?

251
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,240
You can leave this matter to me

252
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,960
You just stop interfering

253
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,919
Get in touch today

254
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,320
I don't think she is bad in nature

255
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,519
Just a moment of confusion

256
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,120
Have done something wrong

257
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,879
The punishment that should be received is also received

258
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,879
It should be given one

259
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,279
Opportunity to come back

260
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,759
But it's not enough to buy her vegetables

261
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,799
Do we have to think of one

262
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,879
A sustainable way

263
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,480
I've thought about this

264
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,639
Recently, a pension insurance was launched

265
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,279
There is a gear

266
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,279
Pay 30,000 yuan

267
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,000
By the second year

268
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,759
Can get one every month

269
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:35,919
Five or six hundred to support the elderly

270
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,320
I think this is especially suitable for her

271
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,200
I'll give it to you for 30,000

272
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,240
No

273
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,759
Since this money is to be given

274
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,799
You have to find a suitable method

275
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,480
You just leave it alone

276
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,639
yes

277
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,279
Everyone has dignity

278
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,399
You're still thinking carefully

279
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,360
OK

280
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,679
I'll leave first

281
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,159
What's going on

282
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,879
Which one of your family

283
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
Haven't coaxed back yet

284
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,759
Don't mention it

285
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,399
And she needs to calm her down

286
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,960
Hurry up the time

287
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,240
You can't coax it back

288
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,399
Carrie is going to intervene

289
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,080
Is it OK? Is it embarrassing to you?

290
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:13,799
Let's go now, what a big deal

291
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,639
You Tang Monk

292
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,600
Bye

293
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,039
Bye bye and leave

294
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,960
Sister Cui is here

295
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,879
Arrived

296
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:36,879
Let's go

297
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,279
I'll treat you to dinner first

298
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:39,879
Then what

299
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,039
Take you to the movie again

300
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,159
Thank you Sister Cui

301
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:42,679
Thank you Sister Cui

302
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:42,960
Thank you Sister Cui

303
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,960
Sister Cui is Friday today

304
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,200
You take us to do an event

305
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
What to do with your boyfriend

306
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,200
I'll care about him

307
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,919
Ice Ice

308
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:57,960
Ice Ice

309
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,160
Feed Bingbing

310
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,119
You're back home

311
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,519
Who allows you to enter the room

312
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,359
Who allows you to help me clean up the house

313
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,079
Don't treat yourself as an outsider

314
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,799
I'm not an outsider

315
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,240
Besides, didn't you give me the key?

316
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,880
Then I'm wrong again

317
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,839
Bingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingbingb

318
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,759
Can we both

319
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:50,839
Have a serious chat

320
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,440
Can you stop getting angry as soon as you speak

321
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,440
OK

322
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,000
Since we need to have a good chat

323
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,000
We'll spread the truth

324
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:05,480
In my opinion

325
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,240
Marriage life should

326
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,960
A model like my parents

327
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
No one is in charge or not

328
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,200
The whole family's money is put together

329
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,519
Whoever uses it will get it

330
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
No distinction between each other

331
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,720
Just do your best

332
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,119
Of course there is nothing wrong with this

333
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:22,680
But this is after all

334
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,000
Not the only way

335
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,759
And not

336
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,079
Can't discuss it at all

337
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,160
Be able to negotiate

338
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,279
Anything can be negotiated

339
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,720
It's just that you're now

340
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,400
Makes me feel very uncomfortable

341
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,920
I think you're on guard against me

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,279
It seems I'm getting married to you

343
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,319
Just greedy for your property

344
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,640
If you have to sign this agreement

345
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,880
Then let's sign one

346
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,319
Completely equal agreement

347
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,640
Don't talk about living expenses

348
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,359
Nonsense like you are responsible

349
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,640
Showing you are a man

350
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,559
Can you provide for me

351
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,480
I don't need it

352
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,319
Ice Ice

353
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,880
This agreement I proposed

354
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,319
It has nothing to do with equality

355
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,119
What you said is completely

356
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,279
Another thing

357
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,839
Since you can make your request

358
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,559
What's wrong with me adding one more equality

359
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,400
I insist on living expenses of half of each person

360
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,519
You don't have to be generous

361
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,480
never mind

362
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,200
You said you agreed

363
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,680
You're actually still gambled

364
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,880
Let's not talk about it today

365
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,319
I've been a little impatient lately

366
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,160
Plan to start from tomorrow

367
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,319
Go far away

368
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,640
Relax and relax

369
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,880
Wait until I come back

370
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,160
Let's have a face-to-face chat

371
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,279
Is it OK

372
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,880
You're going to travel far

373
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,519
Liu Jun, are you hiding from me

374
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,400
I'll give it to me when you come back

375
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,279
The final negotiation is right

376
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,839
Don't think about Bingbing too much

377
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,559
I may not have any signal to go to Qinghai

378
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,319
Miss

379
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,759
Please put away your small table

380
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,160
Hello sir

381
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,079
The plane is about to take off

382
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200
Please turn off your phone

383
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:23,759
good

384
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,279
Hello

385
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,759
The phone you called has been turned off

386
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,559
sorry

387
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,960
The phone you called has been turned off

388
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,240
Hello

389
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,720
The phone you called has been turned off

390
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,519
sorry

391
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,680
Don't worry

392
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,160
Our litigation requirements for you

393
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,079
It is supported

394
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,599
Just need to find some more

395
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,640
Related materials

396
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,240
Still a little cold

397
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,839
Looking for signals

398
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,799
yes

399
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,400
I'll shut down if I don't

400
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,880
I didn't turn on the computer at all

401
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,000
Didn't we say we'd come out and relax

402
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:56,839
You said you're going to get a cell phone

403
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,640
Here and here and there

404
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,000
What's the point of coming out?

405
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,920
Right

406
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,279
Then I'll turn off the phone

407
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
Turn off the computer now

408
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,720
OK

409
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,319
Ice Ice

410
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,400
Ice Ice

411
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,400
What’s wrong with you

412
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,799
What happened

413
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,880
I feel like I'm going to lose Liu Jun

414
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,640
All

415
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,559
Stop crying

416
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,640
Take a closer look

417
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,440
I'm in such a mess now

418
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,599
Is it the one you know?

419
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,240
I've always been one

420
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,759
A very reasonable person

421
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,480
But I don't know why

422
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,720
As soon as I met Liu Jun

423
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,240
My mind is confused

424
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,240
I don't want to talk to him properly

425
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,480
Just want to compete with him for a win or loss

426
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,839
Maybe in your subconscious

427
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
This is no longer just a loss or a win

428
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,400
It's a proof of love and not love

429
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,039
yes

430
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,839
What is missing

431
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,440
The more I want to prove what

432
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,799
Maybe what I've always lacked the most

433
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,640
It's Liu Jun's confidence in loving me

434
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
So I've been struggling there

435
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,880
It's so entangled that it's not like that

436
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,799
I can take it and let it go

437
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,880
Since you can figure it out

438
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,079
Then control yourself

439
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,880
Call him

440
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,559
Called

441
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,279
Can't contact at all

442
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,160
Don't know

443
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,319
He really turned off his phone

444
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,000
Still don't want to hear my voice

445
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,799
It's good not to call

446
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,359
Write an email

447
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,480
You have a tough personality

448
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,480
It's very likely to be on the phone

449
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,720
Emotionally upset

450
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,480
The process of writing emails is slower

451
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,359
What you want to say

452
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,039
Can also be explained more clearly

453
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,039
I'll be busy first

454
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,680
Why don't you go to play

455
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,200
I want to make a phone call

456
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
Does your phone have a signal

457
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,240
Show it to you

458
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,559
No

459
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,400
There isn't any of this movie

460
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,160
If you call

461
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,400
Have to go to town

462
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,880
Why do you think of your girlfriend

463
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,640
Have a little trouble before going out

464
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:23,799
Old King

465
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,720
Do you think I am

466
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,079
Very self

467
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,480
yes

468
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,200
Quite self

469
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:36,519
Not kidding

470
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,519
Not kidding

471
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,480
Haven't you been like this all the time

472
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,519
From principal to class teacher

473
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,720
Then to the female classmate who has a crush on you

474
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,680
You haven't always been

475
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,559
Is Mr. Liu the one who does his own good?

476
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,359
Yes

477
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,880
Think about it with Qian Hongming

478
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,400
You say you can do it

479
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,880
Don't say it, don't say it

480
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,680
Can we come out to relax

481
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,880
It's relaxing

482
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:08,000
Look at yourself from a different perspective

483
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,079
Thank you

484
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,119
You saw it for me

485
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,960
Come with me

486
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:23,680
I've returned to the East China Sea

487
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:24,400
times

488
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,279
Then two days will you not play

489
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:29,920
Don't play anymore

490
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,598
I have to go home

491
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,079
Hello

492
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,759
You know to call me

493
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,519
Where have you been going these days

494
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,039
Turn off the phone by phone

495
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,240
Don't reply to emails

496
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,160
Are you real

497
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,279
Want to break up with me

498
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,720
The signal in the northwest is not good

499
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:51,640
I've been shutting down

500
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,680
I don't bring a computer, either

501
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,079
What email did you send me?

502
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:57,880
Yours

503
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,200
What's the phone number of that lawyer

504
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,119
Send it to me

505
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,960
I'll contact him later

506
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,039
Sign today

507
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,759
Bingbing, are you okay

508
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:08,800
Are you sick

509
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,639
Are you at home

510
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:19,719
Ice Ice

511
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,119
Bingbing Where are you

512
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:25,960
You go back I'm fine

513
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,199
I haven't washed up

514
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,599
You open the door

515
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,679
I told you that you don't need it anymore

516
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,599
What are you doing

517
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,518
Why are you hiding from me?

518
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,559
I'll take a look

519
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,639
What's so cute about crazy

520
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,599
Very ugly

521
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,719
How could it be ugly

522
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,800
Not ugly

523
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,199
When I was in the northwest

524
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,800
I'm thinking of you every day

525
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:03,800
You miss me

526
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,239
You didn't call me either

527
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,039
It's all my fault

528
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,679
I was too careless before

529
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,519
Too abrupt

530
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,039
Hurt your feelings

531
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,519
Sorry Bingbing

532
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,639
Just know it yourself

533
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Eat slowly

534
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,719
Ice Ice

535
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,400
Then we

536
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:38,119
Set the wedding date

537
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,719
You didn't tell me

538
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:43,960
When you were in college

539
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,400
Do you want to be a June bride the most

540
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,719
I think you're not in a hurry to get married

541
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,239
You're anxious to stabilize

542
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,599
You can do your business

543
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:53,760
Where can I

544
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,760
Starting a family is just as important as starting a career

545
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,719
Then I want to make a request

546
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:04,920
What requirements

547
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,920
Wedding banquets will be held at the Crown Hotel

548
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,079
Just this requirement

549
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,320
Just this requirement

550
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,599
Why

551
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,920
Because of the Crown Hotel

552
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,239
It is the best hotel in Donghai

553
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,079
I like

554
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,400
OK, I'll listen to you

555
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,440
Is there any problem with Lin?

556
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:09,960
nothing

557
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,400
This brand is space on both sides

558
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,320
Put two more flower baskets

559
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,800
Hotel free

560
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,800
OK Arrange it now

561
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,199
Thanks Thanks

562
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,598
Thanks for attending today

563
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,480
Our wedding

564
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:37,760
Liu Jun

565
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,119
Congratulations

566
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,239
Old factory manager

567
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
You'll be more at ease

568
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,760
Drink it now

569
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,440
Are you unhappy? Don't worry about me

570
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,719
You'll have to hold it apart later

571
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,880
Don't cry

572
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,960
Stop having fun, hurry up and go to work

573
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,199
Old Zhu is back

574
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,480
What's wrong

575
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:27,880
This table is not accurate again at what time

576
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:29,599
Go well, go well, go well

577
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,920
dad

578
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,679
What are you here for

579
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,039
Don't go with the bride yet

580
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,000
What's this

581
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:44,360
Open and take a look

582
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,320

585
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:09,760
Look good or not

587
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,360

00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,639
Dad's old watch

589
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,599
Leave it to me as a souvenir

590
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,400
Happy wedding

591
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,440
You are also happy

592
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,239
Go, the bride is waiting for you

593
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,480
Congratulations

594
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,239
Sister Liang

595
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,079
Bingbing looks so good today

596
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,000
Thank you Sister Liang

597
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,239
Old Song can't come soon

598
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,639
I'll say sorry for him

599
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,840
Wherever

600
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,759
It's our honor to be here

601
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:34,719
He also asked me to tell you

602
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,440
He has prepared a gift for you

603
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,079
Let you get it after the marriage leave

604
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,320
That's great

605
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,679
Thank you Mr. Song for me

606
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:44,840
Wait until the holiday is over

607
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,840
I'll visit him right away

608
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,519
OK

609
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:47,639
Please

610
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,400
Please ask Sister Liang inside

611
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:49,239
OK OK OK

612
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,519
Look at you like this

613
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,480
I want to cancel my honeymoon

614
00:40:58,559 --> 00:40:59,880
Go straight to Donghai Group tomorrow

615
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,000
Take your gift

616
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:03,119
The acquired day is OK

617
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,519
Go get it now

618
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,440
Pain and pain

619
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,719
Be gentle, come

620
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:08,000
Hello

621
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,119
sorry

622
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,119
What's wrong

623
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,119
We got married back then

624
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,719
I invited my colleague to a table

625
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,320
I couldn't get one for you, either

626
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
A decent wedding

627
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,079
Is the situation different

628
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,360
Ice Ice

629
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,558
Thank you

630
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,360
I love you
