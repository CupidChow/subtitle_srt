1
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
Which factory is yours

2
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,799
Not transferred yet

3
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:47,680
It's nothing more than

4
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,359
Stuck in what I just said

5
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,598
Two key points

6
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,000
For you

7
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,280
Workers in the factory

8
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,759
To be placed

9
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,000
This is put first

10
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,280
OK, affectionate and loyal

11
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,159
I like this person the most

12
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,959
But those buyers

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,400
It's for the land

14
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,359
The entire Donghai City

15
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,598
just me

16
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,639
Doing a factory of the same type as your family

17
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,919
Then it's only me

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
Can eat so many hands

19
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,680
You said it's right

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,240
So in terms of money

21
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,039
I don't have to say more, right

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,560
You mainly rely on this money to build a factory

23
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,478
If it can be received in one go

24
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,280
Then your plan

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,520
Isn't it much more flexible

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,439
These two discounts I mentioned

27
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,439
That's right

28
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:43,639
Where is me

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,400
I am sincere in apologizing

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,520
Put it here

31
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,120
If you think it's OK

32
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,039
Please ask Director Liu for lunch and then go through the procedures

33
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,319
I'll make a deposit of one million first

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,639
How about it

35
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,080
make a deal

36
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,319
good

37
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,919
Have a decision

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,280
Very good

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
Then let's talk first

40
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,120
This thing

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,199
That's it

42
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,400
All right

43
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:27,039
Walk the road to the sky

44
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Meeting again or friends

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,598
good

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
Then take good care of the wound

47
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,400
A speedy recovery

48
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:56,079
The price of my finger

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,639
Isn't it pretty good

50
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,360
Maybe they cut it off

51
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,439
Not just a finger

52
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,199
And a part of my spirit

53
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,759
Can connect your fingers

54
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,279
But there are some things

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,519
It seems like I will never go back

56
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
He agreed

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,720
I've told you a long time ago

58
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,160
In this world

59
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,560
Nothing can be solved

60
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,399
Only the price that cannot be agreed upon

61
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
This Dr. Liu

62
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,800
Not as persistent as you thought

63
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,199
But the fingers were broken

64
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,319
It's the eternal scar

65
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,959
He will never forget it in his life

66
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,600
It's impossible to forgive

67
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,560
yes

68
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,759
This time

69
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,680
It's my brother, I'm sorry to you

70
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,720
no

71
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,920
Don't cry, don't cry

72
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,040
Don't cry Don't cry

73
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,199
Don't do this, don't do this

74
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,319
Heartache

75
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,639
Come and have some soup

76
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,000
I

77
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,399
I really didn't know at the time

78
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,040
That little book is that important

79
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
My son said

80
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,120
There is a friend in the city one machine

81
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,720
Want to ask for some ideas

82
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,120
Borrow that little book to read

83
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,959
Then let my son

84
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,399
Working in one machine in the city

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,920
Are you a quibble

86
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,159
No one steals data

87
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,079
It is impossible to have a single game in the city

88
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,079
Stealing my patent

89
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,600
It won't cause

90
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,720
My subsequent rights protection

91
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:03,959
In the final analysis

92
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,759
I'm lying here today

93
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,600
It's because of you

94
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,439
What face do you have to see me

95
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,639
I'm your nanny

96
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,279
I'm going to work

97
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
I have no choice

98
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,879
What a scoundrel

99
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,920
I admit

100
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,439
I've done this

101
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,600
I'm sorry for you

102
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,600
But I've been begging your dad before

103
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,199
Let my son enter Qianjin Factory

104
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,079
Be a temporary worker

105
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,040
He just disagrees

106
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:23,759
Then I don't have it, either

107
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,360
OK, I don't want to

108
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,160
Listen to you

109
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,360
You go out quickly

110
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,040
It hurts

111
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,720
Don't touch me

112
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,000
Liu Jun Liu Jun Don't be excited

113
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:35,879
Lying down

114
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,720
Please let her out quickly

115
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,839
You let her out

116
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,079
Aunt Fu

117
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,159
He's so excited you're here

118
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,279
Or you go first

119
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,720
His dad won't let me go

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,759
Who dares not listen to his words

121
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,519
you

122
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,759
Aunt Fu

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,959
If you refuse to leave

124
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,680
You can sit outside for a while

125
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,600
What a scoundrel

126
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Alright, okay

127
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,399
Mr. Lin

128
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,399
Director Liu

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,120
The big journey is coming

130
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,720
Come on, please sit on, please sit on

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,600
I've got the lawyer

132
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,759
Organizing the materials

133
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,839
Quite simple to do

134
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,680
Time-free

135
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,120
Let Lawyer Zhou bring the materials

136
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,800
You wait

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,800
etc.

138
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,600
How about Director Liu

139
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,720
Any instructions

140
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,799
Mr. Lin

141
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,240
My son agreed to your request

142
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
But I don't

143
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,799
Want to sign this agreement

144
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,519
I have to add a condition

145
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,919
Director Liu, we all agreed on the conditions

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,240
Prepare to sign a contract

147
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,919
Don't say so much

148
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,519
Mr. Lin

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,279
I know in your eyes

150
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm nothing

151
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,440
I'm weak and can be bullied

152
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,480
I'll let you do whatever you want

153
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:05,519
But this time it's different

154
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,039
Someone touched my son

155
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,639
My old life

156
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,919
Just be willing to go out

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,759
Director Liu

158
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,559
Director Liu

159
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,000
Not to

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
Not to Director Liu

161
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,159
Isn't this just adding a condition?

162
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:28,960
Yes

163
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,720
What are the conditions

164
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,240
Are you Fu Qiufang

165
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,759
I'll give it to that person

166
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
Have read the book

167
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,639
How is this a crime?

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,320
I'm not a bad person

169
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,039
I used to be a teacher

170
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll say it again

171
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,720
You and your son

172
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,759
Suspected of infringement of trade secrets

173
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,239
You are summoned for investigation now

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,360
It has nothing to do with my son

175
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,279
I only took a little money from them

176
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,000
It was my mistake

177
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,759
Comrades of the police

178
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,480
Don't catch my son

179
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,600
I did this

180
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,519
I did it

181
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,919
Don't catch my son

182
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,320
Moving factories to remote suburbs is a development trend

183
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,759
You see

184
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,360
After Liu Jun sold Qianzhang's factory

185
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,000
Didn't he leave the city

186
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,360
Have you been to Kunjiang to choose a site to build a new factory?

187
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,320
I understand the truth

188
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,360
In Mr. Lin's eyes

189
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,799
This is just one piece

190
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,639
A land that can make a lot of money

191
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,840
But for me

192
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,679
After all, I've been doing this for more than ten years

193
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,679
Old factory

194
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,240
There is inevitably some nostalgia

195
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,039
Then why did Mr. Lu come?

196
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,840
The one next to him

197
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,240
Didn't just dug it up

198
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,720
Is Mr. Dong a management company?

199
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,960
I heard it's still

200
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,759
What about Master of Business Administration

201
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,480
Being too high-level manager for foreign companies

202
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,000
Ideologically forward-looking

203
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,639
He's different from you

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,960
Not a technology

205
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,440
It's just

206
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,919
There is only one way to do the market

207
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,759
Good to do the market

208
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,759
Let's go to the market in the future

209
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,159
Factory Director

210
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,480
I want to continue to do it with you

211
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,519
Go to the new factory

212
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,759
No

213
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,000
Didn't Lin Yue place you?

214
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,879
This is too unreasonable

215
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
It clearly stated on the agreement

216
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,879
You don't have to worry

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,559
I'll go to him

218
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,320
No

219
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,519
The city is willing to keep people

220
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,639
There are also workstations

221
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,759
But the problem is

222
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,320
There are automation equipment there

223
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,759
Isn't it a waste of people if I go

224
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,600
Isn't this asking for trouble?

225
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,039
Old Huang

226
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,799
You said I don't know

227
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,120
How can I tell you

228
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,679
It's okay, you tell me

229
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,879
That's right

230
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,159
This new factory built by Ajun

231
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,799
Actually, it's the same as the one-machine in the city

232
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,759
Traditional equipment

233
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,360
Ajun doesn't plan to enter again

234
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,039
And very firm

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,159
Then what the factory manager means

236
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,399
I'll stop messing around in the future

237
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,159
Then of course not

238
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,000
Traditional processing factories are everywhere

239
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,639
Are you still worried about not being able to find a job

240
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,879
How many years will it take

241
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,960
Then I can't stay in the city

242
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,159
Going to a dead end

243
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,759
Factory Director, I want to go to Tengfei Factory with you

244
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,000
Here we go to Tengfei Factory

245
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,679
Don't you have the opportunity to study

246
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,720
No matter how hard or tired I'm willing to learn

247
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,600
Old Huang

248
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,039
That's what you said

249
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,639
It makes me feel so sad

250
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,080
Not so desperate

251
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,919
China is developing rapidly

252
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,399
But it's not coming soon

253
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,320
You are a craftsman

254
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,799
Can't find a job

255
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,399
You're dead end

256
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,440
How is it possible

257
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,080
Just based on your ability

258
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,480
When do you want to do it

259
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,360
You stand by the lathe

260
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,120
you

261
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,799
this

262
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,080
I have something to do

263
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:42,960
I'll leave first

264
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,240
I've never seen it

265
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,720
You're such a unknowing person

266
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,559
Do what you do

267
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,000
The factory will lose money sooner or later

268
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,519
We have something to say first

269
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,600
I won't suppress your price

270
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,679
Don't delay your project payment

271
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,519
You have to keep a close eye on the construction standards for me

272
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,159
How did you promise me that

273
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
My eldest son

274
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,639
Doesn't this error affect the intensity?

275
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,200
What I'm talking about with you is not the intensity

276
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,279
It's an attitude

277
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,879
good

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,799
You wait

279
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,080
I'll give you an attitude right now

280
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,399
You're waiting

281
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,879
It's really sick

282
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,879
dad

283
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,679
I've thought about Uncle Huang again

284
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,679
Or let's take off for him

285
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,639
Leave a place

286
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,960
Absolutely not

287
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,360
We're not eating a big pot

288
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,519
Raise him for the rest of your life

289
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,639
I'll tell you

290
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,200
The virtue of Lao Huang

291
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,159
Don't look at him pretending to be pitiful now

292
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,320
I really want to keep him

293
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,600
He's harder to wait for than anyone else

294
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,960
Come on, come on, let's not talk about these

295
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,120
Come and see what this is

296
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,879
I went to the bank to collect the new ticket today

297
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,279
I originally wanted to get a new version

298
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,960
Rising

299
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,600
How great is it to send a red envelope during the Chinese New Year

300
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,039
Not queued up

301
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,720
Come on, let's do it

302
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,559
Come on, I've thought about it

303
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,039
Come and help me get the red envelope

304
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,320
Divide one by one

305
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,240
I think that Director Zhou gave him three hundred

306
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,240
Electrician, construction

307
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,399
And those foremen who are technically

308
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,600
One person is enough

309
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,679
Don't have two hundred

310
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,399
One hundred and one hundred and five is enough

311
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,919
Save some

312
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,960
This is how the project works

313
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,639
It would be nice if they didn't deduct their money

314
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,759
Also send red envelopes

315
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,720
Your requirement is too strict

316
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,399
A building material

317
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,519
You need to do a strength test

318
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,039
Then they wouldn't want it long ago

319
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,879
It's full of complaints

320
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,440
I'll tell you

321
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,480
You're just taking advantage of the Chinese New Year now

322
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,320
Right, please comfort

323
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,480
Otherwise, your project

324
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,600
You don't want to complete it

325
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,720
It's their business that they complain.

326
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,440
I'm managing normally

327
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,919
You're not managing normally

328
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,279
In the eyes of the construction team

329
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,799
Construction is a rough job

330
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,240
Isn't it just building a house?

331
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,320
You're fine

332
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,399
I've never seen it

333
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,600
A person as delicate as you

334
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,720
The distance designed by others is only ten centimeters

335
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,279
The error is only one centimeter

336
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,159
You'll stop doing it

337
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,879
dad

338
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,200
One centimeter difference

339
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,480
That's one tenth away

340
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:07,279
OK

341
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,559
Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, you are right

342
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,559
Come and look at it

343
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,440
Underfoot

344
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,079
Why is this

345
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,319
Slow down and let go

346
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,279
Let's go

347
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,680
What's the situation?

348
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,559
Boss Liu

349
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:25,759
This is Manager Wei

350
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,720
Let's move here

351
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,680
Said it was a New Year gift for Mr. Xiao Liu

352
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,119
Manager Wei is too polite

353
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,839
This is quite heavy, this guy

354
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,160
Open to open and see

355
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,279
What's this

356
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,759
Go away

357
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,119
Isn't this yours before

358
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:50,920
When rework is required

359
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,480
Are the cement bumps knocked down?

360
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,720
This is a big red flower

361
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,839
OK

362
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,440
Just think I'm a cement head

363
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,480
Don't know what's going on

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,400
No matter how much he complains

365
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,799
The construction standards of this project

366
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,839
It is impossible to reduce it

367
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,599
Must follow my request

368
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,720
Someone outside Mr. Xiao Liu is looking for you

369
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,759
Who is it

370
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,319
Mr. Liu

371
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,519
Miss Yu

372
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,839
Does it still hurt

373
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,720
It's no longer painful

374
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,839
It's okay, just touch it

375
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,000
Can it be completely restored?

376
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:56,559
The doctor said that as long as you do a good job of rehabilitation training

377
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,160
You can recover 80% or 90%

378
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,359
I don't know when something happened to you

379
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,839
So I didn't visit you in the hospital

380
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:11,880
Been beaten

381
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,440
Cut off a finger

382
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,680
In the end, I can only make peace with the murderer

383
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,359
Such a disgraceful thing

384
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,359
Less than people know

385
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,079
sorry

386
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,279
Why are you sorry

387
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,200
If it wasn't for you

388
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,200
Foreign information

389
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,079
I said those words to stimulate you

390
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,000
What happened next

391
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,559
Maybe it won't happen

392
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,039
Don't be stupid

393
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,920
If you talk about cause and effect,

394
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,039
What's happening in the world

395
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,039
Can't contact

396
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,799
All are adults

397
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,519
Your own choices and behaviors

398
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,759
Of course I have to be responsible

399
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,400
That being said

400
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:58,960
But I was

401
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,599
Just shouldn't be so impulsive

402
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,200
Apology is useless now

403
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,599
I really hope I can do something for you

404
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,200
Then if you want

405
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,200
Make an appointment from time to time

406
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,039
Meet and chat

407
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,119
Isn't it good too

408
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,640
It's done

409
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,319
Old factory manager, you are here

410
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,720
Working all day

411
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,759
You see, you just took office

412
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,200
It's just so hard

413
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,400
The old factory manager

414
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,640
We're over today

415
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,079
Then go home after get off work

416
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:05,960
OK

417
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,000
Mr. Liu, I'll leave first

418
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:09,519
good

419
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,359
That's it

420
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,359
How about it

421
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,279
Are there any satisfactory calls?

422
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,559
It's good to have two engineers

423
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,279
I'll show you the information

424
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,599
Liao Guoping

425
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,839
There is also a Sun Worker Sun Haiyang

426
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,640
This young

427
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,799
If these two grow well

428
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,359
It's very hopeful to become our factory

429
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,559
The technical backbone of the future

430
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,359
You eliminated so many

431
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,558
Those who stayed must be wrong

432
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:33,720
Go home from get off work

433
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:35,279
Dad makes delicious food for you

434
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,599
I won't go back with you

435
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,640
I have something to do

436
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,519
You have a date

437
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,279

00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,279

00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:45,839
Bring dad with me

440
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,359
Dad will check it out for you

441
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,960
This is not suitable

442
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:51,279
Sorry, I'm here for the interview

443
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,000
Sorry, we've gotten off work

444
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:56,759
I

445
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,799
We take great care of the

446
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,960
Employees' concept of time

447
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,279
You don't follow the time

448
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,160
We don't need such employees

449
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,599
etc.

450
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,039
I just broadcasted the news yesterday

451
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:07,720
Forward table

452
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,480

453
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,640

00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,200
At least one and a half minutes

455
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,200
That's OK

456
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,599
Give you a minute

457
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,440
Make a self-introduction

458
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,000

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,480

I'll tell you

486
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,839
Hello

487
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,599
who

488
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,599
General Manager of the Municipal First Machinery

489
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,400
Mr. Dong

490
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,559
Mr. Liu

491
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,519
Dong Qiyang

492
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:32,558
Liu Jun

493
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,240
Lucky Meeting

494
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,960
Lucky meeting

495
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,119
Mr. Liu

496
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,839
Your office decoration

497
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,000
Very unique

498
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,559
This is the previous construction site

499
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Gift for me

500
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,400
I'll stay here for a souvenir

501
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
The construction party sends cement blocks

502
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,160
this

503
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,200
Is it a bullet in the envelope?

504
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,119
It means the same

505
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,720
They're not happy enough

506
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,920
It is better for your company, Mr. Lin, to act

507
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,000
Please sit

508
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,680
Mr. Dong is here today

509
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,079
It's for those four

510
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,799
I'm from the city

511
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,240
Did the technician be dug up?

512
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,480
You said those four people

513
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,839
As far as I know

514
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,039
In the factory

515
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,160
Not a technically leading talent

516
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,720
So Mr. Liu needs

517
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
Just dig it out

518
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,640
But among the people I interviewed

519
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:24,680
These four

520
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,400
It's the most meticulous job

521
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,079
Very promising

522
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Then you are not afraid of me if you confess so much

523
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,799
Dig them back

524
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,920
You can't poach this

525
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,160
Although I pay

526
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Same as you

527
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,720
But our learning

528
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,440
and promotion system are more perfect

529
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:42,920
You don't have such a corporate culture

530
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
So Dong Zong comes here

531
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,160
Is it for private matters or public affairs

532
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,039
Nothing about official or private matters

533
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,960
That's it

534
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,279
I have been listening to you by General Manager Wang.

535
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,720
So, I came here to see my name

536
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,079
I want to get to know each other very much

537
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,119
I've been in the industry in the past two years

538
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,440
Always in charge of sales

539
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,839
But I've always been with technicians

540
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,119
Very speculative

541
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:08,920
Come this time

542
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,720
There is also an admonishing request

543
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,480
Look at Mr. Liu, you are not convenient

544
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,000
Take me to visit your workshop

545
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,519
no problem

546
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,839
What about this factory

547
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,200
The fundamentals have been completed

548
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,319
It's a process on the ground

549
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,680
fine

550
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,559
After official operation

551
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,799
Always left

552
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,000
The previous series

553
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,599
I've heard

554
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,599
There is a company recently

555
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,079
A complete set has been developed

556
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,319
I know that

557
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,839
It's a company of my college alumni

558
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,920
He bought my drawings

559
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,200
But no added

560
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,200
Creativity and improvement

561
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:48,599
Just a copy

562
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,920
Just a series of low-end goods

563
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,960
It sounds like Mr. Liu is very

564
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,119
Don't like this practice

565
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,720
But as far as I know

566
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,799
There are still many companies in China

567
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,880
Willing to accept this

568
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,880
Low-end products with low prices

569
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,359
Our city one machine

570
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,440
A set of American drawings were also purchased

571
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,000
Preparing for mass production

572
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,839
We plan to keep going

573
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,599
High-quality routes for independent research and development

574
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,039
That's good

575
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,079
Products on both sides of our

576
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,240
No competition

577
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,359
No competition

578
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,200
Isn't it

579
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,640
Mr. Liu is so confident

580
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,279
In the market of mechanical products

581
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
High-precision mechanical components

582
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,279
Although at the top

583
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,200
But the demand

584
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,440
Never been big

585
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,119
The largest proportion

586
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,799
Often mid-range products

587
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,440
Mr. Liu knows

588
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:51,720
Is this why?

589
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,200
Because the buyer of mechanical components

590
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,759
Generally, they are the manufacturer of products

591
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,359
And the user of the product

592
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,519
That is, consumers

593
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,480
often

594
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,799
Can't tell the difference much

595
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,079
So a sloppy mid-range product

596
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,640
Often the market has the largest sales volume

597
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,200
If sales go up

598
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,119
The price is getting lower and lower

599
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,359
Will sell better and better

600
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,519
On the contrary, my high-precision products

601
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,720
If sales don't go up

602
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,960
The cost will naturally not be reduced

603
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,079
If you can't survive

604
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,640
Finally, I can only return to the mid-range market

605
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,720
Compete with you

606
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:36,960
And by that time

607
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,160
You're completely invincible

608
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,079
There is a saying called

609
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,079
Bad money drives out good money

610
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,319
That's what I mean

611
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,279
certainly

612
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,400
If Mr. Liu doesn't believe it

613
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,799
We can have a gamble

614
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,759
How much do you bet

615
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,640
I dare to answer

616
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,078
But mechanical manufacturing is not gambling

617
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,519
It cannot be eager for quick success or instant benefits, either

618
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:11,880
yes

619
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:13,559
I admit

620
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,480
Your goal is great

621
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,359
The exploration direction is also correct

622
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,160
only

623
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,319
At this stage

624
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,680
Especially in such a market environment

625
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,880
The future of taking off

626
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
I don't think so well

627
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,359
Disturbed

628
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,519
Is it correct?

629
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,359
Liu Jun

630
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,439
Come out and help me see if it is correct or not

631
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,519
Here comes

632
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,519
High point on the left

633
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,079
After passing, after passing, after returning

634
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,680
Here's it

635
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:47,880
What's this drawing

636
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,240
A thousand-year-old bug

637
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,519
Look at this eyebrows and look at this expression

638
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,440
Painted by Carrie

639
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,440
Like you or not

640
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
What does it mean

641
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,240
He drooped his face when he came in

642
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,599
I think my wife is not well drawn

643
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,200
Yes or no

644
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,480
I'll tell you after posting

645
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,799
What post

646
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,160
About the new German models

647
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,119
Some thoughts

648
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,720
Author whirlwind screwdriver

649
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,799
You're writing an article here

650
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,000
Does anyone watch it

651
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,279
Are you not involved in the forum

652
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,599
On the automotive sector of Donghai Online

653
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,079
Famous large slab bricks

654
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,440
My ID (account)

655
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,359
Still has some influence

656
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,599
It's just that I'm in reality today

657
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,480
It's really a brick shot

658
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,400
What are the slanderous words of the netizen

659
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,200
Can't understand

660
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,559
What I mean is

661
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,519
I'll get off work

662
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,599
Been ridiculed

663
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:47,880
Who is it

664
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,160
Dong Qiyang

665
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,640
This place has a signpost

666
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,400
Not yet

667
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
How did you misread the address

668
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,599
Get yourself here

669
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:23,920
Excuse me

670
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,720
I really can't wait for a car here

671
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,039
I can only trouble you

672
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,519
What are you polite

673
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,279
If you have something to think of me

674
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,920
I'm happy yet

675
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,240
There are few people in this road condition

676
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,400
I'll give you a feeling of pushing your back

677
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,799
Speed up very quickly

678
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,079
I'll tell you

679
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,279
I often go to that one

680
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,799
There is a great man in the car forum

681
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Absolute technical flow

682
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,640
The posts are very professional

683
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,119
I'm following his post

684
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,400
I'm looking for someone to adjust my car

685
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,319
How does it feel

686
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
I don't know the car

687
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,400
Can't feel it

688
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,680
I see Dong Qiyang

689
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,519
It's here to attack you

690
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,000
Give

691
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,319
But what's scary is

692
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,400
I actually think what he said

693
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,759
It really makes sense

694
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,720
Bad money drives out good money

695
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,039
There must be some phenomenon.

696
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,839
It will not be eliminated in the short term

697
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,720
But I think this Mr. Dong

698
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,400
Have been engaged in market and sales for a long time

699
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,559
It's still a bit biased to look at the problem

700
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,920
A little narrow

701
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,720
I love listening to what you said

702
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,079
Quick, quick

703
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,440
Encourage me

704
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,640
From me doing foreign trade

705
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,000
See the contact situation

706
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,759
The market segmentation is extremely large and complex

707
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,720
It is simple to use high school and low

708
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:05,839
To summarize three words

709
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
It's a bit rough indeed

710
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,679
Those really high-end

711
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,440
Products with technical content

712
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,920
Their market share

713
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,440
It exists forever

714
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,440
How could it be replaced so easily

715
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,840
Don't forget

716
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:17,719
And country

717
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,719
For high-tech industries

718
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
What about the support policy

719
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,360
yes

720
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,400
But my dad put all the money

721
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,760
All are on me

722
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,679
Take off

723
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,280
There's nothing now

724
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
The cost of trial and error

725
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,400
And this Dong Qiyang said

726
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,598
I'm a little upset inside

727
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,119
I don't know the path I chose either

728
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,960
Did you go right or wrong

729
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,559
I'm not worried about the market for your products

730
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,159
I'm worried

731
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,440
It's your liquidity

732
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,360
The first batch of equipment has been installed

733
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,360
There's not much cash left

734
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,119
This is waiting for our factory

735
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,199
After getting on track

736
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,480
There is a bank loan

737
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,320
Are you the only loan left?

738
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,960
I've come into contact with many customers

739
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,119
They say

740
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,360
Loans for private enterprises are particularly difficult

741
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,559
Don't expect to be too optimistic

742
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,639
We have high technical content

743
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,400
Good growth in the company

744
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,239
Plus, the old factory has a business deal

745
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,159
Big in and out

746
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,480
Bank loan officers want to know

747
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,159
The loan officer can only listen to three points

748
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,000
They all attract customers

749
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,079
You

750
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,480
Just hurry up and try it out

751
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,719
Let's talk about the future

752
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,920
But it's good if you're a little bit of popularity

753
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,199
Maybe this time

754
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,920
Another good hand of cards

755
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:27,800
I'm leaving

756
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,840
You wait for me

757
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,000
Wait for me to change my clothes

758
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,320
Let's go out for dinner together

759
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,558
My mother-in-law is not at home

760
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,000
I have to go home to cook

761
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,480
Don't, you've got this one

762
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,239
Let's eat together

763
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,360
Bring the little peaches with you too

764
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,880
I heard you are a childless person

765
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,639
You hurry up the time

766
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,920
Find a girlfriend

767
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:43,960
Leave

768
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,079
I'll go to your house to eat too

769
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,000
You're working now

770
00:35:59,119 --> 00:35:59,840
How does it feel

771
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,320
fine

772
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,039
Thank you for introducing my work

773
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,038
Our boss said

774
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,239
You guys are the guys

775
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,159
He and I are not a good friend

776
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,559
It's a business partner

777
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,159
He has something for us in business

778
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,400
It's still early now

779
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:17,880
I heard

780
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,000
The latest "Gladiator"

781
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:19,920
Very good

782
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,360
Or let's have a meal

783
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Go and watch a movie

784
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,079
I'm a little tired today

785
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,760
Want to go home and rest

786
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,360
What if it's another day

787
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,400
Call all your friends together to see

788
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:31,639
How lively people

789
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,760
OK, then another day

790
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:00,360
Why are you here

791
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,400
It's rare to have time today

792
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,639
Come here

793
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,880
Sorry not to call in advance

794
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,239
I heard you've been busy supervising the work

795
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,679
You can leave the customs today

796
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,599
The factory has been completed

797
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,880
But the equipment has not been installed yet

798
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,320
There are just a few days left

799
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,280
that

800
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,239
I heard

801
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,320
The latest release of "Gladiator"

802
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,119
Very good looking

803
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,159
Let's go watch a movie

804
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,280
I heard it looks pretty

805
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,679
Yes

806
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,239
I'm really tired today

807
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,920
Go to work again tomorrow

808
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,000
What if it's another day

809
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,440
Good to be another day

810
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,000
Hello Hello Hello

811
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,079
Hello Lu Huadong

812
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,960
Sorry, I didn't bring a business card

813
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,320
Liu Jun

814
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,719
Yes Liu Jun

815
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,599
Long-term view, long-term view, long-term view, long-term view

816
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,159
Can't say that I'm long-term

817
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,679
It's really not a polite

818
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,760
I've heard a lot of people lately

819
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,760
All mentioned you

820
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,519
Lingzun is the major shareholder of Shiyiji

821
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,320
Master Lu heard someone mention me

822
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,840
There's probably nothing good to say

823
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,360
Anyway, at least I've heard it now

824
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,880
Except for someone

825
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,119
All praises to you

826
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,079
OK Let's go another day

827
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,320
Watch movies and movies

828
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,599
Watch movies together

829
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,400
Bye-Bye

830
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,480
Bye-Bye

831
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,679
Mr. Liu

832
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,519
Your company has just been established

833
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,199
Financial data that can be evaluated

834
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,000
None

835
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:33,639
I'm afraid it doesn't fit our bank

836
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,920
Conditions for applying for a loan

837
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,480
How could there be such a limitation

838
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,199
There is a company next door to our factory

839
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,599
Work has just started

840
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,800
I've already given a loan

841
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,440
I know the one you mentioned

842
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,000
It is a state-owned enterprise branch

843
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,599
There is also guarantee from the group headquarters

844
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,199
The situation is completely different

845
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,880
But you have also said

846
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Our factory concept is advanced

847
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,039
Good growth

848
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,440
It is a high-quality enterprise

849
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,960
I don't deny this

850
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,280
But bank lending has its own stakes

851
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,360
Private enterprise risk control

852
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,800
Always clutched tightly

853
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,960
Even if I took your materials

854
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:03,840
Handed on

855
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:06,039
It is impossible for the above to approve it

856
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,920
Then the hard leverage of this financial statement

857
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,280
What kind of indicators should be achieved

858
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,079
That's fine

859
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:14,960
this

860
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:16,880
This loan

861
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,159
Is there no hope at all

862
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,679
What did this loan officer say

863
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,159
What kind of report looks like

864
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,239
It's pretty

865
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,039
Make a report again

866
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,519
Didn't we agree?

867
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,119
New factories must be legal

868
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,639
Can't make fake accounts anymore

869
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,719
What is fake accounts

870
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,759
I'm asking you

871
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,960
How to do this report

872
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,719
Only qualified financial statements

873
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,239
How can I make fake accounts

874
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,800
If it's not fake

875
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,119
The factory must at least operate

876
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,199
More than half a year

877
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,320
Only make a copy

878
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,920
Reports that satisfy the bank

879
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,280
But we have our own funds now

880
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,039
Can't hold on for half a month

881
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,239
It's all my fault

882
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,800
I was too optimistic before

883
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,719
In the early stage of building a factory and recruiting people to buy equipment

884
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,880
Too much investment

885
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,400
No turning back arrow

886
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,599
You tell dad

887
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,039
Just do what's next

888
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,920
Equipment in our factory

889
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,719
One must be installed to enable one

890
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
Even if it is external processing

891
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,079
It must not be idle either

892
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,519
Not just processing

893
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,800
If you need auxiliary design, you can also

894
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,960
You'll report the price higher

895
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,719
I have confidence in my abilities

896
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,400
OK

897
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,760
I'll run the business

898
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,198
No problem finding processing

899
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,079
But then we have to face it

900
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Production and installation

901
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,639
The two lines are in parallel

902
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,159
The capable manpower has not been developed yet

903
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,519
You can't fight too hard

904
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,000
Have to hold on even if you are tired

905
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:46,800
No factory

906
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,920
Production has not started yet

907
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,800
Let's collapse first

908
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,480
lead

909
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:08,880
Lao Gao

910
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,119
Find a place to sit

911
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,880
Let's be quieter

912
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,119
Isn't it OK

913
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,440
You're too exaggerating

914
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,559
I finally went on a business trip to my home court

915
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,920
Can you please treat it well?

916
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:21,840
Listen to me today

917
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,639
Have a meal first

918
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,199
I've arranged a program for you tonight

919
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,119
Walk

920
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,719
Sir, your car key

921
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:28,639
Thank you

922
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,000
Become fat

923
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,119
Live a life

924
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,360
Come

925
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:47,239
OK

926
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,280
Don't hold it in

927
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,559
What do you want to ask

928
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,679
Ask

929
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:58,719
I know

930
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,320
Your SAR policies are different

931
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,079
High salary

932
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,199
But I didn't expect

933
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,440
It's so high
