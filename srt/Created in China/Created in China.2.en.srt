1
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Sir, are you okay

2
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,960
Didn't fall

3
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,319
No, okay

4
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,599
I'm active activities

5
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,920
What to eat tonight

6
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,319
I'll get the medicine and come back soon

7
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,879
Thanks for your hard work

8
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,960
How long have you been discharged from the hospital?

9
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,080
Just go play basketball

10
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,719
I wouldn't let you out if I had known

11
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,840
You said nothing

12
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,319
You won't let me go to the factory

13
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,039
Just keep me at home

14
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,559
Why am I facing the wall

15
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,640
Uncle Xu called me on the way

16
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,478
Talk about the qualifications of general taxpayers

17
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:31,439
Passed the review

18
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,640
Reassure you

19
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,879
I'll tell you

20
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,999
Thank you for saving this big order

21
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
Our net profit for the whole year

22
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,038
Just met the standard

23
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:43,200
Otherwise this qualification

24
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:43,960
It's definitely not guaranteed

25
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,680
I'll tell you

26
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,439
What is this

27
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
General taxpayer qualifications

28
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,279
Is it that important

29
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,559
Of course it matters

30
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,640
I'll tell you

31
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,439
You sit down

32
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,840
well

33
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,520
I'll sit down and tell you

34
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,680
Our industry

35
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,159
This product has a factory price

36
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,400
It is based on the price of raw materials

37
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,840
Add thirteen percent to set

38
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,159
Once you become a small taxpayer

39
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,080
That's different

40
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,200
At that time

41
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,599
No matter how much our cost

42
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,999
What is the gross profit

43
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,439
Then just press

44
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,840
The transaction price of each transaction

45
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,439
Three percent

46
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,640
I forgot about three o'clock

47
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,920
Anyway, I'll pay taxes at about three o'clock

48
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,319
Then look at this knife to cut

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
No matter who it is

50
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,039
All can only pay and not earn

51
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,520
What's the point of opening a factory

52
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,799
Profits from domestic manufacturing

53
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:27,679
So thin

54
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,400
Thin

55
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,119
Thinner than this newspaper

56
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,279
You're a Ph.D.

57
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,880
You understand

58
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,279
It should be a little faster than others

59
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,279
Get to know slowly

60
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,320
You see what's said

61
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,200
January 1, 1999

62
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,799
The euro is about to officially start

63
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,479
This is the world of this century

64
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:48,919
Ah Jun

65
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:52,520
Go back and change to this Mark

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,440
It will become an antique in a few years

67
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:55,919
dad

68
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:58,520
I promised to stay for you for only one year

69
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,560
And I'm only responsible for designing new products

70
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,520
Church of new crafts

71
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,719
Helping to move forward

72
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,960
Can operate efficiently

73
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,960
Manage sales like this

74
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,119
I won't be involved too much

75
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,039
So

76
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,560
After you can go to work

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,479
Just call them

78
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,719
No need to report to me about my work

79
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,400
You don't have to do it every day.

80
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,760
Keep your succession in your mouth

81
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,359
Faits Accomplishment

82
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,919
I won't admit it

83
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:21,479
Anyway, you'll stay for a day

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,320
I'll be happy for a day

85
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,080
I've taken a shower

86
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,159
Have cooked the meal

87
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,159
I'm a patient

88
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,239
I'm still having a needle

89
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,400
You're cured

90
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,719
All can play ball

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,960
This is Cordyceps sinensis

92
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:40,960
How much does it cost

93
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,880
50,000 yuan per pound

94
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,479
More expensive than ginseng

95
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,880
sister

96
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Small steel mill

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,080
I have to beat it into powder

98
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,440
In the second cabinet on your left

99
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:02,960
See

100
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,840
Such an expensive thing

101
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:11,880
Don't buy it in the future

102
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:12,880
Not much money

103
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,159
My salary has increased

104
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,239
Affordable

105
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:18,679
sister

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
After Liu Shitang woke up

107
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,960
Didn't contact you

108
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,440
What are you asking about this

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,320
He Liushitang is blessed

110
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,719
Liu Jun has finished solving the matter

111
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
He woke up

112
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,719
But I have to remind you

113
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,880
Whether he wakes up or not has nothing to do with us

114
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,640
Don't go see him

115
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,679
Mainly Liu Jun

116
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,919
He may not be able to face you

117
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:29,359
Is it okay

118
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,119
Thirsty

119
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,880
Drink some water

120
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,799
I accidentally beat the cup

121
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,200
Try again

122
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,000
Do you need medicine

123
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:05,919
dad

124
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,560
Don't be here to accompany

125
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,320
Go back to sleep

126
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,320
I'll call you if you have something

127
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,320
I'm sleeping heavily

128
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,760
Afraid of not hearing

129
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,479
I'm not like this every day

130
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,279
Go

131
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,200
It's been so many days

132
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:30,799
What about tomorrow

133
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,080
Let's go see the doctor

134
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,039
You still want to do this

135
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,080
I'm not at ease when I leave

136
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,960
I'll get sick this time

137
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,519
I feel like I'm old

138
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,680
Always thinking about the past

139
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,320
We lived in a bungalow at that time

140
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,719
My mother and I

141
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,759
Lead you to the Youth Palace to practice piano

142
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,080
The piano is still there

143
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,119
Can't play anymore

144
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,239
Probably not accurate

145
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,800
Didn't take good care of your mother

146
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,680
This is my lifelong regret

147
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,599
This table

148
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,280
It was when I got married to your mom

149
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,399
Your mom gave me a gift

150
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,080
How fast

151
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,560
It's been almost thirty years now

152
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,680
You're almost thirty

153
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,320
No longer accurate

154
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,440
But it doesn't matter

155
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,920
This time I've been sick

156
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
Maybe I will

157
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,999
If you want to leave

158
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,680
Hold it

159
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,479
Just leave a memorial

160
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,200
I don't want it

161
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,599
You keep it

162
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,800
Drink less water at night

163
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:43,800
The doctor said the kidneys are burdened

164
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,879
The doctor told me too

165
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,680
There must be people around me

166
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,359
Can you not leave

167
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,560
I'm sleepy

168
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,999
Go upstairs to sleep

169
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,280
What about here

170
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,800
You'll be next time

171
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,200
You just put that car

172
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,519
Stop the basement

173
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,800
From there you can get on the elevator

174
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,999
Come

175
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,599
How could I get it

176
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,280
I've never lived in a luxury house

177
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,879
What a luxury house

178
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,200
This is a house

179
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,599
Why are you still holding potted flowers

180
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,399
Are you rustic or not

181
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,920
Moving to a new home

182
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,479
Now it's fashionable to send this

183
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,840
Meaning that family harmony is prosperous

184
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,519
When you move

185
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:20,399
I didn't give you it either

186
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,359
You'll take this back later

187
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,639
Just think I gave it to you

188
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,560
Count you have money

189
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,960
You're stingy

190
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,560
Your surname is Qian

191
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,040
Look at Carrie

192
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,320
Look at Liu Jun’s beautiful big house

193
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:37,960
living room

194
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,040
The south-facing side connects to the study room

195
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,759
This is the piano that Liu Jun played when he was a child

196
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,759
This is Liu Jun's mother

197
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,359
This silly boy is pretty handsome

198
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,800
Here

199
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,960
This should be the bedroom

200
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,280
Liu Jun

201
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,040
Can I take pictures in the bedroom?

202
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,840
Hello

203
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,200
Just take a photo

204
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,680
Have you photographed Jiali yet?

205
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,399
go

206
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,040
OK

207
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,359
good

208
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,479
Carrie comes and see

209
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,759
Let's take a look at the bedroom

210
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,359
it's beautiful

211
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,680
Look outside

212
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,639
Facing the atrium, not facing the street

213
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,040
There is also a garage underground

214
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,440
Look at this decoration

215
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,280
Really good

216
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,440
All real materials

217
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:39,960
Liu Jun

218
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,840
This is a model house, right?

219
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:44,840
yes

220
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,920
That's all that left at that time

221
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,320
My dad bought it for me quickly

222
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,920
A community like yours

223
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:55,639
All East China Sea

224
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,119
No more than three

225
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,239
I've done nothing this time

226
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,440
My dad made it for me first

227
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,599
Such a big two-bedroom apartment

228
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,639
I bought me a new Jetta

229
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,239
Yes, Mr. Liu

230
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,399
Stop laughing at me for being stressed

231
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,320
Why are you under great pressure

232
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:14,920
Your dad

233
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,399
Neither you are required to stay and take over

234
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,999
I won't set a production target for you

235
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,239
During this year

236
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,639
You just do technical supervision

237
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,479
Not as simple as you said

238
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,280
Manager Qian

239
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:25,119
Come on come on

240
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,119
Cooked

241
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,519
Be careful

242
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,359
Thank you aunt

243
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,080
Be careful of hot

244
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,840
Thank you aunt

245
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,879
Moving to a new home to eat sweets is a beginning

246
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,719
There is no need to eat a lot

247
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,560
Just eat two for one person

248
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,840
OK Thank you for your hard work

249
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,040
You're welcome

250
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,639
Nothing happened today

251
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,399
Then I'll leave early

252
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,719
Then you go back first

253
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:46,680
OK, you guys eat slowly

254
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,920
Goodbye Auntie

255
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:49,040
goodbye

256
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,759
Your aunt

257
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,560
Very good temperament

258
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,320
She's not an ordinary aunt

259
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,238
Before

260
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,320
Teaching in the countryside

261
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,879
Later my mom was transferred to the city

262
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,119
I think about it now

263
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,399
This situation of the factory

264
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,879
My head is about to explode

265
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,119
I can't sleep well

266
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,239
Not so

267
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,399
Primary processing is for you

268
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,560
It should be very simple

269
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,320
During the crisis before

270
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,200
You can turn the turmoil as soon as you make a move

271
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,239
Right

272
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,999
That's the problem here

273
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,879
What kind of crisis is that

274
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,519
It's a very simple

275
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,479
Technical barriers

276
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,599
Come and sit

277
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,800
Through a particularly simple

278
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,399
Design correction can be solved

279
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,320
If this is my team in Germany

280
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,200
I don't need to take action at all

281
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
My assistant solved it

282
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,280
But in my dad's factory

283
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,920
So many in this industry

284
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,359
An old worker who has worked for decades

285
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,879
There is no way to do it

286
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,119
Can only have a stroke

287
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,440
Waiting to die

288
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,519
But this is the current situation in China

289
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:01,800
I'm doing foreign trade

290
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:02,999
See more

291
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,960
This belongs to the overall industry

292
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,960
Exist with others

293
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,440
The problem of technical generation difference

294
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,879
It's not really technology

295
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,119
I think the big problem lies in

296
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,920
Management and talent training

297
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,080
Listen to your tone

298
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,800
You want to be fundamentally

299
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,239
Change the current situation of domestic manufacturing

300
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,519
Just you alone

301
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,119
How much can it be changed

302
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,759
Otherwise, what should I say

303
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,920
I can't sleep

304
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,680
It's easy to find fault

305
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,879
It's hard to find a way out

306
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,479
I regret it a little now

307
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,200
Take this stall for my dad

308
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,320
I'll be back for a year if I'll be sure

309
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,479
Of course

310
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,879
The current development momentum of China is very strong

311
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:49,519
Opportunities everywhere

312
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,399
It's a hot spot for entrepreneurship

313
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,680
You're missing

314
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,719
Have both ability and resources

315
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,719
Plus the current national and local

316
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Industrial support policies

317
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:00,479
As long as you have the skills

318
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,519
The chance of success is still high

319
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,200
If you don't come back

320
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,079
Show off your fists

321
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,319
Start a career

322
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,680
I really feel sorry for this era

323
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,839
You listen to what you said

324
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,520
Also use a handkerchief

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,520
You're like a director

326
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,040
Don't persuade me if you have it

327
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,760
I said I'll stay for one year

328
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,079
Let's take a look

329
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,240
A house will be sold to you in a year

330
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,560
I'll add some more

331
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,040
Do you still eat it

332
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,320
I've enough

333
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,520
Who can afford it

334
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:48,720
Look at you

335
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,879
Such a big reaction

336
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,359
What other work

337
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,760
You quit and rest at home

338
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,359
I'll peel an apple for you

339
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,560
Press one pressure

340
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:07,159
My salary is not high

341
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,280
After all, it's an income

342
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,720
The child is born

343
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,480
There are more places to spend money

344
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,919
Let's talk about mom's side

345
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,040
Medical expenses are not small

346
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,520
You're too stressed

347
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,879
Why are I under great pressure

348
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,679
Mom has enough medical expenses

349
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,840
Let's talk about it

350
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,199
We are already well-off

351
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,399
If we can't afford to raise children

352
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,639
How can we live

353
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,359
Listen to my resignation

354
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,959
You can pick it up

355
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,199
Your little hobbies

356
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,520
Yes

357
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:43,959
But among my classmates

358
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:45,599
No one has quit yet

359
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,040
Taking care of children at home

360
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,159
If you don't want to refuse, you won't refuse

361
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,199
Are you the same as a human

362
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,199
Listen to me

363
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,560
OK OK OK Don't say it

364
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,639
I see

365
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,320
Come on come on to me

366
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,040
Didn't you have an appointment for dinner?

367
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,760
Go quickly and don't be late

368
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:01,800
quick

369
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,599
Just a few classmates

370
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,199
Have an appointment to greet Liu Jun

371
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,000
It doesn't matter if it's late

372
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,320
that

373
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,359
Haoyuan sweet and sour pork ribs are delicious

374
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:16,359
I'll bring you a box when I'm back

375
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,359
You see

376
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,399
This is vomiting again

377
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,199
You listen to my resignation

378
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:24,760
Slower

379
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,480
Liu Jun

380
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,760
Give

381
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,800
What's this

382
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,639
The three students I made an appointment with you today

383
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,720
All are very important

384
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,919
These are three high-end brands of tie

385
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:53,840
You'll give it to them later

386
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
Just say it's from Germany

387
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,520
Gifts brought to them

388
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:00,800
You're doing things

389
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,159
Very thoughtful

390
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:05,159
good

391
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,000
You didn't say I was vulgar

392
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,399
Where is Carrie

393
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,959
Why didn't I bring it with me?

394
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,919
Carrie is pregnant

395
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,840
Rest at home

396
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,439
When did it happen

397
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier

398
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:19,760
Do you understand silly kid?

399
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:20,720
Not until three months

400
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,199
Can't tell others

401
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,040
Then didn't you tell me this

402
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,399
Silly kids are not human

403
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:28,399
Who is stupid?

404
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,359
Who is stupid to say

405
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,399
I'm stupid kid I'm stupid

406
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:31,800
Then who is not a human

407
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:35,879
This big yellow croaker

408
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,199
Choking crab

409
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:41,959
Shrimp tofu

410
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,359
Another pan-fried hairtail fish

411
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,560
Pack

412
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:47,159
Thanks

413
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,959
OK

414
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,080
How about it

415
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,879
The environment here is good

416
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,679
It's true

417
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:02,560
Very luxurious

418
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,080
This garden

419
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,599
All Donghai can be ranked

420
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,480
Guess who the boss is

421
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,199
How could I know about this

422
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,359
One of the major shareholders of Shiyiji

423
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:14,520
Lin Yue

424
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,720
Donghai No. 1 Machinery Factory

425
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,320
Isn't it a state-owned enterprise?

426
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,760
Why are there major shareholders

427
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,000
Already modified

428
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,959
I've changed hands three times in the past few years

429
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,240
City one machine

430
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,040
Now it's a pure private enterprise

431
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,919
First sold to a wealthy businessman

432
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,639
Later it was handed over to

433
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,240
A female overseas Chinese in the East China Sea

434
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,320
At the end of last year

435
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,520
Lin Yue and Dongfu Group

436
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:39,879
Eat all over again

437
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,720
I heard

438
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,359
Their production and operation of the city's first machine

439
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:45,639
No interest

440
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,599
They like

441
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,720
It's just the land in the city

442
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:53,959
I've seen predictions in Germany

443
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,480
Talk about real estate in China

444
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,080
It's about to be very popular

445
00:21:58,879 --> 00:21:59,720
This Lin Yue

446
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,560
Still quite good at it

447
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:04,599
Does Lin Yue have any vision

448
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:05,439
I have no idea

449
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,280
But I admire the most

450
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,720
The female overseas Chinese in the middle

451
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,720
I heard

452
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,878
She uses the loan funds to operate across the country

453
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,599
Less than a year

454
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,280
Sell and buy and sell

455
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,320
Just earned

456
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:19,879
Money we won't make in our lifetime

457
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,639
Liu Jun

458
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,919
Do you think you are doing finance?

459
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,720
It's the best business to make quick money

460
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:31,159
I still believe

461
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Adam Smith's opinion

462
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,919
Finance will not create value

463
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,840
Will not increase social wealth

464
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,439
Don't hug you

465
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,480
Theory of the eighteenth century

466
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,520
Stubborn

467
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,080
Your thoughts are too conservative

468
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:46,199
Do you think Lin Yue opens this rich garden

469
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,919
Is it just to increase wealth?

470
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,599
Is it still for charity

471
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,159
It's almost the same

472
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,639
Another shareholder of Haoyuan

473
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,760
Called Leidongbao

474
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,720
He is the boss of Donghai Group

475
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,199
Song Yunhui's brother-in-law

476
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,320
Lei Dongbao is not in good health

477
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,599
Lin Yue Kai Haoyuan

478
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,159
Lare Dongbao invests in shares

479
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,199
Actually, he just wants to shoot

480
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:11,080
The boss of Donghai Group

481
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,760
Open a good way for Mr. Song’s brother-in-law

482
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:15,800
Oh my god

483
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,679
How do you know so much

484
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,800
A mess

485
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:19,959
no way

486
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,320
Do business in the country

487
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,639
You have to find out everything

488
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:25,959
Know everything

489
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:27,760
You have many classes missing

490
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,359
It's so brain-consuming

491
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,879
Dr. Liu Da

492
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,000
Old money

493
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,720
haven't seen you for a long time

494
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,240
Long time no see

495
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,280
Good condition

496
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,040
Look at Wang Xi

497
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:40,320
Why are you so fat

498
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,639
Wang Xi has been transferred to China Merchants Group

499
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,119
Can you avoid getting fat after being promoted?

500
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,399
Who am I

501
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,240
Liu Shang is in the office

502
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,720
Zhang Xiang is in the Education Bureau

503
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:51,040
This is my leader

504
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,000
Don't be modest

505
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,080
What about Lao Zhang and I

506
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,480
Just a clerk running errands

507
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,599
Just look at this

508
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,560
The leaders are my leaders

509
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,639
Come

510
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,240
I'll give it to everyone

511
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,560
Bring some gifts from Germany

512
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,599
Gift is light and friendship is heavy

513
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:04,840
Don't dislike everyone

514
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:05,359
Thanks Thanks

515
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,240
All old classmates

516
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,439
This is a high-end product

517
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,840
Made in Germany

518
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:09,760
Made in Germany

519
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,280
Made in Germany

520
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:10,800
Open

521
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,000
Very good looking

522
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,040
Tie

523
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,679
I'll have to wear this tomorrow

524
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:38,320
Sorry to wait a little

525
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,159
Hello, my name is Liu Jun

526
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,679
I just moved here

527
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,359
Don't be that complicated

528
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,159
Let it be simpler

529
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,720
good

530
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,000
All are here, right

531
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,800
People have to come in a good manner, sit and sit

532
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:32,040
Come to Lao Huang

533
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,359
You are the boss

534
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,240
Why sit so far

535
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,439
Come and sit close

536
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,040
Why are you sitting here for going

537
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,679
Go there

538
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,560
What are you doing here

539
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,040
Come on come on

540
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:47,000
All of us here

541
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,080
The technical backbone of Qianjin Factory

542
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,320
I'll invite you here today

543
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,800
I want to discuss it with you

544
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,840
Next step is our trial production of new samples

545
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,040
This matter is by Ajun

546
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,879
Responsible for telling everyone

547
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
Let it be simple

548
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:04,720
good

549
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,439
Hello everyone

550
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:08,639
About this time

551
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,159
New sample trial process

552
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,320
I have one

553
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,840
Different from previous adjustments

554
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,959
Let me announce it to you first

555
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:24,919
Be simple

556
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,359
This new process reform

557
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
Start implementing today

558
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,199
I hope everyone can strictly abide by it

559
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,000
That Ah Jun

560
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,840
You may not know

561
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,840
Our factory

562
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,119
Test production of new samples

563
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,439
Always the same variety

564
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,800
Being responsible for one person

565
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,359
So what are the benefits of this

566
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,199
Once the product has quality problems

567
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,000
It is easy to identify the responsible person

568
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,320
Your decomposition process is

569
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,520
This sample trial production

570
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:25,639
Different from before

571
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:28,000
I've broken it down into

572
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,399
Six processes

573
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,480
What about us

574
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:32,959
Go to the site to go to the process time

575
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,800
Then comprehensively confirm

576
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:35,919
The person in charge of each step

577
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,000
Let's go

578
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,800
Let's try it out first

579
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:40,879
It's easy to verify the craft

580
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,119
Calculate the ergonomics

581
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,119
The eldest son wants to make a time

582
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:45,800
Then I can't press us

583
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:46,800
The speed of the old man

584
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,119
Let's make a piece-based salary

585
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,679
It's better to find a few young people

586
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,399
Come and try it

587
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:51,959
Young people are fast

588
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,480
Hands and feet are erect

589
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:54,520
Good eyesight

590
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,760
Then come alive again

591
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,320
Save your dad money again, right?

592
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,800
Ah Jun

593
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,560
What about you uncles

594
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:03,320
They are now mainly

595
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,599
Responsible for production

596
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,359
Quality management or something

597
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:07,840
The technology they have

598
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:08,679
That's definitely first-class

599
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,720
Do you know this, right?

600
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,199
Yes Yes Yes

601
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,639
But after all, they are now

602
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,240
Very rarely do practical

603
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:15,879
Otherwise

604
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:16,760
Otherwise, wouldn't it be better

605
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:19,159
Only responsible for trial production today

606
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,199
Wait until the sample is passed

607
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,560
Leave it to them to dispatch

608
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,599
You can produce directly

609
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,439
How good this is

610
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:28,599
Uncles' skills

611
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,599
I know it all

612
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,119
But the decomposition process is necessary

613
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,840
I don't want to make a piece-based salary

614
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,480
I

615
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,359
Yes Yes Yes

616
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,359
Who said that the piece-based salary is fixed

617
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,159
Just calculate the duration of the process

618
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:41,999
right

619
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,080
This is still necessary

620
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:43,720
Yes Yes Yes

621
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,639
Let's go

622
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,679
Browse in the workshop

623
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,080
Just look at it and you will know

624
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,080
This idea is good

625
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:49,800
Walking, walking, walking

626
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:50,760
Your butt is sinking

627
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,879
Take a walk and hurry up

628
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:52,800
Leaving

629
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,439
Old Huang left

630
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,639
Let's go

631
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,520
Get up

632
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,520
Let's go

633
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,800
Come on come on

634
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:16,840
Come

635
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,199
Isn't he able to do this

636
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,000
Just now, he looked reluctant

637
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,240
It's my brother Huang

638
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,840
This craft is accurate enough

639
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:37,800
It's really impeccable

640
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,879
I ask Director Liu for instructions

641
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,080
Am I just doing this

642
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:43,720
Make nine first

643
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,679
Then I changed the car's chamfer

644
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,879
Get out of here

645
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,080
You wheeler, ask me

646
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:55,320
How about it

647
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:56,919
It's OK

648
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,480
very good

649
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,639
Uncle Huang

650
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,879
Whether it is a finished product or a semi-finished product

651
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,240
It's better to take it lightly

652
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,000
Even if it is made of steel

653
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,959
Under collision

654
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,240
It may also affect the accuracy

655
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,280
The eldest son taught me a lesson, right?

656
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,199
Then you can come

657
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,359
You try

658
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,840
No, no

659
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,199
What does Master Huang do

660
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,240
Child, you

661
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,599
Forget it, let's do it

662
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,480
Lao Huang, you

663
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,320
Let's give it a try

664
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,000
With a child, you still

665
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:46,959
Make a plan for me

666
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:47,760
no

667
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,840
The city is preparing to relocate as a whole

668
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:05,599
Free up the land to develop real estate

669
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,399
Manager Hao from our place told me

670
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,480
The developer intends to poach her

671
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,560
In charge of sales

672
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,199
She wants to pull me to jump together

673
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,399
Many people you know

674
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,639
Wide news

675
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,079
Do you think this project is reliable

676
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,679
City one machine

677
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,359
The city has two major shareholders

678
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,079
Lin Yue and Lu Guangfa

679
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,518
That's all the East China Sea

680
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,958
A well-known person

681
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,958
But as far as I know

682
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:40,998
Their two

683
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,840
Real estate development should be

684
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:43,879
No experience

685
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:45,320
Go through the procedures

686
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,359
Run for approval

687
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,399
Get a loan

688
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,600
Not able to get out of here for three to five years

689
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,039
What if something happens in the middle

690
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:53,918
It's not certain whether it can be achieved

691
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,359
Then what you mean

692
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,800
I'm not advised to go

693
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:00,720
sister

694
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,039
Your company

695
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,800
Isn't there a new project?

696
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,600
Manager Hao resigned

697
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,280
Isn't this location just empty?

698
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,120
It makes sense

699
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:18,680
That's a few days

700
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,359
Or I'll be alone

701
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,800
Invite our boss to have a meal

702
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:22,479
Talk to him

703
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,919
My replacement for Manager Hao

704
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,240
still

705
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,399
I'll go for you

706
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,919
Qian Hongming

707
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,120
Is it in your opinion

708
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,559
Any boss I'll deal with

709
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,120
Will use some shameless means

710
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,439
I mean

711
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,280
You invite someone to dinner

712
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,160
Have to drink and give gifts

713
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
We men do these things

714
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,720
You don't have to coax me Qian Hongming

715
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:57,879
I'm not your wife

716
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,200
Such a little girl

717
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
All right

718
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,399
I hope you

719
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,840
Stop contact with Liushitang

720
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Why did I get in touch with him

721
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:27,879
Some time ago he asked me for something

722
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:28,800
You know

723
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,600
That's to buy a house for Liu Jun

724
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,800
I can't just leave business alone

725
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:32,559
Drive him away

726
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,240
Sister, you know

727
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,399
That's not what I mean

728
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:34,919
One person has

729
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:36,359
How one does things

730
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:41,879
I've said

731
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:43,720
I borrowed him to pay it back

732
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,999
But the relationship is not clear

733
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,439
The relationship between the two of us

734
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,840
Is it what outsiders say

735
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,280
You know best

736
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,999
I can't care about anyone, either

737
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,720
What to say behind me

738
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,240
What happened to me in the future

739
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:58,559
I have a number

740
00:36:59,039 --> 00:36:59,959
How do I do it

741
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,479
Your consent is not required

742
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,840
Or disagree

743
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:04,879
Do you understand

744
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,959
Qian Hongming

745
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,879
dad

746
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,680
How long has it been used

747
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Sixteenth minute thirty

748
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,399
Uncle Xu

749
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,439
Where is the person

750
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,240
My dad and Uncle Huang are the ones who are the ones who are in charge.

751
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,320
Leave them alone

752
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,959
Uncle Xu is planning for you

753
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,760
Ah Jun

754
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,559
You kid is too ignorant

755
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:47,840
What's wrong with me

756
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:49,120
You're a junior?

757
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
When so many people are

758
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:50,999
Reprimand the master

759
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,800
Is it reasonable

760
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,359
Old Huang is too stingy

761
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,359
What's wrong with the master

762
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,959
We're never used to being sloppy

763
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,559
Then just remind me, right?

764
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,519
Come to Ajun

765
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,760
Continue making samples

766
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,680
Uncle Xu changed the tool for you

767
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:07,200
Thank you Uncle Xu

768
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,720
Everyone is off work

769
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,359
You are a senior employee

770
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:11,359
I'm still working overtime here

771
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,800
Master Xu is still here to accompany you

772
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,280
Thank you Master Xu

773
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:15,079
fine

774
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,120
Pay attention to safety

775
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:18,320
Hurry up the time

776
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:30,160
This old yellow

777
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,399
Really capable

778
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,840
That's really bad temper.

779
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,840
But people work hard, right

780
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,240
Look at it in the factory

781
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:40,760
He's very handsome

782
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,999
Didn't you see it just now

783
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,800
He moved

784
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,959
A bunch of people followed

785
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,919
no way

786
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,399
You treat such people

787
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Ajun, you have to follow

788
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,919
Just donkey

789
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,359
Follow the stroke

790
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,919
Uncle Xu's skills are good, too

791
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,320
Why do people just reason

792
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,280
Do you think Lao Xu is alone

793
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:00,240
There are also a bunch of people behind him.

794
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,879
He and Huang are not in the way

795
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:04,039
Don't like each other

796
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,760
Today he is taking advantage of your power

797
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:07,280
What about Lao Huang's face

798
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
I'll tell you my son

799
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,439
People with abilities have tempers

800
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,640
You've finished it

801
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,399
Do I have to go find Lao Huang?

802
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,519
No use at all

803
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,160
I calculated the

804
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,039
Manual configuration

805
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,280
Through actual calculation

806
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:25,039
The employment of each process has been confirmed

807
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,320
This not only reduces

808
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,519
Overall wage cost

809
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,959
It is more convenient to control core members

810
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,919
Promote according to this process

811
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,879
You don't have to look for Uncle Huang anymore

812
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,999
Come to work happily

813
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:40,919
Go home safely

814
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,359
get off work

815
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:43,760
You can't do this

816
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:46,120
no

817
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:47,479
Why can't it work

818
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:49,760
Nowhere can

819
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,919
Ajun Ajun Ajun

820
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,280
With Lao Huang's current skills

821
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,280
As soon as he goes out

822
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,320
Some places want him

823
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:56,959
Let's go

824
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:57,760
What to go

825
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,120
Didn't he take away a bunch of people?

826
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,280
Our factory is small

827
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,280
There are not many capable people under my command

828
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,120
All left

829
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,600
You can make scientific configuration

830
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,280
Our factory can't stand it

831
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,999
Isn't there any Uncle Xu?

832
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,559
You must never leave Lao Xu alone

833
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,280
In the factory

834
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,120
Isn't that the only one party can dominate

835
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,039
Don't look at Lao Xu now

836
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,720
Very easy to get along

837
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,600
That's because there's Lao Huang

838
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,879
Lao Huang is leaving

839
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:22,720
He's here alone

840
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,479
I'll tell you

841
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:25,680
He has a bigger temper than Lao Huang

842
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,200
but also

843
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,039
Don't say it, don't say it

844
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Ajun won't say it

845
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,320
go home

846
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,120
I'll handle it

847
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,479
I'll go find Lao Huang to have a drink

848
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,160
I admit now that you are right

849
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,840
Being a person is indeed my weakness

850
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,280
You've been in the past few years

851
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:52,039
Are you encountering it often

852
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
People like Lao Huang

853
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,519
Otherwise, how could it become like this

854
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,559
Mature

855
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,720
You mean I'm so worldly

856
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,200
People like this are everywhere

857
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,600
It's not surprising where it appears

858
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:16,280
But when it comes to how to deal with them

859
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,399
Actually dealing with people

860
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,120
It doesn't matter much

861
00:41:20,919 --> 00:41:23,200
Because these craftsmen have a great reputation

862
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:25,519
It's impossible to be bigger than money

863
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:27,479
If you pay

864
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,760
Drive them high enough

865
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,399
Do you still need to see their winks?

866
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,640
But my dad said

867
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,720
Your dad said something is reasonable.

868
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,439
Money alone is not realistic

869
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,760
But Liu Jun

870
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,160
Do you still need to worry about these things

871
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,439
You are a Doctor of Lude

872
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,760
Senior Engineer

873
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,399
You shouldn't be energized

874
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:53,120
Is it spent on improving the product?

875
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,200
You and a bunch of old workers

876
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,320
What's the point of competing

877
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,399
Of course I still

878
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:02,879
Focus on thinking technology

879
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,680
Found

880
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:06,919
Marketable

881
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,399
New products with technical barriers

882
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,640
That's all right

883
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,479
With technical barriers

884
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:13,200
There is policy support

885
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:14,919
You can get the market

886
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:17,600
Your dad is willing to care about Lao Huang's group of people

887
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,079
Just let him take care of it

888
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,879
He's already in this set

889
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,079
Can't pull it out

890
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,039
Are you willing to accompany him

891
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,160
Do you want to draw a land to punish the roots and ends?

892
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,519
Yes

893
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:31,160
What am I competing with them?

894
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:33,959
No matter how many twists and turns there are

895
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,800
The most powerful thing is the economic law

896
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,479
My strengths are technology

897
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,800
OK

898
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:43,399
Please drink this wine.

899
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,160
Then you have to blow a bottle

900
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,559
waiter

901
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,999
Don't do it, don't mess with me

902
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,760
I have to draw pictures when I go back tonight

903
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:52,160
Thanks

904
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,840
Is it enough to just say thank you

905
00:42:59,039 --> 00:42:59,840
What's the meaning
