1
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Then don't you give it to him

2
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,719
Make a phone call and ask

3
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,840
Hello

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The phone you called has been turned off

5
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,878
sorry

6
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,840
Turn off again

7
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,200
I've repeatedly emphasized to him

8
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,120
No matter what happens

9
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,040
Be sure to stay in touch

10
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,239
Be sure to tell me in advance

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,038
Don't worry too much, either

12
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,280
Maybe it's like last time

13
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,680
It's a false alarm

14
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:13,919
You'll give it to him tomorrow

15
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,039
Make a call and have a look

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,079
If it really doesn't work, go to the company to find him

17
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Then I'll go to his company tomorrow

18
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,719
Hello

19
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,800
The phone you called has been turned off

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,478
Why doesn't the elevator move

21
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,879
Hongming's company is on the seventh floor

22
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,840
You wait for the elevator

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,918
I'll go up the stairs

24
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,280
On the seventh floor

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,240
fine

26
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,240
I know him

27
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,439
He is Qian Hongming's good friend

28
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,918
They're in the same group

29
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,280
He and Qian Hongming are in the same group

30
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,680
What about Qian Hongming

31
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,840
Qian Hongming and his group

32
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,960
What about our money

33
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,680
I have no idea

34
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,919
Pay us back our money

35
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:04,919
You told him he couldn't run

36
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,159
You don't want to run away, either

37
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
Return our money

38
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,478
I really don't know

39
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,800
Don't do it

40
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,840
I'll call the police if you do it

41
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,599
If we are accomplices

42
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,680
Can you be here now

43
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,920
He cheats acquaintances

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,360
We've been cheated one million

45
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,480
My husband

46
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,240
I've called him since last night

47
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,600
Never opened

48
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,560
You see which one you answered

49
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,720
Did you get it done?

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,279
Which one has been connected

51
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,720
Come up and shout here

52
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,519
Put everything down

53
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,519
If you guys grab something

54
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,560
That's suspected of illegal

55
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,040
That's suspected of robbery

56
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,959
The people in the room

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,839
Put everything down

58
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,680
What's wrong

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,600
Let's go to the police station to solve the problem

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,600
Come out with me when you leave

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,159
We don't go to the police station

62
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,159
Don't go to the police station

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,159
Go to the police station to solve it

64
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,040
Go to the police station to solve it

65
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,920
The problem cannot be solved here

66
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,519
OK

67
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,800
That money is for the children to study abroad

68
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,519
Prepare

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,959
My house has been mortgaged

70
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,759
I've invested one million

71
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,000
I won't let the door in now

72
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,920
My wife

73
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,439
Give

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,560
I really didn't expect

75
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,079
Hongming said the financial difficulties

76
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,360
It's such a big pit

77
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,480
Where do you think he will be now?

78
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,800
Is it true

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,480
Run away

80
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,600
He had his wife and children before

81
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,600
Sent abroad

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,800
Let you help him deal with the property

83
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,639
It seems now

84
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,319
All are preparing for running away

85
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't say it

86
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,600
Like a Ponzi scheme

87
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,560
Hongming just failed in his business

88
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,480
You won't believe it yet

89
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,639
He can turn over in two months

90
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,639
This is a big talk

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
I don't think there is any problem

92
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,519
He just doesn't want to give up

93
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,439
Hongming believes

94
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
He can still make this situation

95
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,240
Reinstate it

96
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,000
You're a fool

97
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,560
Now you're talking to him

98
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,560
But Qian Hongming is also considerate

99
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,079
Otherwise, with your friendship

100
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,399
You should be him now

101
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,439
The biggest debtor

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,319
You have to call Jiali

103
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Qian Hongming has always been

104
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,000
She is all embellished

105
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,000
The more important thing

106
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,360
The more impossible it is to tell her

107
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,519
What are you taking

108
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,560
Qian Hongming didn't

109
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,600
The last few properties

110
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,839
Have you sold all to us

111
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,199
There is an address and key inside

112
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,639
You go search one by one

113
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Now there are a lot of debtors

114
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,120
Looking for him everywhere

115
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,240
Will he hide in these houses

116
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,120
The possibility is very small

117
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,040
But you have no other clues

118
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,360
What if he has a reverse thinking

119
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,720
The most dangerous place

120
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,959
It's the safest place

121
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,159
I'm so confused

122
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,680
I didn't call the most

123
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,959
Hello dad

124
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,560
What are you doing

125
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,120
Ah Jun

126
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,759
Qian Hongming hid at this time

127
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,839
Very normal

128
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,839
He owes so much debt

129
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,639
The creditors are anxious

130
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,720
Then nothing can be done

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,399
Hongming disappeared suddenly

132
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,560
Didn't tell me in advance

133
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,519
I want to find Qian Hongying now

134
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,560
Ask what the situation

135
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,360
Do you know where she is

136
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,000
Didn't I tell you

137
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,519
Qian Hongying and I are doing this because of this

138
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,920
It's very unpleasant

139
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,319
We've gradually stopped contacting

140
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
What clues do you want

141
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,560
You must tell me

142
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,199
It's hard to live a debt hiding

143
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,759
Honestly, I

144
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,200
Still worried about her

145
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,399
All right

146
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,679
Then I can only try my luck

147
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,080
If you have any new news, please contact us

148
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,879
Bye-Bye

149
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,840
Bye-Bye

150
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,600
The brother and brother disappeared completely

151
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,559
Dad doesn't know anything

152
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Then you have to answer

153
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,679
Hello Jiali

154
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,320
Feed Liu Jun

155
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,919
Is something wrong with Hongming?

156
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,200
He suddenly sent me an email

157
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,200
Tell me not to contact him during this period

158
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,919
What else did he say in the email

159
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,559
He also said

160
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,679
Say I don't worry

161
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,159
Let me take my little peach

162
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,399
Living a good life

163
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,679
Then you can listen to him

164
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,879
You and your children are there with peace of mind

165
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,240
Don't think too much

166
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,279
How could I not think about it?

167
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,200
His phone number with his elder sister

168
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,480
Nothing can be done now

169
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,120
I'll call my parents

170
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
They just said

171
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,639
Hongming sent them back to his hometown

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,799
Liu Jun

173
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,759
Hiroaki is not

174
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,759
What happened to the business

175
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,799
His business is lately

176
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,120
It's a little unhappy

177
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,000
Qian Hongming's economic

178
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,480
Something serious problem has occurred

179
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,679
No one knows now

180
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,679
Where is he hiding

181
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,720
Carrie

182
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,799
You've been in Australia recently

183
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,960
You'll be more low-key, too

184
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,320
What news do I have with Liu Jun

185
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,080
Can we notify you as soon as possible

186
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,600
What

187
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,279
Such a big thing

188
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,519
Why didn't he tell me

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,679
Then he now

190
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,200
Is there any danger?

191
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,840
I have to go back

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,639
I have to go back with him

193
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,320
Don't

194
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,480
Jiali

195
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,159
You calm down first and don't cry

196
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,159
Crying doesn't solve any problem

197
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,600
We two

198
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,120
Can't care whether you will come back or not

199
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,759
But Qian Hongming

200
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,279
Since this has been arranged

201
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,759
Let's believe him first

202
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,240
Don't disrupt his plan

203
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,000
Then what should I do? Bingbing

204
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,399
Then where can I find him

205
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,000
Liu Jun still needs it

206
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
Give them some old classmates

207
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,600
Make a call and ask

208
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes, I have to ask

209
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,840
Don't worry

210
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,879
Carrie, calm down first

211
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
Then take a break early

212
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,440
We will notify you as soon as there is any news

213
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,120
Hello

214
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:32,799
Hello

215
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,360
Do you think Carrie can listen to advice?

216
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,240
I'm really afraid that she will make trouble when she comes back

217
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,799
Don't ask me

218
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,039
How could I know

219
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,440
What will she do

220
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,639
Liu Jun

221
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,600
Liu Jun

222
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,039
Liu Jun opens the door

223
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,919
I'm not asking my friend

224
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,039
Inquiry about news

225
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,799
He just called me and said

226
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,200
Last night

227
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,720
Qian Hongming's debtor

228
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,879
Jumping himself on the building

229
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,960
The company has been smashed

230
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,080
It's a big mess

231
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,279
Don't you know

232
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,200
It's mainly the boss of this money

233
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,519
It's my husband's friend

234
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,840
Don't you claim to be asking

235
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,840
I just want to ask you

236
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,480
Is there any internal information

237
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,840
OK

238
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:52,960
OK

239
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll treat you to a meal another day

240
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,600
Hang up

241
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,080
Eat quickly

242
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,960
Start calling from sitting down

243
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
The steak is cold

244
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't want to worry either

245
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,200
Can't keep Liu Jun's mind

246
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,840
But think about it carefully

247
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,159
This is really a bit strange

248
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,519
Investments exploded

249
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,639
He's not the first

250
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,200
It won't be the last one

251
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,679
What's strange

252
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,639
That's what you said

253
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,919
You want

254
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,039
Who failed to invest?

255
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,000
Everyone doesn't care about this

256
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,600
Whoever makes money today loses money

257
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,600
Who went in

258
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,799
Just like gossip

259
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,000
But I've just called a few

260
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,919
Telephone of well-informed people

261
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,080
Except for a secret

262
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,519
Tell me not to inquire

263
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,080
A few left

264
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,200
All firmly claim not to know

265
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,919
Don't you find it strange

266
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,519
The more informed you are

267
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,600
The more powerful he is

268
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,480
They don't want to discuss

269
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,759
It probably involved this

270
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,039
Funds with sensitive origins

271
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,440
This Qian Hongming

272
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,000
I must have stepped on some red line

273
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,200
Eat it

274
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,679
She told me

275
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,759
Stop to the side and look down

276
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,000
I feel like I want to jump

277
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,519
What's the high?

278
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,240
Jiali

279
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,680
I know Hongming is missing

280
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,559
You're in a hurry

281
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,440
I'm very anxious, too

282
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,039
But now

283
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,519
Not emotional

284
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,319
Think about you coming back

285
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,079
Get in the car

286
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,039
If you come back, you will be found by the creditor.

287
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:53,559
what to do

288
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,440
no

289
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,039
You can't live in your parents' house, either

290
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,359
What can't be found out about those people

291
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:02,839
Just listen to mine

292
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,960
Take good care of yourself

293
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Take good care of the children

294
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,279
Wait for a while

295
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,079
OK OK OK

296
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,000
Bye-Bye

297
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,359
It's easy to sit

298
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,920
She's going to come back

299
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,640
yes

300
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,680
Isn't this a thing that can be easily understood?

301
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,720
What part is she

302
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,799
Can't understand

303
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,039
I don't know how to tell her

304
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,200
The current situation

305
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,519
Has my phone been eavesdropped?

306
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,319
I don't know

307
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,039
I have a premonition that you can't stop her

308
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,480
Shen Jiali

309
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,519
Although it looks introverted

310
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,839
But her feelings for Qian Hongming

311
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,119
It's really a moth to hit the fire

312
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,480
to be honest

313
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,960
I almost couldn't help it once

314
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,559
Just want to tell her directly

315
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,039
Stay honestly don't make trouble

316
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,119
But in the end

317
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,400
I don't have the nerve to say it

318
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm not Qian Hongying

319
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,920
Can you take the air of an elder with her

320
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,079
What's wrong

321
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,960
Not very right

322
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,519
What's wrong

323
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,359
My dad is wrong

324
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,160
Why are you here

325
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,559
You're not going to let me in.

326
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,400
How could it be

327
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:33,759
Ah Jun

328
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,599
What are you looking for?

329
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,720
What are you doing

330
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,680
What are you doing

331
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,359
You kid

332
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,519
What are you doing? You're

333
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Dad, I know she's here

334
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,480
She's not here

335
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,839
How do you know who I'm talking about

336
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,599
You're still planning

337
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,799
When will she hide her

338
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,640
What exactly is the reason

339
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,759
Drag you down

340
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,880
It wasn't one at first

341
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,119
Is it an investment project to renovate an old building?

342
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,240
How did it happen later

343
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,680
Has raised funds from private

344
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,000
It has also developed to the point of explosion

345
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,720
besides

346
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,559
Why aren't you and Hongming together?

347
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:32,799
Did he say

348
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,119
What to do next

349
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,519
How to solve this problem

350
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,480
Ah Jun

351
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,799
You ask one by one

352
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,920
You've raised so many questions

353
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,079
How do you answer

354
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,480
OK OK OK

355
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,920
Say it slowly, don't worry

356
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,559
Tianmao Building Renovation Project

357
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,480
Hongming is doing it seriously

358
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,279
He not only puts his money

359
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,319
All were cast in

360
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,359
There are also several investors with background

361
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,880
Not convenient for me to come forward

362
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:01,359
Leave the money to him and let him carry it on behalf of others

363
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,759
Last October

364
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,079
He is in copper futures

365
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,759
Losing a lot

366
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,119
Responding to the shrinking transactions of intermediary companies

367
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,920
The money you lend out

368
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,200
Many people lie to the accounts

369
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Can't take it back

370
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,880
This begins

371
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,799
That's why I started raising funds from private

372
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,599
Is it right

373
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,079
I also know that it's not good to borrow private money

374
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,440
But at the beginning

375
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,319
Just want to turn around

376
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,680
Later, the proportion of bad debts became higher and higher

377
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,480
Bank loans

378
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,480
Tighten again and again

379
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,559
People owed us money, don't pay it back

380
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,920
We can't get a new loan

381
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,400
Maintain the capital chain

382
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,279
It's getting more and more difficult

383
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,400
At this time

384
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,200
You should stop the loss in time

385
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,079
Even if it's a debt

386
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,759
I can always settle the old debts slowly

387
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,799
It's not going to be a dead end

388
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,720
At that time, Hongming thought

389
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
Credit policy will be open soon

390
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,640
so

391
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,480
So it's what it is now

392
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,000
Ask a few less questions

393
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,480
What color

394
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:33,480
blue

395
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,160
blue

396
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,920
Get one if you answer correctly

397
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,000
What about this

398
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,039
green

399
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,839
green

400
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
How many do you count now

401
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,039
How many dolls do you have

402
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,960
One, two, three, four, five

403
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,240
Very awesome

404
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,240
Can you play for yourself first

405
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,000
You can play with them for a while

406
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,359
Is it okay for mom to call

407
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Come back soon

408
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,640
Hello Jiali

409
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,160
It's me Bingbing

410
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,880
Carrie, don't be so anxious

411
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
Didn’t Liu Jun tell you

412
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,279
Notify you as soon as there is any news

413
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,279
Liu Jun hasn't answered the phone

414
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,319
I think I'll tell you

415
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,920
I'm already at the airport

416
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,279
Take off in a few hours

417
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,359
Where have you been

418
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,000
Not you

419
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,920
Now you hear me say you have to calm down

420
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,319
No one knows where Qian Hongming is

421
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,680
You won't see him when you come back

422
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,480
Do you know

423
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,920
I know Bingbing

424
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,480
But I really have no way

425
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,079
Stay here alone

426
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,759
I just want to leave my husband

427
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,599
Closer

428
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,559
There is something wrong with you

429
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,759
You're not calm at all now

430
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,839
no

431
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,880
You can only move yourself

432
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,559
No one can guarantee it now

433
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,559
Your personal safety

434
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,279
Liu Jun has been to your house

435
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
That was messed up by those creditors

436
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,920
Where do you live with your children

437
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,200
Go to live in your parents' house

438
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,519
You need to let the elderly

439
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,119
Are you scared and scared

440
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,720
You don't have to persuade me anymore

441
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,119
I've thought about it

442
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,480
If Hongming did something wrong

443
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,640
Whether it's debt or going to jail

444
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,720
I'm willing to take it with him

445
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:10,119
Just like that

446
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,440
Hello

447
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,640
Hello

448
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,240
Then what do you do to call me

449
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,200
Very annoying

450
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:28,000
We've tried our best

451
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,640
I paid interest for several months

452
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,000
By the end of last month

453
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,240
Already empty-handed

454
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,440
Those investors behind

455
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,319
They heard the wind

456
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,839
Propose to withdraw the investment

457
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,119
Koki Hiroaki

458
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:51,839
Pay back the money immediately

459
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,640
Those big investors behind

460
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,519
Hongming said they have a background

461
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,920
What is the specific background

462
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,960
Ah Jun

463
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,078
You ask her what it is

464
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,920
What else is it use

465
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,359
Look at her

466
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,480
Does she seem to know these people

467
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,720
Hongming didn't tell me the details

468
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:18,119
He said the less I know, the better

469
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,079
I thought

470
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Hongming disappeared so thoroughly

471
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,319
Maybe he's gone abroad

472
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,519
It seems now

473
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,359
These big guys

474
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,480
Before you take action to force your debt

475
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,759
Surely prepared in advance

476
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,920
It's impossible for him to run away

477
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,880
On the performance and operating conditions of the product

478
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,359
It's indeed the most stable takeoff

479
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,640
Don't need to read more

480
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,279
Let's go directly to the contract

481
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,319
That would be great

482
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,279
Luo Qing

483
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,880
Then you can take Mr. Lai to the office building first

484
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:13,839
OK No problem

485
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,720
Mr. Lai, I'll come later

486
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,640
See you later

487
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,400
See you later

488
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,559
Mr. Lai please

489
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,319
Hello

490
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,359
Feed Bingbing

491
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,519
Has anyone received it?

492
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,519
The plane has landed

493
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,720
Half an hour

494
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,240
No see Carrie coming out

495
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,559
I'll call her cell phone

496
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Turn off the machine as well

497
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Don't know what's going on

498
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,119
Carrie doesn't go out often and takes care of her children

499
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,799
It's normal to move slowly

500
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,480
I think so too

501
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,680
She has no one to accompany her when she comes back this time

502
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,799
She has to solve everything herself

503
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,039
It's also a very difficult thing for her

504
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,279
yes

505
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,119
I'm going to start a contract negotiation later

506
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,039
It may be late

507
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,920
After you get the person

508
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,079
Don't rush back

509
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,480
You can stay in Shanghai for one night

510
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,200
I have the final say in this matter

511
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,359
If she wants to go back, I can stop her

512
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,759
I know now

513
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,920
To compare who doesn't listen to advice

514
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:20,880
Not even better than her

515
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,240
Something happened at home

516
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,599
Is it emotionally unstable

517
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,440
Thank you for your hard work, my wife

518
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:26,920
Hang up

519
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,079
What's going on

520
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,160
Carrie Carrie

521
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,440
Carrie Carrie

522
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,640
Little Taozi

523
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Carrie Carrie

524
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,920
Jiali

525
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,640
Jiali

526
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,039
Come back

527
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,359
Parents

528
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm back

529
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,240
Just come back

530
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:00,599
Go home

531
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,079
Listen to grandparents very well

532
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,680
Carrie Jia

533
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,759
OK, we should leave

534
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,480
Jiali

535
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,200
What exactly is she going to do

536
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,200
Deliver yourself to someone else's hands

537
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,000
Is this going to force Hongming to death?

538
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,720
Look

539
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,400
I remember my first time

540
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,640
See Qian Hongming

541
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,279
It's two thousand years

542
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,920
When we went to Shanghai to see the car

543
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,240
At that time, you said it was your old classmate

544
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,039
So how good are your relationship

545
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,680
Hongming is my best friend

546
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,279
Many people know

547
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,680
Understood

548
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,519
Then I won't go around

549
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,598
I've told you clearly

550
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,240
Lost by Qian Hongming

551
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,599
Among these funds

552
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,000
There is a lot of hot money

553
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,359
Do you know this

554
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,720
Probably guessed

555
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:48,799
So say

556
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,319
From Qian Hongming's perspective

557
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:52,680
He is now

558
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,240
There is no way out

559
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,480
First

560
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,079
He has no chance to leave the country

561
00:30:59,039 --> 00:30:59,640
second

562
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,519
His wife

563
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,000
Now controlled by the police

564
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,400
third

565
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,559
Even if he is cruel, he will not care

566
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,799
He fled by himself

567
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
It's impossible to escape for a lifetime

568
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:08,880
Did you say yes

569
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,839
What exactly are you going to say

570
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,160
I mean

571
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,279
Since he has

572
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,680
It's a dead end

573
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,039
Why does he want to hide

574
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,279
Not coming from the head

575
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,799
Mr. Lu asked knowingly

576
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,039
Of course, some people have too much energy

577
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,720
He's afraid he'll get hacked after entering

578
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,799
Not just Qian Hongming

579
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,240
Carrie and his sister

580
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,440
This is what you're afraid of

581
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,599
So say

582
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,319
I'll ask you out today

583
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,359
Just want to give it to you

584
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,799
Disclose a good news

585
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:35,839
It's time

586
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
There is still good news

587
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,039
have

588
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,200
Don't think about it so much and have a meal first

589
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:51,920
You're going to take a hunger strike

590
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,039
The more this time

591
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,240
The more you need to have a good meal

592
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:57,720
I'll tell you

593
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,359
There are so many troubles behind it

594
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:00,839
You have no good health

595
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
How can I handle it

596
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,480
quick

597
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,000
I don't know that Hongming is now

598
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Does he have three meals a day now

599
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,839
Hongying

600
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,079
Your sister lives like her mother

601
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,640
Have a meal first

602
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,960
That problem will always be solved, right

603
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,079
Now there is such a large page in the newspaper

604
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,119
Qian Hongming saw it

605
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,720
Surely can't hold back

606
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
Then maybe I'll contact you

607
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:40,680
Right

608
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,119
Eat it

609
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,319
Come

610
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,480
you mean

611
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,519
Those who investigate this case now

612
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,319
And people who want to deal with Qian Hongming

613
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,480
Not the same road

614
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,400
It's not just the same way

615
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,960
The main objectives of the investigative party

616
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,359
Not even Qian Hongming

617
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,880
Do you understand if I say that

618
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,240
The main goal is not Qian Hongming

619
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:26,880
But to find out

620
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,160
The big tiger behind

621
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,159
Who heard of this news?

622
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,519
You didn't guess it

623
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,440
I'm a bit reckless

624
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,680
Can't see the situation clearly

625
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,960
But our old man's judgment

626
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,079
You have to believe it

627
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,279
What do you think

628
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,279
From a legal perspective

629
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,680
If he can surrender,

630
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,759
Report and expose

631
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,920
Yes, you can go to the court

632
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,200
Apply for meritorious service

633
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,440
Even if you can't get a commutation in the end

634
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,519
It's definitely possible to get it

635
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,680
A fair trial

636
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,559
Don't worry about personal safety

637
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,119
So

638
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,840
This thing has developed to this point

639
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,760
It's impossible

640
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,360
There is a better solution

641
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,599
You are all smart people

642
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,119
Taking advantage of the opportunity now

643
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,880
Please persuade him to come out and be in the first place

644
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,239
Do you think I don't want to persuade him to surrender

645
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,518
But now, where are I?

646
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,360
I don't know

647
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,518
How could I persuade him

648
00:34:31,518 --> 00:34:32,558
Had a lot of trouble

649
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,280
You're privately

650
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,559
No contact

651
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,360
Mr. Lu

652
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,199
You thought we had a radio station installed at home

653
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,960
Yeah

654
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,320
You said I definitely believe it if I didn't

655
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,360
But some people don't believe it

656
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:46,760
besides

657
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,920
As a friend, I have to let you know

658
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,800
Someone should be there in two days

659
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Come to talk to you

660
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,559
You have to be mentally prepared for this

661
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,920
Forget it and just talk

662
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,960
I've never told a lie anyway

663
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,400
I still have this confidence

664
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,639
He asked you to surrender

665
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,599
He said in the email

666
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,280
Feeling situation

667
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,880
Some changes have been made

668
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,000
Many people pay attention to it

669
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,719
I surrendered

670
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,639
It shouldn't be hacked

671
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,920
What about him if you surrender

672
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,760
He is the main culprit in the whole matter

673
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,920
You went in alone

674
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:33,719
What is this

675
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,679
Go and take the blame

676
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,079
Hongming certainly didn't mean that

677
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,800
He just wants to be outside

678
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,719
Make some more arrangements

679
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,280
What did he arrange for him

680
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,280
He said he was writing a material

681
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,119
Let's take the inside story first

682
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,719
Disclose part of it online

683
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,559
Whether it is useful or not

684
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,400
Muddle the water a little

685
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,440
This is the trouble for me and Carrie

686
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,239
It's less

687
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,679
What kind of trend is he

688
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,360
I don't understand

689
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,920
But I know that once people go in

690
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,039
It's not easy to come out

691
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,320
I'm really sorry for you

692
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,480
There's such a thing that's right

693
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,840
You have to cooperate with the investigation boss

694
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,039
It's a lot of pressure

695
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
This time it's different

696
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:51,880
Before they come

697
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,199
Also call to make an appointment

698
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,599
What a good attitude

699
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,159
It should be just understanding the situation

700
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,320
yes

701
00:36:59,239 --> 00:36:59,920
fine

702
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,440
After the conversation this morning

703
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,239
Liu Jun followed the police's request

704
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,440
With the ownership certificates of those houses

705
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,480
Go to the Public Security Bureau

706
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:19,400
What houses do you mean

707
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,719
Will it be taken away

708
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,360
I don't think the problem is big

709
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,960
Transaction information and payment certificate

710
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,000
All are complete

711
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,760
The seller is also eager to raise money

712
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,519
This reason is real

713
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,400
It's normal, too

714
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,360
Yes

715
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,400
never mind

716
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,480
I'm going to open it too

717
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,639
Worst case

718
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,440
Isn't it just those houses

719
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,480
Have you been seized

720
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,599
In comparison

721
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,519
Nothing big anymore

722
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,039
I found you now

723
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,199
More and more open-minded

724
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,960
Millions of real estate

725
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,480
So quiet

726
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,119
You said I don't value money

727
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,679
That's a loss of 10,000 yuan in the stock market

728
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,000
My heart panic

729
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,800
But as soon as this happened, I thought about it

730
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,920
At least our family of three

731
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,199
Can stay together

732
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,119
Just content

733
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
How can this life be perfect everywhere?

734
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:17,679
Too

735
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,119
Before Liu Jun talks to the police

736
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,039
Have you seen that leaked post

737
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,519
What news post

738
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,840
Come and I'll find it for you

739
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:03,920
police officer

740
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:05,920
sit

741
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,800
What about Mr. Liu's real estate certificates

742
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,039
We've finished copying

743
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,440
You can take the original back

744
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,880
These properties

745
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,639
Is there any problem

746
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:21,079
No problem at the moment

747
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,800
Just some specific details

748
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,840
Need to verify

749
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,000
If it is a normal transaction

750
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,360
That must be protected by law

751
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:28,559
You don't have to worry about this

752
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,519
Thank you Officer Sun

753
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,199
But the time will the property be sold

754
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,880
He has escaped less than two months ago

755
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,519
We think

756
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,800
It's necessary to search

757
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,280
Do you have any objections?

758
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,199
No

759
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,760
I hope too

760
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,480
You can find some clues

761
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,760
This post is too exciting

762
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,199
Almost took Qian Hongming's abscond incident

763
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,480
It sorted out from beginning to end

764
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,320
How does this person know

765
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,480
So many inside stories

766
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:10,760
He is the big creditor

767
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
Although this post condemns Qian Hongming

768
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,159
But for other people involved

769
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,159
But it is picky and praise or criticism

770
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,400
It also implies that there is another hidden feeling behind it

771
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:23,880
I don't think it's very similar

772
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,119
It was the creditor's news

773
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,760
You think

774
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,920
It was written by Qian Hongming himself

775
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,480
Very likely

776
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,679
He doesn't know what's going on outside now

777
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,079
Let's fight a mess first

778
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,800
Let everyone pay attention to discuss

779
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:42,039
While provoking popularity

780
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,320
Tell the police

781
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,760
He has not been banned yet

782
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,599
There is also value that can be explored

783
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,320
If that's true

784
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,760
Then he must be for Jiali

785
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,039
Want to take the police's attention

786
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,159
Attract some from her

787
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,679
Shen Jiali's situation

788
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,000
It can be light or heavy

789
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,039
If she didn't know

790
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,639
Probably lenient

791
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,280
If found out, she will help

792
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,679
Acts of transferring assets

793
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,760
This sentence is severe

794
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,039
Don't mention Shen Jiali

795
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,599
I got a headache when I mentioned her

796
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,199
She thought she was back

797
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,320
Qian Hongming will stand up and come from the head

798
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,800
The result is now good

799
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,920
No figure can be found

800
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,239
This little fairy

801
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,079
I really love her husband

802
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,519
But have you ever thought about it

803
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,800
Raise Shen Jiali into such a

804
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,880
Simple thinking

805
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,679
Canary without self-care

806
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,039
Whose responsibility is it

807
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,119
If so

808
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,599
That's Qian Hongming

809
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,039
Bound by yourself in a cocoon

810
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,679
dad

811
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,679
Why are you here

812
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,119
I'm from the first

813
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,760
Did Hongming send you an email?

814
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,079
What have you said

815
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:17,960
He said I'll surrender now

816
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:19,400
Not that dangerous anymore

817
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,039
He also told me

818
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,920
Reassure me

819
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,719
He will take responsibility as much as possible

820
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,440
Relieve my crime

821
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,519
Then does he have any

822
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,760
Revealing where he is hiding

823
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,519
Even if it's not clear

824
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,679
What does it mean

825
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,159
It's right to surrender

826
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:51,840
I know a good lawyer

827
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:54,800
I'll introduce it to my dad later

828
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:57,360
Thank you

829
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,000
