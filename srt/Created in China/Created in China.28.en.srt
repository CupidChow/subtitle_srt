1
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,920
After a big bet

2
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,039
Mr. Liu's mentality has begun to turn conservative

3
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,519
I can understand this

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,239
You understand

5
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't understand

6
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,000
We are a manufacturing factory

7
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,359
R&D alone is enough

8
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,840
Your skills are getting better.

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,239
You can pry the earth

10
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:03,640
this

11
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,920
That product cannot be produced

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,079
What's the point

13
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,598
It's like cooking dumplings in the teapot

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,159
You can't throw out the goods

15
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,319
Right

16
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,159
You might as well make a big pot

17
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,039
Put two or three hundred dumplings in

18
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,039
Don't laugh really

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,280
Can be seen and touched

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
Benefits

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,680
It's not that we debated here

22
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,879
What's the point

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,919
You have so many opinions

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,240
Please write an email now

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,840
What email

26
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,478
Did you notify me of not reading it?

27
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,759
No notification

28
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,639
Administrative notice

29
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,759
Regarding the design scale of the heat treatment center

30
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,800
Solicit shareholders' opinions

31
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:37,918
Email exchange

32
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,000
Lao Zhu didn't tell me

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,639
Then I'll tell you it's OK

34
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,240
That Wubi is too troublesome

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,520
Too troublesome

36
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,639
If you don't want to type

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,680
You just write it down by hand

38
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,199
Can I copy it to you

39
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,280
Let's go

40
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,478
I'm annoyed again, right

41
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
Have a flavour platter

42
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,560
I'm almost done with another soup

43
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:17,039
Almost done

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,439
Ginseng stewed duck

45
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,919
Thanks

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
Do you know the stock market?

47
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,680
Be bearish but not short

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,919
The same goes for business

49
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,400
If you think too much

50
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,039
It will definitely lead to inaction

51
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,759
really

52
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,918
Compared to you winning the land king in one fell swoop

53
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,719
I'm a bit too conservative

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,680
I remember when I first developed F1

55
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,759
Sister Liang joked about me

56
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,639
Say I'm too brave

57
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,879
I dare to jump into the pit with my eyes open

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,360
I guess it was that time

59
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,918
Overdrawn your courage

60
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,079
I'm as timid as a mouse now

61
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,280
The foreign business I'll introduce to you this time

62
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,080
That's all ranked in the world

63
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:00,960
Large enterprises

64
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,719
They all came to China

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,879
Find new production capacity

66
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,000
Liu Jun

67
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,960
Now it's not just us

68
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,000
Huge investment

69
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,719
The whole world is the same

70
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,759
Decided

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,439
Decided

72
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,360
Start a geotechnical construction

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,600
One-time expansion

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,959
that is

75
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,600
So hard you ordered it

76
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,279
This is the restaurant's famous dish

77
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,879
Huadiao wine-stewed sausage

78
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,319
A gentleman gave it

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,319
It's not your words to be clear

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,159
Is this guy a man or a woman

81
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,040
It's very important

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,920
It's this gentleman

83
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,319
Boss Liu

84
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,279
Hello

85
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,120
Hello

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,879
Interruption Disturbance Disturbance

87
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
You may not remember me

88
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,800
Before

89
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,600
We've seen it at a dinner party

90
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,759
There were you and Boss Qian at that time

91
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
I'll sit at the table next to you

92
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,639
Excuse me

93
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,279
Boss Wu

94
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,839
Is there anything you have to do

95
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,759
It's rare to meet Boss Liu here

96
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,439
No

97
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,920
It's a bit ashamed

98
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,680
I've been because of this before

99
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,040
Fund turnover is not working

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,079
So from Boss Qian

101
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
Borrowed a sum

102
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
It's for emergency relief

103
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,079
This is the day to repay

104
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,079
It's a little tight

105
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,199
Not to make a mistake for a moment

106
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,319
So I want to hire the boss

107
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,000
Can be able to embrace me for a month

108
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,120
At most one month

109
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,199
I must pay back the capital and profit

110
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,000
Boss Wu probably you misunderstood

111
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,319
Qian Hongming and I are just classmates

112
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,560
I don't understand his business

113
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm afraid I can't help much

114
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,959
Everyone knows that you have a good relationship

115
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,120
I really have nothing to do

116
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,959
I can't see Boss Qian either

117
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,480
I can only ask you to help me with a word

118
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,519
Please

119
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,119
Please

120
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,040
That's it

121
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,879
If I see Hongming

122
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,279
I'll take your affairs today

123
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,240
Tell him something

124
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,199
good

125
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,040
I really can't help with the rest

126
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,079
Excuse me

127
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
Thank you very much

128
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,759
Then that

129
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,279
Then I won't bother

130
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,160
Use it slowly

131
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,319
Thanks Thanks

132
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:35,920
Loaning

133
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,240
Not something that ordinary people can do

134
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,000
Qian Hongming looked at the gentle

135
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,480
I didn't expect the path to be quite wild

136
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,519
I've been working in his business for a long time

137
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,199
Can retain one or two percent of your self

138
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,560
It's already very difficult

139
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,920
We don't understand this

140
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,480
Stop talking

141
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,639
Don't go out and talk nonsense

142
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,759
Don't worry, how strict I'm

143
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Just know how to eat

144
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,199
Eat it, someone gave it to me

145
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,039
These toys are not all new

146
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,199
Some are little peaches

147
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,480
Have played it a few times before

148
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,279
And these clothes are

149
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,759
I think I'm throwing it away

150
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,079
It's really a waste

151
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,079
Just take it over

152
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,839
See if there are any bubbles that you like

153
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,319
You won't mind

154
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,879
What do you mind

155
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,720
The child grows so fast

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,839
Look at this little dress

157
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,079
It's all the same as new

158
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,959
And these books are

159
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,240
With illustrations

160
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,639
Especially suitable for children to see

161
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,480
Yes or no

162
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,040
This book is so well drawn now

163
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,279
It's different from when we were kids

164
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,600
I remember you gave the R&D center back then

165
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,759
When designing

166
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,079
I often go to Shanghai to buy books and picture albums

167
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,680
Have you been there recently

168
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,519
I won't go much now

169
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,959
Hongming

170
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,759
More and more businesses in Shanghai

171
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,600
It's going to pass several times a month

172
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,920
I have anything I want to bring

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,160
He can buy it for me

174
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,560
I don't have to run away by myself

175
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,959
Yeah

176
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,000
Qian Hongming is so busy

177
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,399
Go to Shanghai several times a month

178
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,240
yes

179
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,920
Liu Jun’s business trip time

180
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,839
Very long too

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It should be

182
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,759
Will be back on Saturday

183
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,399
I plan to have my children

184
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,720
Drive to Shanghai to pick him up

185
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,279
Stay there for one night

186
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,039
Do you want to bring Xiao Taozi with you

187
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
Go with us

188
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
It is better to buy books yourself

189
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,919
And now the bookstore in Shanghai

190
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,759
Very well-pretended

191
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,080
It's the same as a cafe inside

192
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,440
Do you want to go and see

193
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,480
That's OK

194
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,200
Just right

195
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,960
Hongming has been busy there these days

196
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,120
Then I'll call him and tell him

197
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
He doesn't need to drive

198
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,919
He doesn't need to answer

199
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,519
What are you talking to him for

200
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,919
We go to him directly when we arrive

201
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,399
Give him a weekend surprise

202
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,240
What do you think

203
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,320
Good

204
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,360
Sister Qian

205
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,279
The house of thirteen

206
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,919
In the end, Sister Zhang snatched it

207
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,200
She wants to thank us

208
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,279
A few boxes of fruits were sent

209
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,360
I've put it here for you

210
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,759
I still have fruits at home

211
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,679
You guys will part

212
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,440
sister

213
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,360
Someone told me

214
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,480
This is assigned to you

215
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,080
It's not appropriate for you to accept it

216
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,000
OK, then you can put it there

217
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
Hello, sister

218
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,080
Jiali

219
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,200
I have two boxes of mangoes here

220
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,960
I remember your dad likes to eat

221
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,759
There are a lot of customers in the store today

222
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,440
Can't walk

223
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Come and get it

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,879
Then I'll call

225
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,080
Let my dad go over and pick it up

226
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm not here today

227
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,080
I'm on the way to Shanghai

228
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,840
You went to Shanghai

229
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,759
Did Hongming ask you to go?

230
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,519
No

231
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,799
I don't want to disturb his work

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm taking Bingbing's car

233
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,960
Wait until we arrive in Shanghai

234
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,600
It happened to be when Hongming got off work

235
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,159
That's OK

236
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:33,399
Then please don't worry Uncle Chen

237
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,559
Come and get it

238
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,399
Thank you very much sister

239
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,919
Bye-Bye

240
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,120
Bye-Bye

241
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,679
What's wrong with sister

242
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,039
I'll ask you

243
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,559
You're in the apartment in Shanghai

244
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,360
Is that little goblin still living

245
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,240
Why did you suddenly talk about this again

246
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,519
I'm busy

247
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
Do you know that Jiali went to Shanghai?

248
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,960
Jiali

249
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,440
What did she do in Shanghai

250
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,080
What do you care about her doing

251
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,639
She took Cui Bingbing's car

252
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,879
Already on the way

253
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,320
I'll take you to the apartment directly

254
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,440
Tell me the address

255
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,519
apartment

256
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,559
I don't have an address for the Shanghai apartment

257
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,919
No

258
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,720
Qian Hongming bought this house

259
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,480
It's been several years

260
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,720
You haven't been there once

261
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,320
When I bought it a few years ago

262
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,399
I've been there once

263
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,360
Hongming drives me

264
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,600
I don't remember the road

265
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,200
Then I'll give it to you directly

266
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,159
Go to his Shanghai office

267
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,919
You have this address

268
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,519
I know this

269
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,200
I'll give you a way

270
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,879
have a look

271
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,559
What did you ask so much

272
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,039
You'll move out of the apartment right now

273
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,039
Take all your stuff

274
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,919
Take them all away

275
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:14,919
If not

276
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,960
I'll look for a cleaning lady

277
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:16,919
Throw it out for you

278
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,240
What streets do you want to go shopping

279
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,919
You move out of the apartment right away

280
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,240
Little King

281
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,879
You send some cleaning aunties

282
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:35,840
Go to my apartment

283
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,919
Take all her personal belongings

284
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,919
Move out all

285
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,360
right

286
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,039
Recover as much as possible to

287
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,960
The original state she was not in

288
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,799
How long will it take to wait a moment

289
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,080
Anyway, as soon as possible

290
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:18,960
dad

291
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:19,639
Little Taozi

292
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,679
Do you miss dad?

293
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,679
Think about it

294
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,960
The little bubbles are here too

295
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,480
Didn't expect us to come

296
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,279
surprise

297
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,559
Too surprised

298
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,399
Your office building

299
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,440
So strict

300
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,960
Visitors must also notify registration

301
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,840
Started last year

302
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,080
The occupancy rate is getting higher and higher

303
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,679
People's contacts are complicated

304
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,360
For our tenants

305
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,360
The stricter the management, the better

306
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,320
yes

307
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:43,919
Stop talking here

308
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,960
Go to my office

309
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,720
Let's go

310
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,600
Walking small bubbles

311
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,200
Let's go

312
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,240
Are you tired to hold it

313
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,080
Arrive at dad's office

314
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,000
Sit casually

315
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,320
Ice Ice

316
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:56,600
Haven't been here yet

317
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,600
My Shanghai office is

318
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,279
Come and play often in the future

319
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,000
OK

320
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,039
Pour some water from Carrie

321
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,679
good

322
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
I'll carry you up.

323
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
You guys play

324
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,559
Walk

325
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,559
We're supposed to

326
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,720
Don't want to disturb you

327
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,159
But the address of the apartment

328
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,200
I can't remember

329
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
I don't have a key, either

330
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,000
Drink water ice

331
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,399
Now you can not disturb

332
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,159
If you don't

333
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,360
Give her the key

334
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,840
I'll send them to the mother and the other two over there

335
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,080
Just right

336
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,840
Liu Jun's plane arrived at night

337
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,960
I still have time now

338
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,320
sure

339
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,840
I didn't clean it alone

340
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,519
It's a mess inside

341
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,159
Why not let's go together

342
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,200
Stay in a hotel

343
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,559
It also facilitates children's rest

344
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,600
Then stay in a hotel

345
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,879
Drink water

346
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,919
Little Taozi

347
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,159
Do you want to talk to dad?

348
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,120
Stay in a hotel together

349
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,080
good

350
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,960
OK, you guys sit first

351
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,759
I'll pack up

352
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,120
Stay in a hotel with dad

353
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
well

354
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,679
Turn around

355
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:00,679
Turn around

356
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,360
You can write too

357
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,519
Will you take this

358
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:10,759
Water supply kettle

359
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,519
Thanks

360
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,679
that

361
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,480
There are big shopping malls nearby

362
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,960
You guys have a rest

363
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:17,960
You can go shopping

364
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,559
I'll go to the airport to pick up Liu Jun later

365
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,759
Then have a meal together

366
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,159
OK to follow your arrangements

367
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,000
good

368
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,720
Is there enough things to bring?

369
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,440
Stay for one day after enough

370
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,039
Bingbing and the others said they would go back tomorrow

371
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,879
And you

372
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,720
Come and buy books

373
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,240
How enough time for one day

374
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,399
I'll take a walk with you again

375
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,679
We drive back on Monday

376
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,360
Ya-y

377
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,039
Then wait for Bingbing and the others to leave

378
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,080
Let's go back to the apartment

379
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,720
There is obviously a house in Shanghai

380
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,039
There is no need to spend money on hotels

381
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,480
All right, listen to you

382
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,919
Take this sheet in for a while

383
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,720
good

384
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,279
Liu Jun

385
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,759
Why are you here

386
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,799
What about Bingbing

387
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,799
You're on a business trip to Guangzhou

388
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,240
Isn't it with Lu Huadong?

389
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,960
What about others

390
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,919
He went directly to Hong Kong

391
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,360
Say it's for home

392
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,360
Women's shopping

393
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,559
You didn't answer my question

394
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:31,960
Why are you here

395
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,279
Your Cui Bingbing

396
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,440
Come here with the kids and Carrie

397
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,879
Say you want to play in Shanghai for a day

398
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,759
Isn't that good

399
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,000
Why do you think you are unhappy

400
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,559
No

401
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,919
Very happy

402
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,000
They're just in a hurry

403
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,279
I have to line up temporarily at work

404
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,720
Then your Cui Bingbing is here

405
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,159
Can I not treat it well?

406
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,600
What attitude

407
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,200
No attitude

408
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,279
Very good attitude

409
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,598
Is it tasty

410
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,079
Is it tasty

411
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,118
Come

412
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,519
Very good

413
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,400
You bully me

414
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,480
You listen to whatever your dad says

415
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,960
I told her not to do anything

416
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,240
I'll go on business trips in the future

417
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:25,720
Let you know the preciousness of your mother

418
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,598
As for my daughter

419
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,358
Most of them are dear dads

420
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Our family is also

421
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,559
Vegetables

422
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Is it a little Taozi?

423
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,960
So well-behaved

424
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,960
I'm so annoyed

425
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,559
Did you behave just now

426
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,519
Have you eaten it

427
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,279
But you will be good as soon as you come back

428
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,359
You've only been on a business trip for a week

429
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,240
Just so worried about the factory

430
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,440
You're now

431
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,680
All have made four calls

432
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,359
Nothing wrong with the factory

433
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,079
Something abnormally changed

434
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:55,279
This week

435
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,759
Three people have resigned in succession

436
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,640
These three resigned

437
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,799
Is there anything abnormal?

438
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,599
It's abnormal for Tengfei

439
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Our staff

440
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,960
Always stable

441
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,480
Which three resigned

442
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,480
Why

443
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,920
The first one is nothing

444
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,480
Poor business capabilities

445
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,559
Resigned by himself

446
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,440
The second one is one

447
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,759
Aunt in charge of dormitory cleaning

448
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,279
Liu Jun, are you okay

449
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,559
An aunt in charge of cleaning

450
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,680
You care so much

451
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,200
Her position is nothing

452
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,920
It's mainly the reason for her resignation

453
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,559
What's the reason

454
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,480
Lao Zhu told me

455
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,880
This aunt is following the trend in the first half of the year

456
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,599
I took the 50,000 yuan I saved

457
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,039
Throw it to relatives to trade stocks

458
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,319
It turned out to be a good profit

459
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,319
Sometimes you can earn in one day

460
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,319
One month's salary

461
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,799
So people think about it

462
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,559
Get up early and go to bed late

463
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,519
What cleaning do

464
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,559
Resign simply

465
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,920
Going to stock trading for full-time

466
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,440
There are so many legends like this in the stock market

467
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,400
I've heard a lot of this kind

468
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,359
There is nothing to do about this

469
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
You're just eye-opening

470
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,519
What about the third one

471
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,759
The third one

472
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,319
It hurts me the most

473
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,279
Most reluctant

474
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,319
Is an engineer at the R&D center

475
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,079
Master's degree from post-80s

476
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,079
Very high technical level

477
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,359
Then what is he?

478
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,720
Because of mother-in-law

479
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,920
Mother-in-law

480
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,400
goodbye

481
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Why did you leave alone

482
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,240
What about her man

483
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,799
You can't see this

484
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,559
What

485
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,599
Stop talking

486
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,400
Go to work

487
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,319
Compared with colleagues

488
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,480
Our salary

489
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,559
Very good

490
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,839
It's more than enough to support a family

491
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,079
But if you buy a house

492
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,000
At least he has been in the past two years

493
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,480
His salary will definitely not keep up with the housing price

494
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,599
If you can't afford a house, you can't get married

495
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,799
This situation

496
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,200
Not uncommon in big cities

497
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,200
Didn't someone joke?

498
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,480
Real estate in China

499
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,759
The economy is born by the mother-in-law

500
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,119
Then he quit

501
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,440
What to do when changing careers

502
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,440
Didn't change career

503
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,359
He has immigrated to Canada

504
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,799
Young people today

505
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,039
Survival pressure is too great

506
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
You said the house prices have been rising

507
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,960
I want to buy a house but I can't afford it

508
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,480
Renting a house is unstable

509
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,119
Vegetables

510
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,799
This is a good girlfriend

511
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,319
Dragged away by mother-in-law

512
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,279
I can understand his decision

513
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,799
Understanding is understanding

514
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,799
Such a good technical talent

515
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Lost in vain

516
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,559
How discouraging

517
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:58,880
This is sugar

518
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,799
Let's wipe your mouth

519
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,920
Every family has a difficult sutra to recite

520
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,319
Bingbing, I don't think you're eating much fish

521
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,200
Try this

522
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,759
Don't worry about me, you can eat yours

523
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,160
vegetable

524
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,240
You eat quickly, you didn't eat much

525
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,839
Come on, try this

526
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,359
Let's go home

527
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:33,400
How happy or not

528
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,559
Leave

529
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,400
What a small turntable

530
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,000
If you grow up, the three of us can't squeeze out.

531
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:40,839
I've put it here for you

532
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,519
Let's put it here

533
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,519
Open slowly on the road

534
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:43,839
Bye-Bye

535
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,759
Bye bye bye bye

536
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,319
Get in the car

537
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,039
Bye-Bye

538
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,200
Bye-Bye

539
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,119
Bye-Bye

540
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,519
Come and take the bus

541
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,559
This is also

542
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,279
What's wrong

543
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:02,960
Get in the car

544
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,799
Slow down

545
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,319
never mind

546
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:10,880
Carrie is one

547
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,160
People who are ignorant of the world

548
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,119
Auntie goes to buy groceries

549
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,599
She doesn't know it's pretty good, too

550
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,359
You don't doubt it

551
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,119
Where is Qian Hongming outside?

552
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,240
Bye-Bye

553
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,880
Open slowly

554
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,680
Bye-Bye

555
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,960
So you brought Carrie here this time

556
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,558
Is it for a sudden attack?

557
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,039
What a surprise attack

558
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,960
Qian Hongming is my husband

559
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,119
I just feel sorry for Jiali

560
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:41,279
You said she is the same

561
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,960
People who graduated from prestigious universities

562
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,400
Now raised

563
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:45,799
IQ is almost negative

564
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,200
Then your IQ is so high

565
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,359
Have you caught something

566
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,920
Hongming dares to bring Carrie back to the apartment

567
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,480
That means nothing really

568
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,839
Alright, get in the car

569
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,960
Come home

570
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,599
Arrived at Taozi

571
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,400
There is no mess in this

572
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,880
Isn't this clean?

573
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,880
I've found a hourly worker to clean it up

574
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,000
Have salty breakfast

575
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,720
I'll make some hot water to make a pot of tea for you

576
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,519
good

577
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,200
Give it to me

578
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,400
Go and wash your hands

579
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,720
Rub more

580
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,480
Alright, rub it

581
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,839
Washed clean

582
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,039
Washed clean

583
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,920
Come

584
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,519
Wipe dry

585
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,480
Let's go play

586
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,319
Mom, look

587
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,319
Dad Dad

588
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,519
Don't come here first

589
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,279
Don't stub your glass if it breaks

590
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,519
Where is mom

591
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Are you sleepy

592
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,640
It took so long to drive

593
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,559
I'm never sleepy when driving

594
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,160
You can sleep for a while

595
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,359
The child made such a late fuss yesterday

596
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,240
You haven't had a good sleep either

597
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,880
Have a rest

598
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,920
Then I'll take a look

599
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,079
If you are sleepy, call me

600
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,799
Let's change

601
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,640
good

602
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,240
Hello

603
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,039
Why are you crying

604
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,680
Why don't you cry now

605
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,240
Who is it

606
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,359
Jiali

607
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,559
OK OK Don't cry

608
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,640
What's the use of crying

609
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Stay where you don't move

610
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,200
We'll be back now

611
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,200
go back

612
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,799
Find an exit and go down quickly

613
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,400
Jiali

614
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,160
Not as you thought

615
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,440
I don't listen

616
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,759
I know I'm too stupid

617
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,160
I can't stand your words at all

618
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,400
What's the point of lying to me like this

619
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,599
I

620
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,640
I feel it in my heart

621
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,039
I can't stand this

622
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,400
I really can't stand it

623
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,799
Jiali

624
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,920
I'm not explaining to you

625
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,720
I'm just

626
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,839
It's really not what you think

627
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,160
Don't touch me, don't touch me

628
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,000
You go

629
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:08,559
Jiali

630
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,720
Don't touch me

631
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:10,519
You go out

632
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,519
Peach is still outside

633
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,240
Let's not argue, okay

634
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,359
Get out

635
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,160
Jiali

636
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,559
Don't touch me

637
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,480
Jiali

638
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,319
Walk

639
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:19,960
let go

640
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:23,640
Jiali, listen to me

641
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,680
Jiali

642
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,279
Jiali

643
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,439
Jiali

644
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,799
Carrie has been crying

645
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,640
The big and the small are crying

646
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,400
Can you

647
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,720
Can you come back and help me

648
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,839
I've got off the highway

649
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,640
Ready to go back

650
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,039
But to be honest

651
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,640
I don't know how to help you

652
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,359
well

653
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,839
That's it

654
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,000
What's wrong

655
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,200
Go back quickly

656
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,200
Come and hold the child

657
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:15,799
Come on come on

658
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,720
I'll be in charge of Carrie later

659
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,759
Jiali

660
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,119
Carrie Carrie Carrie

661
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,599
Jiali

662
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,359
You come here

663
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,000
Jiali

664
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,839
come over

665
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,039
You tell me first

666
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,200
What do you want to do

667
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:34,920
Carrie wants to go home

668
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:36,880
It would be nice to let her go back and calm down

669
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,000
But my attitude is clear

670
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,160
Can't separate or divorce

671
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:39,839
You're not leaving

672
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,039
What should I do if Jiali wants to leave?

673
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,319
Don't say anything about the scene

674
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,680
I've asked you so many times before

675
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,000
You promise me

676
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,319
What are the guarantees now

677
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,160
OK, stop talking

678
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,079
I'm in a mess now

679
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,039
It's okay

680
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,799
never mind

681
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,720
I'll take Jiali back to the East China Sea first

682
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,000
The baby is looking for his mother

683
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,279
Come back quickly

684
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,160
Xiao Pupu is asking his sister to accompany him

685
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,000
Tonight

686
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,680
Two children live in my place

687
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,480
good

688
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,680
I'll cook a bowl of noodles for you

689
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,680
Eat and drink enough

690
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,599
Only then can you have the strength to think about the following questions

691
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,200
I'm not hungry

692
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,160
You guys go back

693
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,400
When did you want to deal with it

694
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,160
Just call me

695
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,880
I have a friend who is a lawyer

696
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,200
Strong business ability

697
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,839
Why do you have to do this?

698
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,640
What

699
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,519
Why are you

700
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,319
Must take me to Shanghai

701
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,119
I've worked very hard

702
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,359
Close your eyes

703
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,680
Why did you force me to open it

704
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,679
Hello

705
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:10,360
Hello

706
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,360
I'll get off the highway right away

707
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,679
How about Carrie

708
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,960
Get off the bus much calmer

709
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,239
Bingbing is here to accompany her

710
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,400
Little Taozi and I are outside

711
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,960
Thank you this time

712
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:26,760
Thanks

713
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,840
Come back early

714
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
you mean

715
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,639
You've known it a long time ago

716
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,679
You've noticed it long ago

717
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,159
Qian Hongming has a problem outside

718
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,079
What does that woman look like

719
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,159
How long has it been since she and Hongming been

720
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Don't you think I'm meddling in other people's business

721
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,679
Now ask what the meaning of this is

722
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,480
Whether you believe it or not

723
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,599
Liu Jun and I

724
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,000
Haven't seen that woman before

725
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,639
Sorry Bingbing

726
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,280
I don't want this either

727
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,559
But Hongming and Xiao Taozi

728
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,960
It's everything for me

729
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,840
I'm not as strong as you

730
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,480
I really don't dare to think too much

731
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,719
Do you want to

732
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,000
Things have been like this

733
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,360
What's the use of just crying

734
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:51,639
To solve the problem

735
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,480
You must have a clear attitude

736
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
I won't divorce

737
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,000
No one there

738
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:24,840
Can

739
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:25,800
Sit here

740
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,559
good

741
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,079
You sit in there

742
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,519
My feet

743
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,079
This waist

744
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,039
Very tired

745
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,519
real

746
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:38,880
What are you drinking

747
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,159
Ice latte

748
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,280
Then I want the same thing as her

749
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,000
Thanks

750
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,000
OK Come now

751
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,599
Don't you dislike Shen Jiali

752
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,400
Then buy her so many things

753
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,440
Isn't she in a bad mood?

754
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,800
I can only buy something to comfort her

755
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:57,960
Let's talk about it

756
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,119
I just don't like it

757
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,599
Her marriage model

758
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,360
Not targeting her

759
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,880
Thanks

760
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,000
Then it won't be embarrassing to see her again

761
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,280
Things have been like this

762
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,280
What's the use of embarrassment

763
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,760
Still can't help but worry

764
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,320
you say

765
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,519
Am I a pretty mean

766
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,199
Maybe in your heart

767
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,039
I think it's a friend's obligation

768
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,119
friend

769
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,840
Maybe it was

770
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:41,960
But now

771
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,360
I don't like her to deceive herself

772
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,280
She blames me

773
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,280
Break her fantasy about marriage

774
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:50,400
We two

775
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,559
I'm afraid I'll never be a friend again

776
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,480
arrive

777
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,000
Hello Auntie

778
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:15,960
Liu Jun

779
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,039
Thank you

780
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,159
We should pick it up ourselves

781
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,800
grandmother

782
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,800
You're too polite

783
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,800
Thank you uncle

784
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,679
Thank you uncle

785
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,880
It's okay, little Taozi

786
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,440
It's causing you trouble

787
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,519
It should be

788
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,000
mom

789
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:29,519
bag

790
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,480
I'm holding mom

791
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,800
I'll get the stuff

792
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,079
Want to eat something

793
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,960
peach

794
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,559
apple

795
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:40,760
Walk

796
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,039
Wait for me to put down

797
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,079
Go to the club to take a seat

798
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,519
After the two get married

799
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,880
It's a process of mutual transformation

800
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:01,679
Jiali and I

801
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,840
No sign of divorce

802
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,760
She accepted my apology, too

803
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,079
I'll try to go home as much as possible in the future

804
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
Take her out more

805
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,480
She said she liked it very much

806
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,079
Teacher Fu's vegetable garden

807
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,800
This weekend

808
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I'll take her to see

809
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
See if it is

810
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:20,840
Rent a farm yard for her, too

811
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,079
When you do things in the future

812
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,559
Think about the consequences

813
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,119
Think more about the children

814
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,119
Little Taozi's personality is like Jiali

815
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,039
Introverted and sensitive

816
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,400
I'm afraid

817
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,800
She can't bear too many changes

818
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,440
I want Carrie to immigrate with her children

819
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:45,880
migrant

820
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,800
What do you want to do

821
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,480
What do you think of

822
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,880
I'm not doing it for convenience

823
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,000
They were allowed to immigrate

824
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,280
Actually, I considered it a few years ago

825
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,480
I want to choose one

826
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,800
Good sunshine and air

827
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,679
Slow pace of life

828
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,519
A place with a good educational environment

829
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,920
Let them go first

830
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,719
What about you

831
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,519
My current focus

832
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:12,719
Still in the country

833
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,000
I can only let them go first

834
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,159
After they are stable

835
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,079
As a family member

836
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,920
Can follow the past anytime

837
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,159
I still remember when I first returned home

838
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,280
You told me that this is a hot land

839
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,760
My decision to come back was correct

840
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,480
But now

841
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,159
Is this hot land for you

842
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,360
Isn't it hot enough

843
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,559
Oh My God

844
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:00,760
Sister Qian

845
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,480
This was last month

846
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,800
Visitor records of No. 5 store

847
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,280
Just two pages

848
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,199
yes

849
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,239
House prices have been rising recently

850
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
But the number of visitors to the store

851
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:17,480
But fewer and fewer

852
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,360
Sometimes in the store one day

853
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,920
Just a few calls for inquiry

854
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,599
The transaction volume is even lower

855
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:25,360
Go out

856
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,679
Hello sister

857
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:41,880
Hongming

858
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,880
I've followed your standards

859
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,920
Cleaned up all the stores

860
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,400
Overall

861
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,400
Bad performance

862
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,599
There are several stores with very light business

863
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,559
It's just losing money

864
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,039
Revenue

865
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,119
Even the salary and rent are not even worth it

866
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,000
Then shut down

867
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,800
now that

868
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,760
The market is so quiet now

869
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,840
If you lose money, you should shut down
