1
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:48,400
You're not

2
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:51,079
I wouldn't tell you if I had known

3
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,200
I'll be so angry that I can get a loan

4
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,000
I just can't figure it out

5
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,079
Why there is

6
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:00,920
Asset mortgage of equal amount

7
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
The money you lend from the bank is

8
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,400
It's several times taller than me

9
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,560
Why

10
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,959
The industry is different

11
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,318
I'm in real estate

12
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,520
Relationship with the bank

13
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,759
It was a little closer

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,639
And scale

15
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:18,520
Your soaring and your soaring together

16
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,199
It can be considered a small and medium-sized enterprise

17
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,960
Plus it's a private business

18
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,439
It's even harder

19
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,919
Don't you have foreign aid from your family

20
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,599
She can't help you with the loan

21
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,598
Her operational abilities

22
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,918
It's already reached its limit

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,639
I can't let her

24
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,000
Try the method with your body

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,319
You know I was yesterday

26
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,560
Did you tell her anything

27
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,000
I said I can just borrow money now

28
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,199
It's OK for me to sell myself

29
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:47,199
Guess what they said

30
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,159
People say

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,520
Her bank

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,199
I don't like my pounds

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Refused to accept

34
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,360
Isn't it you?

35
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,599
The gold at the bedside is full of heroes without color

36
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,199
Why didn't it happen

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,080
Mr. Lu

38
00:03:11,478 --> 00:03:12,199
Can you take it

39
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,400
A project in your house

40
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,000
Guarantee for me at the bank

41
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,840
I promise to repay on time

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,960
Never drag you into the water

43
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,840
real

44
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,240
With me

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,240
Your reputation is definitely fine

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,079
But our listed company guarantees

47
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,039
There is a strict process

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,919
I don't think so

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
You'll definitely not be able to

50
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,319
You're like this

51
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,960
In my private account

52
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,039
There's still some living money

53
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,599
Can't get too much

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,960
Only two million

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
If you really think it's useful

56
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:47,918
I'll call you for emergency first

57
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,079
Useful, useful, useful

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Of course it's useful

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,478
What I lack now is cash flow

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
You just have money

61
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:54,599
No matter how many it is, it's useful

62
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:55,918
Come on, Mr. Lu

63
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,680
I'll pay tribute to you first and I'll pay tribute to you first

64
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,039
Come on come on

65
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,079
Take your hand away first

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,439
No, I don't need to sell myself

67
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,240
No

68
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,960
I don't like you, either

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,560
Mr. Liu

70
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,519
morning

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,160
Sister He

72
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,160
Mr. Liu

73
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,639
You'll tell the cashier later

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,040
There will be a two million today

75
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,279
Call for private loan

76
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,600
good

77
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,480
She went to the bank

78
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,639
I'll tell her right away

79
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,519
Mr. Liu

80
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,600
The steel purchase payment can no longer be delayed

81
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,079
Now there is a lot of complaints in the workshop

82
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,319
Wait for these two million to arrive

83
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,279
Pay immediately

84
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,759
That's not enough

85
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,040
Hundreds of thousands of bad

86
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,800
Procurement department coordinates with suppliers

87
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,920
Sister He

88
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,759
Come back

89
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,720
Mr. Liu is here too

90
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,439
Good news

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,639
All two payments have been made

92
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,279
There are four million cash

93
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,079
Our daily expenses in May and June

94
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,279
Just deal with it omnipotently

95
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,720
Four million

96
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:08,839
yes

97
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,639
Two different accounts have been called

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,839
A total of four million

99
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,439
How come there are two sums

100
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,639
Someone is looking for you, Mr. Qian

101
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,800
Why are you here

102
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,959
I'll do business in the city

103
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,560
Passing by your lunch base

104
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,199
Thinking of having a meal together

105
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,800
Steak set meals in this restaurant

106
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,560
Very delicious

107
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,519
Surely for your taste

108
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,639
Add another steak set meal

109
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,720
OK please wait

110
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,680
Thank you

111
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Silently

112
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,240
Remitted two million to me

113
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,959
Have a nerve to say

114
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,639
If you have any difficulties, don't look for me

115
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,480
Although there is no Lu family's young master

116
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,399
Wealthy and powerful

117
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,279
But at least

118
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,240
It's more than ten years more friendship than him

119
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,439
He can help you get two million

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,839
I can, too

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
But how did you know

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,560
Lu Huadong lent me money

123
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,160
Where did this news come from?

124
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,319
You just leave it alone

125
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,839
I have an insider

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,480
Let me first talk about whether you have enough money

127
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll help you with some if not enough

128
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,159
Enough is enough

129
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,480
I'm just two hundred tons of steel

130
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,839
The purchase price is stuck

131
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,639
Your four million will be paid

132
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,600
I'm getting more affordable immediately

133
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,680
Wait until the contract will arrive next month

134
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,199
I'll be able to pay back the money right away

135
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,720
What steel do you buy? It's so expensive

136
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,959
Imported steel

137
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,040
Used on high-end molds

138
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,600
I want to support domestic products, too

139
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Just now

140
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,360
Quality of similar domestic labels

141
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,800
no promises

142
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,560
I really don't dare to take risks

143
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,240
You

144
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,759
Still the stubborn mind

145
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
What are the raw materials

146
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,040
If the client does not specify

147
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Why do you want to make things difficult for yourself?

148
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,160
Sometimes it's overly precise

149
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,439
It's also an unnecessary waste

150
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,759
You don't understand

151
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,160
This mold is processed

152
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,519
Need to withstand impact

153
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,240
No sloppy materials

154
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
And in the past two years

155
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,639
Domestic companies that pursue quality

156
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,600
More and more

157
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,680
I can't smash the sign of Tengfei

158
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,159
As you say so

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,360
It's a good trend

160
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,399
As long as society continues to develop

161
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,159
Where you use it

162
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,360
There will be more and more

163
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,079
Hope it's as good as you say

164
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,639
Hiroaki

165
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,159
I heard you've been lately

166
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,879
Started to lend privately

167
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,199
What is the interest rate

168
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,959
Let's go with the market

169
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,759
Small amounts are slightly higher in the short term

170
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,480
If you need it

171
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,959
I can give it to you

172
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,279
Introduce some reliable ones

173
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,759
But between us

174
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,120
Don't get involved in this matter

175
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,839
Otherwise, even brothers can't do it

176
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,120
I don't borrow money

177
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,959
I'm just worried about you

178
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,720
If you encounter those

179
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,079
What should I do if I borrow it and don't pay it back

180
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,120
I still think

181
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,720
Risks of private lending

182
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
Too high and uncontrollable

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
This business

184
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
All acquaintances introduce acquaintances

185
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,360
I only have a reputation

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,840
I'm using it now, too

187
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,399
The model you built for me

188
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,240
Control the overall situation

189
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,320
Control the overall situation

190
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Just like you said

191
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,960
Just put the overall bad debt rate

192
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,799
Control within a certain range

193
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,919
There won't be much problem

194
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,399
That's good

195
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,480
This is a density meter for measuring metal

196
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,480
We usually need

197
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,039
Measure large amounts of metals

198
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,720
Then enter our database

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,039
Liu Jun is not here

200
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,360
You'll take us to visit directly

201
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,159
Is it suitable

202
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,639
Are you kidding

203
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,759
Surely suitable

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,360
If Mr. Liu is still not my turn

205
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,000
He must have accompanied him personally

206
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,200
right

207
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
You don't have to worry about me

208
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,080
The first machine in the city has long been no longer under my control

209
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,559
I don't steal your secrets either

210
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,080
Scientific research is a systematic project

211
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Mr. Lu came to visit the laboratory

212
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,159
Look at several sets of data

213
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,039
I can't steal anything

214
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,600
There is another next door

215
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,440
More powerful equipment

216
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,200
I'll take you to see

217
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,000
OK

218
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,720
This device

219
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,159
Only one in the country

220
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,919
On the list of non-export controls

221
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,399
Definitely the top

222
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,879
After buying it

223
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,720
Our engineers

224
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,039
Renovated again

225
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,200
Current accuracy

226
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
It's definitely reached

227
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,879
Levels of technical control in Europe and the United States

228
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,720
Although this factory is a small and medium-sized enterprise

229
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,799
But this R&D center

230
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,960
It's really top-notch

231
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,279
Of course some problems

232
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,639
We need to ask for foreign aid, too

233
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,240
For example, Donghai No. 1 segment

234
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,159
Servo motor

235
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,519
It's not done yet

236
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,600
There are some huge amount of operations on arguments

237
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,679
We need to ask

238
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,120
Professor from Dongda University is here to help

239
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,240
This is you and the university

240
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,240
Cooperative computing

241
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,799
With the professors this morning

242
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,080
For this calculation method

243
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,479
Discussed for hours

244
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,720
Haven't had time to collect

245
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,879
I'll wipe it quickly

246
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,639
Don't wipe it

247
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,440
Mrs. Song is a talented student in the Department of Mathematics

248
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,000
When you talk about those precision instruments

249
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,080
She has no feelings

250
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,559
But this calculation formula

251
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,919
It's someone's old job

252
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,799
I didn't expect to manufacture the equipment

253
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,879
R&D process

254
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
So interesting

255
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,559
I understand

256
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,559
Why did you look at him differently?

257
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,399
Visit his lab

258
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,399
Remind me of something

259
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,840
Small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe

260
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,639
Although not large

261
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,399
But you have top skills in your hands

262
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,840
But their chief workers

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,320
Complaint to me, too

264
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,080
Say your Donghai No. 1

265
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,799
The company's production funds have been put into use

266
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,759
Sucked dry

267
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,000
In the late stage of research and development

268
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,440
The trial product is started once

269
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,080
It's going to suck in tens of thousands of dollars

270
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,320
It's indeed a black hole

271
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,360
You reminded me

272
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
I should ask

273
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,480
His funding situation

274
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,519
Tell me on Dongdong Road

275
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,720
Many factories with lower starting points than Liu Jun

276
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,519
Following the trend in recent years

277
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,960
Production scale

278
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,639
All surpassed Tengfei

279
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,039
So many people

280
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,799
I don't recognize his business method

281
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,840
I laughed at him for being too bad

282
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,399
He is technical

283
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,720
Not so eager for quick success

284
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,039
The industry has a good reputation

285
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,120
Even those who don't recognize him

286
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,240
At most it's ridicule

287
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,679
He won't run it

288
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,039
But for his products,

289
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,840
Nothing to say

290
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Hello

291
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,559
No

292
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,879
What's wrong

293
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,320
I see

294
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,919
What's wrong

295
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,039
Mr. An's secretary

296
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,159
He said he hadn't been to work these two days

297
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,159
Haven't said hello in advance

298
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,960
Asked a lot

299
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,159
No one asked where the person was

300
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Absconded

301
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,399
Still double regulating

302
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,759
Hello, what's wrong with you

303
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,759
Please open the door for official duties

304
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,120
OK I understand

305
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,360
Let them come in

306
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,000
The security guard said

307
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,480
I am a comrade of Donghai Public Security Bureau

308
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:40,159
Bring two

309
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,320
Police officers from Gangwon Province came

310
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,159
You need to cooperate with the investigation

311
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,799
Mr. Liu

312
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,159
Will these people

313
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,919
Take you across provinces to Beiyuan directly

314
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,879
It will definitely be more troublesome to leave the local area

315
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,440
If you wait a little longer

316
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,519
I want me to go with them

317
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,600
You give it to my dad

318
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,679
Bingbing calls

319
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
They'll find a way

320
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:07,879
good

321
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,320
Check it out

322
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,840
Sign up for no problem

323
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,559
OK

324
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
Please be careful

325
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,720
This laptop looks inconspicuous

326
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,039
But there are a lot of research materials

327
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,840
Need to be confidential

328
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,399
You can check

329
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,960
but

330
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,080
Please do not copy

331
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:53,879
Don't destroy it

332
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,159
Once something goes wrong

333
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,440
There is no backup

334
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,279
We have our working standards

335
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,440
You need to cooperate with the investigation now

336
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,240
Please Director Liu

337
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,440
Please do not answer the phone

338
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,840
My wife called me

339
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,200
No one can answer anyone

340
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,039
If you don't cooperate

341
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,720
I can only confiscate your phone number

342
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,400
Comrade

343
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,559
Why are you still asking me

344
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,400
Same problem

345
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,200
I've answered several times

346
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,240
I'm just an ordinary factory manager

347
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,759
We cooperate with Beiyuan Group

348
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,200
It is a scientific research project

349
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,439
On this project

350
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,559
Our technological advantages are quite obvious

351
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,119
No need at all

352
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,599
Fight through bribery

353
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:40,960
Don't need it

354
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,000
Technical advantages

355
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,279
It doesn't matter what you say

356
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,599
An Xinhua has to admit it

357
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,519
Is it useful

358
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,039
Young man

359
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,640
We're not going to investigate you this time

360
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,519
But An Xinhua himself admitted

361
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,920
Accepting bribes

362
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,319
we need to

363
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,440
Check his confession one by one

364
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,720
You can be a witness at most

365
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,119
The main responsibility lies with him

366
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
You don't need to hide it for him

367
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,599
Mr. An and I are just working together

368
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,000
If there is a technical problem

369
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,079
Maybe it can be discussed

370
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,079
But his other things

371
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,720
Have nothing to do with me

372
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,400
Even if you ask me again

373
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:32,799
one day

374
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,039
Two days

375
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
It's impossible to ask one

376
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,519
A answer that makes something out of nothing

377
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:08,920
fine

378
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,559
Hello, I'm

379
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,920
OK OK

380
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,960
OK Thank you very much

381
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,400
good

382
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,400
How about it

383
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,079
How about it

384
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:53,799
The person is released

385
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,880
It's OK now

386
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,039
Go and pick him up

387
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
Come quickly

388
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,000
Very good

389
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,240
The investigation is still underway

390
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,480
These days

391
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,720
Don't leave the East Sea

392
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,759
Don't worry, leader

393
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,960
Makes you worry

394
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,079
dad

395
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm scared

396
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,200
Come back

397
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,960
How is Liu Jun

398
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,160
It's okay

399
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,119
The focus of the investigation was not on him

400
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:54,880
What about Lao An

401
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,680
Lao An has several crimes

402
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,079
It must be impossible to escape

403
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,319
This is his person

404
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,680
Good ability

405
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:04,759
Falling is defeated

406
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,200
The mind is useless on the right path

407
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,039
He has the ending today

408
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm not surprised

409
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,559
I just didn't expect it to be so soon

410
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,559
I'd known this before

411
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,240
I'll definitely not introduce Liu Jun

412
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,240
Worked with him

413
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,480
I'll do it

414
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,559
The scale of the stoke is really too small

415
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,720
But you didn't have anything at that time

416
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,880
Too many other options

417
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,160
yes

418
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,559
Liu Jun is weak in terms of financial strength

419
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
If he can bear it alone

420
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,119
This project

421
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,000
I'll definitely give it to him directly

422
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,079
There will be no future storm

423
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,039
You're still worried

424
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,359
Liu Jun’s mood now

425
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Surely worse

426
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,119
To develop technology

427
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,200
Even the company's expansion has been delayed

428
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,799
These two years have been hard and no gains

429
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,400
It's really hard for him to persevere

430
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,400
You don't understand this

431
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,079
Liu Jun is engaged in

432
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,599
It's his favorite job

433
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,240
And during the work

434
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,519
Continuous achievements

435
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,160
This feeling of pleasure is

436
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,359
There are few things to replace

437
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,759
You're like me

438
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,160
Because of love

439
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,319
There will be a kind of heart

440
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,559
Endogenous motivation

441
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,400
Even if you encounter setbacks

442
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,759
Occasionally a little depressed

443
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,839
New fun will be discovered soon

444
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,880
Rekind the enthusiasm for technology

445
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,880
If you don't believe it, ask him

446
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,920
He will definitely not think

447
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,200
I've worked hard for the past few years

448
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,000
I asked him

449
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,599
People say it's weird if you work hard

450
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,119
What's wrong

451
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,119
You're right

452
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,839
When did I miss it

453
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:03,920
Liu Jun

454
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,039
Liu Jun

455
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,279
Can't sleep

456
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,880
After suddenly waking up

457
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,839
I can't sleep anymore

458
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,839
What's wrong

459
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,599
Ice Ice

460
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,759
Do you think I'm a bad guy

461
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,519
Mr. Song, you admire the most, has a nickname

462
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,839
Do you know what it is called

463
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,599
non-stick pan

464
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,599
What's the meaning

465
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,319
Meaning

466
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,279
He's a cold-hearted person

467
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,599
There is no human feelings in my eyes

468
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,200
Things like what you encountered this time

469
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,039
Put it before

470
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,119
He almost never sticks to his hands

471
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,640
Lin Yue, you know

472
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,480
Have such a deep connection with him

473
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,680
But once the relationship continues

474
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,920
There will be risks

475
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,200
He will draw a line immediately

476
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,839
Never drag on the mud

477
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,240
So you don't have to doubt yourself

478
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,799
Can someone like this help you

479
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,960
Explain your character and ability

480
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,400
All are trustworthy

481
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:20,640
Mr. Liu

482
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:21,319
morning

483
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,519
Mr. Liu is back

484
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,200
Mr. Liu

485
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:29,720
How about it

486
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,359
No grievances inside

487
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:32,839
fine

488
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,400
I didn't make things difficult for them

489
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,720
You just have to be stubborn

490
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,759
But I'll tell you

491
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,920
When you're not here these two days

492
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,839
The factory is entirely supported by Luo Luo

493
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
I, a veteran, didn't make any move

494
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,680
Very handsome

495
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,519
Old factory manager, please don't laugh at me

496
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,880
I'm also a general

497
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,680
I can't sleep until I sleep at night

498
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,640
Can't sleep

499
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,559
Now it's OK

500
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,400
This is really a marshal.

501
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,720
I finally felt at ease

502
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,119
You can flatter you later

503
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,319
I just got from the Management Committee

504
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,440
I've heard a good news

505
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,720
I'll tell you here.

506
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,920
Government funding

507
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,720
I'll tell you

508
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,720
Secretary Qi told me

509
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
This time the funding

510
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,200
It's definitely not a fool-minded project

511
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,319
Really

512
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,880
It's Secretary Cao in our city

513
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,079
Promoted personally

514
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:18,519
Specially targeted at corporate scientific research behaviors

515
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,440
Support provided

516
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,759
The previous large items

517
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,599
Let's not count on it

518
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,599
Can't rank us

519
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,279
It's the smallest share

520
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,640
A year is also a six million interest-free loan

521
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,519
Six million interest-free loan

522
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,400
If this is true

523
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,119
No matter what happens

524
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,039
We have to fight for it, too

525
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,640
right

526
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,279
What are the application conditions?

527
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,720
This is

528
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,240
Required to be funded

529
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,960
Before the end of the year

530
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:45,960
Must come up with one

531
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,480
National patents

532
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,720
That's it

533
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,839
This is for us

534
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,240
Isn't it a piece of cake

535
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:01,960
I'll tell you

536
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:02,960
Don't be too happy too early

537
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,279
Don't be too happy too early

538
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,359
I'll tell you

539
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,960
I later asked in depth

540
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,000
I just knew

541
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,640
In fact, funding this matter

542
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,640
A month ago

543
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,480
They published the article publicly

544
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,960
But the people from the Management Committee

545
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,640
Not just conveyed to us

546
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,839
Why

547
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,079
Because our factory

548
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Compared with other factories

549
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,279
Poor qualifications

550
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,319
It's not that our qualifications are not bad

551
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,640
We're private

552
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,759
What's wrong with private business

553
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,680
Why can't private?

554
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,400
yes

555
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,960
Is there no other private sector

556
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:32,799
Can you squeeze into the list?

557
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,759
No, there are still a few

558
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,319
But the boss is different

559
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,440
Or they are NPC deputies

560
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,440
Or a member of the CPPCC

561
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,200
We don't have any titles

562
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,400
Pure private

563
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,480
But I'll think about it

564
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Eligibility

565
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,400
Actually, so far

566
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,079
Still have a chance to fight for it

567
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,000
Then we need one

568
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,440
Recommended by those with weight

569
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,839
A person with weight

570
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,880
There is no need to thank you

571
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,599
You didn't have much problem

572
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,359
sit

573
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,319
What I care most about now

574
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,240
It's the progress of Donghai No. 1

575
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:23,920
Tengfei and Beiyuan Group

576
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:24,680
Segmented contract

577
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,160
What do you plan to deal with next

578
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,799
Just look at the contract

579
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,440
There are only two ways to deal with it

580
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,599
First, the principal and interest place

581
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Put their investment in these two periods

582
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:33,880
Pay it back

583
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,720
Exclusive rights to patents for segmented research

584
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,440
Buy it back

585
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,440
Second, how much money did Beiyuan give

586
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,440
I'll do it according to the proportion

587
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,000
Share research results with them

588
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,839
Then you

589
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,839
Which way to deal with it more

590
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,279
Then the problem now

591
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,480
Not what I want

592
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,519
But there is Kitahara

593
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,559
It's already a mess

594
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,200
Not even a person in charge

595
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,640
There is no way to negotiate

596
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,279
Kitahara Group

597
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,160
It won't be so messy

598
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,319
There will be soon

599
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,519
Personnel Appointments

600
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,519
You just think it's good

601
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,960
Persist in persistence

602
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,239
The entire Donghai No. 1

603
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,880
There are more than thirty links

604
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,920
The prospects for domestic production are unknown

605
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:21,880
Long construction period

606
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,359
Final investment

607
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,240
It is likely to exceed

608
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,920
Total amount of foreign equipment introduced

609
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:27,880
to be honest

610
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,799
The entire project has been advanced to the present

611
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,119
Your troubles

612
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,159
Not much

613
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,240
I can hold on

614
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,160
You definitely can do it too

615
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,960
I dare not compete with you, Mr. Song

616
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,559
I'll tell the truth

617
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,559
I've heard it outside before

618
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,279
A lot of rumors about you

619
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,359
What a great joy

620
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,559
Take a fish in troubled waters

621
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:48,000
What do they know

622
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,400
Just for such a little profit

623
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,279
Be a Chinese agent for a foreign company

624
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,839
Put pressure on you in all aspects

625
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,559
If it was me

626
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,559
I really may not be able to withstand it

627
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,480
Then what can I do?

628
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,400
Pass Guanguan Guanguan

629
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,359
yes

630
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,200
I have nothing else to ask for now

631
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,319
Just two o'clock

632
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,200
First, don't implicate your elders anymore

633
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,720
My wife is worried

634
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,680
Two

635
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,920
It's the capital

636
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:21,319
Mr. Song

637
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,480
All of this is said

638
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,039
I want to ask you for help if you have a favor

639
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,880
Mr. Luo

640
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,960
Mr. Luo, don't leave

641
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,880
Lao Xu, come to me

642
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,079
I'll look for you

643
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,440
Tengda

644
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,119
Mr. Liu asked me to be responsible for production preparation

645
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,000
You know this, too

646
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:49,519
Know

647
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,599
The installation and debugging of the device now

648
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,640
The personnel training is in place

649
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,839
Order Mr. Luo

650
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,279
You tell me today

651
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,880
when

652
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,480
Only then can we issue production tasks

653
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,440
It's soon

654
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,119
The last two details are missing

655
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,078
Need to confirm

656
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,880
Tengda

657
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,359
Running to the second line to make volume

658
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,799
Where are there so many contract details in the second line

659
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,759
Is it that complicated?

660
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,200
The first batch of new factories

661
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,559
You can't help but be careful

662
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,079
Let's do it in the future

663
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,359
OK

664
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,559
Too much to say hurts harmony

665
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,079
I'll believe you again

666
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
But I can tell you

667
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,799
The equipment staff remained unmoved for a day

668
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,680
But it's a one-day cost

669
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,480
Know

670
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,720
I'm doing it for our factory

671
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:27,480
yes

672
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,599
Have the details of the contract

673
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,480
Little Ronaldo

674
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,079
Old factory manager

675
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,680
It's hard for you

676
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,400
I know the order is not a problem

677
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,000
It's after this starts

678
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,880
A shortage of funds for operation

679
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,279
The old factory manager tells the truth

680
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,200
I am very confident in the current market

681
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,400
As long as Tengda's machine can move

682
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,079
We can run as much as we want

683
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,079
But this is missing

684
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,240
I hope Mr. Liu will ask for help today

685
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,920
Can you ask for good news back

686
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,240
There will definitely be good news

687
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,200
Go and do your business

688
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,279
Six million

689
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,319
You're taking off the scale now

690
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Not small

691
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,119
You have another one who works in the bank

692
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,079
Executive wife

693
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,279
Loan approval matter

694
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,319
It shouldn't be difficult

695
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,079
Even this mere six million fun-free

696
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,759
All have to stare at

697
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,400
Your eyelids

698
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,599
It's too shallow

699
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,480
Mr. Song

700
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,880
Six million is nothing in your eyes

701
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,359
Put it on our flight

702
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,839
That's a timely rain

703
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,519
To be honest with you

704
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,799
Legal tricks

705
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,200
My wife has run out of it

706
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,000
You can't force her to go on a bad path

707
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,400
Take it in too

708
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,200
It's hard to meet now

709
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,960
Such a government-funded project

710
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,559
Our other conditions

711
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,599
All are oversatisfied

712
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,799
It's a private company

713
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,799
I see

714
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,440
Something else is hard to agree to

715
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,279
But this interest-free loan

716
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,000
I can help you get it

717
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,119
real

718
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,159
Since the government wants to encourage scientific research

719
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,480
At least the bottom line of fairness still needs to be

720
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,960
If a company like Lian Tengfei

721
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,079
No support is available

722
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,480
Then I really don't know

723
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,360
What kind of companies are there

724
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:19,559
Can you be qualified

725
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,518
Mr. Song

726
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,199
To be honest

727
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,920
I don't know how to thank you

728
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,400
You really want to thank me

729
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,360
Of course

730
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,119
Then I'll put someone in

731
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,159
Go to your R&D center

732
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,000
How about it

733
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,280
Returnee from undergraduate mathematics

734
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,800
Just gave up this major for several years

735
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,518
I want to return to my old business recently

736
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,559
besides

737
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,679
She doesn't want a salary

738
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,440
You are talking about Sister Liang

739
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,400
Then I definitely welcome it

740
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,480
Our R&D center won't say anything else

741
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,800
There are a lot of calculations piled up there

742
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,679
She wants to calculate as much as she wants

743
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:43,920
Come back

744
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,199
Come back

745
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,679
It smells so good

746
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,320
You've cooked

747
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,280
Live fish bought in the vegetable market

748
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,599
Are you today

749
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,920
What's the joy of

750
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,519
So happy and cook

751
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,920
Thank you for your guidance

752
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,440
I've found our account opening bank

753
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,840
The Pulse of Credit Manager

754
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,199
Our company

755
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,880
Application for expanding credit limit

756
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,199
Approved today

757
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,920
Tengda Factory starts production volume

758
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,119
Your income amount

759
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,320
Has reached

760
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,320
The scale that makes banks tempt

761
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,280
It's reasonable to be able to approve it

762
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm just helping you

763
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,039
Just found the right time

764
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,119
It is also important to seize the opportunity

765
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,440
After all, not every boss

766
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,320
They all look like me

767
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,760
With you a good friend

768
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,159
You can talk, I'll eat it

769
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:28,960
eat

770
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:29,800
Take a taste

771
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,880
Taste a very hot rib

772
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:34,559
How about it

773
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,320
tasty

774
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,639
I'm very good at cooking

775
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,719
Ribs are delicious

776
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,239
Why are you doing so anxious to eat

777
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,480
You're going out tonight

778
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,519
A lot of calculations to be done in the R&D center

779
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,159
Lao Sun and Sister Liang are still working overtime

780
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,079
I have to go over and take a look

781
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,679
Mrs. Song loves mathematics so much

782
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,519
I have to work overtime for you if I don't have a salary

783
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,960
After she returned to her major

784
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:06,880
Very active

785
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,119
Several times

786
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,360
I don't want to go back

787
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,440
Mr. Song has to come here to pick people up

788
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,320
I heard she has handed over

789
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,480
Shanghai companies

790
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,239
No longer responsible for specific projects

791
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,000
yes

792
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,440
You said someone is successful

793
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,400
Just different

794
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,039
Get idle

795
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,199
What about the center of life

796
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,840
It's all about your own interests

797
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:27,840
Not like me

798
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:30,079
I only have a promotion and salary increase

799
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,599
You're also excellent

800
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,679
You've also succeeded

801
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,360
You know you're anxious, please slow down

802
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,599
You choked for a while

803
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,320
Bite your mouth

804
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,320
Should I talk to you or not

805
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,400
Come and eat some okra

806
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:29,199
Mr. Sun

807
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,480
Dumplings are ready and eat them while they are hot

808
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,320
You can eat it quickly, too

809
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:34,199
Sister Liang, do you eat dumplings?

810
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,360
I won't have late supper at night

811
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,039
Thank you

812
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,440
Okay, I'll cook it for you if you're hungry

813
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,039
good

814
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,400
Mr. Liu

815
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,639
The dumplings are ready

816
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,800
You put it there first

817
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,559
good

818
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,400
How is this value

819
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,239
Mr. Liu and Mr. Song are here

820
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,360
Mr. Song

821
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,159
Come and pick up Sister Liang from get off work

822
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,440
I won't say it before 10 o'clock in the evening

823
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:02,639
Don't you have to pick me up

824
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,559
It's just nine o'clock

825
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,719
I'll talk to Liu Jun.

826
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,039
You'll do yours first

827
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,679
Come on

828
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:16,880
You can watch it for me first

829
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,199
Kitahara took office

830
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,960
New General Manager

831
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:26,760
You know

832
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,079
I heard that my surname is Tian

833
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,760
seem

834
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,119
Very background

835
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,719
This Mr. Tian has just taken office

836
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,719
Just call me

837
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,719
This afternoon, a deputy general manager was sent

838
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,599
Come to the East China Sea

839
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,239
Promise me with swearing

840
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,400
After Beiyuan Group's restructuring

841
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,000
Already have the ability to complete it independently

842
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,320
The research and development of segmented projects

843
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,320
To put it bluntly

844
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,480
They just want to leave Tengfei aside

845
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,239
Directly cooperate with Donghai Group

846
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
I've been thinking

847
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,639
Why did they suddenly

848
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,679
Just so confident

849
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,519
Yes or no

850
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,480
It has to do with the leak of your research and development data

851
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,800
If the company develops information

852
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,159
If it was obtained by Kitahara

853
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,559
That's not actually a leak

854
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
Because they have the right to share

855
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,199
The R&D results of the first two phases

856
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,039
It seems they want to take you

857
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,679
The R&D results of the first two phases

858
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,760
Come and compete with you directly

859
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,079
Kitahara Group

860
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,400
It's a qualified company

861
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,360
Legal and compliant competition

862
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,719
I can't refuse

863
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,079
You have confidence to win them

864
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,000
Are you going to get results first?

865
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Are you going to get results first?

866
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,480
Mr. Song means

867
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,639
If Kitahara is in

868
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,960
At the end of 2007

869
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,360
Take out the product

870
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,320
This business is theirs

871
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,159
That's right

872
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,480
Why

873
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,920
That's the last few years

874
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:28,760
Wouldn't it be in vain

875
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,239
This will cost you a loss to death

876
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:34,079
Loss is not the most important

877
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,239
If Kitahara

878
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,519
Be able to get the product first

879
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,519
Then they can apply for patents first

880
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,519
This has really come to this point

881
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,559
All the investments in Tengfei were ruined

882
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,280
And the results of research and development

883
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,880
Not available to other products yet

884
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,559
It's illegal to use it

885
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,480
but

886
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,960
The spirit of the employees of Kitahara Group

887
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,000
I've experienced it

888
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,599
This last step is a qualitative leap

889
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Very difficult

890
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:04,920
I don't think they can accomplish this

891
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,159
Boss Liu

892
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,840
Don't take it too lightly

893
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,559
People like Mr. An

894
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,599
After careful layout for so many years

895
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,000
When you kick it

896
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,119
Peaches picked

897
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,840
Do you think this peach picker

898
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,920
Can you be an ordinary person?

899
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:35,880
What's wrong

900
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,760
Engineers at the R&D Center

901
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,440
Under my nose

902
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:44,880
The experimental data they obtained

903
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,360
I can keep it confidential

904
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,519
But the third phase of research and development

905
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:50,400
Lack of funds

906
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:51,960
I didn't dare to run the experimental equipment

907
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,239
But first,

908
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,679
Cooperated in large batches of operations

909
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,599
If those professors who cooperate

910
00:42:58,719 --> 00:42:59,679
Being poached

911
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:01,719
As long as it is covered up well

912
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,679
I can't even catch evidence of breach of contract

913
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,360
But you didn't sign with them

914
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,360
Is there a confidentiality agreement?
