1
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,520
Good evening

2
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,478
Good evening

3
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:35,960
Is it OK

4
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960
You did it right

5
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,560
What are you talking about without any brains

6
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,918
Come

7
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,120
I know it's you

8
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,439
Liu Jun

9
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,960
As brave as you

10
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,400
Such a scrupulous person

11
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,039
I've never seen it before

12
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:17,560
Sometimes

13
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,800
I want to be like you, too

14
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,280
Have a burning belief

15
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,759
Have immortal passion

16
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,360
But I

17
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,400
Can't do it no matter how

18
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,280
Miss Lin, you're drunk too much

19
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,478
All started writing poetry

20
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,520
There's a little more

21
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,800
But not enough

22
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,199
Would you like to have another drink with me?

23
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,520
You'd better stop drinking

24
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,680
I'll pour you a glass of water

25
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,879
You don't want to

26
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,959
I understand

27
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
I'll try to explain it to you

28
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,879
But what about you

29
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,480
Be careful

30
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,279
Liu Jun

31
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,279
For a factory, do you think you

32
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,120
As for it

33
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,759
Ah Jun

34
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,759
Do you remember

35
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,879
There is a pond to the north of the factory

36
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,199
Walk from you

37
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,240
You'll go there to play with water often

38
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,199
Every time I cried and shouted to catch fish

39
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,399
Your mother gave you a slap for this

40
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,160
Remember

41
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,040
That waste pile here

42
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,560
When I was in elementary school

43
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,439
You'll bring your classmates there

44
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
Go and get scrap iron to sell

45
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,759
Just to buy a guitar

46
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,519
You haven't played a few times

47
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,319
I entered this factory at the age of seventeen

48
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,759
Thirty-eight years have passed

49
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,519
This factory

50
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,959
Feed our whole family

51
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,160
dad

52
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,000
Qianjin Factory

53
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,639
It's your life's hard work

54
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,159
It's also where I grew up

55
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,439
I can't bear to sell it

56
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,680
I can't bear to give up, I really can't bear to give up

57
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,560
But you have to give up if you need to give up

58
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,159
I can't just spend half my life

59
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,879
What's past is gone

60
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,560
Dad has the rest of his life

61
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,519
Dad is pointing at you for the rest of your life

62
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,240
The times are about to develop

63
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,360
We have to look forward

64
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,639
Going forward, right?

65
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,680
right

66
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,639
Dad won't hold you back

67
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,800
Definitely won't look back

68
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,679
dad

69
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,600
I promise

70
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,600
We will definitely get better and better

71
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,639
Will definitely

72
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,159
Will definitely

73
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,720
Walk

74
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,159
Sorry to be late

75
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,840
It's not too early for us

76
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,039
haven't seen you for a long time

77
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,000
Long time no see

78
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,960
I've heard about it in the city bureau

79
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,440
You two have been running for half a month

80
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,480
Inspecting the development zone

81
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,159
All have become experts

82
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,320
All the questions are data

83
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,039
Ordinary people can't receive you two

84
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,320
You don't know him yet

85
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,919
Talking with data

86
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,200
Let's just look at the place

87
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,399
Because I have a meeting in the afternoon

88
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,240
OK, hold on

89
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:20,799
Walk

90
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,000
Director Li will lead the way

91
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Can you come from the city to check it out for me

92
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm so grateful

93
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,960
Very amazing now

94
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,759
This polite word comes

95
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
Comrade Xiao Liu makes rapid progress

96
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,919
That's quite fast

97
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
This is not a polite statement

98
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,879
Let's just be here

99
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,240
It looks pretty clean

100
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,879
Very clean

101
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,679
Come on

102
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,360
sure

103
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,399
How about it

104
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,799
Feel good

105
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,240
OK OK

106
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,600
Thank you Thank you

107
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,639
Order now

108
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,519
No need for that

109
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,799
I'll call you later

110
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,440
OK

111
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,360
We both saw a lot of land before

112
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,399
this

113
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,480
You can rank in the top three

114
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,919
This plot is really good

115
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,679
But the old king

116
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,279
This Kunjiang District

117
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,080
Policy preferential

118
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,279
Not very prominent

119
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm in the city investment and promotion bureau

120
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,720
I understand the truth and truth of these policies very well

121
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,720
What have you heard of?

122
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,080
Close the door and beat the dog

123
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,519
What's the meaning

124
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,480
I've said this all the way

125
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,480
I'll drink some water first

126
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,919
Lao Qian, please explain

127
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,639
Some industrial areas

128
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,960
To attract investment

129
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,679
Many preferential policies will be given

130
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
Can you wait for the company to register and settle in

131
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
Find a document from hair

132
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,000
Just changed

133
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,200
Cut meat without any mercy

134
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,279
You are like us in foreign trade companies

135
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,279
You can shoot one shot and change another place

136
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,200
But you are in the business

137
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,000
Build a factory and get equipment

138
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,639
A large amount of funds in the early stage

139
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,879
All are involved

140
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,559
You can run away monks

141
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,440
Can't run away from the temple

142
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,519
What about Kunjiang District

143
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,799
Advantages of Kunjiang Economic and Technological Development Zone

144
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,919
There are three points

145
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,000
First

146
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,039
It is a national development zone

147
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,039
Has formed a certain scale

148
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,720
Relatively speaking

149
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,080
More stable

150
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,519
What's the second

151
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Its tax benefits

152
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,799
It is a direct exemption

153
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,279
Instead of saying

154
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,519
Tax refund after one year of entry

155
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,240
This support level

156
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,519
It's bigger than you think

157
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,039
What about the third one

158
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,480
Kunjiang District

159
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,720
Just changed to a new secretary

160
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,000
This person

161
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,799
Young and courageous, willing to devote yourself

162
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,159
The most important thing is

163
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,399
People know what it means to raise fish with water

164
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,120
Didn't expect something to be considered

165
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,080
So many

166
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,720
When I just returned home

167
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,320
I feel like opportunities are everywhere

168
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,519
Don't understand why there are many

169
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,000
Simple and profitable things

170
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,879
But no one did it

171
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,399
Now it looks

172
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,679
It turns out that everyone is not stupid

173
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,399
I'm the only one who is simple in mind

174
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,360
Don't overestimate it

175
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,919
You're abroad

176
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,519
Work experience and vision

177
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,720
It's your advantage

178
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,840
Wait for you to finish understanding

179
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,200
After the rules on both sides

180
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,000
The integration of Chinese and Western

181
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,679
We two leopards

182
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,240
Can't compare with you

183
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,320
OK, I learned so much today

184
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,279
I'll invite you to eat

185
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,600
Please come less and I will come

186
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,360
That boss orders food

187
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,840
nailed it

188
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,120
The Management Committee finally rang the seal

189
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,240
The environmental impact assessment and safety assessment have also been approved

190
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,919
I'll say you're over-worry

191
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,279
The development zone government has policy support

192
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,720
As long as the steps are compliant

193
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,080
It's not difficult to do things

194
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,279
OK I'll go home for dinner

195
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,919
Feed Lin Chuan

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,279
Just rang your doorbell

197
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,639
Dr. Liu is not at home

198
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,639
I'm working in Kunjiang Economic Development Zone

199
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,519
What's wrong with Mr. Lin

200
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,200
I heard you are selling Qianjin Factory

201
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,600
Don't know how the progress is

202
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,279
There are several quotes being discussed now

203
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,840
But the biggest problem now is

204
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,799
No one is willing to accept my worker

205
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,879
All you want is the ground

206
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,799
I have a buyer here

207
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,320
Very good conditions

208
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
If you can trust me

209
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,120
I'll help you with a thread

210
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,279
Let's meet and contact each other first

211
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,279
Of course I trust you

212
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,159
That's it

213
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,879
I'll treat you to dinner tonight

214
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:58,960
That's OK

215
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,840
I'll book a place tonight at 6:30

216
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,679
You drive

217
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,759
See you both in the garage

218
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,480
OK See you tonight

219
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,840
Is there any space available?

220
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
I'll do a nail

221
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,558
Thanks to Miss Lin for dressing up carefully

222
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,600
Accompany me to attend

223
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:36,600
You're welcome

224
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,600
You sell the factory at this time

225
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,200
To replace the land

226
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,399
Raise funds

227
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,720
To avoid my elder brother

228
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,200
It should be said that both are

229
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,279
I'm definitely going to develop better

230
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,799
My dad probably

231
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,240
Want to hide from your brother

232
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,080
Give you a suggestion

233
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,360
Don't you know Liang Sishen

234
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,480
You can follow her recently

235
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,559
Telling this infringement lawsuit

236
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,399
She is very familiar with my brother

237
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,039
Liang Sishen

238
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,440
Sister Liang

239
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,600
yes

240
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,000
Her husband is Mr. Song of Donghai Group

241
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,480
You won't know

242
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,039
The boss of Donghai Group is not

243
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,399
Is your brother's friend

244
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,159
careful

245
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:00,519
superior

246
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,640
Stop hitting, stop hitting

247
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,640
Get away

248
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,240
I'll tell you less

249
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,480
What to see

250
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,920
Let's see if you fight

251
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,960
I know you

252
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,039
I know you

253
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,680
Stop him

254
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,319
Leave him a mark

255
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,440
The boss said he let him go

256
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,519
Please

257
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,039
Don't cut my fingers

258
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:15,960
Don't cut my fingers

259
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,720
Don't cut my fingers

260
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,359
My fingers

261
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,400
My fingers

262
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,079
Can be picked up by the doctor, say can be picked up by

263
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:33,440
Don't tell me dad

264
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,519
Don't tell me dad

265
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,119
Go and find Qian Hongming

266
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,480
You can't go in

267
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,440
Wait outside

268
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,440
Did you call the police?

269
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,160
What happened

270
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,240
According to your narrative

271
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,839
Someone rides a bicycle

272
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,799
Impossible collision

273
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,079
After the injured get off the car

274
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,319
So he surrounded him and beat him

275
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,519
A witness said

276
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,720
You've called to know these people on the scene

277
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,759
I just thought I'd say that

278
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,960
Can scare them

279
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,200
So you don't know them

280
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,079
Can it be

281
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
Try to describe the perpetrator

282
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,039
For example, height and size

283
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,480
What about facial features

284
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,319
Things happened too quickly

285
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,480
I can't remember it clearly, either

286
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,519
Are they locals

287
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,200
What accent

288
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,440
Get away

289
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,440
I'll tell you less

290
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,079
Can't hear it

291
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,479
Miss Lin Miss Lin

292
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:33,799
What's wrong

293
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
What happened

294
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,960
I don't know either

295
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,440
Just leave the community

296
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,920
Suddenly I got around and beat him

297
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,519
After the fight, he ran away

298
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,640
Haven't caught anyone yet

299
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,319
The incident is still under investigation

300
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,119
No suspect has been confirmed yet

301
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:48,400
Hello, comrade

302
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,160
My name is Qian Hongming

303
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,559
The injured friend

304
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:52,960
My surname is Gu

305
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,759
This case

306
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,160
I'm currently in charge of the investigation

307
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,519
My friend just came back from Germany

308
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,559
PhD in Engineering

309
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,440
He only knows work every day

310
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,759
He can't participate in anything

311
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,359
Fighting

312
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,359
This is definitely once

313
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,680
Malicious harm incidents

314
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:06,960
What about the injured relatives

315
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,960
When will it come

316
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,359
His father will arrive soon

317
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,720
You're all here

318
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,039
I want to go home first

319
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,960
Liu Jun's surgery situation

320
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,400
Please tell me anytime

321
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,759
Come on come on

322
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,359
Open the door

323
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Come here Come here

324
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,680
Come here Come here

325
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,319
Who opens the door

326
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,720
Stop knocking

327
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,480
Lin Chuan

328
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,480
Lin Yue

329
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,400
Lin Chuan

330
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,279
Lin Yue

331
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,319
What's wrong with sister

332
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,119
Why are you covered in blood?

333
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:46,839
What's wrong

334
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,519
Lin Yue

335
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:48,759
It was you who did it

336
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,799
It's what you did

337
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,640
What's wrong

338
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,039
Did you do it

339
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:52,920
What wind is going to smoke

340
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,880
What happened

341
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Did you find someone to beat Liu Jun

342
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,000
Yes or no

343
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,799
Liu Jun was beaten

344
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,240
When did it happen

345
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,720
Don't pretend

346
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,160
When I heard those people's accent

347
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,799
I know it was arranged by you

348
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,559
Such a despicable method

349
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,799
You made it

350
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,640
What's the difference between you and a hooligan

351
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,240
I did nothing

352
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,359
You can't be beaten just because of Liu Jun

353
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,279
Just think it's me

354
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,480
The instructed person did it

355
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,799
This era

356
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,279
Who is still playing the game of fighting and killing?

357
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Didn't I tell you

358
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,480
I won't bother with him.

359
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,839
Your sister-in-law was there that day.

360
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,599
You heard it

361
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,759
I've said this

362
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,119
I don't need it

363
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,319
Now find someone to beat him

364
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,079
younger sister

365
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,079
Did I lie?

366
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,680
Your sister-in-law can tell at a glance

367
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,440
Let me tell her

368
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,519
Have I lied to her

369
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,559
It's not that you don't believe me

370
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,000
I really didn't do it

371
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,279
Stop acting

372
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,920
You're still a father

373
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,440
Do such a shameless thing

374
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,400
I never thought about giving it to your child

375
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,759
Do you accumulate virtue?

376
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,640
Lin Chuan, you

377
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,720
Don't talk nonsense

378
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,599
My life

379
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,319
I hate others to frame me the most

380
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,440
Believe it or not, I will slap you

381
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,920
Boss Boss

382
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,079
You go You go

383
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,440
I don't, I won't care about you

384
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,720
The policeman is going to ask me again

385
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,119
I won't hide it for you anymore

386
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:37,960
Lin Chuan

387
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,759
What do you mean

388
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,839
You really don't even believe me

389
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,200
What shit pot

390
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,519
Can snatch my head

391
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,240
Mr. Feeding

392
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,720
How is the surgery

393
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,240
Don't worry

394
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,640
The finger has been connected

395
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,039
The sixth and seventh rib fracture on the left side

396
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,400
Fortunately, there was no puncture of the pleural pulmonary vesicles

397
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,559
But the doctor said

398
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,359
It takes a few more days to observe

399
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,240
That's good

400
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm hanging

401
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,599
Wait a moment

402
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,880
Miss Lin

403
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,079
Some witnesses at the scene said

404
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,200
Several fighters

405
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,039
There is a clear Jiangyang accent

406
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,160
Probably a fellow countryman

407
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,519
Miss Lin was closest to them at the time

408
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,000
Please think about it again

409
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
To their accent

410
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,119
Do you have any impressions

411
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,160
I was too scared at that time

412
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,200
My mind is blank

413
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,440
Can't remember anything

414
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,519
This situation is also very common

415
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,400
Miss Lin's origin

416
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,200
Where is it

417
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,400
Come and drink

418
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,519
Come and drink

419
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,079
Brother, I'll pour some for you

420
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,759
Come on, I'll pour it on you

421
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,200
elder brother

422
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,279
Isn't it a bit big

423
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,920
What's a bit big

424
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,119
What do you mean

425
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,839
You can't do it

426
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,759
I have to let him know

427
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,759
This matter cannot be overcome without any bleeding

428
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,359
Do you understand?

429
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,400
What kind of evil did I do

430
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,839
How can I get you guys

431
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,279
I'm not crazy

432
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,119
How dare you

433
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,359
Did I ask you to do this

434
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:22,799
Isn't that day

435
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,880
Did you say you wanted him to see the blood

436
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,640
What I said to you

437
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,799
I called and said something angry

438
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,519
Do you understand the anger

439
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,799
Just what you say when you're angry

440
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,200
Not in your mind

441
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,799
What are you installing every day

442
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,240
Come on come on

443
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,640
Let me see let me see

444
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,880
I'll see what you are doing

445
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,640
Brother

446
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,880
Brother, we were wrong

447
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,039
You can relieve you

448
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,000
You can relieve your breath

449
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:03,720
Come

450
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,119
Come

451
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,480
How many children are you

452
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,720
one

453
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,079
Brother, why do you ask this

454
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,279
Ah Jun

455
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,920
Dad is here

456
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,680
It's okay

457
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,559
Connect the fingers

458
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,680
The doctor said the operation was successful

459
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,279
Will recover soon

460
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,240
It's okay

461
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,480
dad

462
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,039
Don't be afraid

463
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,480
I'm fine

464
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,359
I'll carry it

465
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Son, remember

466
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,759
I will make Lin Yue pay the price

467
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,519
You remember

468
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,839
You said I was reckless

469
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,160
Dad, no matter how angry you are

470
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,680
Don't compare to rotten apples

471
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:26,880
I won't say it, dad knows

472
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Dad knows

473
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,519
Let's sleep for a while

474
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,000
You're back

475
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,480
Wake you up

476
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,000
No

477
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,640
How is Liu Jun

478
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,839
Just finished the operation

479
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,680
His dad is there to accompany him

480
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,359
Too scary

481
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,480
I didn't expect Donghai

482
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,279
Such a thing can happen

483
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,079
yes

484
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
It happened to me

485
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,000
What does the police say

486
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,359
The police said

487
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,400
I forgot to boil water

488
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,000
Don't get up, don't get up

489
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,960
I'll do it, I'll do it, don't get hot

490
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,359
Let it go

491
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,160
You guys saved the fire all night

492
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,279
Almost back

493
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,880
Give your own house

494
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,759
If that's true

495
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,960
We'll go to the newspaper

496
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,240
Feed Ma Yue

497
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,559
Sorry to wake you up

498
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
I remember your lover

499
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,559
It's a reporter from Donghai Business Daily, right

500
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,559
Last time you said you needed it very much

501
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,000
Hot News

502
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,319
Contact the media

503
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,839
You are responsible

504
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,519
It's Mr. Lin

505
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,519
Do you have any idea about this

506
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,960
Now from the center to the local

507
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:11,920
All are emphasizing

508
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,359
Optimize the investment environment

509
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,880
Attract professional talents

510
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,799
This Liu Jun

511
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,279
Investment in building a factory

512
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,559
I

513
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,160
Another real doctor

514
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,039
He took all these two sides

515
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,680
Mr. Lin

516
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,519
Such a big hat is buttoned down

517
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,440
I'm afraid it's not easy to deal with

518
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,920
OK

519
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,039
You go and do it

520
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,920
I'll find a way myself

521
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,039
It's Mr. Lin

522
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,799
Let's go to the hospital

523
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:05,839
Thank you

524
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,839
Thanks

525
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,920
You go back and rest

526
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,200
I'll accompany him

527
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,279
Thanks

528
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Why are you here

529
00:34:17,518 --> 00:34:19,239
Aren't you accompanying Liu Jun in the hospital

530
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,719
Hiroaki

531
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
I'll go later

532
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,719
You give this to Hongming

533
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,199
So much money

534
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:44,639
What did you do for him

535
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,920
Yesterday Ajun had surgery

536
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,280
All are experts found by Hongming

537
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,559
He paid for the money

538
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,320
Just give him the money

539
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,960
That doesn't require that much money.

540
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,440
I don't know how much it costs either

541
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,639
I just took some of it

542
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:05,519
You don't know much, either

543
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,159
Are you okay

544
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,760
I'm fine

545
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,320
Compare with my son

546
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,920
No matter how much money is

547
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,920
Just give this to Hongming

548
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,199
You go and do it

549
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,239
I was in the ward just now

550
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,920
Meet Hongming

551
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,960
He doesn't want to pay attention to me

552
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,360
I don't want to say anything to me

553
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,599
yes

554
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,519
Because of my reasons

555
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,519
Let you be behind the scenes

556
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,800
Being pointed at by someone

557
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,199
He hates me

558
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,559
We all agreed

559
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,159
No more mention of these things

560
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,840
Sorry

561
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,239
Not to mention it

562
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,239
I'm here too

563
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,320
Don't explain it

564
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,599
You go

565
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,199
This is your work

566
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:45,480
Do you eat fried dough sticks?

567
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,480
steamed stuffed bun

568
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,360
Don't want to eat

569
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,440
The article must have been written by someone

570
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,760
I just made some points

571
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,440
In fact, the purpose is very simple

572
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,920
Just want to make things happen

573
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,719
Looks bigger

574
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,519
The Public Security Bureau may pay more attention to it

575
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,639
I don't understand

576
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,199
Such a clear and unconventional thing

577
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,559
Why can't you just

578
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,119
Rely on the law to solve it

579
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,320
You're narrow-minded

580
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Public opinion supervision

581
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,920
It is the responsibility of the media

582
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,400
We are within the framework of law

583
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,320
Add a little chance of winning to yourself

584
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,079
What's wrong with it

585
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,719
Before I come

586
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,000
Go to the police station

587
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,559
Officer Gu told me

588
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,400
Where something happened

589
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,960
There are several cameras

590
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,119
Catch the perpetrator

591
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,440
It's just a matter of time

592
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,719
What's the use of catching them

593
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,159
Can you find out the instructions behind it

594
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,119
That's the key

595
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,440
How to induce confessions

596
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,920
None of us can say that

597
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,239
But where does the matter end

598
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,960
Your attitude is important

599
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,480
So you want to pursue it to the end

600
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,519
Or just stop here

601
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,639
You hope I'll stop here

602
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,719
Keep people on the front line

603
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,280
It's better than burning both jade

604
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,360
After I woke up last night

605
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,280
I saw my dad so sad

606
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,599
I suddenly stopped being angry

607
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,599
Just afraid

608
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,920
They'll hurt me like they're

609
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Hurt my dad

610
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,880
So I advised him

611
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,000
People should be willing to bet and accept defeat

612
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,639
Can't compare to rotten apples

613
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,800
The fried pork liver turtle soup you ordered

614
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,280
Some food

615
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,400
I've done it all

616
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,119
Are you going to the hospital now

617
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,800
Ajun suffered such a great crime

618
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,320
Please take good care of him

619
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:45,719
good

620
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,519
I'll take good care of him

621
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,079
So busy at work

622
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Go back quickly

623
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,559
I've already asked for leave today

624
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,400
I'll leave when your dad comes to take over

625
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,239
Mr. Lin

626
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,719
Dr. Liu

627
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,920
how

628
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,679
Why did it be so called

629
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:33,079
Last night

630
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,880
Then Xiaochuan talks to me

631
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
I was scared at that time

632
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:38,639
I'm afraid

633
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,880
It's the brothers under my command

634
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,239
What a stupid thing

635
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,920
I'll check the results and you'll see

636
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,639
I'm really afraid of anything I'll come

637
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,639
I was so angry that I didn't sleep all night

638
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,320
I'll tell you the truth

639
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,519
I really don't know if they do this

640
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,639
But no matter what it says

641
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,840
They did this for me

642
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,000
Then I will take this responsibility

643
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:08,440
You can open the conditions

644
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,519
You just want to kill and cut

645
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,199
I'll let you deal with it

646
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,360
Since Mr. Lin wants to take responsibility

647
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:21,199
In the afternoon, the police came over to do the transcript

648
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,679
Just turned himself in person

649
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:27,239
The man who is the master

650
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,519
It should have arrived now

651
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,639
The Public Security Bureau surrendered

652
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,960
If sentenced on intentional injury

653
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,000
At least five or eight years

654
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,079
Don't worry about this

655
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,000
I heard

656
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,519
Which factory is your dad

657
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,400
Planning to transfer, right?

658
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,679
I've asked indirectly

659
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,280
There are so many buyers

660
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
at present

661
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,239
Amin's bid is the highest

662
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:07,320
I'm going to do this

663
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,159
I can come out

664
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,559
The same price as Amin

665
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,599
But

666
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:12,639
Also, two more discounts than him

667
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,519
You listen

668
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:14,079
one

669
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,800
Receive all your workers

670
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:17,800
two

671
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,800
Pay the cash in one go

672
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,960
Do you want to think about it?

673
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,800
Police investigation

674
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,280
I must cooperate actively

675
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:43,679
This thing

676
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,159
How much responsibility do I have

677
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,719
The law has the final say

678
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:48,599
But

679
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:50,679
You and I know in our hearts

680
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,119
Which factory is yours

681
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,519
Not transferred yet

682
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:55,400
It's nothing more than

683
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,079
Stuck in what I just said

684
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,320
Two key points

685
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,719
For you

686
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,000
Workers in the factory

687
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,440
To be placed

688
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:04,719
This is put first

689
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:06,119
You said it's right
