1
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,200
Qian Hongming, this kid

2
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
Have you been very busy lately

3
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,959
Why do you care about him

4
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:51,120
What do I care about him for

5
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:51,959
Ask casually

6
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:52,959
You two were so good before

7
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,079
Like a person

8
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:56,560
I haven't seen him pestering you for a long time

9
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,158
I thought you two had broken up

10
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,920
No one can break up with us

11
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,040
But when you say it is true

12
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,560
I'm about the same as him

13
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,560
Haven't seen each other for a month

14
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
He should be very busy

15
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
OK, then you can be busy

16
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,400
in addition

17
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,919
Leave any other things

18
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,639
Who am I in charge of other people's business

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,599
Didn't say you

20
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,240
Didn't say you

21
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,360
Be busy

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,079
baffling

23
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,280
Liu Jun

24
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,639
Are you free on weekends

25
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,439
I'm on a business trip in Shanghai

26
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,360
What's wrong

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,159
You're really busier than the Beijing Olympic Billion Commission

28
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,000
That's it

29
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,039
What about the weekend

30
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,439
Sister Liang, Me, Mr. Song and others

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
Go to Hope Primary School to study basketball court

32
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,520
Are you here

33
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,759
Then I can't go

34
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,439
But this

35
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,080
Take Carrie with you

36
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,439
Let her go out for some breath

37
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,280
She brings a camera

38
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,960
Can you take pictures or something

39
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,599
If you don't go, I'll take her

40
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,478
Then this is it

41
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,520
I'll tell Jiali tonight

42
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,599
Let her contact you

43
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,319
OK

44
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,520
Nothing else is going to happen

45
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,360
I'll hang up first

46
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,879
That's good to worship

47
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,280
Waiting urgently

48
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,240
I'm still laughing late

49
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:38,520
Traffic jam on the road

50
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,159
Hello, Manager Cui

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,360
Are you free on weekends

52
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,040
Good morning

53
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,759
Good morning

54
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,759
Have you had breakfast

55
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,720
have eaten

56
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,079
Then we're leaving

57
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,879
Let's go

58
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,199
Why did you turn right?

59
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,680
Didn't you go to Pengtang?

60
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,759
Should go straight

61
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,800
I have to go

62
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,519
Take a wife of my friend

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,240
Friend's wife

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,000
What about that friend

65
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,639
A friend is on a business trip

66
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,199
He told me

67
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,800
Be sure to bring his wife with you

68
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,439
No wonder I'm asking me to go with you

69
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,160
It turns out to avoid suspicion

70
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,560
No

71
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,160
I'm sincerely

72
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,040
Please come out and play

73
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,519
No, no explanation

74
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,399
Can a meal afterwards be accepted?

75
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,160
Take it and leave

76
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,920
If you can't accept it, turn around and go back

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,959
OK

78
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,959
I'll invite you to eat for a week to help you get enough

79
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,439
Bingbing, look

80
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,480
Very good shot

81
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,600
You are so awesome, are you a photographer

82
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,439
Not that I studied design

83
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,759
Photography is a hobby

84
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,240
No wonder

85
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,879
A good artistic temperament

86
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,839
Can take pictures and beauties

87
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,240
Will also match clothes

88
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,519
Very good looking

89
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,839
Do you drink water

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,839
Thanks

91
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,519
My knees

92
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Really good at talking

93
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,319
Koyanagi

94
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,120
You're choosing

95
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,720
When the surface material of the component

96
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,879
Have you forgotten to consider it

97
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,319
Our company's working environment is

98
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,480
Acid atmosphere

99
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,920
Will cause corrosion to the surface

100
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,199
You should be very clear about this

101
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,360
corrosion

102
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,360
Does it have a big impact on operation

103
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,759
Will it cause downtime?

104
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,360
I'll take someone to the scene tomorrow

105
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,279
No

106
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,399
I've let them

107
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,519
Preserved with surface corrosion

108
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,480
It should be delayed until the spring major repair

109
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,439
But Liu Jun

110
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,519
This shouldn't be the realm you're pursuing

111
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,120
Use environment for accessories

112
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,120
None of them considered

113
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,480
I want to criticize you

114
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,759
My other acidic corrosion

115
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,920
All considered

116
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,680
I have also studied the technology of the East China Sea.

117
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,159
I originally thought

118
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,040
You have installed a desulfurization device

119
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,120
sorry

120
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,199
I was negligent

121
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,360
No excuses

122
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,439
On the day of booting

123
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,639
I've smelled in the factory

124
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,920
Then you should realize

125
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,160
But what about your explanation

126
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,480
It's not unreasonable

127
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,439
Advanced equipment

128
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,360
In the situation of local conditions in the country

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
When I introduced the equipment

130
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,639
Have also encountered it

131
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,079
These experiences

132
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,680
I should tell you earlier

133
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,519
Are you teaching someone a lesson again

134
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,480
No work is allowed today

135
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,879
There is another problem with taking off

136
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,759
Let's talk about it when you finish your work

137
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,320
Donghai Group has a clear provision

138
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,120
Can't get it

139
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,639
Units for quality system certification

140
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,360
It is not allowed to enter the procurement process

141
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,799
The procurement department told me

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,320
Your company is still not available

143
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,120
ISO9000 certification certificate

144
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,039
This one

145
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,080
Mr. Song

146
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,039
this

147
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,519
ISO (International Organization for Standardization) System

148
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,559
It's not only going to cost

149
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,679
A large certification fee

150
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,240
Re-examination is required later

151
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,919
to be honest

152
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,600
I've been lined up and done it

153
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,559
But it's all for certification

154
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,639
Prepare a set of documents

155
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,519
Practical operation

156
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,720
It's not that way at all

157
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,000
Liu Jun

158
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,080
Your management factory

159
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,159
It's been over a year

160
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,840
How to start

161
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,080
Still so childish

162
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,559
Don't laugh at him

163
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,759
If you have any complaints, let him post

164
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,079
You keep saying, I'll listen

165
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,960
Small manufacturing companies like us

166
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,159
There are really too many

167
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,759
Social costs

168
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm reaching out to us

169
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,360
A layer of skin can be peeled off every few days

170
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,759
Nowadays, many units purchase bidding

171
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,240
Treat it as a hard bar

172
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:29,960
Everyone has no choice

173
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,240
All the rush is going on

174
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,360
This certification agency is causing traffic jams

175
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,480
Where is me

176
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,360
It's really weird

177
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,480
Would rather wait in line

178
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,240
Don't want to do public relations

179
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,879
It leads us to line up

180
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,279
There is no schedule

181
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,559
But I heard

182
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,840
Certification agencies in society

183
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,840
There are quite a lot

184
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,360
No matter how many there are, we can't do it

185
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,960
Take off overseas exports

186
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,559
All have to pass the customs inspection

187
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,480
And this commodity inspection export

188
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,399
It's this quality certification

189
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,320
Leading unit

190
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,320
We have to get his certificate

191
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,120
Mr. Song

192
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,720
I think this process has been completed

193
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,840
It is certified

194
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,799
Not the company's quality management system

195
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,919
I'm certified by my PR skills

196
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,320
to be honest

197
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
I'm particularly disgusted with such things

198
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,600
I don't want to compromise

199
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,480
Speaking of compromise

200
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,279
Then we may have a more common language

201
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,919
My current idea is

202
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,360
Adhere to the philosophy

203
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,840
Try to survive again

204
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,799
Only in this way can you

205
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,440
Within the scope of your ability

206
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,840
Influence more people

207
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,799
This cucumber is a bit old

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,720
Liu Jun

209
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,759
I'll give you one

210
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Let's have a simple example

211
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,559
In one piece

212
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,360
Among ordinary small companies

213
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,679
Why can you get it

214
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,279
Opportunities to enter Donghai Group

215
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,240
certainly

216
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,360
Because Sishen recommended you

217
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,840
It has happened before

218
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,200
Some things that have intersections

219
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,080
so

220
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,879
I remember Tengfei's name

221
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,519
Start paying attention to you and examining you

222
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,360
But you have to understand

223
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,679
This is not a regular channel

224
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,399
For those who don't understand factory operations

225
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,200
For those who don't understand quality management

226
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,440
They want to judge a business

227
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,679
Is it worth accessing

228
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,440
Only publicly certified

229
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,079
and standards

230
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:16,840
ISO (International Organization for Standardization) certification

231
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,080
That's what certification is

232
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,080
Even if you look down on this process

233
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,440
You must do it, too

234
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,519
At least it must be done now

235
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,840
Can't get the certificate

236
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,519
The next batch of accessories is not allowed to enter

237
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,279
This is what I ask you

238
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,240
No bargaining allowed

239
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,279
Do you understand

240
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,159
Understand Mr. Song

241
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,600
Don't worry

242
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,600
Authentication itself is not difficult

243
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,720
I actually know it in my heart

244
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,879
Let's go Liu Jun

245
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,559
Give a glory to the new stadium

246
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I'm talking about the serious matter

247
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,240
Go, I've finished talking about it

248
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,080
Go and play

249
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,360
OK

250
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,360
Walk

251
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,440
You said this Liu Jun

252
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,000
Would you be too willful

253
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,720
Sometimes a bookish person can make things worse

254
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,360
Only by being confident dare to be willful

255
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,519
He knows I appreciate him

256
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,720
Behave like a spoiled person

257
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,759
How old are you still acting cute

258
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,279
This guy is really amazing

259
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,320
The teams under his command are all capable

260
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,360
I'm still ready

261
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,759
Send him a batch of bigger tasks

262
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,120
Anything is yours

263
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,479
Let's go

264
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:33,759
Why go

265
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,759
Go play ball

266
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,240
How long has it been since you exercised

267
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,480
Walk

268
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,879
It's so hot

269
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Turn on the air conditioner

270
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,200
Mr. Song just now told you

271
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,679
yes

272
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,080
I've been slandering a lot

273
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,879
Maybe it's a fool

274
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,559
Sometimes I don't know how to give in

275
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,200
Not necessarily a good boss

276
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,799
But I can see

277
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,919
You have the same temperament as Mr. Song

278
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,159
A like-minded person

279
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,240
Yeah

280
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,600
I really hope one day

281
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,639
Be able to reach his level

282
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,600
Being not arrogant or impetuous as if you are light

283
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,919
You're the truth

284
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,159
Of course

285
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,200
I heard it in the afternoon

286
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,159
When you say this

287
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,279
I still think in my heart

288
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:10,879
I said this person

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,519
Why are you so thick-skinned

290
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,240
Nodding to the leader

291
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,600
Respectful

292
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,720
I like it, just like it

293
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,080
Don't like it, don't like it

294
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not from your banking industry

295
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,519
Not that thick-skinned

296
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,440
What do you mean

297
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,679
You mock our financial system

298
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,200
Yes or no

299
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,039
I don't have it

300
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
I'm listening

301
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,879
Are we too noisy

302
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,159
No

303
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,919
I think you two get along like this

304
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,720
Very good

305
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,440
Be able to share opinions

306
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,080
Collision thought

307
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,440
Can we communicate spiritually with each other

308
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,320
Is there any

309
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,399
Yeah

310
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,519
I'm following

311
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,919
You bought the book list you wrote for me

312
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,080
But time is limited

313
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,159
Not found all

314
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,320
Thank you

315
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,759
You'll be in Hong Kong for two days in total

316
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,879
I have to bother you

317
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,320
Help me run these reference books

318
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,399
It's not easy

319
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,840
I have to buy something myself, too

320
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,000
No trouble

321
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,480
Very good

322
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,039
I have a new idea

323
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,039
Want to communicate with you

324
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,159
Look at this

325
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,480
What's this

326
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,039
this

327
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,639
Copper futures

328
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,639
Donald Duck

329
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,320
Is this Donald Duck

330
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,679
this

331
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,559
This doesn't seem to be Donald Duck

332
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,360
Come on

333
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,000
sister

334
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,120
My aunt brought us a cool towel

335
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,320
Still burning or not

336
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,879
Thank you for your hard work

337
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,080
Come on baby

338
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:32,759
Very cold

339
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,759
You bring the thermometer

340
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,679
Show me

341
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,600
I'll do it

342
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,919
Still burned

343
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,120
No, you'll be fine

344
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,440
Take another antipyretic medicine

345
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,480
Please trouble you sister

346
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,679
What's the trouble with this

347
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,600
I've scolded Hongming

348
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,639
You and Taozi often get sick together

349
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,240
He has to balance it

350
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,519
Can't always travel

351
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,879
He also works for his job

352
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,399
Hongming doesn't want this

353
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,000
Does he have a job alone?

354
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,598
People who are busier than him in the world

355
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,279
More

356
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,039
Are everyone careless about their homes?

357
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,118
You're just too tolerant of him

358
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,240
He dares to do this

359
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,799
So lazy

360
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,200
Bring everything to you

361
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,640
Come

362
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,519
Don't say that to his sister

363
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,880
Yesterday, Hongming discussed with me

364
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:28,079
Want to buy another house in the community

365
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,720
Just do it under my parents' name

366
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,079
Let them live here too

367
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,400
After this

368
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,839
If he goes on a business trip again

369
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,319
Someone can take care of us

370
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:38,920
Coughed

371
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,640
alright

372
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,599
Ice again

373
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,400
Thank you aunt

374
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,440
The fever subsides immediately

375
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,400
You just now

376
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
A lot of talks were said

377
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,599
What option contract

378
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,559
Delivery or closed positions

379
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,599
You've changed career now

380
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,799
No import and export

381
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,000
Change to futures trading

382
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,839
I've made it called hedging

383
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,279
The direction is right

384
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,519
Profits can be cashed in the futures market

385
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,400
The wrong direction

386
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,480
You can also pay for losses by taking spot stock

387
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,279
Moreover, in recent years, copper materials demand has been strong

388
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,559
Not very risky

389
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,480
I'll continue to do the letter of credit

390
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,200
Financing Shanghai Copper

391
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,000
This amount of funds can be made up

392
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,680
all in all

393
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,000
This is only

394
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,359
Games for high IQ people

395
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,920
The more complex the rules

396
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,240
More and more industries

397
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,559
The more profitable it is

398
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,200
A smart person like you

399
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,920
You should come in immediately

400
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,200
Make money with me

401
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,039
Invest in futures with you

402
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
How can I have this time and energy

403
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,319
Just take off now

404
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,960
That's enough for me to be busy

405
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,440
You can be busy with the company

406
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,319
Take advantage of rest time

407
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,920
Take time to keep an eye on Shanghai copper

408
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,440
Actually, I think you're OK alone

409
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,680
On this operational level

410
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,839
You're OK with being alone

411
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,599
You can also get the funds on hand

412
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,359
Mortgage

413
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,319
This money is enough

414
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
You opened an account in Shanghai Copper

415
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,759
How can this be done

416
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,039
It's better to invest in new stocks than this amount

417
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:16,359
Liu Jun

418
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,599
I'm a novice too

419
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,119
I need someone to trust

420
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,160
Fight side by side with me

421
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,839
Let's go together

422
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,839
How to enlarge this

423
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,599
Enter

424
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,319
Is he very busy

425
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,599
He didn't let me in the door

426
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,400
Say there is something to see someone

427
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,640
Audible sound

428
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,640
He's in the office himself

429
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,319
It seems to be on the phone

430
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,440
I'll send it to him personally

431
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,799
Forget it, let's talk about it in the afternoon

432
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,519
How can I wait for the afternoon

433
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:29,039
Have you seen the latest fluctuation

434
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,200
Our judgment was correct yesterday

435
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,599
Follow-up is timely

436
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,319
From this trend

437
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,160
There is a good chance today

438
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,960
I found that we two every time

439
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,079
When the opinions are consistent

440
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,519
The accuracy rate is very high

441
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,359
Brothers work together to cut off gold

442
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,160
Who will come back later

443
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,920
I'm old Zhu

444
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,799
Do you have time now

445
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,160
I'm not talking about it anymore. Someone here is here

446
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,319
Don't say it

447
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,640
Please enter

448
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,799
Old Zhu

449
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,440
What's up

450
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,880
Mr. Liu

451
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,319
Five more days

452
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,279
High-tech development

453
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,160
The certification review meeting

454
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,359
But now the outside world is preparing

455
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,799
Many things have not been finalized

456
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,279
This will definitely not work

457
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,799
What peripheral preparations

458
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,559
We haven't invited it

459
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,799
Mr. Song is such an authority

460
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,559
Other reviewers

461
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,839
Have you agreed to come

462
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,680
Mr. Liu

463
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,720
Those reviews

464
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,279
Just a verbal agreement

465
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,160
The company wants to send a formal invitation letter

466
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,200
Among them, those high-level experts

467
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,119
You have to have to

468
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,319
Just come to your door in person

469
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,680
And not sure

470
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,079
The last attendee

471
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,319
Then the subsequent pick-up and delivery

472
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,519
Labor gifts

473
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,559
No way to arrange

474
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,880
There is also the specific content of the meeting

475
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,680
and agenda

476
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,400
Need to notify the review in advance

477
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,480
Must come to the door in person

478
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,000
I'll go in the afternoon

479
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,799
Other bits and pieces

480
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,519
Lao Zhu, let's arrange it

481
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,279
I can arrange it

482
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,279
But you have to sign

483
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,279
no problem

484
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,720
Write me a plan

485
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,200
I'll sign it right after review

486
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,720
Mr. Liu's plan was sent to you yesterday

487
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,640
Look at me

488
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,480
This morning was busy

489
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,960
Haven't had time to open the email

490
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,039
You don't have to look at that

491
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,119
I asked Xiao Zhang to call one more

492
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,079
You can see that

493
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,200
I'll call you after watching it

494
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,960
OK

495
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,759
I'm back

496
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,640
There is no change in the market right now

497
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,440
The main players are absorbing funds

498
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,279
In the process of absorbing funds

499
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,039
All the rise and fall are small

500
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:01,880
This wave of opportunities

501
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,480
Don't buy at a cheap price

502
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,079
It will be very difficult in the future

503
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,160
I'm ready to enter anytime

504
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
If you believe me

505
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,559
Just increase your position with all your strength

506
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,759
Does it hurt

507
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,160
When will the Internet be online on your phone

508
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,559
It can be as fast as a computer

509
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,240
That way I don't have to hold it

510
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,440
Such a big thing

511
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,400
Not only fell asleep

512
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,200
Everyone started talking in a sleep

513
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,359
I'll do it

514
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,960
Just the profit of this order

515
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,079
Put us to fly

516
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,960
Signing from design

517
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,039
Production acceptance and delivery

518
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,240
Then to payback

519
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,319
Hundreds of people need to be busy for at least half a month

520
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,759
Only then can you get the same income

521
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,480
Different types of industries

522
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,960
What's so good about

523
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,839
And now the international situation

524
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,759
So unstable

525
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,759
The resource market will definitely rise sharply

526
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,839
Branch working capital

527
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
I've pulled it out

528
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,440
Wait for the time to come

529
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,000
Just take it all in

530
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,279
You're too radical

531
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,960
If there is any fluctuation

532
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,880
You don't even have money to replenish your position

533
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,359
You're too cautious

534
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,480
Now, there is no chance to take

535
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,880
When do you plan to take action

536
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,480
Then you can't have a chance

537
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,759
Just lose everything

538
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,319
You're betting too hard

539
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,759
Aren't you two talking about futures

540
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,599
So excited

541
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,200
Like two red eyes gamblers

542
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,119
I'm wrong I'm wrong

543
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,400
We're not gambling

544
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,119
Gambling depends on luck

545
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,799
We rely on wisdom

546
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,039
Still have courage

547
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,440
You have the courage

548
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,559
But I have to admit

549
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,359
Your judgment

550
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,720
It's correct in theory

551
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,799
Otherwise,

552
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,039
Let's take a look first

553
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,559
The trend of the international market

554
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,319
Then find the time to enter

555
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,200
Wouldn't you have a review meeting tomorrow

556
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,319
Go home and rest quickly, I'll stare

557
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,160
I don't have to stare here

558
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,720
Just such a large number of ups and downs

559
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,519
Even if I want to go to bed early, I can't sleep.

560
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,440
Carrie, don't peel that apple

561
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,319
Not useful

562
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,839
I want to eat a giant

563
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,319
Eat Big Mac

564
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,000
The hotels are closed

565
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,519
What giants are you eating

566
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,119
You put a bowl of noodles for him

567
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,759
Good below

568
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,359
Eat below

569
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,960
You don't eat this apple

570
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,759
Don't eat it anymore

571
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,759
I'll eat it and don't waste it

572
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,559
Is there any ham sausage?

573
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,759
I want two ham and one egg

574
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,119
have

575
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,119
You two have made contributions

576
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,559
Eat you two into fat

577
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,640
Thank you Carrie

578
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,839
Professor Zhang

579
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,400
Please

580
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,599
good

581
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,200
Mr. Liu

582
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,519
Hello Hello Hello

583
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,200
haven't seen you for a long time

584
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,799
Long time no see please come in

585
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:52,759
How many people have arrived

586
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,880
Twelve are here

587
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:55,920
Director Yu

588
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,599
Mr. Liu, we meet again

589
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,680
Meet again and again

590
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,680
Please come in Please come in Please come in

591
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,440
good

592
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:06,799
Is the coffee ready

593
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,519
alright

594
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,160
Mr. Liu

595
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,279
Your red bloodshot and dark circles

596
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,920
Didn't you sleep well last night

597
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,240
Didn't sleep well, right

598
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,440
nervous

599
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,160
Mr. Liu and Mr. Song are here

600
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,759
General Song

601
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,240
Mr. Song is here

602
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,640
Thanks Thanks

603
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,720
Organize such a meeting

604
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,720
Is it better to do research and development

605
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,720
What else is going to worry about

606
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,160
Yes Yes Yes

607
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,599
When I was young, I was the same as you.

608
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,480
During the development, it did not sleep for three days and three nights

609
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,119
Not as tired as a conference

610
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,440
Administrative affairs are really costly

611
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,519
Come on, please come on, Mr. Song

612
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,039
good

613
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,119
Please contact Mr. Song here

614
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,680
Mr. Song, please first

615
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,240
please

616
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,000
Mr. Song

617
00:28:58,759 --> 00:28:59,920
Thank you for your comment

618
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,839
I didn't know before

619
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,519
Review meetings like this

620
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:04,480
Everyone's actions

621
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,920
Follow the highest level

622
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,480
Your opening

623
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,119
The tone of the entire meeting

624
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,640
Basically determined

625
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,680
I'm really grateful

626
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,480
I'm just seeking truth from facts

627
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,000
Take practical actions

628
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Just protect outstanding enterprises

629
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,359
Your flying R&D system

630
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,440
It's really advanced

631
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,680
High capital investment

632
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,000
Great scientific and technological achievements

633
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,559
Everything is true

634
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:31,880
Thank you for your approval

635
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,119
But I want to remind you

636
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,240
Can't achieve any results

637
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,519
Just be complacent

638
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,319
The road ahead is long

639
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,119
You have to endure loneliness

640
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,759
Persist in persistence and then persistence

641
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:48,880
thank you

642
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,440
No need to give it

643
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,319
You're back

644
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,359
How is the meeting

645
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,400
Is the result okay

646
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,200
Nothing unexpected

647
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:17,160
Very smooth

648
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,799
Have you already placed an order

649
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,799
Hang up

650
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
I don't want to miss such a good opportunity

651
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,680
There is no remaining funds in the account

652
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,759
If you need to restock your position next

653
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,759
I'm afraid you have to find a way out

654
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,359
Take-off liquidity

655
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,559
Can also extract some

656
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,680
I've finished the review meeting now

657
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,480
Can also add more energy

658
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,200
The next three months are critical

659
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,839
Let's do it well

660
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:47,680
OK

661
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:00,960
Liu Jun

662
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:02,519
Serve the dishes

663
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,559
Is it salty to taste

664
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,920
It's rising

665
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,480
What's going up

666
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:22,880
I'll ask you if it's salty

667
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:29,720
It's salty

668
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,039
It's salty

669
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,160
But acceptable

670
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,960
What to look at

671
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,599
You're still trading futures

672
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,240
I'm working with my friends

673
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,039
Opened an account

674
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,440
It's been operating for several months

675
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,359
Revenue is pretty good

676
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,279
Although I haven't done this myself

677
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,319
But I've read a lot

678
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,440
Anyway, I advise you to be more careful

679
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,440
I understand

680
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,920
High returns are accompanied by high risks

681
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,039
I'm not referring to risk, mentality

682
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,759
In the futures market

683
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
With the amplification of capital leverage

684
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,759
People's greed and emotions

685
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,279
It will also enlarge exponentially

686
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,720
But you manage the factory

687
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,160
What is needed is to follow the steps

688
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,279
Handle some stably

689
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,519
Trivial things

690
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,319
The mentality of doing these two things

691
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,759
But it's completely different

692
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,799
But I think

693
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,079
I can do two things

694
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,960
Stay equally stable

695
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,319
Same good mentality

696
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,000
There must be such people.

697
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,039
But I haven't seen it yet

698
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,279
Hot

699
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,519
When I was a kid, I

700
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,759
Take out something to play with

701
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,720
Can you still eat

702
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,359
How to do it in Hubei

703
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,839
Said it's very popular in Beijing

704
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,680
What other crayfish festival has it started

705
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,480
This is the meat

706
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,640
Strange

707
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,400
Liao Gong

708
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,200
Liao Gong

709
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,440
Why are you

710
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,720
Let our workshop stop work

711
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,759
Our workshop this month

712
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,680
Not enough working hours

713
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:27,680
You don't know

714
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:28,960
According to factory regulations

715
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,559
Once the product process error occurs

716
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,000
Work must be stopped immediately

717
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,160
What regulations

718
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,799
Can we set the product process?

719
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,079
Can this be decided in the workshop?

720
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
How did you draw the drawings

721
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,279
How do we produce it?

722
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,039
Mr. Liu signed on the drawing

723
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,039
You're talking about it now

724
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:41,839
This is not right That is not right

725
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,119
The product process is wrong

726
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,599
Who will we listen to in the future

727
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,240
I can't see this

728
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,559
How could it be impossible to show him

729
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,079
Not this, this is for the warehouse

730
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,359
Page 2

731
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,920
Such an obvious mistake

732
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,440
How could Mr. Liu issue it?

733
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,119
When I reviewed the documents today

734
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:09,760
Only found out

735
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,719
Shipping costs this month

736
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,920
It's too high

737
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,119
Why did it suddenly

738
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,360
How much price increases

739
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Mr. Liu didn't rise suddenly

740
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,039
Freight rates in the past few months

741
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,320
Always running slightly

742
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,480
Maybe you didn't care much before

743
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,119
Then you go and tell the transportation company

744
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,239
Domestic oil prices

745
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,840
There has been no significant change recently

746
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,119
The company cannot agree

747
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,199
Transportation costs have increased

748
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,840
Must be lowered

749
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,440
this

750
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,079
I've also talked to Boss Fang

751
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,639
His attitude is very firm

752
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,840
Or just follow this price

753
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,079
Or you will stop doing it after you terminate the contract

754
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,440
Such a large transportation market

755
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,639
I'm afraid he won't do it

756
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,599
Terminate the contract

757
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,679
You go and change my house

758
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,559
Not Mr. Liu

759
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,320
Enter

760
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,400
Mr. Liu

761
00:34:52,518 --> 00:34:53,719
We have something to tell you

762
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,039
What's wrong

763
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:57,320
Say it alone

764
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,039
Change one

765
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:02,639
good

766
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,360
This product

767
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,039
I've always been responsible for the research and development

768
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,800
Until the process is finalized

769
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,840
I just took sick leave

770
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,559
I thought you were going to check it out

771
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,480
There will be no problem

772
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,039
Here Here

773
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,880
Take a shortcut to force processing

774
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,480
What should I do if the stress generated

775
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,159
Are the parts cracking while waiting for delivery?

776
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:33,760
You're the same

777
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,360
Senior engineer who has been in the industry for ten years

778
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,000
Such a low-level error

779
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,559
The only explanation is

780
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,159
Not serious

781
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,159
Mr. Liu

782
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,880
Your condition is indeed abnormal lately

783
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,119
R&D center meeting

784
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,119
To discuss new directions

785
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,760
I've submitted a report twice

786
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,519
You haven't responded yet

787
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:50,280
I don't know you've watched it

788
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,119
Still haven't watched it

789
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,280
Sorry

790
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,559
I've been helping friends recently

791
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,519
Made a project

792
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,519
It really distracts a lot of energy

793
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,760
Made many mistakes that shouldn't be made

794
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:08,840
Mr. Liu

795
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,440
Don't blame me for saying anything

796
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,639
Let's take off

797
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,320
Can conquer the current situation

798
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,239
That's the leader

799
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,440
You're the boss

800
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,400
All are so silly

801
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,119
Then what should we do if we work

802
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,639
Everyone is here

803
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,840
I want to do something

804
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,079
Not to waste time

805
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,599
Come and have some free meals every day

806
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:41,039
You come and find me

807
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,599
Just to tell me to quit

808
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,599
I think

809
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,480
It's better to say it in person

810
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,360
But I still don't understand

811
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,239
We've been doing this for the past few months

812
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,960
Aren't the cooperation good?

813
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,119
Profits on the books

814
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,360
You can check it out for yourself

815
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,960
All right

816
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,760
Take off for you

817
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,880
More important than money

818
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,199
I can understand this

819
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,559
But you don't have to

820
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,679
Quit completely

821
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,639
Daily operations in the future

822
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,920
It's all up to me

823
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:18,559
you can

824
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,760
Only participate at critical moments

825
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,880
I promise you

826
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:21,679
Hiroaki

827
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,159
Now that I have decided to quit

828
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,639
Why bother to carry the mud

829
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:28,840
You know, too

830
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:30,960
I've always been

831
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,479
Adam Smith's consent

832
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,280
Research and manufacturing are my faith

833
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,639
But these few months

834
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,079
I seem to have become a different person

835
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,039
Make a lot of precious time

836
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,000
Contributed to the so-called financial industry

837
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,559
What's wrong with the financial industry

838
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,039
Nothing

839
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,119
This choice is not true or not

840
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,760
It just doesn't work for me

841
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,519
Hiroaki

842
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,800
We're all pursuing

843
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,360
The life you want

844
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,760
Isn't it

845
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,440
All right

846
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:33,960
Hello

847
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,159
Ah Jun

848
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,400
It's what you said

849
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,880
Do you want to terminate the contract with the transportation company?

850
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,199
It's what I said

851
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,360
What's wrong

852
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,800
Come back for me

853
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,320
Our inland water terminal is limited

854
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,840
After the reform

855
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,360
All were Boss Fang

856
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,840
Their fellow villagers have conquered it

857
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,119
They join in groups to bargain and receive goods

858
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,440
You terminate the contract with someone

859
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,079
Did you terminate the contract with everyone?

860
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,480
Then how can we transport it

861
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,599
How to ship

862
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,800
You don't want it

863
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,960
But they join forces to monopolize this

864
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,159
That's wrong at first

865
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,480
No one knows that something is wrong

866
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,239
I know too

867
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,639
This is wrong and won't last long

868
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Then what to do now

869
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:12,960
You can make it

870
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:14,159
With a group of people running the dock

871
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,440
Will you fight to the death?

872
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,840
Old factory manager, please dispel your breath

873
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,039
Don't be anxious, don't be anxious

874
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,880
Mr. Liu didn't mean it either

875
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,760
The current situation of the transportation market

876
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,920
Even I don't know

877
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,280
That's not to mention him

878
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,960
Eliminate qi

879
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,400
Tengfei's shipment has been stopped

880
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,159
I can only ask

881
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,360
My old friends

882
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,480
See if they have any relationship

883
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:40,480
Can say and say and

884
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,599
Then why don't I go and ask about something

885
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,840
Lu family has a wide connection

886
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,159
Maybe he has a way

887
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,239
Actually, we're quite similar

888
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,280
Where is it like

889
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,719
My dad put me in the city for training

890
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:13,840
sometimes

891
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,280
I think I'm pretty awesome, too

892
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,800
Advanced concepts and understand everything

893
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,920
But it's from time to time

894
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,199
Will stomp on such a thunder

895
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,599
All step on the old guys

896
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,639
Unexpected place

897
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,480
Did your dad say that to you too

898
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,360
Here comes

899
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,440
Since it's to be harmonious

900
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,280
Your foreign styles are useless

901
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
Today we have to do some tricks

902
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:44,280
good

903
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,480
Uncle Fang Uncle Fang

904
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,280
Uncle Fang

905
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,000
Uncle Fang

906
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,440
Long time no see Long time no see

907
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,119
Liu Jun

908
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,760
I'm Liu Jun when I first met

909
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,639
Hello Uncle Fang

910
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,599
Hello Hello Hello

911
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Please, please, please, please, please,

912
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,400
I'm not sensible

913
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,039
Offended Mr. Lu's friend

914
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,119
No, no

915
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,840
Today, to express sincerity

916
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,960
I'll make a plea first

917
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,039
Uncle Fang, you

918
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,760
Our business has old rules

919
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,159
Reunite the mirror

920
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,719
I have to drink three glasses of wine

921
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:31,719
Drink

922
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,119
From now on

923
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,840
Everyone can still be friends when they meet

924
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,320
have no idea

925
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,800
Will Boss Liu give this face?

926
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,199
Uncle Fang

927
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,760
What about Mr. Liu

928
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,039
A glass of liquor is poured

929
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,360
I'll toast you for this wine for him

930
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:47,320
No no no no

931
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:48,679
I'm not good at drinking

932
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,199
But I have to drink this cup myself

933
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,440
Uncle

934
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,639
It's too heavy to say it offends

935
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,360
I'll toast you this cup

936
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,320
After three cups, everyone will still be friends

937
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,199
etc.

938
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,760
You can't use this cup

939
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,159
Is it OK

940
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,760
It has to be OK if not

941
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,760
Uncle Fang is really a huge number

942
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,960
Uncle Fang

943
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,559
I respect you

944
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:41,559
Can you drink it if you have nothing to do

945
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:45,440
Come on come on

946
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,079
Drink

947
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,480
No problem drinking big gulp

948
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,760
Tell you not to drink this

949
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,000
Must succeed

950
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:59,599
Let's go home quickly

951
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,639
Come here come here

952
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,400
Kombat 120

953
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:06,960
good
