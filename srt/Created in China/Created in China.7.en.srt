1
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,559
You asked us to implement

2
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,680
Don't dare to have any objections

3
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,559
Pager Mobile Business Pass

4
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,600
No one can be missing

5
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,480
Like it

6
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,520
Giving such expensive stuff

7
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,080
Not suitable

8
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,840
This is my intention

9
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:17,960
Just take it

10
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,680
If it weren't for your wide connections

11
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,719
Take this urgent order

12
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Put it in the city and go

13
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,120
Then my job

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,759
This will definitely not be guaranteed

15
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,279
Nothing to say

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,759
Nothing below

17
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,079
Telephone

18
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,360
Hello Qian Hongming

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,959
OK OK OK

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,319
I know, I know, I know

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,719
My wife is about to give birth

22
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,520
Congratulations, manager

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,960
Help me ask for a leave from the boss

24
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,920
No problem no problem

25
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,719
Thank you

26
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,439
polite

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,200
Congratulations, manager

28
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,920
Please slow down slower slower

29
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:47,319
Thanks Thanks

30
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,159
What are you looking at

31
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,879
Do you care?

32
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,520
What's hidden in your pocket

33
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,400
I'm talking to you

34
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm talking to you

35
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,599
What's hidden in your pocket

36
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:38,999
What

37
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,079
Have you taken the drawings

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,439
What am I doing with the drawings

39
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:42,559
Then take it out and take it out

40
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,599
You let go

41
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,319
I'll tell you the surname Liu

42
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:45,960
Because of you

43
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,120
My monthly bonus is gone

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,360
Don't be more timid

45
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,039
You steal the drawings, you still have some clues

46
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,719
Take it out

47
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,400
You let go

48
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:52,360
You let go

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,640
release

50
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,159
You let go of me

51
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,879
release

52
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,879
Take it out

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,800
Stop hitting

54
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,240
Stop hitting

55
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,680
What to do if you run so fast

56
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,680
He was just a while

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
Can't kill anyone

58
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,279
Hurry up and something really happens in a while

59
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,599
I'll let you hide it.

60
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,239
I'll talk to you well

61
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,200
You don't understand, right

62
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,400
Must fight, right

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,200
Then call

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Because what

65
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:37,560
He stole my drawings

66
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,679
I don't

67
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,719
I didn't steal

68
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,359
Here

69
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:41,400
Which pocket

70
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,520
You're still quibbling

71
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,880
Make another quibble

72
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:50,799
Liu Gong

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,880
Yours

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,640
Your drawings

75
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:02,560
for you

76
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,599
Little Taozi

77
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,679
I'm a dad

78
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,279
This is my aunt

79
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,880
Auntie loves you

80
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,479
You're almost done

81
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,080
Grandma hasn't taken it yet

82
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,200
Grandma is here

83
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,359
Grandma loves you the most

84
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:58,760
Grandma loves you too

85
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,119
This is a mother

86
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,320
Mom has worked hardest

87
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,479
Say hello

88
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,440
OK, don't take pictures of the unkempt face

89
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,760
How bright did you hear her voice

90
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,279
Full of energy

91
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,760
Like me like me

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,119
My voice is loud

93
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,960
That's good nutrition

94
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,200
It's seven pounds and four ounces when born

95
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,599
Carrie was only more than six pounds back then

96
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,279
sister

97
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,679
Look at the baby's eyes

98
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,880
Does it look like Hongming

99
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,359
Hiroaki

100
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,679
Where is the baby looking good

101
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,440
Does it look like a dad or not

102
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,080
Look at the stitching of the eyeliner is so long

103
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,719
It will definitely be a big eye in the future

104
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,080
Why don't you answer the phone

105
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,080
Very busy

106
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,320
Hello Uncle San

107
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,279
Wa Hiroaki

108
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,760
My wife gave birth to

109
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,560
You're answering the phone

110
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:12,760
Guess what I'm doing

111
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,960
That's good news

112
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,880
Only give you a chance to guess once

113
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:16,960
Show off

114
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,080
Hello

115
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,080
Liu Jun

116
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,560
I can hear

117
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,039
Where are you

118
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,560
Is it at home or at home

119
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,640
I'm on the seawall

120
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,119
Why did you go to the seawall?

121
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,560
What happened to you?

122
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,239
I had a fight with the workers in the workshop

123
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,039
Fighted

124
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,320
You're not injured

125
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,320
How old is

126
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,000
They're fighting for this

127
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,520
Can you manage it well?

128
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,799
If not, I'll change someone

129
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,119
I have hundreds of people under my command

130
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,640
I'll just run

131
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:02,719
Solve these things for you

132
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,599
I must take care of them

133
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,960
Go and do it quickly

134
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,919
Go for a trip

135
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,520
Senior Engineer

136
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,000
Fighting with workers in public

137
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:18,239
This self-control ability

138
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,039
Too bad

139
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,400
It was clearly that Xiao Zheng who violated the rules first

140
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,799
Not obeying management

141
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,200
Should I be fined

142
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,640
Let others take it as a warning

143
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,279
Let them settle privately

144
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,200
Liu Jun won't pursue it

145
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,279
I just don't know

146
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,320
How can that work

147
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,440
Liu Jun won't pursue it

148
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,719
That's because he is generous

149
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,159
The production area brings this kind of thing

150
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:38,280
If not dealt with seriously

151
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,759
Who cares about rules and regulations in the future

152
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,519
When did you

153
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,119
Begin to care about management

154
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,519
I know your thoughts

155
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:53,599
But I'm going to say something here

156
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,160
This person will be in the future

157
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,040
There won't be any big prospect

158
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,999
At most, it's technology

159
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,759
Don't understand what you said

160
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:15,960
How about it

161
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,320
I'll take a look

162
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,560
I wanna go

163
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,040
Where to go

164
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,719
Get out of here

165
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,719
Back to Germany

166
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:43,440
Tired

167
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,920
Take a break when you are tired

168
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,800
Go back and have a sleep

169
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,639
You are in this state

170
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,239
Not suitable for thinking of this kind

171
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:02,879
Half a year after returning to China

172
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,320
I'm getting less and less like myself

173
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,920
I originally thought

174
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,160
This world is very beautiful

175
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,519
Goodwill everywhere

176
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,840
But now

177
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,280
I think anyone wants to harm me

178
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,399
Can't say a few words to Lin Chuan

179
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,399
It started to quarrel

180
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,599
Workers read idle books

181
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,239
But I thought

182
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,719
He stole my drawings

183
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,119
Indiscriminately

184
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,239
Unjustly accused others of beating them

185
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:38,519
What do you think I look like

186
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,239
Scoundrel

187
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,560
The bully

188
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,160
Still a rogue

189
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,960
But I became like this

190
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,040
Who else should I blame

191
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,639
Do you blame me

192
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,759
I don't want to leave the senior engineer

193
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,960
Come back and take care of this broken factory

194
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,280
I was paying a little higher

195
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,960
Give up computer major

196
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,160
I found this job in foreign trade

197
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,280
Learn from scratch

198
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,200
When I first started working

199
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,080
To keep customers drinking until they vomit

200
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,599
I've cried while holding the tree

201
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,560
Where to be a human

202
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,239
Not that much happiness

203
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:54,840
this is life

204
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,759
Do you like this kind of life?

205
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,080
Do I have any choice

206
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,160
But I really don't like it

207
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,440
This kind of environment

208
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,239
In the factory

209
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,759
Either use violence to submit

210
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,599
Or you have to learn

211
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,160
Those so-called tricks

212
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,759
They seem to

213
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,519
Get used to the rough management before

214
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,320
Instead, I can't accept it

215
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,599
I'll reason with them

216
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,920
Have you ever thought about it

217
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,440
Those grassroots workers

218
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,280
The injustice they encounter

219
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,800
Which one will be less than you

220
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,719
Many people feel frustrated

221
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,239
Can't even say it

222
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,239
Over time, it becomes numb

223
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,280
You have talent

224
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,479
There are conditions

225
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,920
But you have to try

226
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,599
To understand all living beings

227
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,160
There are many people in this world

228
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,560
Especially those workers

229
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,239
They don't have resources like you

230
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,879
Haven't opened your eyes like this

231
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,399
I've never received an education like you

232
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,680
Then why do you ask others for it

233
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,920
Suddenly understand your ambitions

234
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,359
Have the same thing as you

235
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,719
What about logical judgment

236
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,759
In China

237
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,080
Something

238
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:29,719
You have to take it slowly

239
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,479
Sister-in-law

240
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,399
You can definitely see that

241
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,239
My elder brother has changed a lot in recent years

242
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,519
Now it's only you

243
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,960
He can only listen

244
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:06,879
I understand what you mean

245
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,359
But you know too

246
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,479
The domestic manufacturing industry is not good

247
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,440
So many people are imitating

248
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,999
You let him stop first

249
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,399
He definitely won't do it

250
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,119
I know

251
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:19,040
You are raising your baby abroad

252
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,119
These things were originally

253
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,239
It shouldn't be bothered by you

254
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,639
But I still hope

255
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,840
Can you persuade him

256
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,119
Can you listen

257
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,560
Just look at him

258
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:32,239
OK, then I'll try it

259
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,599
Thank you sister-in-law

260
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,040
You should take a rest

261
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,399
Don't hang it now

262
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,280
I'm just about to ask you

263
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,719
You and that Liu Jun

264
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:42,920
how's it going

265
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
People don't like me at all

266
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,560
Call you today

267
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,920
That's my elder brother's business

268
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,080
It has nothing to do with him

269
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,639
I'll just ask casually

270
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,960
OK, that's dead

271
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,999
Hang up

272
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,160
Dr. Liu

273
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm looking for you

274
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,440
Mr. Lin

275
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,119
You

276
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,879
fine

277
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,080
What about this thing

278
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,200
I've learned it

279
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,080
If you have any ideas, just say

280
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,080
I'll definitely deal with it seriously

281
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,999
I have no idea

282
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,999
No need to deal with it

283
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,200
No need to deal with it

284
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,960
Don't worry

285
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,759
Will not delay production

286
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,680
OK then

287
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,879
Do it well

288
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,239
Harmony makes money, right

289
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:13,960
good

290
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,759
Come on come on

291
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,960
Is there any place to sit?

292
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,479
Sit

293
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,320
These first three batches

294
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,199
It's a domestic order

295
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,240
Two orders for export

296
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,080
Now this is the domestic investment

297
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,240
310,000 yuan in payment

298
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,800
Wait for the money to arrive

299
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:33,639
We can see

300
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,919
The final settlement data is

301
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:36,959
Aunt He

302
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,040
that

303
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,840
Are the R&D special items listed?

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,800
All listed

305
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:41,840
You see

306
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,760
Like this material fee

307
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,040
City One Machine Testing Center

308
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,199
What's the rental fee

309
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,240
All are classified as R&D

310
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,159
good

311
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,560
How about some project data

312
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:53,480
It doesn't look right

313
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,320
No

314
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:56,599
What items did you say

315
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:58,919
I don't quite understand these items

316
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,879
Arrived

317
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:00,879
dad

318
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,000
Just confirmed with the bank

319
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,199
The final payment of 310,000 has been reached

320
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,359
What I said

321
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:06,840
OK OK OK

322
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,000
This company has good performance

323
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,080
It may be a few days later

324
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,240
But I will never miss the account

325
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,280
OK

326
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,560
Dad, you're here just right

327
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,599
We are reviewing the documents

328
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,199
Look

329
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,199
You sit you sit

330
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,760
No no no no

331
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,000
Just this transportation fee

332
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,119
Unknown use

333
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,399
And this one

334
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,280
Why is the transportation fee so high

335
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,359
This temporary labor fee

336
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,280
What's the fee

337
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:29,679
I can't understand it no matter how

338
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,520
Boss

339
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,720
There is something wrong with my sales.

340
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,280
OK OK OK

341
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,119
I'll go there first

342
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,879
You go and do your business

343
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,080
Dad, sit down

344
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,560
It's okay, it's okay

345
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,040
What is this?

346
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,679
Are you stupid

347
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:46,800
What's wrong

348
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,560
What money did dad spend in Shanghai

349
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,080
Is there a saying

350
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,159
I can't pay for it myself

351
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,599
You can't pay it yourself

352
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,840
But isn't this operation

353
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,279
There will be problems

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,240
Money spent on business

355
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:04,080
All invoices

356
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,320
What's the problem

357
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,240
OK OK OK

358
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:08,878
You'll get 310,000 in

359
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,480
Check out the final settlement amount

360
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,399
Sorry dad

361
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,560
Still losing money

362
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,119
This is good

363
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,760
Look

364
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,439
This is the third batch

365
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,879
It's barely equal

366
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,520
What are you worried about

367
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:32,879
I'll tell you Ah Jun

368
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,679
At the beginning

369
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,480
Dad is ready

370
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:35,800
Preparation for big compensation

371
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,280
Now it seems that I'm overly worried

372
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,760
Develop with this momentum

373
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,280
You'll release another new product

374
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:42,760
Profit will be made soon

375
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:43,679
real

376
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,720
Don't always sigh

377
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,879
You're not always telling your dad

378
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,080
Don't bow your head when something happens

379
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,639
Do you want to look up and look forward

380
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,119
Why doesn't it work until you are

381
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,520
yes

382
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,639
It seems that I am not losing much now

383
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,560
But my personal expenses

384
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,760
Haven't spread out yet

385
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,240
It seems that I will be saved in the future

386
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:02,879
Great saving

387
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,560
Your little Taozi is so well-behaved

388
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,480
Don't cry or make trouble

389
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,199
I heard from Hongming

390
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,639
This is a long-distance delivery inspection.

391
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:19,720
You

392
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,079
Also go there specifically

393
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,280
Bought a gift for the child

394
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,560
Too sorry

395
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,959
It's me who should say sorry

396
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,280
When you gave birth to little peaches

397
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,119
Hongming was dragged away by me

398
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,959
Wasn't that special day?

399
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Don't be here for you two

400
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,080
You're welcome

401
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,438
Sounds awkward

402
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,399
Liu Jun

403
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,639
Come out and eat some watermelon

404
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,439
good

405
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,480
Uncle has gone to eat watermelon

406
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,599
Bye-Bye

407
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,639
You guys go

408
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,800
Look like me

409
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,080
Eyes look like you

410
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:54,959
What should I do then

411
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,000
What's good looking

412
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,679
The gift my uncle bought

413
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,560
I independently develop new products

414
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
So much has been invested

415
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,399
Funding and energy

416
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,080
Currently, the settlement is still losing money

417
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:10,959
You see the market

418
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,439
With its good equipment

419
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,399
Do OEM for me

420
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,800
In the end, he made a good profit

421
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:18,639
It's really too deformed

422
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,040
This high profitability of finishing

423
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,199
I have to take it into my own hands

424
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,080
I remember you planned it before

425
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,399
Not that the investment is too high

426
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:29,520
Does your dad disagree

427
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,639
He has to agree if he doesn't agree

428
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:33,800
Even if you sell a house and a car

429
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,800
This step must be taken

430
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,000
OEM is not just about concessions

431
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,639
It has also increased significantly

432
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,599
Risk of leaks

433
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,159
At present

434
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:44,199
People who don't take infringement seriously

435
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:45,639
Still too many

436
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:50,240
Lin Yue is so smart

437
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,280
Just look at money and not the rules

438
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,080
You have to keep a little tight during this time

439
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,320
A few more batches

440
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,679
Enter

441
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:58,959
Mr. Liu is here

442
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,080
Mr. Liu

443
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,760
Old Willow Old Willow

444
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:01,840
Mr. Liu meets Mr. Liu

445
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:03,119
My heart is full of joy

446
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:03,959
Pour a cup of tea

447
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,599
No no no no

448
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:05,359
No, no, no, no

449
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,520
I've brought my own

450
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,599
You see

451
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,878
I've made enough preparations

452
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,480
Look at the Cassia seed

453
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,679
Reduce blood pressure and improve eyesight

454
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:14,159
I'll tell you Mr. Liu

455
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:17,040
Today I am in the Dragon and Phoenix Hall of Peace Hotel

456
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,159
A specially booked private room

457
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:19,800
Sign the contract

458
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,359
Let's have a good drink

459
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,599
Then put this

460
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,560
Manager Qin and Han workers are called

461
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,439
Old Liu

462
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,320
That's right

463
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,599
Your product has no problem

464
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,199
yes

465
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,359
What about the pass rate of random inspection

466
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,199
Very good too

467
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:35,000
But

468
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:35,840
This morning

469
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:36,999
We have another meeting

470
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,800
Some details about the contract

471
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:40,320
Some adjustments have been made

472
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,840
Then you can take a look first

473
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,080
well

474
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,000
I can probably guess

475
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,959
What is Lin Yue doing

476
00:24:08,878 --> 00:24:10,639
It must have been holding the drawings I gave him

477
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,080
Make a blank first

478
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,639
Then go to the heat treatment workshop to do experiments

479
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,000
Want to pass various

480
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
Thermal expansion rate of metal

481
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,080
Deduce the ratio of alloy material

482
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,159
If you have the ability, please say it again

483
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,760
Forget it, tell you ten times

484
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:25,720
You can't understand, either

485
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,439
Then you don't worry about anything

486
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,040
There is no need to worry so much

487
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,159
Lin Yue didn't know at all

488
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,000
First-hand information

489
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,760
That's it

490
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:37,279
Not through precision calculation

491
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,199
Hold the whole kit

492
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,560
A stupid way to do experiments

493
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,520
Not that easy

494
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,919
Colliding out accurate data

495
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,240
Wish you success

496
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:45,919
You understand

497
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:50,520
Hello

498
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,280
This price

499
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,919
Why did this drop so much?

500
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,359
We all said it well yesterday

501
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,800
You can't change the price

502
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,760
Same series and same product

503
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,480
Same parameters and specifications

504
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,639
Someone quoted

505
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,560
Twenty percent lower than you

506
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:07,639
You said we

507
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,399
Shouldn't it be

508
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,560
Re-certify the price

509
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,520
impossible

510
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,320
This was developed independently by my son

511
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:13,959
There is no second manufacturer in the country

512
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:14,679
Even less likely to have

513
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,599
A lower offer than this

514
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,760
it's out of the question

515
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,760
I only look at the other party's quote

516
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,240
Is it possible

517
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,560
Or Director Liu is back

518
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:25,919
Think about it carefully

519
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,119
Impossible

520
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,199
This is absolutely impossible

521
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,399
Is it convenient for you now

522
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,959
OK OK OK I'll come here right away

523
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,040
What's wrong

524
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,919
Chief Engineer Wang told me that the city is one machine

525
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
RF-A01 samples have been made

526
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,840
Various mechanical properties and my settings

527
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,720
Almost no difference

528
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,879
No

529
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:53,240
I'll go there quickly

530
00:25:58,199 --> 00:25:59,599
I really can't figure it out

531
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,040
Mingming heat treatment site

532
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:03,159
Only I can see the temperature display

533
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,679
Only I know

534
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:06,280
What rare material is added

535
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:07,840
Their R&D team

536
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,320
How did it crack

537
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,480
Could it be that the person who leads the lead is a master

538
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,000
Boss Lin won't let me participate this time

539
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,560
It's the head of the deputy chief engineer

540
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,599
I know how capable this person is.

541
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,679
He can come to the conclusion so quickly

542
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,560
If it wasn't a lucky one

543
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,119
That's definitely

544
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,439
Have clear clues

545
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:30,919
It's impossible to hit a great fortune

546
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:32,040
I'm on different parts

547
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,560
Different heat treatments are used

548
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,080
The probability of several collisions he can hit at one time

549
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,879
It's astronomical

550
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:36,760
Absolutely impossible

551
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,119
I'll reveal something to you

552
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,480
Their research and development experiment

553
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,599
Raw material cost

554
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,320
A total of 200,000

555
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,679
You go back and do it well

556
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,280
From you

557
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,879
What kind of information is leaked

558
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,919
That's how much money it's only spent

559
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,959
No wonder

560
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,199
Negotiable order

561
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:04,760
Cancel if you say cancel

562
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,199
I'll tell you Ah Jun

563
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,439
I thought of it at that time

564
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,320
This must be related to the city's first machine

565
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,800
Samples of the first machine

566
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,159
Just made it today

567
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,919
Your Shanghai order is gone

568
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,520
Follow-up for normal sales

569
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,679
How fast

570
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,280
They must have been sure before

571
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,679
Try the sample

572
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:22,560
But why do they

573
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,199
Can you be sure in advance

574
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,480
How did they master it

575
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,320
What about the key data

576
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,199
you mean

577
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:38,639
Aunt Fu

578
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,399
Aunt Fu opens the door

579
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,639
Liu Jun

580
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,240
What's wrong

581
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,439
Where is my book

582
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,520
Sorry Sorry

583
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:46,840
I might be leaving

584
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,280
Put it in your bag

585
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,280
She's a book reader

586
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,679
It's my mother's old colleague again

587
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,760
What is she trying to do this

588
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,919
Picture money

589
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,879
If it was Fu Qiufang

590
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,359
That's all for money

591
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:08,439
Is she short of money?

592
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,399
Short of money

593
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:11,760
Her son passed the exam

594
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Not a good university

595
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:13,959
I don't have a job after graduation

596
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,399
Which company does her husband work

597
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,439
Closed again

598
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:17,479
Monthly pension

599
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,520
Just a little money

600
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,000
Her husband is in poor health

601
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,119
You said it's for their family

602
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,959
What is most important

603
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,320
Money is the most important

604
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,320
Sorry dad

605
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,240
I was careless

606
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,199
The previous book

607
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,119
When not in the safe

608
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,119
I should be alert

609
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,040
The later data recorded above

610
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,639
Enough they compare with each other

611
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,959
The final data range has been drawn

612
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,280
Too shameless

613
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,199
Then what should we do

614
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,080
What to do

615
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,240
We can't just let it go

616
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,240
Then what do you want

617
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,480
I'm going to sue them

618
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,520
Prosecution

619
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:01,480
Do you have any evidence

620
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,879
dad

621
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,080
Lin Yue violated my heart

622
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:05,720
My contribution

623
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,040
My intellectual property

624
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,240
Can you bear this kind of thing

625
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,040
I can't bear it

626
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:09,919
Bear with it

627
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
We've accepted it

628
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:12,959
Never look for that Lin Yue

629
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:14,359
His fellow villagers

630
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,639
There is no good thing

631
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,919
It's all about up and down

632
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,598
There are people

633
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,199
Listen to me

634
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,280
Don't cause trouble

635
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,399
Dad, why are you doing this

636
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:24,320
Lin Yue is the one who violated the law

637
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,159
What are you here to advise me to do

638
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,439
You're still unreasonable

639
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,639
Can it be eaten as a meal

640
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,040
Ah Jun

641
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:43,280
Don't fight for a moment

642
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,199
Prosper or not

643
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:51,760
What are you doing

644
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:52,679
You please come back to me

645
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:54,159
I won't look for Lin Yue, I'll go home

646
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,119
you

647
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:01,399
Mr. Lin

648
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,439
The order from Shanghai has been collected

649
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,320
The two foreign parties also had a good negotiation

650
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,520
Wait until they finish the process

651
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,199
We can sign a contract next week

652
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:11,679
Very good

653
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,359
Taking advantage of Liu Jun's current

654
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,399
He has no production capacity

655
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,720
The other imitations didn't keep up

656
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:18,159
We're running at this time

657
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,439
This is the time difference

658
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,320
OK

659
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:21,760
Perfect

660
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,800
Mr. Lin doesn't answer the phone

661
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:35,840
I'm going to go in and find him

662
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:36,919
Not sorry

663
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,879
Just notified above

664
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:38,639
Start today

665
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,800
You can't enter this door

666
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,959
You'd better go

667
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,399
You've all seen it, too

668
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:44,000
I don't have a knife or a stick

669
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,480
I just want to go in and talk to him

670
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,439
Everyone is civilized

671
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,919
Is there anything that can't be said in person?

672
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,199
We are also ordered to do it

673
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,919
If you say you can't enter, you can't enter

674
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,879
You go

675
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:53,119
I'll look for Lin Chuan

676
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,119
I'll find Lin Chuan.

677
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:54,760
Dr. Liu

678
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,720
Can't I find Lin Chuan?

679
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:56,760
We all work

680
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,359
Why do you think you should make things difficult for us?

681
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,280
Otherwise, you will raise your hands with a generous and generous amount

682
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:01,480
You see

683
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,199
Sorry

684
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,439
Lin Chuan

685
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,399
Lin Chuan

686
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,399
I know you're at home

687
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,840
We are neighbors

688
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,359
You can't hide from me forever

689
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,080
Open the door

690
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,399
Please come in

691
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,000
You don't have to close the door

692
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,158
I'll leave after I'm finished speaking

693
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,080
There was a moment

694
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,040
I actually believed you

695
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:41,240
I thought Miss Lin and I were travelers

696
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,240
Now it looks

697
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,520
I'm so childish

698
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,480
Sorry

699
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:51,720
I haven't advised me

700
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,520
A gentleman loves money and gets it in a good way

701
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,399
This money is not what he should have earned

702
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,919
He refused to negotiate

703
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,679
Just forcing me to sue

704
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,560
But he is the person

705
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:01,840
That's the character

706
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
See such a huge profit

707
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:04,800
According to the contract

708
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:05,879
No production is allowed in the city

709
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,720
The same kit as our factory

710
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,040
Please send me a message

711
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,159
This product is a factory that dares to produce one

712
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,199
I'll go to court to sue immediately

713
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,800
Liu Jun, calm down first

714
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,720
I know you're angry

715
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,359
But it's useless for you to do this

716
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,760
I'm not helping my elder brother threaten you

717
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,399
But my elder brother is that

718
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,959
You just think he is a

719
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,240
A local snake that is not easy to mess with

720
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,040
Is it OK

721
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Don't be reckless

722
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,560
I'm reckless

723
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,240
Use law to solve problems

724
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,199
This is a modern society

725
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,279
The most civilized way

726
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:38,760
You actually said I was reckless

727
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,520
You don't understand what I mean

728
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:42,320
I'm not here to debate with you today

729
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:43,639
You take my words

730
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,879
Just convey it to him

731
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,959
Liu Jun, I

732
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,919
Sorry, Mr. Liu

733
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,240
Your case

734
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,599
We cannot be a proxy

735
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,119
Why

736
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:00,679
Is it because I don't have enough information?

737
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:02,199
I have a patent certificate

738
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,159
There is also a copy of the contract

739
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,919
Bring them all

740
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,359
This has nothing to do with information

741
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,239
What about the city one machine

742
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,760
Always a long-term customer

743
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,119
On the law

744
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,320
A conflict of interest

745
00:34:13,478 --> 00:34:14,679
We really can't answer

746
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,918
good

747
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,800
So that's the case

748
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,320
Can you introduce

749
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:22,998
Another law firm gives it to me

750
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,039
Let me give you a clear idea

751
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Your lawsuit

752
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,320
No one will answer

753
00:34:52,518 --> 00:34:53,320
Come back

754
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,239
The meal will be ready soon

755
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,438
There's another dish

756
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:12,200
I can't find evidence now

757
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,160
There is no way to accuse you

758
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,439
But what did you do

759
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,680
You know it in your heart

760
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,160
I don't want to eat the food you cooked anymore

761
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,039
You go

762
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,600
Don't come again in the future

763
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:04,479
Who can't say false benevolence and righteousness

764
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:06,959
What do you mean

765
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:07,999
You make the words clear

766
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:30,640
good

767
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:32,680
OK

768
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,200
Factory Director

769
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:06,399
The Gangdi Tax Inspection Department called

770
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,359
Say someone reported that we were tax evasion

771
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,519
Let you hold it for three years

772
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,640
All vouchers and books

773
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:12,200
Go over and be investigated immediately

774
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,280
Inspection Department

775
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,079
I have a good relationship with them

776
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:16,999
How could they

777
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,039
Don't even say hello

778
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,320
Directly notify the account check

779
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:20,160
Why

780
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,479
I asked tentatively, too

781
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,160
But they didn't say anything

782
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:26,959
It shouldn't be

783
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,479
Will you sue Lin Yue with me?

784
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,240
It's related

785
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Who have you sued

786
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,359
I filed a complaint the day before yesterday

787
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,760
Prosecuting Lin Yue for infringement

788
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,479
The court said the case was filed within seven days

789
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,439
Let me come back and wait for news

790
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,999
you

791
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,680
Didn't I let you sue him?

792
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:46,959
Where did you get the official seal

793
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,240
I opened the safe and got it myself

794
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:51,999
You're pretty reasonable

795
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,840
Factory Manager, don't do it

796
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,399
Do you know if you have caused a big disaster

797
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,519
How much does it have to do with the matter

798
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,320
I don't believe it

799
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,519
It's okay, go

800
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,359
Let them all go out

801
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:04,079
Don't do it, speak well

802
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:06,439
Go out

803
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,479
Ah Jun

804
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,800
Checking the account is Dad's seven inches

805
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:26,879
One dozen or one accurate

806
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,320
Advance so many years

807
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,919
Can't help but check

808
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,399
Even if you win the lawsuit

809
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,160
So what

810
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,479
So what if you lose money

811
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,079
That's not enough to pay the penalty for checking the account

812
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:52,600
Let's withdraw the lawsuit

813
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:56,919
The lawsuit must be withdrawn

814
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,559
Dad knows you're wronged

815
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,359
But withdrawing the lawsuit does not mean losing the lawsuit

816
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,399
What are we afraid of if we have any reason

817
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,720
but

818
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,439
We don't have the strength of Lin Yue

819
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,559
Why bother

820
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,240
Not as strong as others

821
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,359
Do you want to be a good person?

822
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
I beg you, okay

823
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,479
Dad begs you

824
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,680
Sorry dad

825
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:41,800
I'll go to the court

826
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,479
young people

827
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,600
If you're always so unclearable

828
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,680
Will suffer a great loss in the future

829
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,999
We are all rule-performing people

830
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,680
That's all for this matter

831
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,640
OK OK OK

832
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,879
Then you go back

833
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:27,559
It's so much trouble

834
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,399
Take good care of your child

835
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:29,919
good

836
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:30,800
Not to give it

837
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,280
We don't have the strength of Lin Yue

838
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,200
Dad knows you're wronged

839
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:44,479
I beg you, okay

840
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:47,359
Dad begs you

841
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,918
Mother

842
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,039
You taught me since childhood

843
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:15,559
No matter what others say

844
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,760
Be brave to be yourself

845
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,280
That's why I became

846
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,359
Today's Liu Jun

847
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,559
But now

848
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,879
I have no idea

849
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,640
Can you continue to be yourself

850
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,999
I'm Liu Jun

851
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,879
I'll always be Liu Jun

852
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,919
I'm Liu Jun

853
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:32,160
I'll always be Liu Jun

854
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,559
Comrades

855
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:05,800
Is there anything wrong

856
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:06,760
Comrades

857
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:07,680
Hello Hello Hello

858
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,120
We are from Pengtang Hope Primary School

859
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,079
Our car is broken here

860
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,919
Can't go down the mountain

861
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:11,680
Can you help

862
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,079
Go to the foot of the mountain to make a phone call
