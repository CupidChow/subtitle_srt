1
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:44,158
Five million

2
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,560
I heard it right

3
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,439
One machine spent five million

4
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,079
Buy Liu Jun's skills

5
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,560
That's really ridiculous

6
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,878
When that guy was doing research and development

7
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,920
We all see it

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,280
This takes that little time

9
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,959
Used equipment

10
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,158
Consumed materials

11
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,519
Added up

12
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,560
R&D cost

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,840
He can't sell one

14
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,159
The price is five million

15
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,400
Pricing of intellectual property rights

16
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,359
I'm afraid you didn't calculate that way

17
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
No matter how you calculate it, you can't calculate it like this

18
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,639
I'll tell you

19
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,080
This is definitely not Lu Guangfa’s idea

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,800
He's too smart

21
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,439
It's his stupid son

22
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,039
This prodigal son

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,520
Big brother

24
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,199
The city is no longer yours

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,680
What do they buy and sell

26
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,039
That's their business

27
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,560
Just leave it alone

28
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,599
I don't want to care about me

29
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,000
You said that stupid

30
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,840
He was fooled by Liu Jun

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,520
What technology do you sell

32
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,079
You're going to take revenge

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
Lin Yue is gone

34
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,759
Otherwise, you will avenge him

35
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,759
What kind of revenge is selling technology

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,560
revenge

37
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,879
Selling technology is really selling technology

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,719
In fact, Lu Huadong's decision is really correct

39
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,918
With the huge production capacity of the city-one machine

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,280
After he bought out his skills

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,759
Very good profit margin

42
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,159
There is a new word this year

43
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,960
You haven't heard of it

44
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,599
What

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,240
Win-win

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,319
Win-win

47
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,439
Sell technology well

48
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,439
Come

49
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,520
congratulations

50
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,039
With this money

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
You can buy a new house

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,960
Be my neighbor

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,039
Where

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,800
My special valve trial

55
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,800
Just succeeded

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,159
But subsequent accessories

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,478
Have to continue to develop

58
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,599
So

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,319
My five million

60
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,639
I plan to buy all new equipment

61
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,680
Development of new accessories

62
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,000
The factory manager who came back from abroad

63
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,280
It's just different

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,719
The waiter has another drink

65
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,759
What do you think of this

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,840
World Trade Center was hit

67
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,000
Does your company have much business in the United States

68
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,240
In addition to some direct business

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
There are many re-entering

70
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,839
The proportion is not small

71
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,079
Such a big thing

72
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,920
It will definitely have an impact on the economic situation

73
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,759
You're both foreign trade and stocks this year

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,079
I also have to buy a house in Shanghai

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,079
The leverage is too large

76
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,600
Be more cautious

77
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,439
This one is buying a house in Shanghai

78
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,560
What does it matter

79
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,040
House prices in Shanghai

80
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,759
It will definitely rise all the way

81
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,120
If you have spare money

82
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,078
I want to advise you to buy one

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,480
I just finished testing the special valve

84
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,360
Do I look like spare money

85
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,519
You didn't say this

86
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,720
Is the expected profit of the valve good?

87
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,639
How can you still have money shortage

88
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,239
Expected profit

89
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,879
That has to be sold, too

90
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,680
This special valve

91
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,040
The target customers are large state-owned enterprises

92
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,920
From success of sample to acceptance by the market

93
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,920
There are several difficulties in the middle

94
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,279
I've been looking for relationships and asking people for help these two days

95
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
Still failed to break through

96
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,639
The threshold for large groups

97
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm so worried

98
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,720
How could you have no way

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,279
You didn't know that

100
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,360
Who's coming

101
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
Who do I know

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,199
Hello Sister Liang

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,560
I'm Liu Jun

104
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,439
Really magnificent

105
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,399
It is worthy of being a large state-owned enterprise

106
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,720
I'll remind you again

107
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,720
They just watched it

108
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,240
After our sample report

109
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,319
Promise to give us a trial opportunity

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,680
Don't be too excited

111
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,600
It's not easy

112
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,680
The threshold for such large state-owned enterprises is high

113
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,839
We've already stepped in

114
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,759
Half a foot

115
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,439
yes

116
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,319
Can be tried

117
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,920
It's already supreme grace

118
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,160
What our company is going

119
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,480
High-tech route

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,560
The attitude must be neither humble nor arrogant

121
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,639
Reflect the characteristics of our company

122
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,199
good

123
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,199
Mr. Song’s guest arrived

124
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,920
This is the chairman of our group

125
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,759
Mr. Song

126
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,360
Mr. Song

127
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,720
Hello Mr. Song

128
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
I am Liu Jun from Tengfei Factory

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,519
Just call me Xiaoliu Xiaoliu

130
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,560
Hello

131
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,240
This Q&A will

132
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,399
You want to participate in it yourself

133
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,439
This type of special valve

134
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,639
Never used it before

135
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,600
Domestic brand

136
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,040
You are the first one

137
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,240
I've seen the sample report

138
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,279
Very interested

139
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,000
Come here today to attend

140
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,759
That's great

141
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,120
Please give me more valuable suggestions from Mr. Song

142
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,560
Let's get started

143
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,199
OK OK OK OK That's it I know

144
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,519
It's good to be busy

145
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,319
Didn't say you

146
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,240
Don't talk so much nonsense

147
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,720
Old factory manager

148
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,679
Old Zhu

149
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,759
You are looking for Mr. Liu

150
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,279
He is not in the office nor in the workshop

151
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,960
Where have you gone

152
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,159
Go to Donghai Group

153
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,240
Today is a special valve Q&A meeting

154
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,240
He and Sun Gong Liao Gong

155
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,639
I set off with the sample early in the morning

156
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,840
Donghai Group

157
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,279
OK OK OK

158
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,600
You go and I understand.

159
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,399
OK

160
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,039
It's me, old man

161
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,158
Really sorry

162
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm afraid it's time to change

163
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,840
how

164
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,919
It's not that I'm making excuses

165
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,240
Can I lie to you in our relationship?

166
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,159
It's really the kids are busy

167
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,399
Yes Yes Yes

168
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,120
yes

169
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,039
Young people today

170
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,320
Isn't that the case

171
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,440
Have to find a suitable time

172
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,320
Make them feel

173
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,960
It was naturally recognized

174
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
It's hard to do for adults

175
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:39,840
OK OK OK

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,320
Make an appointment again and again

177
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,639
Every step of the test

178
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,080
All data records are in the library

179
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,960
For verification

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,080
Control of the entire set of accessories

181
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,799
Using

182
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,440
Current advanced industrial control technology

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,679
All indicators can be fully met

184
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,320
Standards for similar products abroad

185
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,600
Not necessarily

186
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,879
Your forging data

187
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,639
Obviously not achieved

188
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,480
That's it

189
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,679
Because of European and American countries

190
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,279
Embargo regulations on China

191
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,600
All our imported forging equipment

192
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,279
All have limitations in accuracy

193
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,600
The quality of this product

194
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,759
To a certain extent

195
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,759
Affected

196
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,159
But this gap

197
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,120
Can be compensated by design

198
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,039
Compared with Donghai Group

199
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,000
The current imports of the United States

200
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,120
Our finished products in overall performance

201
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,200
Not inferior

202
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,879
Of course

203
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,399
Embargo is not

204
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,679
An excuse for stopping R&D

205
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,200
Next

206
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,519
We will work hard

207
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,120
Understand the structure of imported forging machines

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,919
Further improve forging accuracy

209
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,360
The database you just mentioned

210
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,360
Can I take a look

211
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,480
Mr. Song, please read

212
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,039
Hydrogen sulfide at different concentrations

213
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,039
At different temperatures

214
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,519
Corrosion levels for different steels

215
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,960
Do we have data records?

216
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,559
We've drawn a curve chart before

217
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,840
You can check information

218
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,399
You can take a look for it yourself

219
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,960
Equipment for the East China Sea

220
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,519
Such a critical set of data

221
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,840
We don't

222
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,119
Take off but has

223
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,120
Such a huge amount of data

224
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,080
How did you get it

225
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,759
We have a dedicated person now

226
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,320
Specialized test materials

227
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Enrich the database

228
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,440
But when there were no staff in the past

229
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,360
This work

230
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,360
It's up to me and the engineers

231
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,600
I did it stupidly using my rest time

232
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,399
Where are most of us

233
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,559
Not geniuses

234
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,759
But there are always some people

235
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,159
Will rely on extraordinary seriousness and persistence

236
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,759
Learn more today

237
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,960
Do more tomorrow

238
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,519
Over time

239
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,240
What comes out is rich results

240
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,399
When I was a kid, I recited "Selected Mao"

241
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,720
There is a sentence in it

242
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,399
In the world, fear is just serious

243
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,960
You're stupid

244
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
It seems stupid

245
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,440
It's really great wisdom

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,879
Thank you Mr. Song

247
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,919
Mr. Liu, I'll give it to you soon

248
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:42,840
thank you

249
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,440
You're welcome

250
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:43,840
See you next time

251
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,200
goodbye

252
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,679
Very good this time it will definitely be fine

253
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,679
Absolutely

254
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,879
I think I can definitely pass

255
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,279
Don't be excited

256
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,879
Who said this was decided

257
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,080
Not that simple

258
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:58,840
You didn't see Mr. Song

259
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,000
How much do you agree with

260
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,320
100% more

261
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,320
This is not Yiyantang

262
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,399
This matter

263
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,919
It's not something that Mr. Song alone can decide.

264
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,480
So

265
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,480
It's said that I can enter this year

266
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,240
WTO (World Trade Organization)

267
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,120
Haven't you entered this for half a year?

268
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,559
So recognition is recognition

269
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,960
It's still unclear whether it can be used or not

270
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:18,639
Come

271
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,279
About the trial of Tengfei Factory

272
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,639
Special valve decision

273
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,080
What else do you have any comments

274
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,799
After today's Q&A meeting

275
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,759
I believe

276
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,679
Everyone is concerned about the product itself

277
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,240
There should be no comment

278
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,519
But our Donghai Group

279
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,600
High production capacity

280
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
The equipment is constantly shut down

281
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,200
Only on regular

282
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,399
When practicing at a large and small scale

283
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,360
Replace accessories

284
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,039
Once replaced

285
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,240
Then you have to guarantee

286
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,279
To use it until the next maintenance

287
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,639
Midway accessories fail

288
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,600
One shutdown

289
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,759
That's a million losses

290
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,600
I think the risk is still too great

291
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,039
So I think

292
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,679
Can you fight Tengfei

293
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,919
This domestic accessories

294
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,240
Observe again

295
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,960
Let's wait for other companies to try it out first

296
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,039
After success, we will introduce it

297
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,639
This is more secure and more secure

298
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,399
Other companies

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,480
Which company are you referring to?

300
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,240
I've said it on many occasions

301
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,720
Donghai Group's positioning for itself

302
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,919
It should be the leader of the entire industry

303
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,960
From the perspective of social benefits

304
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,600
We have a responsibility

305
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,960
Discover excellent independent research and development products

306
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,200
Create conditions for domestic production of the whole machine

307
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,159
From the economic benefits

308
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,120
Encourage the use of domestic accessories

309
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,240
We also reduce costs

310
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,159
A must-have path

311
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,240
Ask everyone

312
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,120
If Lian Tengfei is like this

313
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,799
Dare to innovate independently

314
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,159
Another comprehensive Q&A product

315
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,840
Can't enter Donghai Group

316
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,320
Then what is our leader

317
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,639
Where exactly is reflected

318
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,320
The road to domestic production in the entire industry

319
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,559
In which direction should we go

320
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,039
Hello, I am Liu Jun

321
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,799
OK I understand

322
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,440
OK Goodbye

323
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,320
Completed

324
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,840
Very good

325
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,038
Very good

326
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,320
Too good, so good, so good

327
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,080
Very good

328
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,200
Don't be happy

329
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,080
Two weeks

330
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Delivery in two weeks

331
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,879
The first batch of accessories

332
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:14,519
good

333
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,879
The key to opening up the market

334
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,480
Just watch it

335
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,720
Results after this trial

336
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,639
Don't worry

337
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,759
Such a rare opportunity

338
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,559
I will definitely supervise the production in shifts with Gong Liao.

339
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,799
There will definitely be no problems

340
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,559
rest assured

341
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:25,879
Please enter

342
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,679
Mr. Liu

343
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,240
The gatekeeper called and said

344
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,240
A customer is looking for you

345
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,200
But no appointment

346
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,799
The security guard didn't dare to let her in directly

347
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,360
You see

348
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,320
My guest

349
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,759
What's the name

350
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,840
No name reported

351
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,159
Said it's from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China branch

352
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,440
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Branch

353
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,879
Forget it, who he is

354
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,159
All the masters come to the bank

355
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,399
Get in quickly

356
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,080
OK

357
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,079
Please enter

358
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:23,680
This is our Mr. Liu

359
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,440
Hello

360
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,000
Hello, I am Liu Jun

361
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,480
Welcome ICBC leaders

362
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,799
Visit to guide the work

363
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,079
My name is Cui Bingbing

364
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,039
Is a credit officer at a municipal branch

365
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,160
Then please sit

366
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,240
good

367
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,519
Pour a glass of water

368
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,279
OK

369
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,000
Miss Cui is so young

370
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,599
The middle-level state-owned banks are

371
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,799
Just a small and middle-level

372
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:49,599
Please drink water

373
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,160
Thanks

374
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,680
I'm from a friend

375
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,920
See your company

376
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,079
Report on applying for high-tech enterprise certification

377
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm quite interested

378
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
So I took the initiative to come to the door

379
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,799
Want to talk about business with Mr. Liu

380
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,680
For companies like us

381
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,680
Credit from the four major banks

382
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,960
It's really rare

383
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,160
We have also done it in ICBC before

384
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,960
But I didn't do it

385
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,359
Don't know Manager Cui

386
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:18,720
What do you want to know specifically

387
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,920
I've read your company's financial report

388
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,759
The specific allocation of these fixed assets

389
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,799
It's not visible on the balance sheet

390
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,680
This is my first

391
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,240
Things you want to figure out

392
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,119
I want to ask Mr. Liu

393
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,359
Your factory's fixed assets

394
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,079
It's impossible to most

395
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,559
All on the device

396
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,279
It's really on the device

397
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
This is our company

398
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,839
Copy of all equipment prices

399
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,119
If there is any need to verify,

400
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,599
We can, too

401
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,640
Go directly to the workshop to have a look

402
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,200
I can't understand this in foreign languages, either

403
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,400
That's better, just like Mr. Liu said

404
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,160
Let's go to the workshop to have a look

405
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,240
good

406
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:06,599
please

407
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,000
Is Mr. Liu just like this factory?

408
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,519
Just this piece

409
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,400
Then I know your loan

410
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,880
Why can't I do it

411
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,079
Isn't it because of your four major abilities

412
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,759
Do you look down on our private factories?

413
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,119
In my opinion

414
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,880
Our bank has been reluctant to lend money

415
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,599
There are two major reasons

416
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,119
I can tell you the first one now

417
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,119
you say

418
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,359
Profit figures on your income statement

419
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,480
Too beautiful

420
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,480
Beautiful as if he was making fake accounts

421
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,960
And the level of fraud is very low

422
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,319
Like a

423
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,079
Self-employed people who are trained in stalls

424
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,160
My profit margin

425
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,078
It's indeed higher than other machinery factories

426
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,279
That's because

427
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,680
They do low-level processing

428
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,000
Profit margin is already low

429
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,839
Then you compare it horizontally to other countries

430
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,079
For example

431
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,480
I've worked in Germany before

432
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,079
Take off the current gross profit

433
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,480
It's just normal

434
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,279
Maybe

435
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,519
But this does not match

436
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,839
Banks’ understanding of domestic private enterprises

437
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,119
Even me

438
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,680
A regular loan officer

439
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
When just reading the report

440
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,880
I think it's fake, too

441
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,720
If there hasn't been a site inspection

442
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,759
Who can believe it

443
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,240
In Mr. Liu's workshop

444
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,720
A beautiful woman in a golden house

445
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,480
Oh well

446
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,160
So what is another reason?

447
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,519
Miss Cui

448
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,480
It's almost time to get off work

449
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,720
Or I'll treat you to a meal

450
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,720
Let's have a chat while eating

451
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,720
Find me a place

452
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:00,920
I'll change my clothes

453
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,799
Taste is OK

454
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
What about this second one

455
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,000
It's your fixed assets

456
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,359
The land accounts for too little value

457
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,880
New companies have fewer credit records

458
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,680
Although the business situation is good

459
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:30,839
But think about it

460
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,319
Your factory building

461
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:33,920
Take up just a little bit of land

462
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,759
Can't evaluate how much value

463
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,839
So from the perspective of risk control

464
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,720
Your loan

465
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,319
Only get a little

466
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,920
But this little loan

467
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,720
Profits earned

468
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,000
Only enough to buy equipment

469
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,039
And with the current production capacity

470
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,400
There is no need at all

471
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,440
Go buy land to expand

472
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,200
You deal with the bank to get a loan

473
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:54,400
You have to follow the bank's idea

474
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,599
There are many companies currently

475
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,759
This is all done

476
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,480
When they reinvest their profits

477
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,160
Some are used to buy land

478
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,720
Some are used to buy equipment

479
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,279
Some don't even buy equipment

480
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,480
Direct rental

481
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
So what

482
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,880
First, it is convenient to make loan collateral

483
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:10,839
Secondly

484
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,519
You can wait for the land to appreciate

485
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,799
I've seen many successful enclosures

486
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,039
On the balance sheet of that company

487
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,039
Assessment of land value-added

488
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,319
That's the big deal

489
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,039
The key is that we don't have that much money

490
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,440
Update the equipment is the top priority

491
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,160
Your mind is too rigid

492
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,839
The money you bought the land

493
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,319
You're not idle either

494
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,279
You will appreciate at that time

495
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,839
You can get more loans

496
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,759
That's not money

497
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,200
You can't buy equipment

498
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,920
No wonder

499
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,039
I said there are some factories in the industrial area

500
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Obviously the benefits are average

501
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,200
The scale can expand rapidly

502
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
I've never understood it yet

503
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,480
Where did they get so much money

504
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,119
Miss Cui

505
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,960
We meet for the first time today

506
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:56,960
You'll tell me this

507
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,039
Bank Secret

508
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,960
You're not afraid that I'll say it out

509
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,039
What is my business purpose

510
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,200
It means that every time I negotiate a loan

511
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,559
Just make a friend

512
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,279
Since I've taken the initiative today

513
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,480
Door-to-door service

514
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,000
That must be for Tengfei

515
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,519
And you, Mr. Liu

516
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,400
Have had an in-depth understanding

517
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,880
Then I'll say thank you first

518
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,000
Funding plan after taking off

519
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,960
Please give me some advice

520
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,039
Stay in touch

521
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,559
Stay in touch

522
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:42,640
Or add some more dishes

523
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,160
Enough to eat

524
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,119
Enough to eat

525
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,839
OK

526
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Turn on now

527
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:20,880
How about booting

528
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,039
Very smooth

529
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,000
Mr. Song, I will take Sun Gong down first

530
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,000
good

531
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,240
No problems when booting

532
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,599
Just like an airplane

533
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,079
Just as it can take off safely

534
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,200
It's a very good start

535
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,720
This large-scale equipment operation

536
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,200
Mr. Song is willing to make the decision

537
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,519
Use our domestic accessories

538
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,240
It's really courageous

539
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,440
A large machine

540
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,880
Can run smoothly

541
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,359
Every accessory is important

542
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,440
The reason why I am today

543
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,279
Call you to the scene to see the machine

544
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,480
Just want you

545
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,839
These product providers

546
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,279
Know what's on your shoulders

547
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,240
The heavy responsibility

548
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,400
Of course

549
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,599
if

550
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,799
There is a problem with the on-site startup operation

551
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,680
I'll send you on site, and it's more convenient for me to send you on site.

552
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,960
Liu Jun

553
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,279
You know the beginning

554
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,160
Why did you get it

555
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,200
Is this opportunity

556
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,400
Is it because of Sister Liang's recommendation?

557
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,960
You really think it's related

558
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,079
years ago

559
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,279
We've tried domestically produced equipment

560
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,640
But

561
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,680
Wait until the product is designed

562
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,960
No accessories found in the country

563
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,200
Or it cannot be processed

564
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,680
To the end

565
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,680
Nominally domestic

566
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,640
In fact, the key parts are imported

567
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,440
Cost

568
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,279
More high than buying a whole machine from abroad

569
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,839
So since then

570
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,079
Domestic production has become my heart disease

571
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,599
Take the initiative to take the path of innovation

572
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,960
I strongly support

573
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,240
I hope you can

574
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,200
Can endure loneliness

575
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,359
Resist the temptation

576
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,559
On the road of independent research and development

577
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,039
Go on firmly

578
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,319
Hello Miss Cui

579
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,559
The land of these two parks

580
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,960
I've got a few of them

581
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,240
It's really a bit difficult to choose

582
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,319
I don't know if Miss Cui is inconvenient

583
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,119
Come here

584
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,119
Help me from the bank assessment perspective

585
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,839
Please consult

586
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,359
Give me some practical advice

587
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,079
Of course I have no problem

588
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,920
Explore the growth of the enterprise

589
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,079
It's my job, too

590
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,720
I'm fine tomorrow

591
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,200
Or we'll see you tomorrow

592
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,200
See you tomorrow

593
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,440
What's up

594
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,440
Dad misses you

595
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,680
The special valve you made

596
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,759
There is a way out

597
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:05,559
Is that

598
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,519
It's easy to do it below

599
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,079
dad

600
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,200
You're a

601
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,880
People who have been in charge of factories for more than 20 years

602
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:14,599
Build a business

603
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,920
How could there be a time to relax

604
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,559
I'll apply for a take-off next year

605
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,240
High-tech enterprises recognized

606
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,559
Tax cut loans, etc.

607
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,680
A series of policy support depends entirely on it

608
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,599
This is not an easy thing

609
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,200
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

610
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:31,839
By the way

611
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:34,200
I heard from Lao Zhu

612
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,720
A few days ago, someone from a bank

613
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,319
Come to see you in the factory

614
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,519
How was the talk

615
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,799
Her thoughts

616
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,519
Give me a lot of inspiration

617
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,839
I'm going to get these things

618
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,359
You'll make it clear later

619
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,759
What is a banker

620
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,160
Come and see me

621
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:04,920
Visit home

622
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,359
This means this means this means

623
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,920
You know dad cares a lot

624
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,680
Funding matters

625
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:09,400
dad

626
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,559
OK OK OK

627
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,720
I'll tell you

628
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,920
Dad has an old friend

629
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,319
Uncle Pi, you know

630
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,240
Now I'm planting peaches

631
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,319
Say serious things

632
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:23,920
He told his father

633
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,039
There is a girl's condition

634
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,240
Very suitable for you

635
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,160
Bank jobs

636
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,440
Both parents are doctors and experts

637
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:30,920
Which is the whole country

638
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,319
The kind of experts that are invited

639
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,200
Dad wonders if it's a door

640
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:33,720
I'll say

641
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,119
How could there be people from the four major industries

642
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,920
Come to the door on your own initiative

643
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,720
Dig into ours

644
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,319
The growth of small businesses

645
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,119
What era is this

646
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,039
You arranged a blind date for me

647
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,799
And you arranged it

648
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,759
Don't tell me clearly

649
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,480
If I had known it earlier

650
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,960
I won't ask her again

651
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:46,559
What's wrong

652
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,200
What's wrong

653
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,079
What's wrong

654
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,480
The elders introduced you

655
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,920
You just think it's old-fashioned

656
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,440
You met on the Internet

657
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,640
Just fashionable

658
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,759
How to know is not to know

659
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,240
What are you not forcing

660
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,279
What a pretentious thing

661
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,079
Even with me

662
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,960
Come back for me

663
00:30:59,039 --> 00:30:59,759
Busy

664
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:00,759
return

665
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,279
Why are you waiting here

666
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,519
The first plot is next door

667
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,519
Park your car here and walk over

668
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,079
Look at Mr. Liu's face

669
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,559
Probably got it

670
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,039
Miss Cui

671
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,599
It's not that I'm stingy and rude

672
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,839
But my daily work is piled up

673
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,920
If you inspect our company, it will be fine

674
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,559
But you have to examine me

675
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,240
I really don't have time to receive

676
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,119
Want to hear the truth

677
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,440
Be the same as you at first

678
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,720
Very disgusted with others making connections

679
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,640
Especially seen

680
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,000
After your company's information

681
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,079
I think you're a fake liar

682
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,160
So when I first came to the door

683
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,000
I want to expose you in public

684
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,440
Give the introducer an embarrassing

685
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,319
Then what

686
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,119
Then the thing

687
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,440
You know it all, too

688
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
Is the occupational illness of being a loan officer?

689
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:34,160
I really can't tolerate it

690
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,200
A company with such good growth

691
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,720
Not treated fairly

692
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,480
Mr. Liu

693
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,200
Put aside the cause and not mention it

694
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,599
Our relationship

695
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
It can be pure business

696
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,599
Don't be so afraid of me

697
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,480
What do I have to be afraid of?

698
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,960
There is one more to take off

699
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,200
What about the financial consultant who comes to the door

700
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,480
I've taken advantage of you

701
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,000
Since I've said everything

702
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,078
Let's continue

703
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,480
please

704
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,160
The fourth quarter is not yet reached this year

705
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,640
Good guy

706
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,359
The output value of Tengfei Factory has already caught up with it

707
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,720
It's been a factory for the first ten years

708
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,400
Who dares to think about this in the past

709
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,480
But there are also bad ones

710
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,240
It's just that Ajun is too tired

711
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:25,960
All day long

712
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,720
Think about it in my mind

713
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,480
I can't help

714
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,200
What do you think of

715
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
Come and play basketball

716
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,359
No mood

717
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,039
Miss your baby brother

718
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,599
What's wrong with him

719
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,519
A customer from Shanghai told me

720
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:56,599
Hiroaki

721
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,000
Maybe someone is outside

722
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,199
I'm talking to you

723
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,440
Are you not surprised

724
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,880
Talk

725
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:31,920
Hongying

726
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,518
The foreign trade environment is very complicated

727
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,320
I'll tell you

728
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,719
See so many customers every day

729
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,199
Everyone is different

730
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,159
Hongming has a lot of thoughts

731
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,039
What's the surprise of me if you say this

732
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,159
Yes or no

733
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,119
When Carrie and Hongming fell in love

734
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,639
I have a bad reputation

735
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,480
The family is carrying debts

736
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,400
Actually at the beginning

737
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,119
Her parents were against it

738
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,480
It's just that I can't resist Carrie

739
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,119
I often thought about it at that time

740
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,840
Wait for her to marry

741
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,480
I must be nice to her

742
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,440
You don't have to worry about this

743
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,480
Men are right

744
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,920
No matter how hard it is outside

745
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,880
He will also go home

746
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,320
I advise Hongming

747
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,760
He certainly won't listen

748
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,840
However, Hiroaki

749
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,159
Pay attention to Liu Jun's opinions the most

750
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,920
Can you let him

751
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Find an opportunity

752
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,719
Let him help tell me about Hongming

753
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,559
Playing ball

754
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,960
Playing ball

755
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,719
Two parcels that can be connected

756
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,000
The value is certainly

757
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,719
One plus one is greater than two

758
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,599
But their factory sells land

759
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,840
It's because of poor management

760
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,840
The debt relationship behind it

761
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,639
It must be very complicated

762
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,519
You need to figure it out before you start

763
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:03,800
really

764
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,960
Where is your next piece of land

765
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,480
In the Science and Technology Park

766
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,800
Have to drive over

767
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,679
OK

768
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,280
Then I'll go

769
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,280
What are you doing

770
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:13,880
Driving

771
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,440
Isn't it enough to drive my car

772
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,880
Walk too

773
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,400
The sound of your car

774
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,039
It seems to sound wrong

775
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:33,480
Is there any

776
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,239
Why are there still sounds

777
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,239
Do you do maintenance

778
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:44,840
I often send it to the car.

779
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,440
My car is pretty clean

780
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,599
Maintenance and car washing are different

781
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,639
Your last oil change

782
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,119
How many kilometers is it

783
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,280
At five thousand kilometers

784
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,960
I sent it to the 4S store

785
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,840
Say my car is pretty good

786
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,039
completion

787
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,559
Showing 20,000

788
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,320
Yes, 22,900

789
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,280
never mind

790
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,360
Just take it as a return to your financial advice

791
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:16,880
Come back in a while

792
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,679
I'll check the car for you

793
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,559
You can repair cars

794
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,559
No one in the East China Sea

795
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,840
Know German cars better than me

796
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,000
You can't drive this car

797
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,480
I'll call them

798
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,199
Tow your car to the repair shop for repair

799
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,679
You can take my car

800
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,960
I'll send you back first

801
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,599
OK

802
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,400
Then I'll treat you to a meal

803
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,840
As thanks

804
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,559
Invite me to dinner

805
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,480
What do you want to eat

806
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,400
Home cooking

807
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:00,199
Want to have delicious home-cooked dishes

808
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,199
Go to a normal hotel

809
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,360
Surely not possible

810
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,159
Or go to my house

811
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,079
I'll do it for you

812
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:08,960
Go to your house

813
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,599
You can cook

814
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
You don't know what my nickname is

815
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:14,880
What's the name

816
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,519
People in the martial arts world are called the chef god Bingbing

817
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,760
I told you that I've eaten the meal I've cooked

818
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,360
No one is crying and begging for a second

819
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:22,639
I was so excited about it

820
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,199
Then I'll take a chance and give it a try

821
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,559
Then we have to buy vegetables first

822
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,599
Please enter

823
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,360
There are only two light bulbs on

824
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,719
Can you bear this

825
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,639
This is not

826
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,400
Is there another one that can be bright on one side?

827
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:46,079
Men's slippers

828
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,239
Is it okay

829
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,000
fine

830
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,559
This cabinet is always like this

831
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,599
Just wear this

832
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,280
You can find a place to sit by yourself

833
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,159
Do you have a spare light bulb

834
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,360
Or I'll change it for you

835
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,400
There is a sink underneath

836
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,079
good

837
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,480
Why are you leaking?

838
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:17,239
Is it in the way

839
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,000
You can move it away if you are in the way

840
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,519
That way, why don't you cook first

841
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,320
I'll go to the car

842
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,239
Get a tool box

843
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,199
Fixed for you

844
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,800
Please trouble you

845
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:32,960
fine

846
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,000
Have you fixed it and you can have a meal

847
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,079
Wait for a minute

848
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,559
Come on, come on, shrimp

849
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,439
So delicious

850
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,400
You're very edible

851
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,400
Give me another bowl

852
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,519
One more bowl

853
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,000
You're the second bowl

854
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,519
Can you eat it if you're fine

855
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,559
Then I'll give you less

856
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,039
A full bowl

857
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,840
My favorite food when I was a kid

858
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,239
My mom cooked hairtail for me

859
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,199
This bibimbap is delicious

860
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,480
You taste very much

861
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,920
When I counted it just now

862
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:56,760
Discover your house

863
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,039
There are still many things to repair

864
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,440
But today my toolbox

865
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,599
The tool is not brought correctly

866
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,079
Wait for Saturday

867
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,400
I'll be at home for service again

868
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,800
Let's cook another meal for me

869
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,760
What do I tell you?

870
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,760
The person who has eaten the meal I made

871
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,559
No one doesn't want to have a second meal

872
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,960
tasty

873
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Be slower and be careful

874
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,559
I'll pick you another shrimp

875
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,000
good

876
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:41,960
Old factory manager

877
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:42,840
Busy

878
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:54,840
Then it's decided

879
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,400
See you on weekends

880
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,280
goodbye

881
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,320
Ah Jun

882
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:02,840
Busy

883
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,320
Just finished calling Sister Liang

884
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,840
I want to invite her and Mr. Song

885
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,880
Go and eat big crabs

886
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,159
Thanks for trying our products

887
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,599
That's what it should be

888
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,079
You should thank others

889
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,480
Hairy crabs

890
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,159
Then you bring your dad with you

891
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,239
Sister Liang said she wouldn't eat hairy crabs anymore

892
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,199
Change to weekend

893
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,800
Go to Hope Primary School to study basketball court

894
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:23,760
This is very meaningful

895
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,159
This makes sense, this is good

896
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Meaningful This Meaningful

897
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:27,280
This is good

898
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,199
Are you in trouble

899
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,800
I'm fine

900
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,400
What time is it

901
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,360
It's been slowing down by almost an hour

902
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,039
Qian Hongming, this kid

903
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,400
Have you been very busy lately

904
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,800
Why do you care about him

905
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,960
What do I care about him for

906
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,800
Ask casually

907
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,800
You two were so good before

908
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,920
Like a person

909
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,400
I haven't seen him pestering you for a long time

910
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,000
I thought you two had broken up

911
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,760
No one can break up with us

912
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:04,880
But when you say it is true

913
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,400
I'm about the same as him

914
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,199
Haven't seen each other for a month
