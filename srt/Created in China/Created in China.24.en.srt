1
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,280
Look at your good face

2
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,719
Pornography, gambling, drugs

3
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,598
What would you do

4
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,799
alright

5
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,159
You go out for a walk

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,959
Let yourself take a vacation

7
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,800
I'm here

8
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,439
Is it going well

9
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,759
Very smooth

10
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,759
It's OK to get out of seclusion

11
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,520
How is the family situation

12
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,120
There is no movement here at home

13
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,120
All are pretty good

14
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,879
Don't worry

15
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,079
My parents asked

16
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,159
I said you're on a business trip

17
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,599
That's good

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,800
Before the Spring Festival, the busiest time for factories

19
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:54,960
But now

20
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,240
I can only lie here

21
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,400
And I don't know how long it will take

22
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:00,680
fine

23
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,639
Where in the factory

24
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,960
Aren't Luo Qing and the others?

25
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,319
You sound very tired

26
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,120
I didn't have a rest on the plane, right?

27
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,520
Have something to sleep

28
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,439
Contact us tomorrow

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,919
Liu Jun

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,960
You must not gamble

31
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,840
If you're really bored

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,680
You go to the duty-free shop

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,280
Buy something for me and Xiaopaopao

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
OK

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,439
Ensure the completion of your wife's tasks

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Has hung up

37
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,319
Bye-Bye

38
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,360
Dr. Liu

39
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,199
It's really you

40
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,560
When I was so busy before the Chinese New Year

41
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,000
Can you still come to Macau if you have time

42
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,399
If you can come, I can't come

43
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,160
Could it be said

44
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,879
This casino was also Boss Lin

45
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,639
Monopoly

46
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm looking at your recent

47
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,000
Rising

48
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,399
It's doing pretty well

49
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,720
I'm not worried about you

50
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,319
Is there anything else that can't be readily

51
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,560
It's just a matter of no way to think about it again

52
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,079
Only come to Macau, right?

53
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,480
Then why did Boss Lin come

54
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,600
Can you be the same as me

55
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,439
How much trouble can you cause

56
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,000
Listen to me

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,480
What about you in your heart

58
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,319
What's wrong with it?

59
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,120
You find a place where no one is

60
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,639
It's OK to yell at both

61
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,319
Don't get involved when you bet

62
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
This one touches it

63
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,079
But I can't throw it away

64
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,319
Don't let your wife and children at home

65
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,199
Worry about you, right

66
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,759
In my impression

67
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,319
We should be considered enemies

68
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,600
What qualifications does Boss Lin have?

69
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,279
Come and teach me a lesson

70
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,160
You're still young

71
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,639
Wait for you to reach my level

72
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,720
You'll know

73
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,199
In this world

74
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,600
There is no revenge that cannot be solved

75
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,319
There is no complaint that cannot be dissolved

76
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,120
Who has time to get angry with you

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,959
Seriously advise you

78
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,439
Go home quickly

79
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
You're twisting

80
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,319
A person who doesn't let go

81
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,079
You must not enter a casino

82
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,360
What if I had to go in today

83
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,680
That's also

84
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,319
It doesn't matter

85
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,439
Legs on you

86
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,959
I can't care, either

87
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,680
Mr. Song

88
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,480
I'm Lin Yue

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,720
I'm in Macau recently

90
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,399
You guess I'm at the entrance of the casino

91
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,480
Who did I meet

92
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,800
Hello, Mr. Song

93
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,560
I'm Liu Jun, I

94
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,319
Didn't get out

95
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,439
Why didn't I get out

96
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
Why didn't I get out?

97
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,240
See you again, Dr. Liu

98
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,560
Liu Jun

99
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,600
I haven't heard you for a long time

100
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,560
Why did you think of calling

101
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,879
I met your elder brother in Macau

102
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,480
Gambling is his old habit

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,159
Go often

104
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,600
My sister-in-law no matter what

105
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,720
All want to leave him

106
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,720
This is one of the reasons.

107
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,000
No

108
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,319
Why did you go to Macau?

109
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,639
I

110
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,040
My company has had some trouble recently

111
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,199
Not in a good mood

112
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,040
My mind just now

113
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,920
I was going to

114
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,399
Have a few bets to relax

115
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,519
But your elder brother stopped him

116
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,240
to be honest

117
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,438
He was so determined not to let me in

118
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,679
I'm quite surprised

119
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,720
My elder brother is a very complicated person

120
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,440
He is not what you think

121
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,279
So pure bad

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,200
He just hasn't studied since he was a child

123
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,360
The way of thinking is different from ours

124
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,559
Sometimes I think

125
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,720
Can't understand him

126
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,679
But he is a righteous man

127
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
Anyway, I'll calm down now

128
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,440
Very glad he stopped him

129
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,639
Thank him for me

130
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,200
You're welcome

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,120
This shows that you have some qualities

132
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,279
Very valuable

133
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,159
Even he hopes you can keep it

134
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,519
Lin Chuan

135
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,919
You are a good friend

136
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,279
I hope

137
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,320
Your life will be happier and happier in the future

138
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,159
I'm very happy

139
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,480
Thank you

140
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,679
Hello Mr. An

141
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,799
You've returned home

142
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,120
Come back to me

143
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:51,919
Listen to Old Wei

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,480
You called me yesterday

145
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,799
It seems to be quite urgent

146
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,159
What's up

147
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,440
Mr. An

148
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,240
Take off

149
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,120
Receive an investigation team

150
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,519
Do you know this

151
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,240
I know

152
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,000
What are their investigations

153
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,320
They reviewed

154
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,600
Investment Agreement Accounts

155
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,159
Take-off in the use of project funds

156
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:20,919
Each certificate

157
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,080
Almost all checked

158
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,080
I've heard Mr. Song say

159
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,720
You guy has a slutty sex

160
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,480
I believe them

161
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,000
Can't find anything

162
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,879
There is definitely no Mr. An

163
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Every project that takes off

164
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,399
All are independent accounts

165
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,919
Our cooperation is no exception

166
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,000
And such a big investment

167
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,799
My principle is

168
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,600
Good steel must be spent on the blade

169
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,679
Every penny needs to be spent clearly

170
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,360
Mr. Liu

171
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,799
Since you're so honest

172
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,200
I don't hide it from you either

173
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,720
Now within the group

174
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,879
Someone really thought about it

175
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,000
United City's top management

176
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,919
Want to be in the process of restructuring

177
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,720
Extend your hand to pick peaches

178
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm already dealing with it

179
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,759
I guess

180
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,080
After the Spring Festival

181
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,279
There will be a wave of inquiries

182
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,879
All just

183
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,879
Routine description

184
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,639
Don't worry

185
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,320
It will definitely not delay you

186
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,559
Subsequent research and development

187
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,039
rest assured

188
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,519
OK Mr. An

189
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,799
I believe in you

190
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,240
OK that's it

191
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,679
goodbye

192
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
You said you

193
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,639
A new factory

194
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,639
All finished ribbon cutting

195
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,279
Our own home decoration

196
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,440
Drag and drag again and again

197
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,799
New Year's Day has passed

198
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:20,720
Still like this

199
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,399
I and Xiao Bubble

200
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,720
When will I move in

201
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,039
Tengda Factory is built quickly

202
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,840
That's because I have a bunch of shareholders

203
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Charge in the battle

204
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,879
Our home decoration

205
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,039
I can only rely on myself

206
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,240
You know nothing about this again

207
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,440
I can't

208
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,919
Marry a bunch of wives and go home to help

209
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,840
I think beautifully and a little wife

210
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,840
But I see our unit

211
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,480
Many colleagues decorate

212
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,919
All are included except building materials

213
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Just worry about feeding

214
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
How do you keep laying the wire

215
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,600
It's all done by yourself

216
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,240
You really don't understand.

217
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,759
You think these wires and pipes

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,360
Doesn't it matter if it is laid underground

219
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,399
Actually

220
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,240
Layout and installation of strong and weak current

221
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,000
Very impacting the actual living experience

222
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm an engineering student

223
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
I don't like their decoration team

224
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:09,919
Those things made

225
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,440
Wait for us to do a slow job

226
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,200
Make sure to pretend for you

227
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,679
Comfortable house

228
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,399
Don't say anything else

229
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,000
Every time I see you

230
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,320
When working with tools

231
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,679
I think you are very handsome

232
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,799
Extraordinary masculine

233
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,240
With those banks

234
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,320
People in the office building

235
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,399
Not the same at all

236
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,279
They looked at the greasy and floury

237
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,240
Then you're really looking for the wrong place

238
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,759
Just like me now

239
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,200
You go to the construction site

240
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,159
Grab one handful

241
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,639
no the same

242
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,759
You're not on the construction site

243
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,000
But with the temperament of a construction site

244
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,840
What is this called

245
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Do you understand the contrast

246
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,759
This is more attractive

247
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,600
More attractive

248
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,080
I found out that after you got married

249
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,759
Your ability to give me a ecstasy soup

250
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,600
Known

251
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,840
I'm just this style

252
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
Whatever you like

253
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,440
Just tell you

254
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,000
Anyway, I won't be like Carrie

255
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,639
If you have anything, you will be in your heart

256
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,960
Rely on her husband to guess

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,600
Each family has its own way of getting along

258
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,200
Hongming enjoys taking care of Jiali very much

259
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,600
Then what about me

260
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,000
Of course I like it more

261
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,960
My wife is like this

262
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,360
Order arrangements after the Spring Festival

263
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,679
Already coordinated

264
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,679
But yesterday there was a boss

265
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,558
Want to make a batch of motor shafts

266
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,840
But he only gave the parameter requirements

267
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,360
Want us to design

268
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,919
This thing

269
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,320
For other manufacturers

270
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,320
Maybe a bit difficult

271
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:42,759
But we take off

272
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,360
The database has been built long ago

273
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,759
You told the boss

274
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,200
Drawings can be released in one day

275
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,000
good

276
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:52,960
Wait a minute

277
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,759
Luo Qing

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,240
Tell the boss

279
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,559
The construction period after the Spring Festival is over

280
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,880
We can't handle the processing

281
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,118
but

282
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,799
We can still draw drawings

283
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,358
Drawing design time

284
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,039
You just say one month

285
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:18,279
Follow this time

286
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:19,240
Renegotiate the design price

287
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,039
Got it

288
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,759
Didn't say it just now

289
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,000
Can you draw the drawings in one day

290
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,359
Only three thousand dollars are given to design drawings

291
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,359
Now

292
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,200
Many people

293
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,440
Value of mental labor

294
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,799
No correct understanding

295
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,359
In their concept

296
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,359
If you can make pictures in one or two days

297
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,359
He even thinks it's high if the price is 3,000

298
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,160
Why

299
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,480
Let's make a picture quickly

300
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,119
Because we have an experimental database

301
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,440
But data acquisition and maintenance

302
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,240
Still confidential

303
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,599
All require huge investment

304
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,599
This principle

305
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,839
Can't they understand

306
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,160
In fact

307
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,240
Just can't

308
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,640
So instead of trying hard

309
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:02,640
Explain to them

310
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,279
It's better to be like Mr. Liu said

311
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,119
Tell them

312
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,039
This is a group of senior workers

313
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,359
Take a month

314
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,400
Designed drawings

315
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,720
That way they can believe

316
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,960
Buy it yourself worth it

317
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,720
I really hope one day

318
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,039
They can really understand

319
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,319
The value of knowledge accumulation

320
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,839
alright

321
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,400
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve

322
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,839
After this meeting

323
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,920
We'll have a formal holiday

324
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:24,839
It's holiday

325
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,799
The old rules

326
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,599
All the backbones must not lose contact

327
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,599
Keep your phone open at any time

328
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,200
no problem

329
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:30,960
well

330
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,839
A meeting

331
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,920
Happy New Year to everyone

332
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,319
Happy Spring Festival

333
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,400
Happy Spring Festival

334
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,720
Happy New Year

335
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,599
Thank you Sister Qian

336
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,200
Go home and have a good holiday

337
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,839
OK Goodbye Sister Qian

338
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,720
Goodbye Goodbye

339
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,119
Happy New Year Sister Qian

340
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,079
Happy New Year

341
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,000
Thank you Sister Qian

342
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,359
Goodbye Sister Qian

343
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,359
Happy New Year

344
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,240
Thank you Sister Qian

345
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,079
Xiao Zhou

346
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,920
Your home is from another place

347
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,160
I have to go back to work in the store on the fourth day of the New Year

348
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,200
You're fine

349
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,640
My boyfriend and I are here for the holiday

350
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,920
Not going home

351
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,000
Sister Qian, don't worry

352
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:06,960
As long as there are customers

353
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,119
Have business to complete

354
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,640
I'd like to come back to work early

355
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,440
OK Thank you

356
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,440
Goodbye Sister Qian

357
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,160
goodbye

358
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,119
Unlock

359
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,440
I want to check it out

360
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,759
sister

361
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,880
This is my work phone

362
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,640
You're not a confidentiality job

363
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,240
I can watch it even when working

364
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,319
Unlock it quickly

365
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,920
Or tell me the truth

366
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,599
You and that Shanghai woman

367
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,000
Haven't separated yet

368
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,519
It broke two years ago

369
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,160
Then I'll find another one again

370
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,880
I

371
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,640
Perhaps more than one Qian Hongming

372
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,119
How many do you have

373
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,839
sister

374
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,680
Don't be so angry, okay?

375
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,440
Jiali

376
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,640
My wife hasn't interrogated me like that

377
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,839
I was about to tell you your wife

378
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,039
Shen Jiali also has problems

379
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,480
The year-end settlement amount the day before yesterday does not match

380
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,200
We checked the accounts all night long

381
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,119
All night

382
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,920
Has she called you a phone number

383
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,920
Don't care where you are

384
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,319
Why don't you stay at night

385
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,519
I haven't been a wife for anyone

386
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
But I know

387
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,920
Normal couple relationship

388
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,839
It shouldn't be like this

389
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,599
You said you two are

390
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,880
A fickle person is irresponsible

391
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,400
A fireworks that are not in the world

392
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,079
Keep going for a long time

393
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,920
No matter how good the relationship is, it will turn bad

394
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,039
Qian Hongming

395
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,079
I'm really for

396
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,000
You and your children are worried

397
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,519
sister

398
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,319
I know you care about me

399
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,599
I promise you if it's good

400
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:31,200
There is absolutely nothing in Shanghai

401
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,039
there is none left

402
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,400
I don't believe it

403
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,799
Don't believe in your guarantee

404
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,559
Now I can only rely on Carrie himself

405
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
To change the status quo

406
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,720
work

407
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,839
Let me go to work in an agency

408
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,039
you do not know

409
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,759
Hongming and I are getting bigger and bigger

410
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,799
This is now every day

411
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,720
All have high cash in and out

412
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,200
Looking at me, I was scared

413
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,440
The cashier we invited

414
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,880
He's an outsider after all

415
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,078
I can't say if there is any problem

416
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,880
You're a family member

417
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,680
I want you to go to the company

418
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,240
Pay attention to the financial situation

419
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,039
No heavy life every day

420
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,200
Just need to be responsible

421
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,640
Especially suitable for you

422
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,359
But

423
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,680
But I haven't learned finance

424
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,319
sister

425
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,240
She really hasn't studied finance

426
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,319
Who is born to know about finance?

427
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,319
Ren Jiali

428
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,680
Graduated from a prestigious university

429
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,640
Good brain

430
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,119
Can't you understand the account?

431
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:32,839
yes

432
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,039
Jiali

433
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,400
You know your sister's temper, too

434
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,880
If it's not really difficult

435
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,200
Sister definitely won't

436
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:47,960
Please ask you

437
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,920
Sister, don't say this

438
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,039
We are all a family

439
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,480
How can I ask for it

440
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,160
That

441
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:11,640
OK

442
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,640
I'll listen to you

443
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,839
You trust me

444
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,079
I'll go and help

445
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,839
good

446
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,440
Then this matter will be settled

447
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,920
This cake smells delicious

448
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,279
It will definitely taste more delicious

449
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,599
You're not talking nonsense

450
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,200
Get up until ten o'clock

451
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,119
You're a dad

452
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,319
Don't set a good example either

453
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,799
Have finally had a vacation

454
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,039
Let's relax

455
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,440
hot

456
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,440
Who is it

457
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,319
Come here to pay New Year's greetings so early

458
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,240
I'll see the kids and you open the door

459
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:05,880
good

460
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,759
Happy New Year

461
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,160
Happy New Year

462
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,440
Come to greet the New Year alone

463
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,119
I

464
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Is Bingbing not here

465
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,680
She is taking care of the children upstairs

466
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,359
I'll tell her to go

467
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,400
No, no, no, no

468
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,319
I'll ask you for help

469
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,680
It's just right that she can't hear

470
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:29,519
Come on come on

471
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,440
I'd like to help me

472
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm about to be these two women in our family

473
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm so annoyed

474
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,240
What happened

475
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,799
You told me to advise Jiali not to go to work

476
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,799
She goes to work in your company

477
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,839
Isn't it pretty good

478
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
You and your sister are there

479
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,519
Who dares to let her be wronged

480
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,000
My sister wants Jiali to work as a cashier

481
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,559
If this is a normal company

482
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,400
That's fine

483
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,839
I'll open this agency

484
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,000
It's for absorbing cash flow

485
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,200
Carrie is timid

486
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,799
When I was trading futures before

487
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,400
She's always frightened

488
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,799
If I let her do this now

489
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,400
Manage such a huge amount of funds

490
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,319
She must be scared

491
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,440
Liu Jun

492
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,039
Carrie trusts you the most

493
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,599
Will we not have an appointment for dinner tomorrow

494
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Please help me stop it

495
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,920
But these

496
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,640
Your sister should know it clearly

497
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,839
Why did she let Jiali

498
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,480
Go to work

499
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,119
What kind of ability is my sister

500
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,359
She has been in this industry for so many years

501
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,519
Haven't seen anything

502
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,279
She certainly doesn't think this is

503
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
How serious and complicated it is

504
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,240
But Carrie is different

505
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,599
When she was at work

506
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,559
At most, just design

507
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,759
Don't deal with money very much

508
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,200
I said it was not suitable

509
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,799
Do you care?

510
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,759
If you don't care

511
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,920
After the New Year I will take Jiali

512
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,400
I've sent you to work in the R&D center

513
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,799
At least your environment is purer

514
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:06,480
you

515
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,960
Leave your wife to your brother to take care of

516
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,440
Listen to this absurd or not

517
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,440
No

518
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,559
Anyway

519
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,599
No matter what you say

520
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,160
When we meet tomorrow

521
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,680
Please advise me

522
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,559
Leave it to you

523
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,880
Don't tell Bingbing

524
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,839
It's not that I haven't finished speaking yet

525
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,359
After saying it, that's all

526
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,240
Then I haven't agreed yet

527
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,240
You've agreed

528
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,240
It's great to hold it in one hand

529
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,119
What sound

530
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,440
The diapers have been changed

531
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,240
The next task is gone

532
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,640
You've heard it all

533
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,839
As far as I can see

534
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,119
Qian Hongying pulled Shen Jiali to work

535
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,920
Not because

536
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,240
A shortage of personnel in the intermediary company

537
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,839
Why isn't it

538
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,000
Their company

539
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,079
More branches open

540
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,400
It was necessary

541
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,799
One of you takes care of the account

542
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,240
only

543
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,039
Hongming's company

544
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,319
Funding transactions are too complicated

545
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,720
It's not suitable for Carrie

546
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,039
I believe this

547
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,440
Carrie's personality is not suitable for managing money

548
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,880
But Qian Hongming is so nervous

549
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,720
There must be other reasons

550
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,440
What's the reason

551
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,319
What Qian Hongming wants to keep most now

552
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,160
What is it

553
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,279
It's Carrie's simple state

554
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,960
What if she goes out to work

555
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,079
Have gained knowledge

556
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,440
Then, like me

557
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,279
You can see through it at a glance

558
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,759
You guys' tricks

559
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,160
How can I live that day

560
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,240
What do you mean by this

561
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,519
You

562
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,880
You just don't want to

563
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,400
Thinking about Qian Hongming's failure

564
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,799
Even his own sister doesn't trust him

565
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,440
You still think

566
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,799
He has no women outside

567
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,039
I've asked Hongming

568
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,240
Hongming told me

569
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,240
His small apartment in Shanghai

570
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,599
It's for rent

571
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,720
But the tenant is a young girl

572
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,079
That's why these are rumored

573
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,839
Anyway, it has been like this since ancient times

574
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,599
Everyone loves to listen to pornographic news

575
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,839
Just deceive yourself

576
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,039
I'm too lazy to care about you

577
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,119
I've gone to have a meal

578
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,720
You look at her

579
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,920
Don't let her put it in her mouth

580
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,038
OK

581
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,599
Want to eat something

582
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,839
How about a try this one

583
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,440
sure

584
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:14,079
Do I order a fish

585
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,559
Don't be too spicy, we want one

586
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,039
OK

587
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,599
Thanks

588
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,359
What do you want

589
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,680
I want to eat pork and green onion buns

590
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,440
What do you want to order

591
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Have a fish

592
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,920
Have a fish

593
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,519
Less chili peppers

594
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,160
OK

595
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,920
Carrie Carrie

596
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,440
Is this OK to do it again

597
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,880
It's just right to have vegetables

598
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,960
OK, thanks

599
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,480
Little Taozi

600
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,799
What seafood do you want to eat

601
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,200
Let's take a look at what you want to eat

602
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,480
Do you want to eat pork ribs?

603
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,960
Enough meat dishes

604
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,640
I heard

605
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,279
After the Spring Festival

606
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,119
You're going to work in an agency

607
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,880
yes

608
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,400
No need

609
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,039
Hongming is more than enough to support his family alone

610
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,160
He doesn't want you to work too hard either

611
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,319
This is not a matter of hard work or not

612
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,119
My sister is facing difficulties now

613
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,480
If we stand by and watch

614
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,680
That's too unreasonable

615
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,119
She said too

616
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,519
Now I'm working in a company

617
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,200
Only use your own family financially

618
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,319
Almost all routine

619
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:08,599
Convention

620
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,559
Qian Hongying said

621
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,279
Yes

622
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,640
That's not necessarily

623
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,799
As long as the system is improved, supervision will be strengthened

624
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,839
External cashier

625
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,039
You can trust it too

626
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,720
For example, my company

627
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,240
Basically financial

628
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,559
All professionals hired

629
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,880
My dad never cared about it

630
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:26,200
This sister said it too

631
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,000
She said you're a big factory

632
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,440
Those hundreds of workers have strict processes

633
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,839
Unlike us, this is a small family workshop

634
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,680
Only rely on your own family to help

635
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:36,960
That's it

636
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,799
waiter

637
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
Give us a scrambled egg

638
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:40,960
OK

639
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:41,400
Thanks

640
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,240
Another scrambled egg

641
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,599
How about you two?

642
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,599
We've finished ordering

643
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,319
It's over

644
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,799
Then let's go find Aunt Bingbing

645
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,559
good

646
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,240
You guys are hungry

647
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,319
Let's take a look again

648
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,640
How is the ice point

649
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,839
how's it going

650
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,720
Your sister is a personal

651
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,079
Blocked the road

652
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,759
See if you want to eat

653
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,240
I can do anything you want to eat

654
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,759
How about a shrimp cake

655
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,079
Take care

656
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,440
Let's talk about it, let's talk about it.

657
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,200
no

658
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,079
You can

659
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,759
Stop playing, eat a few bites first

660
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,799
Drink some water

661
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,519
Why don't the hot dishes come yet

662
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,039
Don't just eat cold dishes

663
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,759
There are so many people in this holiday

664
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,680
If you're hungry

665
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:34,640
You eat my first

666
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,119
I haven't moved yet, eat

667
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,319
You don't eat it

668
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,079
I'm not hungry, you eat

669
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,240
Jiali

670
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,480
You know the cashier

671
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:05,039
What is it for

672
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,079
My sister said

673
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,640
I'll teach me after I go to work

674
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:18,599
Where is me

675
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,880
It's especially supportive of you going out to work

676
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,880
But the cashier's job

677
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,440
It's about listening to people's orders at any time

678
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,640
There are a bunch of trivial reimbursements

679
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,680
There is also a request for money

680
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,839
Have to keep following taxes and banks

681
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,759
Deal

682
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,640
I work in the bank I know

683
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,079
Those little girls at our counter

684
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,680
Arguing with the cashier every day

685
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,839
Will you quarrel

686
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,960
quarrel

687
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,079
There's still a fight

688
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,799
That's over

689
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,200
You won't be arguing

690
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,559
Then someone will be bullied to death

691
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,680
What do you see

692
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Hurry up and go to the food

693
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,799
Wait for a moment I'll urge me to urge

694
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,000
Why did it cause trouble for me

695
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,880
Just do your business

696
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,359
Don't think about it

697
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:32,960
OK OK OK

698
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,759
I'm not angry or angry

699
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,079
I won't say it, hang up first

700
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:43,119
That day was well said

701
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,920
A sudden change of mind today

702
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,359
I think there is someone else

703
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,680
Message nosy

704
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,839
Hongying, it's not me who said you

705
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,599
You brother and sister

706
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Very good person

707
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,599
A gentle personality

708
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,359
Just at home

709
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,960
Being so spoiled

710
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Actually she is

711
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,559
Can't stand any grievances

712
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,400
You're a choreography like a cashier

713
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,000
She can't do it at all

714
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,839
The same is about having hands and feet

715
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,519
She's not from a princess

716
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,960
How can I just adapt

717
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:21,880
None

718
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,240
I asked her to go out to meet people and things

719
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,720
Isn't it for her good?

720
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,279
Yes, yes, yes, for her good

721
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,440
But Hongying, you are already

722
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,039
Not my sister

723
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,960
You're a mother-in-law mentality

724
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,160
This doesn't work

725
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,000
you see me

726
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,440
You want to learn from me

727
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,240
What happened to Ajun and his wife

728
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:42,480
I never ask

729
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,759
Do you care less

730
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,960
A little bit

731
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,039
This size is OK

732
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,599
What about this

733
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,840
It is our current second phase of research and development

734
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,360
Results made

735
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,480
Everyone is an expert

736
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,480
This research and development is a blunt

737
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,679
Just burn money

738
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:03,400
Current investment funds for the second phase

739
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,360
Have used up

740
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,360
I can only find money for the time being

741
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,559
I hope the third phase of the payment

742
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,440
Can call one day earlier

743
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,280
High-tech R&D

744
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,639
What I fear most is that I don't want to meet the emperor

745
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,719
Once stopped

746
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,119
All previous efforts are abandoned

747
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,280
I believe everyone understands this

748
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:23,360
Especially

749
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:25,760
The person who went to Tengfei to check the account

750
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
You should be clearer in your heart

751
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:30,840
Come in

752
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,760
Mr. An and Mr. Liu arrived

753
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,119
Mr. An

754
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,239
President Liu

755
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,920
Twist you from afar

756
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,199
It's really a pity

757
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,400
Come on, sit down quickly

758
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,639
Come and pour tea

759
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,320
Come

760
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,360
It seems that this is a check

761
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,800
It really affects your work and life

762
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,559
but

763
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,719
What do you think

764
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:07,800
Since someone wants to know

765
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,519
We've spread out and made an explanation

766
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
It is also necessary

767
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,840
yes

768
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:14,719
And you

769
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,639
Just do it for me

770
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,440
I owe you personal favor

771
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,400
Mr. An, please don't be polite

772
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:25,320
We take off many new products

773
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,119
More patents and more tax refunds

774
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,679
The tax department often comes to check the accounts

775
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,119
We've developed a habit

776
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,239
And this check

777
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,639
It was originally the right of the investor.

778
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,760
I have no reason to refuse

779
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,760
Look at me and say

780
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,880
With you

781
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,400
Manage advanced company cooperation

782
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:44,559
Just worry-free

783
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,239
yes

784
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,199
Mr. An

785
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,840
I can provide the funds for the third phase first

786
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,800
But I still hope

787
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,000
You can implement it as soon as possible

788
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,559
It's now the equipment debugging stage

789
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,360
This machine is burning money when it is turned on

790
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,880
I'm really worried

791
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,039
Can't hold on for too long

792
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,639
Understand

793
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,599
overcome

794
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,079
Overcome

795
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,400
Come

796
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:23,679
Drink tea

797
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,760
I'm sorry to tell you

798
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,039
My business trip to Beiyuan

799
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:33,760
Failed to get back the third phase of investment

800
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,559
Long-term funding arrangements for the company

801
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:40,920
I'm afraid it's going to be because of this

802
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:41,920
Make corresponding adjustments

803
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,760
Beiyuan is just postponed

804
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,400
Or is it completely impossible to fulfill the contract

805
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,360
yes

806
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,400
When they finish the restructuring

807
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,960
Will the situation be better

808
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,199
Mr. An didn't say anything to death

809
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,119
But I don't think it's optimistic

810
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,079
If the restructuring is successful

811
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,800
The nature of the enterprise has changed

812
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,079
How many bosses are willing

813
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,440
Be willing to do research and development

814
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,880
Pay money in real time

815
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,599
So according to my estimate

816
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,360
Even in the most smooth situation

817
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,840
Mr. An will also give us discounts

818
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:20,039
Or change the investment method

819
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:21,880
Anyway

820
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,400
It's impossible to pay so readily

821
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,280
Mr. Liu has come to this day

822
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,280
Funds from R&D centers cannot be cut off

823
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,679
We just bit our teeth

824
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,519
Have to stick with it

825
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:39,639
Have to stick with it

826
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,599
Of course I want to stick with it

827
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,840
But Tengda's installation

828
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
It's about to be finished

829
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:47,440
New production capacity

830
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,920
It also requires liquidity

831
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,920
It is impossible to put all the cash flow

832
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,119
All hit the R&D center

833
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,000
That

834
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,320
Mr. Liu is right

835
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,519
We're opening a factory

836
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,519
The factory is not a research institute

837
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,079
Why expand production capacity

838
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,440
Isn't it just for a larger market

839
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,159
Is it better to make a profit?

840
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,559
Compared with R&D

841
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,880
Working capital in the workshop

842
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,159
That's essential

843
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,440
Losses every day

844
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:09,679
I understand you said this, but

845
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,360
Everyone is now shareholder

846
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:14,199
I'll hold this meeting today

847
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:15,920
It's for

848
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,480
Let everyone know more

849
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,760
The current situation of the company

850
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,360
Not to make everyone feel discouraged in advance

851
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:24,320
certainly

852
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,280
It's more difficult now

853
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,239
But I still say the same

854
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,960
There must be a road before the car arrives at the mountain

855
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:31,519
Let's work together

856
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,119
Difficulties solved one by one

857
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,159
OK

858
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:34,920
good

859
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:35,960
good

860
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,280
Market demand cannot be pre-stored in advance

861
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:32,759
Tengda's equipment

862
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,039
If you want to open the entire line

863
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,480
Production capacity will surge several times

864
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,639
So I'm going to go on a business trip tomorrow

865
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,280
Get back a few more orders

866
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,239
I have to feed the new workshop

867
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,360
Even my dad admits

868
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,440
You have sales talent

869
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,440
There is definitely no problem running the order

870
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm not worried about your order

871
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,039
What I worry about is the loan

872
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:54,480
I really hope the prospect of getting a loan

873
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,400
Also as optimistic as you are opening up the market

874
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,440
Who makes our manufacturing industry unpopular?

875
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,239
Want to get a loan legally and compliantly

876
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,599
It's really too difficult

877
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,320
Mr. Liu, I'm already very cautious

878
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,280
Using funds

879
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,880
Daily expenses of R&D centers

880
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,079
I've pressed and pressed

881
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,239
only

882
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,880
There have been four startup tests this month

883
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:25,079
It costs tens of thousands at a time

884
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,880
You know this

885
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:27,920
so

886
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,239
Enter

887
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:43,800
Mr. Sun

888
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,760
Director Xu

889
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,079
Didn't bother you

890
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,079
No, no

891
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,559
Please

892
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,360
Mr. Liu, take a look

893
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,199
Two hundred tons of imported steel

894
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:58,639
The contract must be fulfilled

895
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,440
The order needs to be completed.

896
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,800
Listed on this list

897
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,519
We produce it

898
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,599
Required raw materials

899
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,159
Can't save a penny

900
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:06,920
Unless it is

901
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,639
The company lowers the standards

902
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,360
That definitely won't work

903
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,599
Take-off's reputation is hard to come by

904
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,000
The standard cannot be lowered

905
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,320
The latest

906
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,199
When is the ordering period

907
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,039
Next Tuesday

908
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:29,000
good

909
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,880
Let me put the list first

910
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,679
Before next Tuesday

911
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,960
I'll definitely make the financial payment

912
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,280
Then I'll leave, you're busy

913
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:51,760
You're not

914
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,440
I wouldn't tell you if I had known

915
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,559
I'll be so angry that I can get a loan

916
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,360
I just can't figure it out

917
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,360
Why there is

918
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,199
Asset mortgage of equal amount

919
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,480
The money you lend from the bank is

920
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:07,639
It's several times taller than me

921
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:08,599
Why
