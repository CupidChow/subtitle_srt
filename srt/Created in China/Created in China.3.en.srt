1
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:49,799
Is it enough to just say thank you

2
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:50,799
What's the meaning

3
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,639
Be generous

4
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,559
Come

5
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,640
congratulations

6
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,920
Upgraded to become a dad

7
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,360
Let my son learn to play the piano in the future

8
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,599
Who is your son

9
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,400
His son and daughter let him learn to play the piano

10
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,360
To be honest

11
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
You want one more

12
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,079
Son or daughter

13
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,719
My daughter's little cotton jacket

14
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,719
Post to dad

15
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:43,920
Hello

16
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,279
This is for you from Table 9.

17
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,439
Someone else delivers wine

18
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,520
Not bad, I'm still earning alcohol

19
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,559
Do you know

20
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,479
Don't know

21
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,920
Executive Director Lin Chuan

22
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,400
Haisheng Group

23
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,120
Lin Yue's sister

24
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:13,800
Who is Lin Yue

25
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,680
You forgot

26
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,879
The one I told you before

27
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,319
The major shareholder of Shiyiji

28
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,959
This is his sister

29
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,400
I didn't show this moment

30
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,080
This wine is definitely not for me

31
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,560
Why don't you take this wine

32
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:28,919
Go thank you

33
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:30,560
I don't know me, I won't go

34
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:34,719
I'll go for you

35
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,599
Liu Junlai

36
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,520
Come here soon

37
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,279
Excuse me

38
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,279
I drove today and couldn't drink

39
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,039
Come

40
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:07,400
hello

41
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Neighbor

42
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,440
Hello Miss Lin

43
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,039
My name is Liu Jun

44
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,400
You've introduced it

45
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,000
This is my sister-in-law Xia Haiping

46
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:18,520
Hello, Mrs. Lin

47
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,679
Hello, sister-in-law

48
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,960
Just call me Sister Xia

49
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,119
Come and sit down

50
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,080
I'll do it

51
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:24,960
This is a coincidence. Miss Lin

52
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,520
Renovation workers in the neighborhood nearest

53
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:27,960
Drink and fight

54
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,640
I took a detour when I saw them

55
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,719
so

56
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,159
I saw it in the basement in the morning

57
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,640
The same clothes as me

58
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:36,520
Manager Qian

59
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,520
Your friend is so outstanding

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,039
Do you have a girlfriend

61
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:41,919
I'm really sorry

62
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:43,359
The lights were too dark just now and I didn't see clearly

63
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
He just returned from Germany

64
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,039
I don't know much about this either

65
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,320
Just played well

66
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,200
Thanks

67
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,359
Mr. Liu returned to China after studying

68
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,039
In Germany

69
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,000
There must be a lot of girls

70
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,039
I'm going to be sad

71
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Not many, either

72
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,679
My girlfriend is not sad either

73
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,440
I've been in the country for a year and then returned

74
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,440
Mr. Qian just introduced

75
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,520
Mr. Liu and our family are together

76
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,399
My dad does have a machine factory

77
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,440
But the scale is very small

78
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,359
There is no way at all

79
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,840
Compare with your city

80
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,080
Mr. Liu is polite

81
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:25,960
have no idea

82
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:27,960
Your most optimistic market

83
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:28,679
What is it

84
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,039
I'm considering

85
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,960
Stainless steel precision casting

86
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,880
This is a big international market

87
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,400
National policy for support for manufacturing

88
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,760
Also going to high precision

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,239
High-tech directional tilt

90
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,520
I believe it's like your city

91
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:43,599
Such a big manufacturer

92
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,640
I probably have studied this direction

93
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,119
yes

94
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,880
Have discussed it several times

95
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,159
The machine tool equipment of the city

96
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,359
The city is leading

97
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,479
Where is Liu Jun

98
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,039
Since I met this time

99
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:59,599
You'll try it later

100
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,520
When new products

101
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:01,440
What are you looking for

102
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,400
You can borrow equipment from Miss Lin

103
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,279
That would be great

104
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:07,840
It's just not

105
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,039
Somewhat trouble Miss Lin

106
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,760
No trouble

107
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,080
Is it troublesome

108
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:21,560
No trouble

109
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,039
Mr. Liu can come

110
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,960
Of course we welcome you warmly

111
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,320
You are a senior talent

112
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,239
Any technical issues

113
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,279
We can also discuss it together

114
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:33,080
Interconnection or not

115
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,679
Thank you wherever you are

116
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,200
All of this is said

117
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,039
Miss Lin

118
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,000
I can visit first

119
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,799
Is the city one machine?

120
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,919
What does my sister-in-law think

121
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,359
very good

122
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:28,520
Waited for a long time

123
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:29,919
No

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,159
Didn't disturb your mother's rest

125
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
She's already asleep

126
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,919
I originally wanted to go up and see her

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,039
I feel it's not suitable again

128
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,639
So let you get down

129
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,999
This is my friend

130
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,160
Bought from Shanghai

131
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
Thank you for your kindness

132
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,399
It's just that my mom is now

133
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,239
Can't eat these things anymore

134
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,999
Actually, I bought it for you

135
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,200
Have been taking care of the patients for so many years

136
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,040
Very consuming

137
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,759
I hope you can replenish your body

138
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,160
No other meaning

139
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,239
In fact, I would like to express my gratitude to you

140
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,840
Ajun likes that house very much

141
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,920
You told him that house

142
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:30,920
I bought it for you

143
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,119
No Of course no

144
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,239
Ajun and Hongming's attitude

145
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,200
I know very well

146
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,359
I don't want to cause trouble for you

147
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,319
Take it

148
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,519
Take it

149
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,280
It was very cold today

150
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,639
Go back quickly

151
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm leaving

152
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,639
Go back

153
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,080
mom

154
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,359
Have you not slept yet

155
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,239
Blind dates in China are really everywhere

156
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,719
As good as Miss Lin

157
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,879
Look at her sister-in-law who is anxious

158
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,080
Have made progress

159
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,160
First

160
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,320
It's obvious it's a blind date

161
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:11,800
second

162
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,840
Can see

163
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,359
Miss Lin is in excellent condition

164
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,399
I'm not stupid

165
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,479
If you're not stupid

166
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,040
Why don't you contact people more

167
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,800
You really have a girlfriend in Germany

168
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,119
No

169
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,840
I'm not looking for a partner when I'm back

170
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,800
And I'm staying in the country for a year

171
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,680
Just go back

172
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,200
What love am I in here

173
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,280
Exotic love

174
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,599
How cripple people

175
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,160
Too

176
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,119
The waiter settles the account

177
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,840
No. 9 bought it together

178
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,599
Hello sister

179
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,200
I'll go back soon

180
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,399
What's up

181
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,719
Me, my mother

182
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,479
This money should be enough

183
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:16,879
careful

184
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,560
Hiroaki

185
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,320
Do you want to run a red light

186
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:02,920
Need not

187
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Don't drive too fast

188
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,119
Mom has

189
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:15,080
already

190
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,399
mom

191
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,599
mom

192
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,719
Chief Executive Wang

193
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,680
Mr. Lin

194
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,719
Mr. Lin

195
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,239
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

196
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,519
Please come in quickly please come in quickly please come in

197
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,280
Please sit, please sit, please sit

198
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,200
You have something to ask me for

199
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,440
I want to ask

200
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,960
Are you in the factory in the afternoon

201
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:45,800
exist

202
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,680
I have no arrangements for going out in the afternoon

203
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,599
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK

204
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,040
That's how my wife arranged it

205
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Our Lin Chuan

206
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,440
Have a friend

207
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,119
Doctorate who returned from studying in Germany

208
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,200
He wants to come to our factory in the afternoon

209
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,200
Visit the equipment

210
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Then I think our factory

211
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,599
You are the most familiar

212
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:05,599
You take him around and around

213
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,479
How about it

214
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,200
That's all

215
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,519
That's all

216
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,920
OK I understand

217
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,119
OK OK OK OK OK OK

218
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,080
Thank you very much

219
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,040
Chief Executive Wang

220
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:26,960
Director Lin

221
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
Mr. Lin gave instructions

222
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,999
Say you have a friend

223
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,320
Come and visit in the afternoon

224
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Let me accompany you

225
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,639
Then after work in the afternoon

226
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,239
Waiting for goodbye in the factory

227
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:36,879
Chief Executive Wang

228
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,160
Brother, did you do it on purpose?

229
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,040
I said you did it on purpose

230
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
What a purpose

231
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,200
This Liu Jun came to visit

232
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,680
You can arrange a technician

233
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,519
You can lead the way

234
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,680
What are you doing

235
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,200
I have to arrange General Manager Wang

236
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,519
Let him do this

237
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,680
Can he be happy

238
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,079
You met Lao Wang

239
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,519
If Old Wang is unhappy, it will be right

240
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:10,759
Right

241
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,519
He loses his face if he is unhappy

242
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:13,959
Then your doctoral friend

243
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,520
What kind of cultivation

244
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:15,480
I'll see

245
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:17,959
Your sister-in-law told me

246
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,040
Say this is one

247
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,358
A rare and wonderful young man

248
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,159
We need to focus on the exam

249
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,520
Look at your brother today

250
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:24,679
All three pieces are worn

251
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:26,439
no way

252
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,760
Now this is gold-plated

253
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,959
It's too easy to fake your qualification resume

254
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,159
I have to let experts like Lao Wang

255
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,760
Discussion with him one by one

256
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:36,240
What do you know?

257
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,480
Walk around and be clear

258
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,679
Is it rare to have talent

259
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,359
Brother, please check on you

260
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,439
no

261
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,639
Where do you and your sister-in-law want to go?

262
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:48,320
Liu Jun came here to inspect the technology

263
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,720
Not a blind date

264
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,000
Someone said it clearly

265
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,840
Only one year in the country

266
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:55,959
That might be because

267
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,320
No one can keep him

268
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,359
Wait until he finishes visiting

269
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,359
You bring people here

270
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,280
I'll see you in person

271
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,159
This is OK

272
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,159
Your makeup today

273
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,720
What's wrong

274
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Good drawing

275
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Good day

276
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,159
Hello Mr. Liu

277
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,639
What's Mr. Liu and Miss Lin's

278
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,399
How awkward

279
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:15,959
Just call my name

280
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,119
Good Liu Jun

281
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,359
Return your money

282
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,040
How can this work

283
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:24,720
Last time I promised that I would treat you

284
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,280
rest assured

285
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,359
I've deducted all the expenses that should be deducted

286
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,879
But you keep too much

287
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,840
Even in Germany

288
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,040
You can't pay like this

289
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,959
You're afraid you don't know

290
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,480
The Germans only know what to do

291
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:36,359
Yeah

292
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,879
Then please come back next time

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,720
no problem

294
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,240
Today you take me to visit the factory

295
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,199
no

296
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:44,599
It's our Chief Executive Wang

297
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,720
How dare Chief Executive Wang work

298
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,639
Just find someone to lead the way

299
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,520
The city is so big

300
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:52,480
It's very tiring to walk around

301
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,760
Work arranged by Mr. Lin

302
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,119
Who dares to say he is tired

303
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:00,679
Where is our old workshop

304
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,720
Machines of all ages

305
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,879
There are hundreds of units in total

306
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,359
CNC workshop

307
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,959
It was renovated a few years ago

308
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:09,439
All imported Japanese equipment

309
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:10,720
Don't know Dr. Liu

310
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,439
Where do you want to start?

311
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
I'm here to learn

312
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,560
Just call me Xiaoliu

313
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,079
if you can

314
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,359
I want to check out the test equipment first

315
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,879
He is still an expert at this request

316
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,079
Let's go

317
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,199
It's okay Lin Chuan

318
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,800
You don't have to follow

319
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:33,679
I'll go by myself

320
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,159
I'll just accompany you if it's okay

321
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,000
Really no, really no

322
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,080
You are busy with yours

323
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,240
We've gone

324
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,439
Mr. Lin

325
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,639
It's four o'clock

326
00:21:59,159 --> 00:21:59,959
Your friend

327
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,159
When will it come

328
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,679
They visited the R&D center

329
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Old workshop

330
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,439
It should be in the CNC workshop now

331
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,639
Old Wang is willing

332
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,040
Take him to the CNC workshop

333
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,280
Then why are you here

334
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,240
You won't go with you

335
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,040
I'll go with me

336
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,480
They visited at the beginning

337
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,480
Mr. Liu persuaded me to give up

338
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,320
I can't be shameless

339
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:27,320
Follow it

340
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:31,919
This doctor is interesting

341
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,840
This doctor is really interesting

342
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,040
Your makeup

343
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,438
Obviously not as thick as morning

344
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,280
Go away

345
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,240
OK OK OK

346
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,320
Such a good CNC machine tool

347
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,359
It's the only one in the East China Sea

348
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,720
Why are they all idle

349
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:00,439
This CNC workshop

350
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,439
It was built by the Japanese

351
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,599
That core technology

352
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,800
It's all in their hands

353
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
After the Japanese engineers evacuated

354
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,040
There is no one in the factory

355
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:10,639
Can master the operation of the equipment

356
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,879
To restart

357
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,720
Must have to spend a lot of money

358
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,199
Request a Japanese engineer

359
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,439
Come here to debug

360
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Technical barriers

361
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:23,959
Shiyiji owns these imported equipment

362
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:26,280
Obtain high-tech enterprise certification

363
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:27,359
It's easy

364
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,000
But this is just the surface

365
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,679
What about the actual situation

366
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,480
What the bosses think

367
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,800
Not manufacturing at all

368
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,240
According to the city one machine

369
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,679
See the current product list

370
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,720
Not to mention these CNC devices in front of you

371
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,840
Even the factory is running

372
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:47,720
Those old equipment

373
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,760
Complete production is considered a waste of money

374
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,560
You are the chief engineer

375
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,280
Why not develop

376
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,439
What about higher-end products

377
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,159
I was reckless

378
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,560
Sorry Sorry

379
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,560
It doesn't matter

380
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,159
We're all engaged in technology

381
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,760
Who doesn't want to develop new products

382
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,040
In these few short years

383
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,599
The boss of the city's first machine

384
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:13,720
Just changed three times

385
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,800
Research and development of new products requires high investment

386
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Requires capital cost time cost

387
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,320
You're at the end

388
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:21,040
It may not be able to be successfully developed

389
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,959
In the eyes of those bosses

390
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,720
Some of them have higher profits

391
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,760
Other industries

392
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:27,679
Who would do this

393
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,760
Something that is not accurate

394
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,040
But the product has not been upgraded

395
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:35,520
For manufacturing

396
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,679
In terms of long-term development

397
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,800
It's really a huge hidden danger

398
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:43,599
The biggest hidden danger

399
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,439
I'm afraid it's not this yet

400
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:51,840
The biggest hidden danger

401
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,480
It should be a talent

402
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,040
Current income level in manufacturing

403
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,359
Can't keep it at all

404
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,840
Young technical talents

405
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,399
Especially in these years

406
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,560
I'm looking

407
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:03,959
A group of newcomers come in

408
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,320
Grow up with them

409
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,599
at last

410
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,280
But I had to change careers with them

411
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:10,359
Or sign the application for resignation

412
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,959
Our job

413
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,599
Different from the computer industry

414
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:23,040
There will be no sudden miracles

415
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,240
There is no cross-level jump

416
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:28,000
What is needed is long-term accumulation

417
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,480
You haven't had ten or eight years

418
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,599
No results will be produced

419
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,520
But now

420
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,320
Five years

421
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,159
At most five years

422
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,520
Everyone left

423
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:51,599
OK, then let's make an appointment with him

424
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,119
I have time this week

425
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,399
well

426
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,399
elder brother

427
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,720
Let's talk back and forth

428
00:25:58,919 --> 00:25:59,760
Dr. Liu

429
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:00,599
Hello Mr. Lin

430
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,320
This is a handsome guy

431
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,240
Young talented young talented

432
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,560
Thanks to Mr. Lin for agreeing to visit me

433
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,199
I really benefited a lot today

434
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,399
Don't be so humble

435
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,560
You are a doctor of overseas

436
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,760
You come here to visit

437
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,119
That's also our honor

438
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,080
Wherever

439
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,000
I heard I went to many places today

440
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:16,480
yes

441
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,679
We've figured out everything

442
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,199
There are still many things to learn

443
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,359
You are humble

444
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,119
This is my business card

445
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:28,159
Liu Jun

446
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,720
This name is very loud

447
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,119
You've calculated it with someone

448
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,119
good

449
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:36,240
This is almost time to get off work.

450
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:37,480
Or we will go to Haoyuan

451
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:38,679
I run a small restaurant

452
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Our regular meal

453
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:40,919
Sit down and eat while chatting

454
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,279
Then let's go

455
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,000
Thank you Mr. Lin for your kindness

456
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:45,480
but

457
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,639
Miss Lin also knows

458
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,599
I have a good friend

459
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,159
His mother passed away two days ago

460
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,159
I promised to see him today

461
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,520
If not another day

462
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,159
I'll treat Mr. Lin to dinner one day

463
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,520
It doesn't matter

464
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,639
Doctor Liu, you have something to do

465
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,639
Just do yours first

466
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,480
It's just this time I'm back

467
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,280
You stay for a little longer

468
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,760
Do we have opportunities

469
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:04,439
Yes or no

470
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,000
good

471
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,520
OK, that won't delay you

472
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:08,280
Come and welcome you again

473
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:08,919
Thank you Thank you

474
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,240
OK OK OK I won't give it to you

475
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:10,879
Goodbye

476
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,639
Go and do your business

477
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:12,520
goodbye

478
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:13,320
goodbye

479
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,919
Mr. Lin treats to dinner

480
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:18,240
Such a rare opportunity

481
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,199
Why don't you have friends

482
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,159
Another time

483
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:21,599
What opportunity

484
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,119
You come to the market for a while

485
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:24,599
Don't you want to cooperate with Mr. Lin?

486
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,280
Mr. Wang, you misunderstood

487
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
I'm really just here

488
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:30,480
Just visiting the equipment factory

489
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,119
Look around at the factories you travel with

490
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,520
It has always been a big hobby for me

491
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,199
Young and energetic

492
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,000
It's the own factory that has control

493
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
It's really enviable

494
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,560
Not very old

495
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,320
Not small

496
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,879
He really has a good friend's mother

497
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,959
Just passed away

498
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,560
Not looking for excuses with you

499
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,080
I believe this

500
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,240
that is

501
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,159
Haven't experienced the hammer of society

502
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Not very good at being a human being

503
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,720
sister

504
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,320
Could it be that we sold this old house

505
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,800
Sold

506
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,560
Where did you let me live

507
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,720
Of course I bought a new house.

508
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,679
Now you can

509
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:38,560
Don't need too much down payment

510
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,240
Don't bother me at this time

511
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,439
I'm not energetic

512
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Even my mom's funeral has been pushed to you

513
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,599
Don't want to worry about these troubles

514
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,760
You don't have to worry about these

515
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,159
I'll do it

516
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,320
Buying and selling houses is my business

517
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,760
When is your turn

518
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,040
When you are watching your mother

519
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,199
I just thought about it all night long

520
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:30,280
I think I must make money well in the future

521
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,959
Buy a big villa

522
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,840
Glorious everywhere

523
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,439
Furniture must be painted to be visible

524
00:29:42,438 --> 00:29:43,639
When you have time

525
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,399
You come with Jiali and her children here

526
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,520
Our family is healthy

527
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,439
Make life lively

528
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,080
Fireworks are everywhere

529
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:11,000
Just think about it

530
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,520
How can I afford a villa?

531
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:26,800
Depend on you

532
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,000
Fight for your breath

533
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:33,919
future

534
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,080
Let's buy a big house too

535
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:43,919
That way, my sister has time

536
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,240
You can also stay there for a few days

537
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,720
Will someday

538
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:56,240
I'll make a lot of money

539
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,199
Let you and Carrie live in a big villa

540
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,800
Let's all live the best

541
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,399
Fresh milk

542
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800
Some green vegetables

543
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:31,159
How many pounds of yellow croaker

544
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:35,919
Thanks

545
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,439
You're here to wait for me

546
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,399
I'll put down my stuff and come out to find you

547
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,280
OK

548
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,639
You were in the hospital that day

549
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,000
All homes have been arranged

550
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:15,439
Almost

551
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,800
To confirm the cemetery tomorrow

552
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,720
You can arrange a burial

553
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,480
My sister

554
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,720
When my sister was in middle school

555
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,919
Very good at studying

556
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,040
If it weren't for my mother's illness

557
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,119
She can also get into college smoothly

558
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,399
After graduation

559
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,399
Find a good job

560
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,959
Can pass now

561
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,520
A relaxed life

562
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:09,119
In theory

563
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,679
I shouldn't tell you this

564
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,240
I just hope you understand

565
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,080
Sometimes people are forced into trouble by money

566
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,159
Don't care about what face is

567
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,599
What is bone energy

568
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,399
Although I dare not say

569
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,040
Can fully understand

570
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,480
But I know

571
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,599
It's really not easy for you

572
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,439
Sorry

573
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,720
fine

574
00:33:58,599 --> 00:33:59,280
Say too much

575
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:02,639
Say too much

576
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:08,480
This afternoon

577
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,760
Miss Lin called me

578
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,599
Have some condolences

579
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:14,879
How are you there

580
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,320
Is it going well

581
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,760
Which CNC workshop in the first machine in the city

582
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,958
Really worthy of

583
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,320
Built in collaboration with the Japanese

584
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,478
Which workshop standard equipment configuration

585
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,120
Very good

586
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:32,679
It's really enviable

587
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,359
But what's the use of hardware alone

588
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,918
The bosses' consciousness still can't keep up

589
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,600
Can't keep talents at all

590
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,600
This is not just a problem with the city

591
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,239
The entire industry is now

592
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
All kinds of

593
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:50,159
Short-sighted behavior

594
00:34:51,518 --> 00:34:52,199
A huge

595
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,438
Mechanical Engineer Fault

596
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:54,320
Coming soon

597
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,958
Research and development capabilities of high-precision products

598
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:57,760
Can't keep up

599
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,879
The future of manufacturing

600
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,439
What should I do

601
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,840
We all

602
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,160
Is it just to rely on

603
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,999
Sell clothes and shoes

604
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,280
To maintain long-term development

605
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:17,879
Do you think those bosses are short-sighted

606
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,600
What about you

607
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,559
Your year-on-year appointment with your father

608
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,039
Isn't it a hug

609
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,160
What about the short-term psychology of leaving with just one shot

610
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,680
I'm different from them

611
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:40,600
Maybe

612
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,879
Behind every choice

613
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,120
Can find your own reasons

614
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,959
In your own industry

615
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:50,879
It's going with the flow

616
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,359
Still on the tide

617
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:55,999
Ten years later

618
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,240
Let's look back

619
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,240
It may determine our destiny

620
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:06,760
That's the choice in the past few years

621
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,039
Let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let

622
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,079
A few more

623
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,079
Eight more

624
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,479
Then you go down and stare

625
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:54,999
OK

626
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,280
dad

627
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,160
Remember to call them back

628
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,280
Help me raise this

629
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,640
What are you doing

630
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,879
I ordered a test equipment from Germany

631
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:09,999
This has just arrived in the first batch

632
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,160
Forgot to tell you

633
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,800
I've requisitioned this room

634
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,999
Do a lab

635
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,240
Then what you mean

636
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,399
There is a second and third batch later

637
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,600
I figured it out

638
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:26,720
Limited energy

639
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,280
It has to be put on the key

640
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,439
So

641
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,160
In the future, we will get a job score

642
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,280
What kind of sales are like

643
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:36,760
Arrange production and manage workers

644
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,559
Leave it to you to do

645
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,760
I specialize in technology

646
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,519
Product standards and R&D

647
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:43,200
Then what you said

648
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Process reform

649
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,919
I won't do anything about production discipline

650
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:47,999
Of course I have to do it

651
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,519
Just leave it to you

652
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:52,879
I admit

653
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,519
In dealing with workers

654
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,680
You're really good at it than me

655
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:58,039
If you are going to implement the reform

656
00:37:58,479 --> 00:37:59,680
The resistance will be smaller

657
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
Give up

658
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,879
It doesn't matter

659
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,160
Dad can teach you

660
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,879
I'll tell you

661
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:06,280
Deal with these old guys

662
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:07,600
I have something to do, I'll leave first

663
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:08,879
Please check it for me

664
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:09,800
Go away

665
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:10,879
This kid

666
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:16,680
How can I understand this?

667
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,720
This place is OK

668
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:20,879
The tea is very good

669
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,280
The environment is good too

670
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,399
Very quiet

671
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,519
You're free in the future

672
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,720
You can come and sit often

673
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,800
You can mention me when you come

674
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,519
20% off this face

675
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,359
There are still some

676
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,800
Give

677
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,039
Thanks

678
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:40,680
Taste

679
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,760
This product series you chose

680
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:48,039
Currently in the country

681
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,039
All have to be imported

682
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,879
Our city has tried it before

683
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,559
Meets size

684
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,600
It won't satisfy the intensity

685
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,959
Where can't pass the test level of the finished product?

686
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:02,359
Do you have the confidence to conquer

687
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:04,879
To be honest with you

688
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,359
I was abroad before

689
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:07,519
Have been exposed to this product

690
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,160
Basically certain

691
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,280
Materials and general processing steps

692
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,079
No quest from scratch

693
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:17,039
But you still need experimental data

694
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:18,320
These data

695
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,559
But there is no way to take advantage of it

696
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:22,280
You can only be honest

697
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,600
Test again and again

698
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:26,160
I understand what you said

699
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,039
This tea is really good

700
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,079
Not bad, right

701
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:33,999
Materials at different temperatures

702
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,559
Tensile compression after treatment

703
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
The reversed value

704
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,680
All need to be tested

705
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,919
Metal analysis must be carried out

706
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,599
Under simulated working environment

707
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,600
Test fatigue intensity

708
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,879
This project has a high return

709
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,280
You have this design ability, too

710
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,479
But the winning chance is great

711
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:53,559
The bet is high

712
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,439
You have such a huge development cost

713
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,959
Director Liu can agree

714
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,959
I haven't told him yet

715
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,280
But I have confidence in convince him

716
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:05,959
If it's really impossible to convince

717
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,879
I'm just a scoundrel

718
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,640
You You You

719
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
Don't be fooled by me

720
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:10,479
Dad

721
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:11,439
Too high funding

722
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,160
I can't afford it

723
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,680
Listen to me that I don't agree

724
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,600
Listen to me

725
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:15,680
I admit

726
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:17,478
Now the R&D costs are indeed a bit high

727
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:19,200
But something that others can't do

728
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,919
We can do

729
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,160
This is called the technical threshold

730
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,479
Only with thresholds can you be competitive

731
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,280
With this competitiveness

732
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,559
Only when our factory has long-term development

733
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,399
and profit guarantee

734
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:26,720
Don't report to me

735
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
Heat treatment tensile experiment

736
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Our factory does not have this condition

737
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,399
Goodbye, I'm leaving

738
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,559
I've already agreed with General Manager Wang

739
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:34,359
We can put some experiments

740
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,760
Put it on the city and do it

741
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,760
After your new product development is successful

742
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,640
you

743
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,760
You plan to produce and process

744
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,879
Hand over to the city

745
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,959
That's not necessarily

746
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,559
OEM

747
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,039
You have to consider the price

748
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,559
There are many technical factors

749
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,320
I'm now on my development

750
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:55,439
There are still several months left

751
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,320
I didn't think so long

752
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:57,680
You have to think about it

753
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,999
Don't you want such an important thing

754
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,840
You process the product

755
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:03,840
All handed over to someone else

756
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:04,879
I'll ask you A Jun

757
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,079
Whose product is

758
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,919
Is it still ours

759
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,160
Isn't that someone else's

760
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,999
Calculate it mine

761
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:10,240
How can I not count as mine

762
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:13,760
You're such a elm head

763
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:16,720
Your new product preliminary research

764
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:17,800
Post-OEM

765
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:19,760
All things

766
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,399
All done under someone's nose

767
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,879
All our data

768
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,160
Show it to others

769
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:24,879
yes

770
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:25,720
What is

771
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,600
Then he doesn't want to copy it, just copy it

772
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Who did we work for

773
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,800
Dad, are you thinking too much

774
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,240
How easy it is

775
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,840
Ajun, you really don't know

776
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:36,079
Those people's ability to imitate

777
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,079
By the way that

778
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:39,600
Uncle Pi, do you remember

779
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:40,519
Remember

780
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,279
Gear factory

781
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:44,120
I used to ask you to drink

782
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:45,720
I've been scolded several times

783
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:46,879
Don't mention it

784
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,320
Don't scold him, either

785
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,479
Now he has returned to his hometown

786
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,320
Planting peaches

787
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,359
Change career

788
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
What's the point of switching

789
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,720
He has been from Singapore a few years ago

790
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,240
Is there a set of equipment imported?

791
00:41:58,399 --> 00:41:59,999
Once the equipment failed

792
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,999
What about your Uncle Pi

793
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,359
Hurry up again

794
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,160
I found another OEM

795
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,800
Results all technical data

796
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,320
It spread soon

797
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:09,079
Leaked

798
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,680
Less than a week

799
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:12,200
The streets are full of him

800
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,079
Exactly the same gear

801
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,999
Dad, I'll tell you

802
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,919
I'll sign the contract to the OEM factory

803
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
If it's a breach of contract

804
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,559
They were punished to lose their fortunes

805
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,919
Uncle Pi signed it, too

806
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:21,720
He's not stupid

807
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,720
But it's useless

808
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:24,680
All bankrupt

809
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:25,439
Who's going to lose everything

810
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,399
Your Uncle Pi

811
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,399
How is that possible

812
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,479
How is it impossible

813
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:29,800
Once this matter happened

814
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:30,959
Your Uncle Pi is the first time

815
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,760
Report the case

816
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:32,959
The court also took on this case

817
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,039
But it's been two years

818
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,079
No judgment was made

819
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
You're doing this

820
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,559
I'll put my words here

821
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,439
I'll bet with you

822
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,240
Your finished product is offline today

823
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:41,240
Less than a month

824
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,959
The streets are full of imitations

825
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:43,959
Then what do you think you should do

826
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:45,879
Then as you say so

827
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,879
It's a dead end to our factory innovating independently

828
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,519
If you don't engage in independent innovation, you will definitely die

829
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:51,039
This way, shut down the factory

830
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,999
Go back to Germany

831
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,800
you

832
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:54,919
you

833
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,320
Where is Ajun

834
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,800
My heart is uncomfortable

835
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:01,519
No

836
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,760
120 Kombat 120

837
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:03,879
Can't get angry

838
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,200
Dad, I'll tell you serious things

839
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,359
Can you stop making trouble with me

840
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,519
120 is that fast

841
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,479
Who are you
