1
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,759
No, no

2
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,560
Don't want your research and development

3
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,719
Influenced by our side

4
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:49,200
My knowledge is a bit aging

5
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,799
But I know

6
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
The scientific attitude is rigorous

7
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,840
You follow your pace

8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,759
not give a damn about

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,519
One more month

10
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:00,879
Even one more quarter

11
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,400
Few people can do this like you, Mr. An

12
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,239
Really understand

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,759
The spirit of scientific research

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,240
With your words

15
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,280
Now I'll

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,919
I feel more confident

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,318
in addition

18
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,719
Report something to you too

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,560
you say

20
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:20,680
This first phase of the process

21
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,079
Didn't it go very smoothly

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,120
My engineer has started preparing

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
The second phase of work is here

24
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,478
at the same time

25
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,199
Two universities also participated

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,680
You see

27
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:36,439
Then I won't hide it from you

28
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,439
This second batch

29
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,719
Not all together yet

30
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:45,680
This situation is very complicated

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
Your last two million

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,918
I guess I'll have to wait

33
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,360
It will be settled this Thursday

34
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,400
Then you see you are here with me

35
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,240
Stay for a few more days or

36
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:57,719
Wait for the money to arrive

37
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll send you wires right away

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,000
Such a big city

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,319
I haven't visited much yet

40
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,520
Then I'm here

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,879
Stay two more days

42
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,400
OK

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,919
Mr. An

44
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,719
This year's support payment has been completed

45
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,079
Move over first

46
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,520
Give the second phase of the Tengfei

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,599
Get it together first

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,919
But Mr. An

49
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,159
We are this money

50
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,280
Donghai No. 1

51
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:27,000
It's important to our company

52
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,719
Determines our company

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,159
The direction of future production

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,598
The agreed investment cannot be cut off

55
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,759
good

56
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,360
Manager Zhu

57
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,079
Old Zhu

58
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,879
Mr. Liu, you are back

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,599
Ask Luo Qing to come and find me

60
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,079
good

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,360
Start layout

62
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:53,000
Donghai No. 1 segment market

63
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,039
But I didn't say it before

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,719
Products from this project

65
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,199
It will definitely be monopolized by Beiyuan Group

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,400
At least one to two years

67
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,400
yes

68
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,879
I thought so before

69
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,639
But this time

70
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,840
When the exchange of Beiyuan

71
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,000
I stayed for two more days

72
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,080
More in-depth contact

73
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,360
Their grassroots employees

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
I just found out

75
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,319
Before, we

76
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:13,400
Understanding of large state-owned enterprises

77
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,639
It's really incomplete

78
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,360
So we have to correct it

79
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,360
Our previous predictions

80
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,879
Has Mr. An changed his mind?

81
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,160
Not Mr. An

82
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,560
It's Kitahara Group

83
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,639
The status of the workers

84
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,879
They can't process it at all

85
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,199
This segmented product

86
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,040
The required accuracy

87
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,879
Where is Mr. Song

88
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,040
It will definitely not lower the standard

89
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,639
Once there is a problem with Kitahara

90
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,560
It's our chance to take off

91
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,240
I see

92
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,279
Then I'll make a plan now

93
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,000
Go

94
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:50,920
But Mr. Liu

95
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,079
Prerequisites for occupying the market

96
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,199
It must be successful in research and development

97
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,279
Kitahara Group

98
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,839
After all, it's also an investor

99
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,240
It's running so badly now

100
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,639
Take off for us

101
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,000
There will be negative effects, too

102
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,000
I've made the worst plan

103
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,279
If the funds in the third phase are not in place

104
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,800
It's up to us

105
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,519
Keep it up

106
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,399
OK no

107
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,120
I'm starving to death

108
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
It'll be fine soon

109
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,240
Come here Come here

110
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,639
Beef noodle is here

111
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:42,879
Be careful of hot

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,199
It looks so good

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,560
You are good at cooking now

114
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,759
Of course

115
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,959
You're now

116
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,560
One person wants to eat two people's meal

117
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,879
You're definitely not hungry

118
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,720
How about salty

119
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,680
tasty

120
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,639
Eat slowly

121
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,560
Some more fruits later

122
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,399
Look at that person is Lin Yue

123
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,759
It's really Lin Yue

124
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,519
The leaders of Shanxi came to inspect

125
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,759
Why is he with him

126
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,079
I know this

127
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,800
He borrowed a lot of money from our bank

128
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,839
Say he went to Shanxi to fry coal mines

129
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,680
He probably did a good job like this

130
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,720
What did you say about coal mines

131
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,720
His property

132
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,879
From upstream to downstream

133
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,360
Which one has something to do with the coal mine

134
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,600
Why did you suddenly think of it

135
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,519
Jump to this business

136
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,600
You're a scholar's head again

137
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,079
Every time the above issue a new policy

138
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,079
That's an opportunity in the market

139
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,600
Small coal mines were closed some time ago

140
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,279
We're all running out of electricity

141
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,920
The coal price will definitely rise rapidly

142
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,600
Lin Yue

143
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,120
Just a flexible head

144
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,000
Know to seize the opportunity

145
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,399
Involve capital operations

146
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,480
Capital Operation

147
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,720
You know he likes it very much

148
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Go to Macau to gamble

149
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,680
Coal Mining

150
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,600
It's the same nature as gambling

151
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Half a pound

152
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,319
Not serious

153
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,120
In your eyes

154
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,439
In addition to making net profits in real life

155
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
The rest are the last

156
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm telling it's true

157
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,639
Lin Yue is very gambler

158
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,199
Now his wife doesn't care.

159
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,519
I guess I've been crazier

160
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,759
I've also heard

161
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,480
On the one hand, he wants to give his children

162
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,560
Getting Education in the United States

163
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,120
On the one hand, he refused to give up his custody

164
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,560
Never divorced

165
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,319
His wife is also very miserable

166
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,240
Just dragged

167
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,360
You wait

168
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,439
Other people's gossip

169
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
You know so clearly

170
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Who told you

171
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,639
Lin Chuan

172
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,680
You've started guessing again

173
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,360
It must be something

174
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,199
Eat noodles quickly and wait for it to cool down

175
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,120
Don't want to eat

176
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,600
I'll tell you

177
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,879
Everyone told me

178
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,199
When a woman is pregnant

179
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Men are the most unhonest

180
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,759
Tell you to be careful

181
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,800
You have a lot of eyeliner around you

182
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,079
I have nothing

183
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,519
Watch it casually

184
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,120
You said you were pregnant

185
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,959
Is it a baby boy or a baby girl

186
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,600
If it's a boy

187
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,279
Definitely very strong hands-on ability

188
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,399
Then let him go to the factory with you

189
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,920
If it's a girl

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,240
Prepare abacus for her in advance

191
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,399
I'm so annoying to you

192
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,639
Ajun Ajun

193
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,960
You, what are you doing

194
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,919
What to see

195
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,399
How long has it been this time?

196
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,600
It's been two or two hours

197
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,559
More than just

198
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,279
Three hours

199
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,519
Are Cui Bingbing's family here?

200
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,120
In

201
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,320
I'm a family member

202
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,799
Congratulations on getting one thousand gold

203
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,919
Six pounds and seven ounces of production

204
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,200
Get ready to pick up the bed

205
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,080
It's good to give birth

206
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,080
Be safe for both mothers and children

207
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,039
Safety

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,639
Thank you

209
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,039
It's good to give birth

210
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
Dad is so good

211
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,879
OK OK OK OK OK

212
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,399
Didn't you say it just now

213
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,320
It's a boy and a girl

214
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:19,960
Didn't say it

215
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Go and ask

216
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,120
Just said, daughter

217
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,279
Girls are good girls are good

218
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,799
Girls are good girls are good

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,159
I'll call Qian Hongming

220
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Go and go and go and go to call

221
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,720
When Ajun's mother was alive

222
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,799
I just want a girl

223
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,600
Good girl

224
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,600
Good girl

225
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,279
Have eaten

226
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,120
I'm happy after eating

227
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,840
Breastfeeding is really not easy

228
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,720
All this big bowl of fish soup must be finished

229
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,840
No salt added

230
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,159
I just tasted it very fishy

231
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,559
Isn't it necessary?

232
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,600
It's so urging

233
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,720
If you don't have milk, drink milk powder

234
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,720
That won't work

235
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
The expert said

236
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,159
Breast milk is the best

237
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,799
As long as it can be urged

238
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,600
She still has to drink

239
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,919
Can't let the child down

240
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,159
I don't ask for anything else anyway

241
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,120
You just need to know my hard work

242
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,399
Just know that I feel sorry for me

243
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,960
Why do you cry as soon as you eat

244
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,919
Urinated

245
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,279
Mom, let me do it

246
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,639
Come on come on

247
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,519
No hurry

248
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,600
Come

249
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,320
OK OK OK OK OK

250
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,919
It'll be changed soon

251
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,639
Change it soon

252
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,960
Mr. Liu

253
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,120
Mr. Liu

254
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,600
Mr. Liu

255
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,600
Got asleep

256
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,799
You're here

257
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,240
Didn't sleep well last night

258
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,639
The child is making trouble

259
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,840
Don't mention it

260
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,440
You can sit down quickly

261
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,639
I'll get up and stretch for a while

262
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,919
My neck

263
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,000
What's the matter

264
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,919
Still that old question

265
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,240
Designed by the company

266
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,279
Of the fourteen products

267
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,279
There are two more

268
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,720
Imitation products appeared on the market

269
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,559
Although the imitation is rough

270
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,360
But it's still cheap

271
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,080
Taken away our two orders

272
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
This confidentiality system is so strict

273
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,240
Why can't the loophole be blocked

274
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,279
The devil is one foot taller

275
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,840
Some workers have a good memory

276
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Can put some data

277
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,240
It's slowly spread

278
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,200
And the engineer jumped to the job

279
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,919
Take away the technical ideas directly

280
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,879
Anyway

281
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,840
Various doors cannot be defended

282
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,600
We have strong R&D capabilities

283
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,840
Imitation cannot shake our foundation

284
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,080
But I'm always chasing me like this

285
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,440
It feels bad, no

286
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,200
Mr. Liu

287
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,759
I have one here

288
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,240
Ideas to solve problems

289
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,799
I'm afraid you'll finish reading it

290
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,039
Say I'm decaying

291
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,119
Come and see

292
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,399
How depraved are you

293
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,799
Come and see

294
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,240
How much did I fall into

295
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,399
This is a draft I wrote

296
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,639
You can see first

297
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,360
you mean

298
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,919
Establish a second-tier brand

299
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,320
right

300
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,879
This second-tier brand

301
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,399
We specifically use it for running volume

302
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,600
Put the mid-to-low-end market

303
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,639
Take it all

304
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:55,519
Over time

305
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,320
Those who imitate will understand

306
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,320
Technology to spend a lot of money to take off

307
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,639
Can't make any profit

308
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,360
This leaked loophole

309
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,639
Stop yourself without being blocked

310
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,919
Your logic is very similar

311
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,559
Automobile companies

312
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,919
It has various brands of different levels

313
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,440
Different pricing and different quality

314
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,480
What is used is

315
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,200
The invisible hands in the market

316
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,240
You have always emphasized that technology is the first

317
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,879
Adhere to the concept of high quality

318
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
My proposal

319
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,279
Do you think it's feasible

320
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,039
I think it's feasible

321
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,039
The focus of the R&D center now

322
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,320
All on Donghai No. 1

323
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,159
Not much new product development

324
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,080
Just fry the cold rice

325
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
Then I'll go back

326
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,399
Consider the specific details quickly

327
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,879
Then a meeting will be held in two days

328
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,480
See everyone's opinions

329
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,399
no problem

330
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,360
Go and do it

331
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,120
good

332
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,120
Mr. Liu

333
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,480
I'm a person who has been here

334
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,120
Understand your current state

335
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,600
Sleep on the table

336
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,559
Easy to bloat

337
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,559
Or I'm here

338
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,600
Add a set of sofas to you

339
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,480
No, no, no

340
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,399
I can't put it down either

341
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,600
You go and do it

342
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,120
Walked

343
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,000
This is a shower gel for children

344
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,080
And body lotion

345
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,879
Don't use it wrong, big and small

346
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,519
good

347
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,240
And this one

348
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,919
Specialty for babies

349
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,120
These are all pretty good in my opinion

350
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,440
But I can't buy it in Donghai

351
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,639
Have to buy it in Shanghai or Hong Kong

352
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,080
You're almost done with it and tell me

353
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,679
I'll let Hongming's friends bring it to you again

354
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,879
Thanks to you

355
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,240
I'll tell you

356
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,080
Don't think my mom is a doctor

357
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
But take your kids to buy things

358
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,519
Don't know anything

359
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm usually a careless person

360
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,679
Many things are not considered

361
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,080
Fortunately, you help me

362
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,120
I can't help much, either

363
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,600
I just gave birth to a baby earlier than you

364
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,039
Just more experience

365
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,159
This kid is very moist

366
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,879
Yeah

367
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,879
Try it

368
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,159
Little baby

369
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,919
Bubble

370
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
So cute

371
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,519
Look at her long hands and feet

372
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,559
Much like Liu Jun

373
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,440
Her weight

374
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,840
Even medium

375
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,440
All fat is growing on me

376
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,840
A woman has a baby

377
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,279
It's normal to be a little fat

378
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,960
Besides, you're so young

379
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,039
Recovered very quickly

380
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,879
I can't do it, I have to wear work clothes

381
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,519
You're going to work so soon

382
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,159
This definitely won't work

383
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,639
Ice Ice

384
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,360
Your decision is too willful

385
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,039
No one month's maternity leave

386
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,159
Just go to work

387
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,120
I think I'll have to take a break for at least three months

388
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,240
Bingbing

389
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,079
Can't the bank approve if you ask for a three-month vacation?

390
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,118
mom

391
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,960
This is not a question of whether to approve or not

392
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,720
You know, too

393
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,200
My position is like an ordinary position

394
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:12,960
It's different

395
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,559
I'll let it go for three months

396
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,358
There will definitely be ambitious colleagues

397
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,559
Snatched it to me directly

398
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,079
Wait for me to go back after the leave

399
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,920
Exile me to a marginal post

400
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,079
Then I might as well retreat to the end

401
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,559
Just be a housewife

402
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,640
That really won't work

403
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,598
Actually, being a housewife

404
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,880
Nothing

405
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,880
Could it be

406
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,279
Your bank job

407
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,598
More important than the baby's growth

408
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,720
Both of these matters

409
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,680
Why do you have to separate order?

410
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,160
dad

411
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,599
Work can really bring me

412
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,559
A great sense of self-confidence and a sense of accomplishment

413
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,000
Please understand me

414
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,319
Liu Jun

415
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,799
Such a big thing

416
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,400
You can tell me too

417
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,960
Bingbing's Choice

418
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,640
I definitely respect it

419
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,839
But the child is still breastfeeding

420
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,440
Even if I can help

421
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,640
Can't replace mother

422
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,039
Bingbing, you work on your side

423
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,039
Take care of children while

424
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,319
Wouldn't it be too hard to get busy

425
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,519
I've thought about this too

426
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:19,920
I'll see

427
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,119
There is a small apartment building next to the bank

428
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,920
I want to rent a small apartment inside

429
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,160
Anyway, my mom has retreated

430
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,240
When I go to work during the day

431
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,720
My mom can go over and the nanny

432
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,920
Take care of the children together

433
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:33,599
I'll come back for breastfeeding every two hours

434
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,279
Not it

435
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,000
That

436
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,880
If your mother doesn't want to go to the apartment

437
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,279
Help you see your baby

438
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,440
That's over

439
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,559
That's only a nanny

440
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,519
Take care of the children

441
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,799
That won't work

442
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,240
Where can a nanny be reliable

443
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,559
I have to stare

444
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,960
Yes

445
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,599
Actually, I think

446
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:58,359
A nanny can't take care of the children alone

447
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,759
Breakfast is ready to eat

448
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
I won't eat it, you can eat it

449
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,519
Can't get connected

450
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,000
I'll do it

451
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,160
Do you really support me in going to work?

452
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,119
Really support

453
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,920
It's really heartbreaking

454
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,359
If I were my mother

455
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,920
It's definitely not as good as you

456
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,160
alright

457
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:23,880
Thank you

458
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,599
I agree

459
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,200
The plan to set up a second-tier brand

460
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,759
Give an example

461
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:44,920
Past VCD (Video and Video)

462
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,480
That's expensive

463
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,480
Everyone has no money

464
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,960
They must have gone to watch the pirated version

465
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,039
No matter how blurry the image is, it can be tolerated

466
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:50,960
What happened later

467
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,039
It is copyrighted and used great power

468
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,160
Go and get this genuine

469
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,480
The price of audio and video discs has dropped

470
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,599
Everyone can see the authentic version

471
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,359
Not very expensive either

472
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,039
That's natural

473
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,279
All choose the genuine ones first

474
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,039
right

475
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,559
This is the market

476
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,880
Rather than letting them chase behind and suck blood

477
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,880
It's better to ourselves

478
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Be an authentic second-tier

479
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,160
But I think this second line

480
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,599
Cannot be established in

481
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,839
Tengfei's current factory area

482
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,559
You have to find another place to build it

483
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,200
Completely split

484
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,559
Avoid entering and exiting together

485
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,079
Confusing us

486
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,599
It was finally built

487
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,279
Product management concept

488
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,200
yes

489
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,640
These different qualities

490
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:24,599
Placed in different factories

491
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,559
It must be good

492
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,319
But we need to start a new factory

493
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,359
Must require substantial capital investment

494
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,640
Can the company squeeze out the money now?

495
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,119
Financial resources are certainly a problem

496
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,400
But look at Mr. Liu

497
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,839
I think it's for him

498
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,559
Energy is the biggest problem

499
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,119
Yes, Mr. Liu

500
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,920
Look at your dark circles now

501
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
When will you have energy

502
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Go and manage a new factory

503
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Based on my experience

504
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,160
Raising children is at least one year old

505
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,119
After weaning

506
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:49,799
Only then can it be easy

507
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,720
Absolutely impossible

508
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,440
Years of age are far from the end

509
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,559
Can crawl from children

510
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,720
Until kindergarten

511
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,680
This process is easy on what day

512
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,039
You know what you raise a child

513
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,799
But the R&D center's production

514
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
It's already reduced

515
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,880
Little Bubble called Uncle

516
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,359
Smiled

517
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,200
The child is so white

518
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,359
Who are you two

519
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,160
That must be icy

520
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,599
Surely can't follow me

521
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,039
How many pounds did this child have?

522
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,119
Six pounds and seven taels

523
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,680
After giving birth

524
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,920
So many things in the room

525
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,039
I think it's a humidifier again

526
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
It's a thermometer again

527
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,359
It's quite advanced

528
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,279
You've heard this

529
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,680
I just haven't raised a child

530
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,920
This is not advanced

531
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,079
This is the standard

532
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,200
Must pay attention

533
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,720
Air humidity balance

534
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,119
Otherwise she will cough easily

535
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:38,599
Learn a little

536
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:39,720
It will be used in the future

537
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,759
right

538
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,039
Can use it after learning something

539
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,160
Wait

540
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,880
Let's go downstairs to talk about it

541
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,200
Go down

542
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,079
good

543
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,839
Hurry up

544
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,599
Leaving baby

545
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,680
Let's go

546
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,279
I've heard a lot of rumors about you recently

547
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:02,680
Congratulations

548
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,039
The reputation of the world is getting higher and higher

549
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,920
It's all transferred from the bank to the law firm

550
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:09,920
Tell me

551
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,039
What tongue is chewing on me again

552
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,519
Say you're awesome

553
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,759
Go back to work unexpectedly

554
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,359
Make your male colleague who wants to replace you

555
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,680
Caught off guard

556
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,240
Change departments in less than two days

557
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,599
It's hard to win

558
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,400
No way to fight

559
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:34,279
When will you get married to Dongdong?

560
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,079
us

561
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,640
I don't mean to urge you

562
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,720
I'm just curious and want to ask

563
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,279
What’s wrong with you

564
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,599
You want to ask me

565
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,960
The secret to allocating energy

566
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,960
I'm asking about your dad's experience

567
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,119
Your Dongfu Group has a great family and a great business

568
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,279
How did Boss Lu get busy

569
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,200
Why do I feel like building a branch

570
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,279
Don't have that energy

571
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,079
This is when you go to school

572
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:12,880
Frankfurt

573
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,680
Come and have tea

574
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,680
Be careful

575
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,480
Actually, this is your problem

576
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,519
Very simple

577
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,079
The answer is just four words

578
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,480
Equity incentives

579
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,599
You want

580
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,839
My dad is not three heads and six arms.

581
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,119
That's a big stake

582
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
How can he care about it alone

583
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,000
So he thought of a solution

584
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,039
Put some of the main backbone of the company

585
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,079
Developed into a shareholder

586
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,880
A boss is too busy

587
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,880
Just a few shareholders are working together

588
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,440
Don't believe it

589
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,559
After this reform

590
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,119
The effect is indeed immediate

591
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,440
I remember going back one day

592
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,559
I'll get home

593
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,079
Suddenly I could see my dad at home

594
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,680
Force me to do my homework every day

595
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,279
My first girlfriend

596
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,160
Just blowing

597
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,440
Very pretty

598
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,319
But we are taking off and not going to the market

599
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,519
This is an equity incentive for not listing

600
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,319
Is there any difference between year-end dividends

601
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,880
They're not stupid

602
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
Anyway, Dong Qiyang didn't like it

603
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,079
Dong Qiyang

604
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,680
He's the life of working

605
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,880
My dad was in the stock market reform.

606
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,359
Didn't think about going public

607
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,279
That's been many years later

608
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,160
and

609
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,039
Does this person have equity?

610
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,839
The enthusiasm for working is completely different

611
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,480
You're like a donkey pulling a cart

612
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,559
You always tell it

613
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,359
Arrived at the end

614
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,640
I'll give you a carrot

615
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,119
That won't inspire it

616
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,880
You hang this carrot in front of it

617
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,119
Let it look at it while walking

618
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,039
That's how it can have

619
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,960
What about running forward

620
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:40,799
Yes or no

621
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,160
Makes sense

622
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,960
To Alice

623
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,119
Practiced as a kid

624
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,039
Come on come on

625
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,160
You're having trouble before marriage

626
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,680
It's because you pursue perfection

627
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,079
I really don't want to get married

628
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,680
But you two want

629
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:13,279
Only by unifying opinions

630
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,160
What do you think of

631
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,240
He still wants to get married

632
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,200
We both are because of this

633
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,599
Split one hand

634
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,200
When did it happen

635
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
You didn't tell me

636
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,680
Getting married or not is a matter of two people

637
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,200
I told you from the beginning

638
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,839
There is no need to discuss it

639
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,319
Let's talk about it

640
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,400
I'm not against all marriages either

641
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,640
You see, you get married very well

642
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,200
How good it is now

643
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,359
Don't be afraid of you making jokes when you say it

644
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,079
Actually, I'm Liu Jun

645
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,880
I'm a little worried about gains and losses

646
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,680
So just got married

647
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,119
Just anxious to have a child

648
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,480
Until pregnancy

649
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,200
I feel at ease

650
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,000
Do you think

651
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,640
Having a child

652
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,720
Only then has the proof of love

653
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,599
Maybe

654
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,480
Besides, I feel like there are bubbles

655
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,480
This home is complete

656
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,000
Then you think if I change this stock

657
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,279
It's more thorough

658
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,720
Directly introduce investment shareholders from outside

659
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,119
Do you think it's feasible

660
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,400
If I just follow the market

661
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,039
Maybe tell you it works

662
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,000
But I've participated

663
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,119
After group management

664
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,279
See too many

665
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,720
Investment channels with higher output

666
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,400
The idea is completely different

667
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,400
Not your house

668
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,000
How to pick the empty space on the second floor

669
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,000
This is the layout of the science and technology park

670
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,960
What are the double-headed layers

671
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,000
I don't understand either

672
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll continue

673
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,039
Capital profit-seeking

674
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,799
What I like most is to make quick money

675
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,319
Who has that patience

676
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,680
Invest in your slow

677
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,119
A thin manufacturing plant

678
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,160
Then your dad bought a market machine

679
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,240
Why

680
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,559
I advised him at that time.

681
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,359
I said you have that money

682
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,359
You buy a piece of land

683
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,640
Is it not good to wait for appreciation

684
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,279
You're really saying it

685
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,759
Now it's not just funds

686
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,000
Even the flow of talents

687
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,160
This is the direction

688
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,480
It seems that Tengfei's equity reform

689
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,079
Only for internal executives

690
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,440
You

691
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,039
Don't worry, either

692
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,680
I still have it there

693
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,039
Information templates during the stock reform

694
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,039
I'll bring it to you then

695
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,920
You make a reference

696
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,000
OK

697
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,079
Why did you suddenly become

698
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,000
So kind

699
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,640
Not what you said

700
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,599
Am I so good all the time

701
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,200
Reliable

702
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,000
that

703
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,240
By the way

704
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,599
By the way

705
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,000
I'll ask you something

706
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,000
Just you see

707
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:56,640
Your wife

708
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,039
With Chen Qifan

709
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,160
All types are quite similar

710
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:01,839
All of them

711
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,359
Be strong and independent

712
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,680
Focus on career

713
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,079
Yes

714
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,480
Then you say

715
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,160
Just like them

716
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
A particularly personalized woman

717
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,400
How did you catch up?

718
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,799
I may not have any experience with this

719
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,240
It seemed to be

720
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,200
I'm chasing me

721
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,119
Are you good, can you

722
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,519
You just pretend I didn't ask

723
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,319
I'll read it to everyone

724
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,799
List of new shareholders

725
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,359
Its corresponding shareholding

726
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,480
After equity adjustment

727
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,640
I hold 38% of the shares

728
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:48,880
Liushitang

729
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,480
That's my dad

730
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,160
Twenty-nine percent of the shares held

731
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,960
8% of Luo Qing

732
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,359
5% of Lao Zhu

733
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,759
The old saying is right

734
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,759
Everyone has high firewood

735
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,279
The startup speed of this Tengda project

736
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,920
It's much faster than it was back then

737
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,400
Isn't this your experience

738
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,400
Guide us to avoid many detours

739
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,640
The current social environment

740
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,680
Better getting better

741
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,000
Division of labor in the construction industry

742
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,240
More and more meticulous

743
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,759
Compared to that time in 1999

744
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:00,519
Hello

745
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,720
Hello, are you the boss of Tengfei?

746
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,839
yes

747
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,240
Who are you

748
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:06,960
Where is the boss' phone number

749
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:07,920
Can be opened directly

750
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,240
You're not a bag company

751
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,160
I don't know who you are

752
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,039
But if you are with my business

753
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:14,960
Have any questions

754
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,359
Please go to the local industrial and commercial bureau

755
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,240
Query and understand

756
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,200
What's wrong

757
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,720
I don't know where I called

758
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,480
Quite strange

759
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,559
This area code

760
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,240
Isn't it from Mr. An and the others?

761
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,519
Could it be the Kitahara Group

762
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,359
What happened

763
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,240
I heard

764
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,799
Beiyuan has some difficulties recently

765
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,160
If there is anything I need help

766
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,759
Mr. An, please say hello at any time

767
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:52,319
Company now

768
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,160
I did encounter some difficulties

769
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,359
But to solve the problem fundamentally

770
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:01,400
It's definitely not OK to rely on friends to help you

771
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,960
Didn't the ancients say

772
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,519
If you are poor, you will change

773
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,839
Must reform

774
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,480
This backward system

775
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,400
Only by truly getting out of the predicament

776
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,279
I'm working in this direction now

777
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,079
What you mean

778
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,119
Beiyuan needs to be restructured

779
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,279
Opinions from all parties are now being collected

780
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,680
Summary of the plan and report it to the market

781
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,599
Only by winning policies

782
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,200
Then this restructuring probably requires

783
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,359
How long has it been

784
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,039
Seize the day

785
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,039
What's wrong

786
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,440
The face is so ugly

787
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,599
What did Mr. An say?

788
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,599
I asked about local acquaintances in the afternoon

789
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:57,839
Talk about Beiyuan Factory

790
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,359
Now I can't even pay my salary

791
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,359
But I just called Mr. An

792
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,480
His tone sounds optimistic

793
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,440
Full of energy

794
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,079
He still insists

795
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,440
The company is not enough to hold on

796
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,240
It's really a bit abnormal

797
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,400
You're so rare

798
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
Mr. An's little thoughts

799
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,079
Is there anything difficult to guess

800
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,039
Reformed

801
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,759
How many state-owned small and medium-sized enterprises

802
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,920
That's all done

803
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,559
Do you want to listen to me

804
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Give you an example

805
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,160
Talk

806
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:32,960
I'm in the previous bank

807
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,759
There was a client at work

808
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,400
It is a state-owned pharmaceutical company

809
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,640
Losing for three consecutive years

810
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,960
Employees

811
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,960
All of them are already losing money

812
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,039
Half of the backbone have changed jobs

813
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,720
Looking at

814
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,359
When bankruptcy is about to come

815
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,279
Suddenly it started to reorganize

816
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,480
This is a trend-based

817
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,960
In line with the people's hearts

818
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,359
The same leader

819
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,400
The same group of managers

820
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,440
Just that year

821
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,880
Turn losses into profits

822
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,599
Do you understand what I mean

823
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,279
I understand

824
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,239
The so-called loss

825
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,639
Actually, it's someone

826
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,518
Deliberate devaluation of assets

827
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,119
Even transfer

828
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,199
Make the business a burden

829
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,639
Force the competent department to let go

830
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,760
I see

831
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,559
But this is all

832
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,360
Something happened several years ago

833
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,400
Since 2004

834
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,039
After the establishment of the local SASAC

835
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,280
There are very few things like this

836
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,039
At least it's much more hidden

837
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,719
Not so easy to make

838
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:34,880
But my dad was back then

839
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,079
When I took over the factory

840
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:38,320
That factory has indeed suffered a long loss

841
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,639
I didn't say anything about you

842
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,119
Why are you doing the right choice?

843
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,518
Feeling guilty

844
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,320
As you analyze it

845
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,760
I understand

846
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,079
Why Mr. An

847
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,518
Never urge the progress of R&D

848
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,199
Follow his plan

849
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,760
He must have wanted to wait

850
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,039
Results will be produced after the restructuring

851
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,159
That's fine

852
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,519
Pick a big peach directly

853
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,239
Probably the child is hungry

854
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,159
You rest

855
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,440
I'll feed

856
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,760
The bottle is in the disinfection cabinet

857
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,679
Hello Who are you looking for

858
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,760
Find your leader

859
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,320
Working Group

860
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,360
What work group

861
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,039
It is said to be a special audit team

862
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:50,320
Come and check

863
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,800
Donghai No. 1 segment project

864
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,400
R&D process and financial expenditure

865
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
A total of six people came

866
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,639
Three are from Kitahara Group

867
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,679
The other three are from government departments

868
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,078
People from the government

869
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:05,840
Mr. Liu

870
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,119
This investor comes to check the account

871
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,079
There was no problem originally

872
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,920
But you don't say hello or make an appointment

873
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:13,840
This attitude

874
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,599
I'm afraid the visitor is not good

875
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,199
fine

876
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,760
Our Take-Action Account

877
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
Always open and transparent

878
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,559
Nothing to hide

879
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,599
Let them check it out

880
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
OK, I'll arrange the reception

881
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,119
The user you call

882
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,519
Not available for the time being

883
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,840
Please dial later

884
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,639
sorry

885
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,440
The user you call

886
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,960
Not available for the time being

887
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,280
Hello, Mr. Wei

888
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,519
I'm Liu Jun

889
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:44,960
Mr. Liu

890
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,159
Hello Hello Hello

891
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,199
Today you're there

892
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,119
A working group came to check the accounts

893
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,840
I've arranged for someone to receive them

894
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,599
I want to report to Mr. An

895
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,800
Why can't his phone be reached?

896
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,079
Mr. An

897
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
He is not in the country

898
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,119
Mr. An went abroad

899
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
It's a business trip

900
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,400
That's him leading the team

901
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,599
Go abroad for an inspection

902
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,000
Have been walking for several days

903
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,440
Come back next Monday

904
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:13,880
so

905
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,719
Then I'll contact him when he comes back

906
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,639
OK OK OK

907
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,119
good

908
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,320
If something goes wrong with Kitahara

909
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,039
R&D funds cannot be reached

910
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,480
Will your progress be affected?

911
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:35,840
There will definitely be an impact

912
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,599
And not small

913
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,599
I can only find a way

914
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,880
Digestion step by step

915
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,440
Another question

916
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,119
It is production after the research and development is completed

917
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:46,920
what to do

918
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,079
According to the current situation

919
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,719
There may not be supply in Beiyuan

920
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,519
As long as the research and development can be successful

921
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,000
Production problems are easy to solve

922
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,519
If he doesn't work, please take it

923
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,639
It's natural

924
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:09,880
how

925
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,840
In addition to funding concerns

926
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,920
Any other questions

927
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,639
Between you and Mr. An

928
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,159
Have you ever had anything

929
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,360
It's hard to say about it

930
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,519
In this industry for so many years

931
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,760
No one can guarantee

932
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,079
I have a glass of water

933
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,320
Actually, I've been

934
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Needless to say more details

935
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,119
I can understand

936
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,039
Mr. Song

937
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,960
My dad is retired now

938
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,440
If the worst happens

939
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,760
My wife should be in the future

940
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,079
Both Luo Qing and

941
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,400
Please, Mr. Song, then

942
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,239
Help them

943
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,639
Without your support

944
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,639
Donghai No. 1

945
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,400
There is no way

946
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:16,840
Continue to research and development in Tengfei

947
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:17,960
Not to mention this for now

948
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,599
I'll just ask you one question

949
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,440
You did everything you could

950
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,559
Rather walk in the gray area

951
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,920
The research and development of Donghai No. 1 must also be carried out

952
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,480
What is the original intention

953
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,440
It is the pursuit of technology

954
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,239
To catch up with international leading level

955
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,119
fanaticism

956
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,119
certainly

957
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,840
There must be some personal selfish part

958
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,480
But much less than ordinary people

959
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,639
at this point

960
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,280
I know very well in my heart

961
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:51,320
Mr. Song

962
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:55,199
OK Don't be too stressed

963
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,800
If you have any problems, just face it

964
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,880
I know this

965
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,840
I'll also get it as soon as possible

966
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,079
The situation over there

967
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,000
thank you

968
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,039
Absolutely not

969
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,519
Your response is too negative

970
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,239
At this critical moment

971
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,320
Mr. An left the country

972
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,639
It's definitely not that simple

973
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,599
Reform of state-owned enterprises

974
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,199
What a big piece of cake

975
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,079
His opponents for profit

976
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:20,199
I'm sure I dare to use any means

977
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,159
Want me to say

978
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,920
You can't stay here passively

979
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,119
But Mr. Song said

980
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,760
But what is Mr. Song’s status

981
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,440
This is in his eyes

982
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,559
What can it be considered

983
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:34,280
Can you be the same as him

984
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,880
As cool as him

985
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:36,920
So don't care

986
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,360
But I feel bad

987
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,679
How many pitfalls did I step on after returning home

988
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,000
How much effort did I do

989
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,159
I just want to do the right thing

990
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,039
Take the right path

991
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,119
But now

992
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,079
I'm going to walk myself as I walk

993
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,519
Going into a fugitive

994
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,559
I can understand your mood

995
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,559
But this world

996
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,199
Not so clear in itself

997
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,119
Black and white

998
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,159
You can only open your heart

999
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,320
Try to adapt to it

1000
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,280
Instead of confrontation

1001
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,320
to be honest

1002
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:27,400
No matter how tired or hard work is, I'm not afraid

1003
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:30,360
But this thing

1004
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,280
It made me feel particularly frustrated

1005
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,559
I can't breathe

1006
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,960
I need to vent

1007
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:40,159
I have to find some bad things to do

1008
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:43,320
Look at your good face

1009
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,760
Pornography, gambling, drugs

1010
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,639
What would you do

1011
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:54,840
alright

1012
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,199
You go out for a walk

1013
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,000
Let yourself take a vacation
