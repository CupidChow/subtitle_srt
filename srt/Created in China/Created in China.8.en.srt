00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:50,960
Comrades

2
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,199
Is there anything wrong

3
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,158
Comrades

4
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,079
Hello Hello Hello

5
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,520
We are from Pengtang Hope Primary School

6
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,479
Our car is broken here

7
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,320
Can't go down the mountain

8
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,079
Can you help

9
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,480
Go to the foot of the mountain to make a phone call

10
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,439
I have a cell phone

11
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,840
Very good

12
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,640
Sorry, maybe it's out of power

13
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,840
Then that

14
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,999
I know a little bit about auto repair

15
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,719
I'll take a look at the car for you

16
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,439
Very good Thank you

17
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,759
Hello Uncle

18
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,439
Hello you

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,039
I'll take a look

20
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,559
Nothing big on taxation

21
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,120
But since

22
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,400
They have notified us to check the accounts

23
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:44,640
Cooperate

24
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,159
You bring some recent vouchers

25
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,319
Go to the inspection department on Monday

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,800
Touch them

27
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,999
Must be good at attitude

28
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,719
I know the factory director

29
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,360
Bring the door for me

30
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
The user you call

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,759
Not available for the time being

32
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,159
Please dial later

33
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,120
What's wrong

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,120
The principal said you two o'clock

35
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
It should go back

36
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,159
I'm afraid something will happen to you

37
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,240
Very anxious

38
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,478
Our car has a malfunction

39
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,559
I've been waiting for more than an hour

40
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,400
I just met this helping comrade

41
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,319
You try

42
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,840
OK I'll give it a try

43
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,439
Alright, let's play

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,439
Thank you Thank you

45
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,719
Thank you very much

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,960
You see, you're soaked

47
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,999
You've got some oil

48
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,840
Why don't you go to school to wash first

49
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,800
Very close

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,759
My car parked at the foot of the mountain

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,200
I'll just wash it home

52
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,079
You go down

53
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,360
It takes an hour

54
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,200
It's easy to get sick if you're wet

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,479
Let's change your clothes first

56
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,999
I'll take you to drive later

57
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,920
You are

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,640
I'm a volunteer at Hope Primary School

59
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,840
My surname is Liang

60
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:28,760
uncle

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,319
Is this for me by the kid?

62
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,479
yes

63
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Have you taken the medicine?

64
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,279
Thank you Sister Liang

65
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,560
fine

66
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:40,840
Sister Liang often comes here

67
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,760
Be a volunteer

68
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,320
How many times a month

69
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,119
to be honest

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,320
Sometimes I come here

71
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,000
Not just helping others

72
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,960
It is the one who benefits from the heart that you

73
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,479
I understand

74
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Just like me today

75
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:05,000
I was very depressed

76
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,200
But it was raining coldly

77
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,679
Take a hot shower

78
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,400
Stay with the kids for a while

79
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,520
I feel much better

80
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,080
I should be like you in the future

81
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,719
Volunteers often come to Dangdang

82
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,799
Welcome at any time

83
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,640
Ah Jun

84
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,320
Don't think so much

85
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,719
Don't be sad

86
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,080
One mistake brings wisdom

87
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,960
It's a good thing, right

88
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
Let's stay away from the market in the future

89
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,320
The farther the better

90
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:46,279
Let's keep all the good things by ourselves

91
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,440
Don't let him know

92
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,159
How did you say that sentence

93
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,520
Have treasures at home and attract thieves to remember

94
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,520
Right

95
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,520
dad

96
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,440
When I was in college

97
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:57,960
That Professor Wu

98
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,560
Do you still remember

99
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,159
I remember

100
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,000
You study abroad

101
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,039
It's just someone recommended

102
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:02,919
I want to take a vacation

103
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,440
Go back to his alma mater to see him

104
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,359
You should have gone to see someone long ago

105
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Deep kindness of the teacher

106
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
Daddy will give you

107
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:10,440
Prepare some gifts

108
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,440
Look at others

109
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,560
besides

110
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
You see, during your school days

111
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,000
So many girlfriends

112
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,679
dad

113
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,840
Contact you

114
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,440
Uncle Pi, who opened the gear factory

115
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,599
Aren't you planting peaches?

116
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,400
Don't break

117
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Everyone is grandpa

118
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:27,039
He's two years younger than me

119
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,560
Answered the phone

120
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
This kid

121
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,119
Hello

122
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:34,960
Hello Mr. Liu

123
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
I am Yu Shanshan

124
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,520
do you remember me

125
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,719
Miss Yu

126
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,719
Of course I remember

127
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,080
What's wrong

128
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,200
Mr. Liu

129
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I have one in my hand

130
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,479
Something that is very important to you

131
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,960
We'd better meet

132
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,039
Now

133
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:52,000
yes

134
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,960
As a reward

135
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,440
You have to treat me to a meal

136
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,400
OK, what do you want to eat

137
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,119
Come to eat at home and eat ready-made

138
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,039
Sorry, you say it again

139
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,320
Invite

140
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Drink before the guests arrive

141
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,599
Improper

142
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,879
My courtesy is

143
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,559
Order food after the guests arrive

144
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,999
waiter

145
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,159
Here comes

146
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,840
The old rules are three meats and one vegetarian

147
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,920
OK wait

148
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,040
Do you drink alcohol

149
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
It seems to be coming often

150
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,160
One of the four dirty little things in this city

151
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,999
Notoriously dirty

152
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,160
It's also famously delicious

153
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,759
Where is me

154
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,440
It's also a well-known regular customer in this store

155
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:03,920
Talk about the truth

156
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,239
The city has just negotiated two foreign businessmen

157
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,040
Have visited the factory

158
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,280
Basically sure

159
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,239
Will buy in large quantities

160
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Products you design

161
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,160
That's it

162
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,599
You take it back

163
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,239
Don't cause trouble for yourself

164
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,879
You don't have to doubt that I have bad motives

165
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:38,879
Since I've done this

166
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,320
Betrayal of the company

167
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,999
Of course I plan to leave

168
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,519
You're quitting

169
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,719
But not now

170
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,999
I have to work in the city for a year

171
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,239
Only then can you leave your household registration

172
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,560
But it's not long

173
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,359
You resigned and me

174
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,040
It doesn't matter

175
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,040
Of course not

176
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,399
I'm an engineering student

177
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,519
Originally, I applied for the R&D center

178
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,280
But you know the result, too

179
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,639
Just be a vase in the import and export department

180
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,239
If it weren't for the household registration

181
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,719
I've resigned long ago

182
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,719
You've been cheated this time

183
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,639
There are many righteous colleagues in the city

184
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,879
All of you are unfair

185
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,920
So we all hope to help you

186
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,479
Don't let Lin Yue succeed

187
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,719
Yeah

188
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,479
Why haven't I heard it before

189
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,920
What about this call for justice

190
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,119
This voice of justice

191
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,440
It makes no sense to me

192
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,040
Do you really want it

193
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,519
You're not going to think of a solution

194
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,999
Do you prevent foreign purchases?

195
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,160
Lin Yue has won now

196
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,280
Sorry, I'm going to let you down

197
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,280
I originally thought

198
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,680
You're different from them

199
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,160
I think you still have some blood

200
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,599
I didn't expect to be so conscious of the current situation

201
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,800
Know how to advance and retreat

202
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:22,960
OK, I'm stupid

203
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,759
I misread the person

204
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,599
Is that your Boss Lin’s car?

205
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,080
Read it wrong

206
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,440
That's not you

207
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,519
Boss Lin’s license plate number

208
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,119
Liu Jun, you bite Lu Dongbin

209
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,160
That's right

210
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:42,920
My file is still in his place

211
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:43,960
Of course I'm afraid

212
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,440
Are you afraid

213
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,080
You're not afraid

214
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:46,960
Why did you make trouble yourself

215
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,680
Let your dad be scolded

216
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:49,879
etc.

217
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,239
My dad went to find Lin Yue

218
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,599
You said Liu Jun encountered this kind of thing

219
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,560
It really makes people angry

220
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,519
Can you just bear it

221
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
What to do if you can't bear it

222
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,599
But you said it

223
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,399
Liu Jun is not the same

224
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,680
A person who admits defeat easily

225
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,879
A person denies defeat

226
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,999
Whether he can accept it

227
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,399
The price of not giving up

228
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,160
Liu Jun is not stupid

229
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,999
He can understand the benefits and consequences of this

230
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,840
If this experience

231
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,719
Can help him learn to surrender

232
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,599
It's also a kind of growth

233
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Not a bad thing

234
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,040
Little Taozi

235
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,680
Uncle Liu Jun

236
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
When will you grow up

237
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,160
You ask first

238
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:42,879
When will the little peach grow up?

239
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
She is growing faster than Liu Jun

240
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,359
Is that a little Taozi

241
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:57,840
Our company colleagues

242
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,119
Many rent rooms here

243
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,920
This is quite close to my home.

244
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:10,200
How many floors do you live in

245
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,560
Third floor

246
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,399
Then I'll wait for you to go up and I'll leave

247
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,160
good

248
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,160
Miss Yu

249
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,999
Thank you for trusting me

250
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,519
Would like to tell me this

251
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,479
It's not that I trust you

252
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,560
It's you who are trustworthy

253
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,440
how

254
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,560
These shops are still to be sold

255
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,160
This time, because of the account check

256
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,239
The factory paid a large amount of taxes

257
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,719
Money-in-transferable cash

258
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,879
Too few

259
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,560
Don't sell these properties

260
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,840
The factory really can't move

261
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,960
If you think clearly

262
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,680
I'll try my best

263
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,119
Find the best buyer for you

264
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Think clearly

265
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:38,560
Thank you

266
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,759
Hirohide

267
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,759
You said I'm in my heart

268
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,440
It's a little unsure

269
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,479
I always feel that Ajun manages the factory

270
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,639
This method

271
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,719
It's too radical

272
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,560
He thinks it's right

273
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,719
I think there is a problem

274
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,999
I think it's right

275
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,160
He doesn't accept it

276
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,719
In our mind

277
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,119
This gap is quite big

278
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,800
Do you think I am

279
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,239
This is behind

280
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,239
You're not behind

281
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,479
At that time

282
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,840
Different from now

283
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,440
At that time, we must take steady steps

284
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:18,840
Only then can you accomplish something

285
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,719
Liu Jun

286
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,560
Although sometimes it's impulsive to do things

287
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,519
but

288
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,280
As a bystander, I think

289
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:28,639
Many of his thoughts are correct

290
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,080
Otherwise, you wouldn't have fought your old job

291
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,639
Support him, right?

292
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,639
Your vision has always been very accurate

293
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:35,960
I'll listen to you

294
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,160
Or this one

295
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,359
I won't sell it now

296
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,239
It sounds nice to you

297
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,519
To strengthen canteen management

298
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,359
Improve the service level of canteen

299
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,160
From July 1

300
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:56,719
School cafeteria will stop using meal tickets

301
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,719
All use meal cards to eat

302
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,920
Used with meal cards

303
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,320
Contactless IC card technology manufacturing

304
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,479
This is all designed by you independently

305
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,479
yes

306
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,639
All have registered patents

307
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,560
I've brought so many students

308
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,519
Everyone says I prefer you the most

309
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:20,919
Look at this

310
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,080
I prefer it

311
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,599
It's still quite reasonable

312
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,200
teacher

313
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,320
You have many students all over the world

314
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,920
There are also many connections in this field

315
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,519
Can you give it to me

316
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,800
How many manufacturers are introduced

317
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,879
how

318
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,160
Difficulties in production

319
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,119
I want to use this set of drawings and techniques

320
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,999
Sell

321
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,639
The asking price is not too expensive

322
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,800
Each company can give one

323
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,519
Just 50,000 to 100,000

324
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,320
Such a low price

325
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,119
You're selling it at a low price

326
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,519
You're short of money

327
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,639
No

328
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,800
I just want to

329
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,160
Put these technologies

330
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,759
Convert to production as soon as possible

331
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,959
OK

332
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,119
You sold A01

333
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,159
This is the end of the

334
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,639
The surplus after travel expenses

335
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,639
It should be able to fill

336
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,280
The deficit caused by previous research and development

337
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,240
If it weren't for this Lin Yue

338
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,679
You're definitely reluctant to sell

339
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,000
Don't worry, dad

340
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,320
I don't feel sorry for it at all

341
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,879
These low-selling techniques

342
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,520
It will be mass-produced soon

343
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,800
Product price

344
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,280
Definitely lower than the first-machine in the city

345
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,000
Lin Yue is not

346
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,199
Want to rely on plagiarism technology

347
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,280
Make a fortune

348
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,599
He will know in two months

349
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,800
What is real price competition

350
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:41,720
yes

351
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,800
You sell your own technology

352
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,280
Lin Yue just got it

353
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,599
Can't say anything

354
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,800
Ah Jun

355
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,119
Nothing else can be done

356
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:57,840
Stop when you are ready

357
00:18:58,959 --> 00:18:59,760
Do you understand

358
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:03,679
I know

359
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:21,840
Repricing

360
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,599
My product is coming off the line soon

361
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,919
He called and wanted to ruin the appointment

362
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,240
Mr. Lin

363
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,240
This product bid

364
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,280
It's really too intense

365
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,919
Actually, it's not just this one

366
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,480
Almost all domestic trade

367
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:37,679
All are going to ruin the contract

368
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,840
This one is kind

369
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,959
Some don't even call one

370
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,320
Wait for the goods to be delivered

371
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,040
It's said that the quality is not up to standard

372
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,320
Refusing to inspect

373
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,359
Nonsense

374
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,840
That nonsense

375
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,399
Out of the same workshop

376
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:52,720
Liu Jun and the others can pass

377
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,199
Why can't ours

378
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,040
Mr. Lin

379
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,199
actually

380
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,639
The delivery guy has also quarreled with them

381
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,399
But they checked it on site

382
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,639
That pass rate is a bit sloppy

383
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,280
People just seize this excuse

384
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,639
OK OK OK OK Price reduction

385
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,199
Price reduction

386
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,439
You didn't catch this time difference

387
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,000
You can't do it now

388
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,598
Fortunately, we have a few more

389
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,520
Foreign trade order

390
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:19,599
Two are right

391
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,599
yes

392
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,199
Their play styles are different

393
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,439
Will not break the contract

394
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,119
But there is only one requirement

395
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,480
High product quality requirements

396
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,679
Can you do me a favor?

397
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,320
You give me this production workshop

398
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,280
Keep a close eye

399
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:37,199
Don't show up any more

400
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,959
Any little problem

401
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:39,919
OK

402
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,199
It's Mr. Lin

403
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,280
Please go and do your business. Two of you

404
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,439
Brother Qian

405
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
Are you so tired

406
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,320
Of course I'm tired

407
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,599
The company's business volume is getting bigger and bigger

408
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,080
I've been doing it every day

409
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,280
There is no quiet time

410
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:44,119
Carrie has already

411
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,439
Take care of children at home full time

412
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,480
You still complain

413
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,359
I heard you have made great achievements

414
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,119
Beautiful work

415
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,119
Internal message

416
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,480
Lin Yue has eaten recently

417
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,959
Several boring losses

418
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:00,359
There is really yours

419
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:02,720
I'm all damn

420
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,879
Teachers and classmates from alma mater

421
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,599
Don't say it

422
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,879
The relationship between alumni

423
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,959
It's really amazing

424
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,040
Many people I've never seen before

425
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,040
Just Professor Wu introduce it

426
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,000
These people will

427
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,159
Help sincerely

428
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:16,560
I really didn't expect

429
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,320
Of course

430
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,199
Otherwise, say

431
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,119
Get into a good university

432
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,119
It's like entering

433
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,399
What about a good circle

434
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,119
People will help you without saying anything

435
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,399
Don't forget then

436
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:30,879
Don't let others

437
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,760
Give benefits

438
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,959
OK OK OK

439
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,320
Not to mention my depravity

440
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,159
I'll call you out today

441
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:37,560
I have a serious matter to ask you

442
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,199
you say

443
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:42,359
Tell me

444
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,000
CIF (cost plus insurance plus shipping)

445
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,599
Quotation

446
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,959
and LC (Letter of Credit)

447
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,520
Payment process

448
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,840
I'm going to work and check out orders every day

449
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:54,159
Come out for a drink with you on the big weekend

450
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,480
I have to teach you a lesson

451
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,919
You can read the book yourself

452
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,040
I didn't understand after seeing it

453
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,080
You are an international trade expert

454
00:23:01,198 --> 00:23:02,280
I won't ask who you ask

455
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:03,280
Tell me quickly

456
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,520
Play one

457
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,599
I don't play

458
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:07,760
Drinking

459
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,119
Sober

460
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:14,560
I'll tell you once

461
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,800
Very good looking

462
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,520
Try put it on quickly

463
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,760
This one is not easy to buy

464
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:26,080
It's said that celebrities wear the fire

465
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,919
Which star is it

466
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,320
That's that

467
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,520
That TV series

468
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:34,080
Three men and three women

469
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,240
Live in one piece

470
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,560
What's that name

471
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:38,560
Haven't seen it

472
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,679
I knew it was Liu Jun

473
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:42,800
OK

474
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,199
Lin Chuan

475
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,720
What happened between your elder brother and Liu Jun

476
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,159
How did it be handled

477
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,199
I don't know either

478
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,480
good

479
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:03,720
But sister-in-law

480
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:05,679
I think you should still take care of him

481
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:06,599
I'm lately

482
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:07,919
I can't understand him anymore

483
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,599
You can't understand who

484
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,480
I can't understand you

485
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,520
I can't understand you yet

486
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,560
Do you know

487
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,359
Low prices to reduce our factories

488
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,199
All from Liu Jun

489
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,240
Buy the drawings directly

490
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,639
That's someone else's own

491
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,639
Technical achievements that have been studied hard

492
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:25,720
How to sell

493
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,359
That's someone's freedom

494
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,959
You blocked someone's road so hard

495
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,359
People also need to stop losses in time

496
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,439
Anyway

497
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,800
I was careless

498
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,359
I underestimated others

499
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:39,760
I'll admit it this round

500
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,000
That's this kid

501
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,280
In a short time

502
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,480
So many buyers can be found

503
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,760
He has the ability

504
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,520
I'll admit this round

505
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,280
I won't bother with him

506
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,080
Satisfied

507
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,199
nice

508
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,639
So LC (Letter of Credit) refuses to pay

509
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,199
It has nothing to do with the contract

510
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,520
As long as the buyer has sufficient reason

511
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,439
Reject

512
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
The letter of credit that was called

513
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:17,760
Some are the methods of handling

514
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,599
Is it right

515
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,800
It can be understood so

516
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,320
The goods leaving the port

517
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,560
Can I recall it immediately

518
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,639
Then how is that possible

519
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:29,199
Ocean freighter floating on the sea

520
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,159
You call

521
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,840
Say to call it back if you say you want to call it back

522
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,159
If the operation cannot change the port

523
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,159
Then you can only return to the port

524
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,679
Your company has been recently

525
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:41,879
No exclusion order

526
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,320
Why did you suddenly ask about this

527
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,439
I haven't thought about it yet

528
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:47,359
Let's talk about it later

529
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:48,439
Come and drink

530
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,359
Good evening

531
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:38,720
Dr. Bergman

532
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,199
Didn't bother you

533
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:45,720
I have something to ask you

534
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,480
Help me find a patent lawyer in Germany

535
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,280
OK

536
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:55,760
Thanks

537
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,000
It is a patent infringement case

538
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:23,679
Fixed

539
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:24,879
Fixed

540
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,520
Thank you uncle quickly

541
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,320
Thank you uncle

542
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,199
You're welcome

543
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,800
Come on, come on, children, you go first

544
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:32,080
Really well cultivated

545
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,959
Keep up with you

546
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,000
Thank you so much today

547
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,359
No hard work

548
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:40,800
This is what it should be

549
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,439
There are not many teachers in our school

550
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,080
There is no male teacher

551
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,560
Volunteers like you

552
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:47,599
It's really rare

553
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,159
Is Sister Liang here too

554
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,079
right

555
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,320
Ms. Liang

556
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,840
We are our regular volunteers

557
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,800
They all come at regular intervals

558
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,480
Just now we walked out of that building

559
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,480
It was donated by her and her husband.

560
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,560
Her husband

561
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,800
Liu Jun

562
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:07,480
Sister Liang

563
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,439
I said this Jetta looks so familiar

564
00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:10,840
I didn't expect it was you

565
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,480
Mr. Liu has been here several times

566
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,159
It's just that you haven't met once

567
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,359
Thanks to his help

568
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:17,199
Our school

569
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
What's wrong with that little bread

570
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:19,760
All fixed

571
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,879
I feel relieved to drive this time

572
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,599
You really do auto repair

573
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,560
Not me who studied mechanical

574
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,359
Just know a little bit of auto repair technology

575
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,359
Then I'll buy a car next time

576
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,520
Please give me a counselor

577
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,480
OK No problem

578
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:33,679
Guaranteed to be available on call

579
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:35,679
Principal Wang

580
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,679
I just looked in the water room

581
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,520
Several faucets

582
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:38,639
All are rusted

583
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
I'll buy some new ones next time

584
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:40,520
Come and change it

585
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,959
This is my husband's business

586
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,320
Don't fight him for a job

587
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,199
Before you come

588
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,199
These repairs in the school

589
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,520
It's all done by her husband

590
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,520
Yes

591
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,199
If he has no work next time

592
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,879
I don't know where to put that hand

593
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,760
Is your husband also from science and engineering

594
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,119
He studied chemical engineering

595
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,439
Mr. Liu has good driving skills

596
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,080
This is the city's many bends

597
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,320
I can barely catch up

598
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,280
If it's a big straight line

599
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,080
I can't catch up if I step on the accelerator

600
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,599
Leave

601
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,080
Goodbye Sister Liang

602
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,320
Dad, I'm back

603
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:04,439
Come back

604
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,000
Have you eaten

605
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,959
Didn't eat it

606
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,359
Eat together then

607
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,399
I'll tell you

608
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:10,959
Plan for the construction of the new workshop

609
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,080
I've done it

610
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,720
Look

611
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,639
Liu Jun is back

612
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,079
You put it there

613
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,040
You see

614
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,040
These data are pretty good

615
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,639
Look at this third item

616
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,919
this

617
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,280
You come here

618
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:46,240
What's wrong This is

619
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:47,919
Why do you keep her

620
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:49,439
Then let it go

621
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,639
Where will she go after quit

622
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,720
Get out of this door

623
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,679
She can't even eat

624
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,080
Don't you hate us more

625
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,879
But you know her clearly

626
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,840
Calm and calm

627
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,720
How can I calm down

628
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,879
Not contradictory

629
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,040
She does her job

630
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,358
What's the important thing we say

631
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,840
Isn't it over to avoid her?

632
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,280
Just like now

633
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,199
Dad, you were so angry when you were young

634
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,320
Where have you gone

635
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,199
Why are you not only in the factory now

636
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,480
Has been threatened by workers

637
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:12,240
You can't even make any decisions at home

638
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,800
Then she will

639
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,199
Are we talking about something

640
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,199
Have to hide upstairs

641
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,479
Hiding in the study room

642
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,320
the wicked

643
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,560
If you do evil, you will not be punished

644
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,399
That is to encourage her to continue doing evil

645
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,280
Have you finished speaking

646
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,599
It's finished

647
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:26,760
Calm

648
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:28,040
You kid

649
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:29,800
Just too tough

650
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,760
What can't be done

651
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:31,919
All are up to their own personality

652
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,159
You need to understand how to adapt

653
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,119
Make adjustments to people and things

654
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,398
This is the most basic concept

655
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:38,639
If we both

656
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,359
Not even unified

657
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,159
Then there is no point in staying

658
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,560
I'll just go back to Germany.

659
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,840
Back to Germany

660
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,399
Do you still go back to Germany now

661
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,199
I

662
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Why can't I go back?

663
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:50,320
It's different now

664
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,280
Ah Jun

665
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,760
This factory

666
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:53,919
No, no me

667
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,280
But you can't be without you

668
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,560
You want

669
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,919
The most difficult old Huang and Xu in the factory

670
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,000
What they are technically

671
00:32:01,198 --> 00:32:02,679
I'll look for you anymore

672
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,599
All the workers in the factory listen to you

673
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
I'm in charge of logistics and accounting

674
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,199
I'll tell you

675
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,679
If you go back to Germany

676
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,040
I sold the factory

677
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,879
I can bear it, do you want to bear it?

678
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,240
I haven't heard of you recently

679
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,599
Start experimenting again

680
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,560
No

681
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,439
Technology development of new products

682
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,439
I've stopped

683
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:34,679
I'm studying land development recently

684
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,319
Land Development

685
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,399
Change your career

686
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,040
Don't think too much

687
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,520
My dad has been very busy lately

688
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,480
Changed mind

689
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,280
Decided not to make small fuss

690
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:47,840
I'm researching recently

691
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:48,679
In each development zone

692
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,840
Tax preferential policies

693
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:52,000
Are you planning to choose a site for the new workshop

694
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,560
Isn’t Wang Xi in charge of investment promotion?

695
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,320
He can definitely help

696
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,720
He is looking for me

697
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,159
All surrounding industrial areas

698
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,520
and development zone information

699
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
He collected it all for me

700
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,959
Who helped you and these old classmates

701
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,119
The relationship established

702
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:09,560
You have to thank others

703
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,199
It's you

704
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,679
I'll thank you very much

705
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:13,840
Tap Tap Tap

706
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,919
How do you ask me to thank you

707
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,280
You know it still

708
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,119
Come

709
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,199
Then you want to wait for the new factory

710
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,639
Return to Germany after completion

711
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,399
That year it was over

712
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,240
Residue for another year

713
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,279
Then continue

714
00:33:38,879 --> 00:33:40,359
Currently, this situation of the factory

715
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,280
I can't go back for a while

716
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,720
If so

717
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,919
My position has been overtaken

718
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,280
I'll stay in the country

719
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,800
Be a small business owner like my dad

720
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,000
Not quite good

721
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,480
Why are you so unpromising now

722
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,520
Why is it no longer successful

723
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:58,919
Dedicated to the manufacturing industry of the motherland

724
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,159
You said I'm not going to be successful

725
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,279
There is a promising future and a promising future

726
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,080
Promising

727
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,280
Let you have a chance

728
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,320
stop

729
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,998
Foreign trade does not require advance payment

730
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:21,879
Letter of Credit Transaction

731
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,800
It's the easiest

732
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:24,998
The most reliable way

733
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,359
We've done it for two consecutive years

734
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:27,998
Nothing wrong

735
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,879
Why this time

736
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,239
Will someone refuse to pay

737
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,998
Can you explain it to me

738
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,079
The other party said in the email

739
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,120
It's our documents that do not match

740
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:38,239
What's the meaning

741
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,478
They heard about the news

742
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:41,879
Want to lower the price

743
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:42,800
all right

744
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:43,679
This is the time

745
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,800
Don't fight with others

746
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,039
Right

747
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,958
You can tell someone

748
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:46,918
The price can be negotiated

749
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,559
I've gone to communicate

750
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,518
The attitude of two foreign companies

751
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:51,998
Almost the same

752
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,399
It's not a problem with money

753
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,679
What's the problem

754
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,359
I

755
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:56,679
I

756
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,519
You have to give me a reason, my friend

757
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,479
You are a manager of the import and export department

758
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:01,840
You're rejected now

759
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:03,479
You can't even figure out the reason.

760
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,280
You're not here to have a fresh meal

761
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:06,720
Big brother

762
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,840
What's the use of scolding him now

763
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,039
Still have to find one

764
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,519
Consultation by those who understand foreign trade

765
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:15,320
Analyze the reason for this now

766
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,200
What is it

767
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:17,640
See how it can be solved

768
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,840
What's going on in the finance side

769
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,439
Loans for these two letters of credit

770
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:32,439
Expired

771
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,720
Definitely no renewal

772
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,720
In addition, the cargo ship floats on the sea

773
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,999
The higher the cost of sending back

774
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,840
The key is

775
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:41,120
It kills a lot of liquidity

776
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,439
so

777
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,320
Bad financial situation

778
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,959
elder brother

779
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,200
Lin Chuan

780
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,479
Hello Miss Lin

781
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,640
Say you said

782
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,160
Miss Lin, don't worry

783
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:11,079
The documents are not in line with each other.

784
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:13,200
There are many possibilities in it

785
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,120
right

786
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:15,800
I'm busy outside now

787
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:16,959
If it's convenient for you

788
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,640
I'll go back to you when I finish my work

789
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:20,240
I'll analyze it for you

790
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,439
You're welcome

791
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,840
goodbye

792
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,399
The orders for one machine in the city were refused payment

793
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,438
Is it related to you?

794
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,039
I'll say

795
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,240
You last time for no reason

796
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,039
Inquired about the letter of credit

797
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,600
Where is Liu Jun

798
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,120
If you really can't swallow this

799
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,840
Must teach Lin Yue a lesson

800
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,439
You won't be so ruthless

801
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:55,840
You can definitely load before loading

802
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:57,079
Let the buyer terminate the contract

803
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,720
It can also make him lose money

804
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,879
It's fine now

805
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,079
The city's first machine has suffered such heavy losses now

806
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:04,320
What if Lin Yue found out that it was you who did it

807
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,760
What do you think he will deal with you

808
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,959
Am I afraid of him

809
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,039
His incompetent tricks

810
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,399
Scaring my dad

811
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:12,879
What else can he do

812
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,359
Find someone to beat me

813
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,280
Oh my God, do you think he dare not

814
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,600
Lin Yue has reached this position today

815
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,800
He hasn't done anything

816
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,280
What industries does his own

817
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,720
The thing about tackling the little hooligans before

818
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,359
I can tell you a few

819
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,680
You really made him suffer this time

820
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,559
This secret

821
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,640
How long can I hide Lin Yue in the end

822
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
It's really hard to say

823
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,519
I knew it was him

824
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,519
how

825
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,519
He's right, my problem

826
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,840
Don't tell me nonsense

827
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:50,720
What I asked you to check

828
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,160
You'll find out for me.

829
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,240
Other things have nothing to do with you

830
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,039
What am I going to do

831
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,079
Can I just slap him?

832
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,079
I have to let him know

833
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,120
This matter cannot be overcome without any bleeding

834
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,240
Do you understand?

835
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,720
The brat is having fun with me

836
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:14,879
Don't want to go back to Germany, he is

837
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,760
Sister-in-law

838
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,079
Sister-in-law

839
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:36,840
You two

840
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:38,160
What's the messing thing about

841
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,959
We're both

842
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:40,919
It has nothing to do with them

843
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:55,760
You two go

844
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:57,680
Keep the project in a close eye

845
00:38:57,999 --> 00:38:59,600
If I overspend, I will punish you two more

846
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:02,359
Remember me

847
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,079
It's the big brother

848
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,840
Sister-in-law

849
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:05,760
Leaving sister-in-law

850
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,959
What's wrong

851
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,600
Make trouble for me about foreign trade

852
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:23,879
It's that boy Liu Jun

853
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:28,120
Then you two are even

854
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:31,879
I've said it before

855
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,320
You block someone's road

856
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,999
People have to stop the loss in time

857
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,999
Stop loss

858
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,999
He's slapping me in the face, okay

859
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:42,240
I'll just do this

860
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:43,280
Then in the East China Sea

861
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,479
Everyone can walk on me

862
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,439
Then what do you want to do

863
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,399
What do you think

864
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:53,680
OK

865
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,439
Then you do it

866
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,200
One day

867
00:39:58,399 --> 00:39:59,559
I have to be like Sister Wei a few years ago

868
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,879
Just like Brother Dongbao

869
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,439
Go and see you on time

870
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,919
What did you say

871
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:05,879
Am I?

872
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,399
Why didn't it happen

873
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,919
Lin Yue

874
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:17,840
You have a wife and a child now

875
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,079
Didn't you be a bachelor in the past few years

876
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,079
He is a child who has just returned home

877
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,879
What are you chasing with him

878
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,959
Sometimes

879
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,240
It's the kids doing that

880
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,559
What a talented person

881
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:30,879
never mind

882
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Be a good person

883
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,320
Is it OK

884
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,039
Good man

885
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,720
Be a good person now

886
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,760
The price is too high

887
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:55,039
Where is Lin Chuan

888
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:56,640
Let her come over and discuss

889
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:58,439
Where did she go?

890
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,079
She went out with her friends

891
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:02,399
You didn't find it

892
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,359
Did she not want to pay attention to you recently

893
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,079
You've gotten into trouble

894
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,559
Do you know

895
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,999
This is not a big deal

896
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:23,959
Dad, please pay attention to your heart

897
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:24,479
Is it OK

898
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,320
This is a big deal, child

899
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,160
Listen to me

900
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,519
Go away from the East China Sea quickly

901
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Go back to Germany immediately

902
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,959
I'm protecting my rights according to law

903
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
Do you need to be so scared

904
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,919
Lin Yue is human

905
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:33,959
He's not a ghost

906
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,519
Sometimes people are more terrifying than ghosts

907
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,240
Pack up immediately

908
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:37,078
Listen to me

909
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Don't come back for three to five years

910
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,280
If Lin Yue really looks like you said

911
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:39,999
So terrible

912
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:40,720
Then I'll leave

913
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:42,240
He's angry at you

914
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,559
If we want to leave, we will go together.

915
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,600
My old man buried half a piece of the earth

916
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,840
What am I doing in Germany

917
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:46,800
I'm here I can handle it

918
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:47,399
I'm fine

919
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:48,280
If you can handle it

920
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:48,919
I can handle it, too

921
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:49,439
You kid

922
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,439
You listen to me finish speaking first

923
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,160
OK OK OK

924
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,120
You say you say you say

925
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,680
I'm going to sell the entire Qianjin Factory

926
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:59,160
Go to the development zone in my name

927
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,399
Create a new business

928
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,320
What did you say

929
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:02,160
Don't worry first

930
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,039
Come on, come on, sit on, sit on

931
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:10,840
Our factory is in the city center

932
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,840
Originally moving out is the trend

933
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,999
New development zone

934
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,559
Not only policy benefits

935
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,559
And the land is much cheaper

936
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:19,240
The difference in a single replacement

937
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:20,439
It's enough to make up for it

938
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Funds for our equipment upgrade

939
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:26,600
Don't underestimate Lin Yue's ability

940
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,559
No matter where you build a factory

941
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,840
He can find you to deal with you

942
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:29,959
Is it okay for you to use your brain

943
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:30,640
dad

944
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,399
Wait for us to sell Qianjin Factory

945
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:33,320
After settlement

946
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:34,600
There will be taxes in the future

947
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,519
Issues like accounting checking

948
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,999
It has nothing to do with the new factory

949
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,359
Let's start over again when we change places

950
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,999
Follow the rules from now on

951
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,200
Understand the rules

952
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,160
Build a brand new business

953
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,039
Ah Jun

954
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:48,559
The idea of building a new factory

955
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:50,519
I haven't considered it for a long time

956
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:51,640
yes

957
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,120
I've started the site selection

958
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:55,879
Development Zone Government

959
00:42:55,999 --> 00:42:57,200
For private enterprises like us

960
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,359
Policies support is very strong

961
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:01,760
Dad, believe me

962
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,280
I'm definitely not a whim
