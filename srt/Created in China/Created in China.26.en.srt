1
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,598
What's wrong

2
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,439
Engineers at the R&D Center

3
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,120
Under my nose

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
The experimental data they obtained

5
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,039
I can keep it confidential

6
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,200
But the third phase of research and development

7
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,079
Lack of funds

8
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,640
I didn't dare to run the experimental equipment

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,920
But first,

10
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,359
Cooperated in large batches of operations

11
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,280
If those professors who cooperate

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,359
Being poached

13
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,400
As long as it is covered up well

14
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,360
I can't even catch evidence of breach of contract

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,039
But you didn't sign with them

16
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,240
Is there a confidentiality agreement?

17
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,400
Why did you follow me before

18
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,759
That thing is only guarding against gentlemen

19
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,759
Can't guard against villains

20
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,680
Then what do you do

21
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,759
Professor Zhang, don't get me wrong

22
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,400
Our cooperation has always been very pleasant

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,120
I just heard some rumors

24
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,400
Want to verify it

25
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,000
Is it better to give an explanation to the shareholders

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,000
Mr. Liu

27
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,599
Since you asked

28
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,199
Then I'll say something to my heart

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,800
Those you heard

30
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:43,800
Not necessarily a rumor

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
At least I myself

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,599
I did receive it

33
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,960
Contact with Kitahara Company

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,400
Their offer is very high

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,560
If not considered

36
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,560
The issue of default

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,520
I really don't want to refuse

38
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you for telling me this

39
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,680
With your words

40
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,280
I'm much more relieved

41
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm rejecting this

42
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,159
But how about other people

43
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,520
Have you asked it all, too

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,400
Several other professors said

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,520
Haven't received a call

46
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,439
I have nothing to comment on, either

47
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,759
Since they said

48
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,599
Haven't even received the call

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
Then if not

50
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,840
Everyone knows

51
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,759
Follow-up funds for segmented projects

52
00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:46,800
Not enough

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,918
Now there is one more

54
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,360
Competitors by any means

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,079
If Kitahara Company

56
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,360
Can really rely on these methods

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,439
Get the chance first

58
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,240
Then let's take off

59
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,400
All previous efforts

60
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,159
It will be a waste of money

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,919
Lost completely

62
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,400
I'll put these difficulties out now

63
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,478
Let's discuss it

64
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,920
What should I do

65
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,399
It's regardless of risk

66
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,600
Continue to increase investment

67
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,560
still

68
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,959
Accept reality

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,439
In the final stage

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,959
Give up competition

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,759
Let me express my opinion first

72
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,159
At least so far

73
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,759
I don't want to give up yet

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,959
Mr. Liu

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,159
You don't want to give up

76
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,040
We R&D personnel

77
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,240
Of course, I don't want to

78
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,360
But the facts are in front of you

79
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,279
We can see one by one

80
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,160
First of all, on financial resources

81
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,439
Beiyuan Company has strong assets

82
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,560
Get a bank loan

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
That's no problem

84
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,360
Let's talk about progress

85
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,920
They're in hand now

86
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,120
Two-thirds of them already

87
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,160
R&D results

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,240
Not much different from us

89
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,240
Finally, let's talk about human resources

90
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,360
Those professors

91
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,160
Although not admitting private breach

92
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,360
But the real situation

93
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,959
Everyone knows it

94
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,439
We have nothing

95
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,360
Very fantasy

96
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,759
Mr. Liu

97
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,720
Not my negative attitude

98
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,360
I really can't think of it

99
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,839
What confidence do we have to fly

100
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,480
Can you go with such a

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,159
giant

102
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,560
Go to compete

103
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,399
Mr. Liu

104
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,639
Can we take a step back

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
Keep up with the boss over there

106
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,000
Talking about cooperation

107
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,720
I can't see

108
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,199
Kitahara

109
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,920
Since you have found Donghai Group directly

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,720
Want to order

111
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,920
That must be

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,399
After various cost analysis

113
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,199
I think we're going alone

114
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,279
Comparing results sharing

115
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,399
More profitable

116
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,199
We're now

117
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,040
Has been poached

118
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Go and talk to someone again

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,800
What good conditions can be discussed

120
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,680
Mr. Luo, what you want to say

121
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,639
I'm not convinced

122
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,639
Segmented Projects

123
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,680
We made it from scratch

124
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,720
Even if they took it

125
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,720
Results of the first two periods

126
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,519
Don't you have to get familiar with it from scratch?

127
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,360
Then we

128
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,759
There is also a time advantage

129
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,240
No matter how much they cost

130
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,639
I can't take this shortcut

131
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,720
That means

132
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,519
We still have a chance to win

133
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,120
But

134
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,879
I admit

135
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,120
The huge financial resources of Kitahara

136
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,240
Enough to make up for their weaknesses

137
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,839
The result of persistence

138
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,920
It's very likely to be a complete failure

139
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,639
But since no one wants to give up

140
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,480
Then next

141
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,839
I will continue to work hard to find money

142
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
Everyone's work

143
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,439
Must work harder, too

144
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,120
Anyone who can

145
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,439
Accelerate the progress of research and development

146
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,240
Try to move forward as much as possible

147
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,040
Mr. Liu

148
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,720
I think you will

149
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,279
It's a serious mistake

150
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,879
Why

151
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,920
The engineers at the R&D center

152
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,040
Don't care much about it normally

153
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,079
The ups and downs outside

154
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,279
If you don't say it

155
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,319
They didn't know what happened in Beiyuan

156
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,560
Maybe work hard

157
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,560
It really surpassed the R&D progress

158
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,360
But now I'm so frank

159
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,040
Bloody facts are in front of you

160
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,399
Nothing better than the opponent

161
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,759
This is scared

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,399
The team is even harder to lead

163
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,360
My intention is not to hide it

164
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,279
I hope to make the problem clear

165
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,240
Of course I hope

166
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,800
Can arouse everyone's emotions

167
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,360
A battle of storm

168
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,319
I understand what you mean

169
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,639
Tragedy in adversity

170
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
It's a double-edged sword

171
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,000
After it was inspired

172
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,360
Will it make people progress or decadent

173
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
Then who can say it correctly

174
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,839
OK, let's not talk about these false ones

175
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,680
Finding money is the real problem

176
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
The big order you have

177
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,480
Must talk to me

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,120
I need this contract

179
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,639
Go to the bank to negotiate acceptance

180
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,240
With this ten million

181
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,558
The R&D center can resume work

182
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,840
You can get back if you lag behind

183
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,558
I'm confident in signing the contract

184
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,840
The ten million you can get

185
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,840
You are ready

186
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,080
Are they all hitting the R&D center?

187
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,000
The turnover of Tengda Laoxu

188
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,879
What to do

189
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,600
Find a way

190
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,799
There is always a way to balance it

191
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,559
Everyone comes here

192
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,120
Come and have a look

193
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,960
Let's take a look at what I just approved today

194
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,039
Ten million bills of exchange

195
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,639
Ten million

196
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,799
Ten million

197
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,159
I'll take a look I'll take a look

198
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,080
Ten million

199
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,120
Ten million, ten million

200
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,679
Still ten million

201
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,039
Our group's experimental equipment

202
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,039
Can run

203
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,759
yes

204
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,320
Everyone listens

205
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,799
Mr. Liu gave the money

206
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,240
Our R&D Center

207
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,399
You have to be worthy of the money

208
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,039
Every minute and every cent must be spent to the point

209
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,039
Not ending

210
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,159
No retreat

211
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,039
OK OK OK

212
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,039
Never give up

213
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,679
good

214
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,799
We all understand this

215
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Don't worry

216
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,919
Don't stand there and work quickly

217
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,639
Construction is on

218
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,279
Work and work

219
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,519
Bill of exchange bills of exchange

220
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,679
Returned it back

221
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,919
Hold it and collect it

222
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,240
Please help me take a look

223
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:46,799
Come down

224
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,000
Thank you for your hard work

225
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,200
All are excited now

226
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
It's exciting

227
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,559
This acceptance is only 10 million

228
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,799
How long will it take for you to burn

229
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,759
If it's finished burning

230
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
There is no result yet

231
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,039
What to do then

232
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,480
Sister Liang, you may not understand

233
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,200
The mood of us technicians

234
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,039
Technology research and development for us

235
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,039
It's like ten months pregnant

236
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,039
Donghai segmented project

237
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,200
It's the child we're pregnant

238
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,320
It's almost time to give birth

239
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,279
Even if there are defects

240
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,159
Even difficult to produce

241
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,679
But parents

242
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,240
But parents

243
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,960
Who is willing to give up

244
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,399
Natoufei and Tengda two factories

245
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Is it your responsibility

246
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,559
Is it your child or not

247
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,000
Your primary identity

248
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,519
Not a technician

249
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,559
It's a decision-maker of a business

250
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,519
Shouldn't you face a crisis

251
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,600
Balancing risks

252
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,440
Priority

253
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,919
Is the interests of most people

254
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,440
Do it even though you know it cannot

255
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,919
This stubborn temper of technology is coming

256
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,679
Good

257
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,000
You're still praising him

258
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,000
The school is doing this

259
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,720
Several professors

260
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,120
All have turned to Kitahara

261
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,320
He now knows that there is a fire pit ahead.

262
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,519
Still having to jump in

263
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,159
Someone needs to stop it

264
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,320
Instead of encouraging him

265
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,119
No need to block

266
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,639
Sometimes under heavy pressure

267
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,320
Only human potential can burst out

268
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,799
He's still young and can handle it

269
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,320
Is this a skilled person

270
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,720
Always get a little fool

271
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,279
Look at me

272
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,279
Not just one

273
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,679
Are you crazy about it?

274
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,559
For Donghai No. 1

275
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,320
Even the promotion has been given up

276
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,399
Guard this small peninsula and drink the sea breeze

277
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,919
Haven't you stopped me?

278
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,440
Then is he the same as you

279
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,600
Private enterprises burned

280
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,679
But your own money

281
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,679
He's just now

282
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,840
Without this strength

283
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,919
You

284
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,799
The evaluation of Tengfei is too narrow

285
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,720
How strong is a company

286
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,720
You can't just look at profit attempts and numbers

287
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,200
It depends on the leader

288
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,480
Pursuit and sentiment

289
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,120
Liu Jun’s R&D center is very high-quality

290
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,399
What is missing is an opportunity

291
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,960
And one for him to play

292
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,840
Market environment

293
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,840
I believe

294
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Society will not always be so impetuous

295
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,320
As long as reform and opening up continues

296
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,559
It will definitely slowly

297
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,879
Become a healthy competition

298
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,200
Maybe

299
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,279
But I'm just worried

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,600
Liu Jun can't wait for so long

301
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,720
According to the current trend

302
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,679
If he continues to do so recklessly

303
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,799
Take off like a

304
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,120
Eggs flying toward the stone

305
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,639
The ending will be very unhappy

306
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,320
I still like this

307
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,919
A fool who doesn't hit the wall and doesn't look back

308
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,840
And the products he took out

309
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,799
I believe it, too

310
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,200
Anyway

311
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,879
You spend every day in the R&D center

312
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,360
You can observe him

313
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
If he is really because of Donghai No. 1

314
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
In a desperate situation

315
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,360
I won't look at him

316
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,440
Torn to pieces

317
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,639
Where are you

318
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,639
It's obvious that you can take action early

319
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,240
I have to observe the end

320
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,399
Are you a savior

321
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,080
It feels very good to turn the tide

322
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,840
There has never been any savior

323
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,919
Try it

324
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,600
May I

325
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,399
Can

326
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,200
I used to ride this thing

327
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,000
Go to and from get off work

328
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,159
Now it's a fitness equipment

329
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,480
The world has changed

330
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,879
Don't be moved and go to cook

331
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,399
After practicing, eat

332
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,159
Eat more and longer meat

333
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,600
I don't

334
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Song Yunhui

335
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,559
What are you pretending

336
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,840
Manager Luo

337
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,600
Old Zhu

338
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,000
What are you doing

339
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,679
Lao Xu

340
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,440
Take some middle-level players

341
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
There is a fuss in Mr. Liu's office

342
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,720
Say he favors one and the other

343
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,960
Put all your money into the bottomless hole of R&D

344
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,480
Regardless of Tengda's life or death

345
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,000
Actually, I can understand Lao Xu

346
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,960
Equipment is insufficient due to working capital

347
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Half idle

348
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,120
Neither working hours nor per capita output value will be increased

349
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,639
Then the income will decrease

350
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,000
It all depends on

351
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,159
The vital interests of everyone

352
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,279
Who will take care of production if you change

353
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,240
Can he not be in a hurry

354
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,519
Lao Xu can survive until today

355
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,119
It's not easy

356
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,240
Don't worry, Lao Xu

357
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,320
You believe me

358
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,159
Once this is successfully developed

359
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,159
It's a huge profit

360
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,879
It's good for the factory

361
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,559
Three months

362
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,519
You'll wait for me for three months

363
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,559
Surely results

364
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,519
Then brothers

365
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,000
What kind of workload do you want

366
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,799
I will add it to you without any ambiguity

367
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,039
Add to you

368
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,279
Good Mr. Liu

369
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,639
Then we can remember

370
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,360
What you said

371
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,360
I'm doing it for the company, too

372
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,120
This half of people are idle

373
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,759
It's not a thing

374
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,320
Don't worry

375
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,240
Then we're leaving

376
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,320
Leaving Mr. Liu

377
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,120
Bye bye bye bye

378
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,679
Don't give it to me

379
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,240
Let's talk to each team again

380
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,759
Mr. Liu

381
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,960
Just relying on this coaxing and deceiving

382
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,759
No

383
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,240
Research and development has been eaten

384
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,279
Too much money

385
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,440
Current monthly shipments

386
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,639
It has begun to decline

387
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,200
Once the amount of income does not meet the requirements

388
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,720
It will inevitably affect the next credit

389
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:28,759
Such a vicious cycle

390
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,720
Once formed

391
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,639
No money spent on R&D and factory

392
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,240
How long can the company last

393
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,799
There are many ideas for the R&D center

394
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,679
Need to verify

395
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,519
If you can't continue now

396
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,000
I know the work is not in full

397
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,480
I know too

398
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,960
It's not easy for you to maintain the market

399
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,600
But now is the most critical moment

400
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,600
You're different from others

401
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,440
What I need now

402
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,879
It's your support

403
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,039
Ice Ice

404
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,080
I'm back

405
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,358
Why are you sitting here

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,920
You sit down first

407
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,279
How do you look at me inquiry?

408
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,960
I'll declare it to you first

409
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,640
I'll be under your strict management

410
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,079
Absolutely loyal

411
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,160
A little bit of principled mistake

412
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:27,960
Nothing happened

413
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,440
So no matter what you ask me

414
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,839
I won't be guilty

415
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,000
I heard today

416
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,480
Except for last month's

417
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,799
That's more than ten million

418
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,039
A new acceptance

419
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,559
You'll spend half of the research and development

420
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,559
Bingbing, you don't know

421
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,880
There is a recent one in the center

422
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,960
Very important simulation experiments to run

423
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,720
This money is very needed for research and development

424
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,359
R&D requires money

425
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,960
Doesn't the company need money to operate?

426
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,119
You're doing this now

427
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,599
You dragged the whole factory to one

428
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,279
On the runway without a finish

429
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,480
You didn't think about it at all

430
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,119
Huge risks after failure

431
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,680
A company was not considered

432
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,079
The most basic survival problem

433
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,759
The company is not the only one

434
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,359
Research and development of this sector

435
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,000
Tengfei Tengda so many employees

436
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:24,759
Their interests

437
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,319
Isn't it your responsibility

438
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,960
Sister Liang asked me too

439
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,279
Same problem

440
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,240
I don't really have one

441
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,960
Explain the right reason to you

442
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,960
But my intuition and my instinct

443
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:46,759
tell me

444
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,720
The general direction of segmented projects

445
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,920
Definitely correct

446
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,319
If I'm because of your objections

447
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,559
If you stop

448
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,920
Then this project will definitely be

449
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,119
My lifelong regret

450
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,400
even

451
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,680
Even my soul

452
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,440
There will also be gaps

453
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,319
Your soul

454
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,000
good

455
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,079
This is how we two are breaking up soon

456
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,359
Signed prenuptial agreement

457
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
You told me with striking words

458
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,359
Although the company is in your name

459
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,160
But the start-up capital was paid by your dad

460
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,039
So the real investor is him

461
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,000
Then I'll ask you

462
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,319
Today's one is related to

463
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,680
Major decisions on life and death of a company

464
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,000
Have you asked him for any comments

465
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,160
Does he know the company

466
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,079
What's going on now

467
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,880
Ice Ice

468
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,319
There are many people in the factory opposing me

469
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,680
My dad won't understand

470
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,880
But I thought

471
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,000
I thought at least you were there

472
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,200
I thought you would

473
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,160
Support me to understand me

474
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,200
I support you

475
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,960
How do you want me to support you

476
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,000
To help you get more loans

477
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,519
I'm almost ready to use my power for personal gain

478
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,039
You're so flying now

479
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,839
Try to death

480
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,680
you tell me

481
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,319
Have you considered my consequences

482
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:14,920
I understand you

483
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,400
I've been understanding you

484
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
But now I'm asking

485
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,920
Your sensible answer

486
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:20,960
You can't give it to me

487
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,200
Your ideal

488
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,000
Your soul

489
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:23,720
Your intuition

490
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,440
These are not reasons for your willfulness.

491
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,799
Liu Jun

492
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,439
Your daughter is upstairs now

493
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,359
She needs one

494
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,960
A stable growth environment

495
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,720
In your ideal

496
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
When you are treacherous

497
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,759
Can you consider her

498
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,680
OK OK OK Don't cry

499
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,400
OK OK OK

500
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,920
Mom is not arguing

501
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,119
Not afraid

502
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,519
Mom is OK

503
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,519
President Liu

504
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,799
Very good I'm looking for you

505
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,200
This time there is a chance. Let's go

506
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,440
What are you talking about in a mess?

507
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,519
Computer simulation

508
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,119
Output curve

509
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,880
That's already happening

510
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,839
You go and have a look

511
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:32,680
real

512
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,240
Of course

513
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,480
The entire research team is here

514
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,599
Come

515
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,440
Good evening Good evening

516
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:45,799
Mr. Liu

517
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,640
Mr. Liu sits

518
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,759
It's okay

519
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:49,880
All condition groups

520
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I've retested

521
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,119
Data consistent

522
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,759
Extremely small output range error

523
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,440
Mr. Liu, please do it yourself

524
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,640
I'll try

525
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,279
X-condition group

526
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:42,839
this

527
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,960
Why is this

528
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,680
Which Z axis do you see

529
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,279
Z-axis

530
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
There is something wrong with this

531
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,480
Mr. Liu

532
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,799
Y condition group

533
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,160
very nice

534
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,960
The existence of this variable

535
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,400
Always the devil in everyone's heart

536
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:32,598
Unexpectedly,

537
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,160
You found it today

538
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,319
Mr. Tan, you have made great contributions

539
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,359
Not all of me

540
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,880
Sun Gong Liao Gong

541
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:40,960
And Xiao Ke and the others

542
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,240
They're helping me too

543
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,640
Mr. Liu

544
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
We've done a lot

545
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,920
Work conditions tested

546
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,119
You want one too

547
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:50,359
Just think of the most extreme and difficult

548
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:51,559
Yes, right

549
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,279
Anyway

550
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,279
I think one, I think one

551
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,519
Mr. Liu

552
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,799
I've tested this condition long ago

553
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,759
Think about it again

554
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,119
See if it can stump me

555
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,920
I think of one more, I think of one more

556
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,599
I'll think of another one

557
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,839
No need to lose

558
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
I've done this, too

559
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:15,839
I've proved

560
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,279
I watched Sister Tan do it

561
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,240
Talking about it

562
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,920
It's all up to these young people

563
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,640
We old ones are not good

564
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,039
Without them, there is imagination

565
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,799
Some time ago

566
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:25,920
Isn't there no money?

567
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
No one can afford to run the equipment

568
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,559
Just sit together and think about it

569
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,039
Many ideas

570
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,480
When I just heard it

571
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,680
It's simply ridiculous

572
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,039
Not

573
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,000
Chief Liao didn't have it at all

574
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,359
Dislike us for being imaginative

575
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,920
Instead, it was recorded one by one

576
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:39,960
Verification excluded

577
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:40,759
right

578
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,599
Mr. Liu

579
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
What's wrong with you Mr. Liu

580
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,200
Such a variable

581
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,759
From spring to autumn

582
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,240
Never gave up for a moment

583
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
It's said that only fools will get lucky

584
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,480
Why

585
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:09,799
Because we are the only ones

586
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,119
These fools will

587
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,359
Keep silly

588
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,519
Bumping to the head

589
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,440
Only the possibility of this small probability

590
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,319
Crash it out

591
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,759
Everyone knows

592
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,160
More than half a year after the Spring Festival

593
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,039
The days of the R&D center

594
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,920
It's just a ball of black

595
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,039
The previous stage was quite smooth

596
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,160
But suddenly an obstacle

597
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,960
Just stuck us

598
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,759
How many people don't understand

599
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,119
Lost hope for us

600
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,480
But luckily

601
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,839
Fortunately, we have Mr. Liu

602
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,279
Always understand and support us

603
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,960
So we thank Mr. Liu for

604
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,359
Thank you Mr. Liu

605
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,799
Thank you Mr. Liu

606
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,200
Thank you Mr. Liu

607
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,240
Thank you Mr. Liu

608
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,640
Thank you Mr. Liu, thank you Mr. Liu

609
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,599
Thank you Mr. Liu

610
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Thank you everyone

611
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,920
Thank you for your hard work

612
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,759
I'll treat you tonight

613
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,799
Don't go home without getting drunk

614
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,079
good

615
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,440
Don't go back if you're drunk

616
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,720
Don't go home if you're drunk

617
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,400
Thank you

618
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,079
Thanks

619
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,759
Below, please invite the winner to come to the stage to receive the prize

620
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
As for it

621
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,240
In the field of manufacturing

622
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,720
At the national level

623
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
Tengfei made his own voice

624
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,960
I'm really happy for him

625
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,559
Thanks Thanks

626
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,720
You come

627
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,680
Dear leaders

628
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,160
Dear guests

629
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,599
Dear experts

630
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,000
Hello everyone

631
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,279
I heard

632
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,640
This expert betrayed Tengfei

633
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,279
The most critical time for R&D

634
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,680
Go north quietly

635
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,480
Breached the contract and sold the technology to

636
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,920
Liu Jun’s biggest competitor

637
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,279
Does Liu Jun know about this?

638
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,559
Then he knows

639
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:59,759
Why do you still have to be with such a person

640
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,880
Let's publish papers together

641
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,000
Put aside character

642
00:32:04,078 --> 00:32:04,960
This expert is in the industry

643
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,519
Still have strength and status

644
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,160
You have to remember

645
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,039
Some circles have developed to the top

646
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,000
All are limited to a few people

647
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,839
A small group formed

648
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,119
Breach of contract and poaching

649
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,079
Not easy to check

650
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:20,640
But Takeo

651
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,240
Small and medium-sized companies do need it

652
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,519
A national award

653
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,160
To support the facade

654
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,519
Liu Jun is willing to pretend to be stupid and not say anything

655
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,920
It's indeed much more mature than before

656
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,160
Maybe

657
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,799
Tell the past

658
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,720
He is definitely one

659
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,880
A person with moral integrity

660
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,200
Now I have to be with the light

661
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,480
Mature

662
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,079
Still degenerate

663
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,880
Master the real core technology

664
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,599
Only in the world's high-tech field

665
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:58,039
Have a place

666
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,880
Thanks

667
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:05,319
Mr. Liu

668
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,359
Wait for the next chance

669
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,920
You must check it out at your Tengfei Factory

670
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:08,680
Welcome

671
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:09,559
Mr. Liu

672
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,880
Your phone number

673
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,400
Then Mr. Liu won't disturb him anymore

674
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,079
I'll leave first

675
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,799
goodbye

676
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,079
Hello Jiali

677
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,119
Liu Jun

678
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,839
I want to ask you for help

679
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,119
What's this

680
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,000
What's this

681
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,759
This requires more than 100,000 yuan in cash

682
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,039
A total of 180,000 cash

683
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,200
Hongming every month

684
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,680
All gave me a lot of living expenses

685
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:46,720
I can't spend it

686
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,240
I'll keep it in the safe

687
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,440
I've saved up so much in the past few years

688
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,400
Liu Jun

689
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,559
Can you take the money back

690
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,480
Store in the bank with your name

691
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,680
I'll save some more every month from now on

692
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,119
I'll give it to you one after another

693
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,359
this

694
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,720
Nothing happened to your family

695
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,239
No, no

696
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,079
It was the last time

697
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,518
Things you're investigated

698
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,039
Hongming told me

699
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,639
The more I think about it

700
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,360
The more I feel nervous

701
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,239
I'm afraid he's the same as you

702
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,559
What's wrong

703
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,639
You know me

704
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,840
I have no ability

705
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,480
I'm afraid something really happens if something really happens

706
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,480
Not only can I not help Hongming

707
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,119
I might drag him down

708
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,000
Jiali

709
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,800
Hongming is much more cautious than me

710
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,800
I don't think you have to think randomly

711
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You'll finish listening to me

712
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,440
This thing

713
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,000
I've been thinking about it for several months

714
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,159
I've also asked

715
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,518
Your Bingbing's opinion

716
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,679
She said I'm very good at having this consciousness

717
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,159
Can do some on a regular basis

718
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,440
Crisis prevention work

719
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,518
For our family

720
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,920
Have more insurance

721
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,400
this

722
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,239
It's the double insurance I can think of

723
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,000
Your and Hongming’s finances

724
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,280
Have been deeply bound

725
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,000
Find an outsider

726
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,679
Save a sum of money in his name

727
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,880
It's indeed a solution

728
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,920
Just leave this task to me

729
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:11,800
Not suitable

730
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,159
You can give it to Hongming's sister

731
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:18,119
The brother and brother started a company together

732
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,360
I can't tell the difference financially

733
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:23,880
Liu Jun

734
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,119
You just think it's for

735
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,119
Let me feel at ease

736
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,519
Please

737
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:33,880
All right

738
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,559
What is the specific amount

739
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,519
I'll send you a receipt

740
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,239
No, no, no

741
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,079
I'll be every month from now on

742
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:39,960
Will give it to you again

743
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,559
Just remember it in your mind

744
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:42,920
Such a large amount of cash

745
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:43,760
Don't even hit a note

746
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,639
You can trust me

747
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,800
I can't believe it myself

748
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,000
Bingbing, I'm back

749
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,960
The hero who won the science and technology award

750
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:09,760
Come back

751
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,480
What delicious food did you prepare

752
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,480
Ice Ice

753
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,840
Want to have a meal

754
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,079
Come and sit here

755
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,400
I'll interrogate you

756
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,199
Interrogate me

757
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,599
What to say

758
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,559
Aya called me today

759
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,760
Say she saw you with her own eyes in the afternoon

760
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,880
In the cafe

761
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,119
And a long hair

762
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,360
Young girl dating

763
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,840
You tell me honestly

764
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,039
Who is that girl?

765
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,159
Young girl with long hair

766
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,000
Shen Jiali

767
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,719
It's your fault

768
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,320
You told someone some time ago

769
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,119
Family financial double insurance

770
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,639
See what this is

771
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,639
Where does this come from so much cash?

772
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:07,000
Carrie brought it to me in the afternoon

773
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,159
Ask me to open an account for her and save it

774
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,599
This Shen Jiali

775
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,239
Are you a little too dependent on you

776
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,320
Then your behavior is very strange, too

777
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,239
Take the money

778
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,880
What coffee do you drink with her?

779
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,880
Then I won't drink coffee

780
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,760
What am I doing

781
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,479
We both find a community entrance

782
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,519
Touch your head

783
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,079
She gave me a pack of money

784
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,519
I put it in my arms and then left

785
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,840
This is even more strange

786
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Anyway

787
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,880
I'm wronged you, okay

788
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,239
We've been doing it lately

789
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,400
Two months mortgage loan

790
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,719
No task was completed

791
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,920
Qian Hongming, a loan business like this

792
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,719
Business should be even worse

793
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,840
How can I still pay for living

794
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,840
Give so generous

795
00:37:59,079 --> 00:37:59,880
yes

796
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,679
Didn't hear it yesterday

797
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,280
Did a rich boss commit suicide?

798
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,559
That person

799
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,159
His situation is different

800
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,199
He gambled all the money

801
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,880
It didn't work a few months ago

802
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,360
I heard of that person

803
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,840
A very good relationship with Lin Yue

804
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,840
Let's go to Macau to gamble money together

805
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,880
Anyway, if you get addicted to gambling

806
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,159
Few people can make a fortune

807
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,960
Look at it, the last word is lost

808
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,599
But it's fine

809
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,199
You have strong concentration

810
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,119
Didn't get into the water last time

811
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,480
That's

812
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,480
But sometimes men gamble

813
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,519
What Is Not a Win

814
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,400
The picture is relaxation

815
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,639
Just stressed out to you women

816
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,599
Just like fighting

817
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,679
Can that be the same

818
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,760
I'll tell you nothing

819
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,559
These people have a weak cultural foundation

820
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,559
After you have money

821
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,599
Don't know how to play and spend it

822
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,880
The same goes for Qian Hongming

823
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,760
Looks fashionable on the surface

824
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,239
Actually, it's just a rustic

825
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,519
Hongming has provoked you

826
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,320
You said someone

827
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,440
Just discuss something

828
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,480
Speaking

829
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,360
We have surplus food now

830
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:13,639
After moving

831
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,559
Change your car

832
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,559
It's definitely going to be replaced

833
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,840
But I don't want it

834
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,719
A big sedan like Sister Liang

835
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:23,320
I want one

836
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:27,480
Small and fierce wind

837
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:29,840
A car that has to be hit

838
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,280
Think about what cars there are

839
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,559
Small and powerful wind-like

840
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,280
Then I'll change your tank

841
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,159
Little Beta

842
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,280
I'm the first one to thrust you old Shuke

843
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,639
Come on, come on

844
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,280
nice shot

845
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,400
Deduct him

846
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:56,880
Win

847
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,599
It was him who lost several games to me

848
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:04,599
What are you celebrating here

849
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,079
You care about me, I'm happy

850
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,199
It's Spring Festival again

851
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,280
Haven't proposed successfully yet

852
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,880
Tried breaking up

853
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,559
But I just can't let her go

854
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,199
What else can I do

855
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,360
Keep working hard

856
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,679
Don't think I don't know

857
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,199
No matter how much you go home during the Chinese New Year

858
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,119
Just to accompany you

859
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:20,760
You're still here

860
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,199
Say bad things behind the scenes

861
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,039
Don't say it out

862
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,519
I'll tell her if I turn my head a little later

863
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,039
Drink some lemonade

864
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,519
Thanks

865
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,440
thank you

866
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,519
Such a large community

867
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,039
It's all the things

868
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,519
Their former city

869
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:43,880
If I weren't from Donghai

870
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,039
I can't recognize it at all

871
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,719
What is the past

872
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,239
Now it's ours

873
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,599
The market is too hot this year

874
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,920
City one machine now

875
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,199
Two workshops are being expanded

876
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,079
Go to us later

877
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:56,920
Guidance and guidance

878
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,119
I won't go

879
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,559
My Tengda is also ready to expand

880
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:01,719
no way

881
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:02,840
Too many orders

882
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,880
Can't do it at all

883
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,280
I don't understand

884
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,119
Which place is it

885
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,639
There is such a large consumer demand

886
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,079
How long can this demand last?

887
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,960
Will there be one day

888
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,119
It suddenly disappeared

889
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,760
Expand us vigorously

890
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,400
The subsequent production capacity

891
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,159
Let it stand in place

892
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,519
To be honest, I have this concern, too

893
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,519
It's been nearly two years

894
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,639
Gross domestic product grows rapidly

895
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,559
Demand is also expanding rapidly

896
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,280
We must catch up

897
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,320
There are so many factories across the country

898
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,239
You hesitate

899
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,039
Then the market was stolen by someone else

900
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:31,760
yes

901
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:33,960
I originally thought

902
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,760
Only the products of our own are selling well

903
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,119
But after get off work in the evening

904
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,119
I see other electromechanical companies

905
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,719
It's brightly lit

906
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,639
Work overtime

907
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
Orders are like snowflakes

908
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,320
Every family is expanding wildly

909
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,400
There is market vitality

910
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,719
The economic structure is not complete

911
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,320
I'm worried about breaking the car and running

912
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,559
Will it be one day

913
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,920
Suddenly it broke up

914
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,199
I'm studying economics

915
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,880
Just listen to mine.

916
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,039
Our company

917
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,840
Only passively cater to

918
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Actively expand

919
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,400
Keep up with the environment

920
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,960
As for the correct road planning

921
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:12,000
That's what the government should do

922
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,800
The top management is the one who understands the overall situation

923
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,320
Hello dad

924
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,039
The new home is almost done

925
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,760
Tomorrow is thirty

926
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,719
You see, I brought Bingbing

927
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,719
There are bubbles to go to your place

928
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,800
Or come and find us

929
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,199
You don't need to come to me

930
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,239
This is the New Year

931
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,280
You and Bingbing take advantage of this time

932
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,719
Have some relaxation

933
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:49,480
Let's talk about this year

934
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,760
I won't spend New Year's Eve in the East China Sea

935
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:53,559
Then where are you

936
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,119
I'm in Shanghai

937
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:56,920
Shanghai

938
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,400
Then when will you come back

939
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,039
Go back after the Spring Festival

940
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:03,119
About the fifth day of the lunar month

941
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,440
Then you're alone in Shanghai

942
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,599
Pay attention to safety

943
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,079
OK OK OK I know
