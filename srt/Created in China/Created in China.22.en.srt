1
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,799
worn out

2
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,640
It's home

3
00:01:56,878 --> 00:01:58,239
Or our East China Sea is cooler

4
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,759
Isn't that true

5
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,359
I'm so thirsty

6
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,039
You see

7
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,120
When we left, we just started broadcasting

8
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,560
It's almost finished now

9
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,800
They told me

10
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,039
This play is very good

11
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,240
I don't know if there is any replay

12
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,639
Such a good TV series

13
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,800
It will definitely be replayed

14
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,800
What are you doing

15
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,360
tidy

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,360
You flew for seven hours

17
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:37,759
You're not tired

18
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,400
You put it there first

19
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:40,719
Let's clean up tomorrow

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,560
It won't run long legs anyway

21
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,759
Whether it's tired or not

22
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,680
The first thing to do when you come back

23
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,840
Isn't it just packing your luggage

24
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,000
If you are tired, don't move

25
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,918
I'll help you clean up

26
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,840
Our living habits

27
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:55,240
It's really different

28
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,879
Can live together

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,599
It's also a miracle

30
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,400
I'll wash this for you

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,680
Wash it

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,360
You don't need to accommodate me

33
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,879
You're the same as before

34
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,919
Just throw it away

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,199
I'm there

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,478
Tell me the truth

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,319
Have you been unable to stay

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,879
Want to come back to work

39
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,400
Others go to the island for their honeymoon

40
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
All hope time

41
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,879
Can live a little slower

42
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,159
You're fine

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,840
Lying on the beach for a while

44
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,599
Just start talking about your lab

45
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,199
Don't know who it is

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,400
While taking a bath in the bathtub

47
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,639
I started to chant

48
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,119
This quarter's storage absorption mission

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Not meeting the standards yet

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,639
Give it to me

51
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,759
We're the life of working

52
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,000
Come in

53
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,319
President Song and Mr. Liu arrived

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,759
Mr. Song

55
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,599
Here comes

56
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,680
Come and sit

57
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,918
You go and I'll do it

58
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,599
good

59
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,759
How about it

60
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,960
How does your life feel after marriage

61
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,400
After getting the certificate, I'll finish the wedding

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,159
My heart becomes very stable

63
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:10,039
From now on, there will be two goals

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
One is honest

65
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Be someone's husband

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
One is to concentrate

67
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,160
Putting the scientific research and management of the

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Take another step forward

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,079
sit

70
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,839
Thanks

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,720
good

72
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,040
A job goal

73
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
A life goal

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,959
Both make sense

75
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:27,959
yes

76
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,680
Has the company branch been reselected?

77
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,120
Deputy General Manager Luo of the company

78
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,279
Election as branch secretary

79
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,600
Work has been started

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,240
Drink water

81
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,000
good

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,040
OK, it won't hurt your appetite

83
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,800
Liu Jun

84
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,639
Do you know Beiyuan Group

85
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,759
Of course I know

86
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,399
One of the best in Northeast China

87
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,519
Large machinery group

88
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,600
Old state-owned enterprises

89
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:08,720
It seems to be

90
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,160
Military to civilians

91
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:10,959
right

92
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,959
Mr. An, the top leader of Beiyuan Group

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,160
It was after the Cultural Revolution

94
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,199
The first batch of college students

95
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,199
It's also a technical job

96
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
He's always very optimistic

97
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,199
Donghai No. 1

98
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,600
Robot project

99
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,519
Just for themselves

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,199
Have concerns about R&D capabilities

101
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,800
I'll give him

102
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,399
Recommended you

103
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,560
Judging from his reaction

104
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,279
It should not be rejected

105
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,079
Joint development with Tengfei

106
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,439
Share technology in the future

107
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,600
Joint development

108
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,879
What you mean

109
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,360
Mr. An is willing to contribute to Tengfei

110
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,600
Don't be excited, too

111
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,199
This is just an idea at the moment

112
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,199
Not a decision

113
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,399
What about next week

114
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,159
Mr. An and I are in Beijing

115
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,399
Will attend the same meeting

116
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
The places where you live are also together

117
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,279
You

118
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,800
Go back and prepare relevant information

119
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,600
Bring to the hotel

120
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,480
Meet him

121
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,920
Try to first draw on Mr. An’s personal intentions

122
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:04,759
Confirm

123
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
OK No problem

124
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,759
I'll prepare right away

125
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,199
What I just introduced is

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,800
Takeo has achieved in recent years

127
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,680
Major patents and national awards

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,199
Leaders are precious

129
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,560
There are some small results

130
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,920
I won't list them all

131
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,879
All in the bound material

132
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,159
I've said it a long time ago

133
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
The person recommended by Mr. Song will not be wrong

134
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,279
Your vision is the ruler

135
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,800
There is no need at all

136
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,079
Let Xiao Liu run this time

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,959
Extra

138
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,040
It should be

139
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,279
Listening is false, seeing is true

140
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,199
Just listen to our two Wang Po selling melons

141
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,480
That certainly cannot count.

142
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,680
So I still hope Mr. An

143
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,920
Can come to the East China Sea in person

144
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,720
Check out his R&D center

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
What Mr. Song said doesn't count

146
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,199
Is there any word in the world that can be believed?

147
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,720
We must go to Donghai

148
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
But not to investigate

149
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,839
Go to study

150
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,480
Learn from your advanced experience of Mr. Song

151
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,519
Welcome

152
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,759
Let's learn from each other

153
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,839
Very good

154
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm flying

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,160
Awaiting all leaders

156
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,279
Visit to guide the work

157
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,920
This old an

158
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,519
I said it was unnecessary

159
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
But five technical experts came here

160
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,519
Obviously

161
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,720
Pay attention to this matter very much

162
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,600
I also see that Mr. An is very interested

163
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,680
But until he left

164
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,959
Didn't agree to cooperate clearly

165
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,600
only

166
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,879
Ask me to go to Beiyuan Group

167
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,160
Continue to talk in detail

168
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,360
Mr. Song

169
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,080
What do you think

170
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,879
What else does he want to talk about

171
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,558
This is the style of state-owned enterprises in the north

172
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,120
You get their territory

173
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,039
Take the last step and pass the last level

174
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,000
And what about them

175
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
We must also convene leadership teams

176
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,360
Let's discuss it

177
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,559
Take a walk

178
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,840
It's impossible to say too much in advance

179
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,679
Too

180
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,799
I tried to mention it today

181
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,960
Overall project budget

182
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,080
Even possible additions in the later stage

183
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,159
All counted

184
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,320
Mr. Ke An listened

185
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,519
Not even frowning

186
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,240
The financial strength of this state-owned enterprise

187
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,879
It's so strong

188
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,639
I've seen it

189
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,120
Your cooperation with this

190
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,200
It's ambition to win

191
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,360
but

192
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,159
I have to remind you in advance

193
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,559
Mr. An

194
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,159
Not very similar to me

195
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,240
You cooperation is cooperation

196
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,879
In terms of personal relationships

197
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,879
It's better to grasp a degree

198
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,559
Don't be too rigid

199
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,000
But don't mix it too much

200
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:01,960
This is me

201
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,519
MP3 (digital music player)

202
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,919
Why don't you make a sound

203
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,960
Liu Jun, please help me take a look

204
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,440
What's wrong

205
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
No more noise

206
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's change to a new one

207
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,000
Change a new loser

208
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,200
What’s wrong with you

209
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,840
After coming back, I was absent-minded

210
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:33,159
I don't know either

211
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,559
Am I thinking too much

212
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,080
But today Mr. Song said something

213
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,200
The more I think about it, the more I feel it has an inner meaning

214
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,360
What to say

215
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,519
He said Mr. An is not very similar to him

216
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,200
What's wrong with this sentence

217
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,440
After Mr. An came to inspect

218
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,240
Tell me to go over and discuss the contract next week

219
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,639
You know, too

220
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,480
What about internal discussion

221
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,759
Will it be successful in the end

222
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,480
It's still a matter of one sentence from the top leader

223
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,600
I just thought

224
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,120
Do you want to bring something over?

225
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,320
Express your expression to Mr. An

226
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,440
But

227
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,799
But you just met twice

228
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,600
Not very familiar with each other

229
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,120
You are afraid that he will reject your kindness

230
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,079
Instead, it's a waste of time

231
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:16,720
Yes or no

232
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,559
yes

233
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,200
I was a little hesitant, too

234
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,360
As a result, Mr. Song suddenly said this

235
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,399
I don't know what he said is different.

236
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,600
Which aspect is it

237
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,720
Do you care what he is

238
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,600
You mean it

239
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,480
It was originally one

240
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,799
Very normal thing

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,559
Even if he refuses

242
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,360
You've shown your feelings at least

243
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,200
Big brother

244
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,919
The nature of your two companies

245
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:44,679
no the same

246
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,200
Your and Mr. An’s personal gain

247
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,120
Different

248
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,360
You'll have bleeding when you should

249
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,360
From the perspective of personal gain

250
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,919
Mr. An is indeed different from me

251
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,759
Then what should I give

252
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,360
It's too cheap, can't be taken

253
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,038
Such a big project

254
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,879
Things worth tens of thousands of dollars

255
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,480
It's just like throwing a stone to ask for directions

256
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,879
Things worth tens of thousands of dollars

257
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm really

258
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,799
It's getting less and less

259
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,519
Let's continue discussing

260
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,279
All have to go to jail

261
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,519
Not that serious

262
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,279
Now at this critical moment

263
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,039
It's when you show your sincerity

264
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,639
You're too aloof and can't do anything

265
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:16,679
Please sit

266
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,360
Mr. An, please wait in the lounge

267
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,000
Thanks

268
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,559
Mr. Liu is here

269
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,000
Mr. An

270
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Wait for me a little

271
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,360
OK

272
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,519
Mr. An

273
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,399
Sorry, sorry

274
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,360
It's okay

275
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,279
Mr. Liu welcomes you

276
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,200
A good talent

277
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,000
Thanks

278
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,679
sit

279
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,080
It's been a few days

280
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,200
Many colleagues in the company

281
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,039
Tell me after you've gotten in touch

282
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,759
Tell me about your personality

283
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,039
Too different from one

284
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,600
The boss of a private enterprise in the south

285
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,360
Yeah

286
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,759
But today I'll see this

287
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,240
This is a bit like

288
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,080
Sit and sit

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,840
A small gift is not respected

290
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,679
I'll take a look

291
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,679
Mr. An

292
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,559
Our soaring scientific researchers

293
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,759
They are all very eager to participate in Donghai No. 1

294
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,759
Everyone is particularly grateful to Mr. An

295
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,840
Give me this opportunity

296
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,360
How beautiful this watch is

297
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,240
nice

298
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,080
Very expensive

299
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,279
Not expensive

300
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,440
nice one

301
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,679
I've received my heart

302
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,759
But I can't ask for this thing

303
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,120
You have to take back this watch

304
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,759
Mr. An

305
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,279
I have no other meaning

306
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,000
This is an ordinary watch

307
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,960
Don't let

308
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,080
I often come here

309
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,039
Get me to sign

310
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,279
We're not good at pushing and giving

311
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,279
Close

312
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,600
Let's talk about the contract first

313
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,440
Old Wei said you had been talking for three days

314
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,360
Talk very carefully

315
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,720
I've read all this

316
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,679
Old Wei told me

317
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,159
You care more

318
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,639
Issues about the amount of post-payment of cooperation

319
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,279
Yes

320
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,559
That's it

321
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,120
When the budget amount in the contract

322
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,440
When additional or changes are needed

323
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,360
In theory

324
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,000
Of course I need to reevaluate it

325
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,240
But scientific research investment

326
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,639
Continuity is important

327
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,320
Once the middle occurs

328
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,159
Stagnant or outage

329
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,080
The final result has a great impact

330
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,360
Understand

331
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,720
So you want to be in the beginning of the agreement

332
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,120
Just agree on a range of changes

333
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,519
Just add up

334
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,639
Within the scope

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,200
You can skip reevaluation

336
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,159
Pay directly

337
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,879
Yes Yes Yes

338
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,399
Deputy General Manager Wei and I

339
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,519
A discussion has been made

340
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,080
The scope of recognition by both parties

341
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,679
Article 7, Paragraph 6

342
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,559
Now wait for Mr. An, you can take a photo.

343
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,039
This old Wei is really careful

344
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,759
Just a small clause

345
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,360
You sit down

346
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,159
Just a small clause

347
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,279
Is it worth dragging you to talk for a day

348
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:32,879
It should be

349
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,039
Call the legal affairs person to come here

350
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,118
Contract with Tengfei

351
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,039
It's time to knock the chapter

352
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,880
Thank you Mr. An

353
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,480
Happy cooperation

354
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,118
Happy cooperation

355
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,319
Mr. Liu stamped it and took a look

356
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,279
Please trouble you

357
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,680
Thanks

358
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,279
Mr. An

359
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,119
Good day today

360
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:37,400
yes

361
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,079
Mr. An

362
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,119
Mr. Liu

363
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,519
Signed

364
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:42,559
Signed out

365
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,640
I've been busy for more than half a month

366
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,599
The hands are itchy

367
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:46,640
Play ball with me

368
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,359
Playing ball

369
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,640
Golf

370
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,799
But I can't play golf

371
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,480
Won't

372
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,960
Then just take a walk with me

373
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,759
good

374
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Please give you seafood tonight

375
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,000
I haven't treated you for several days

376
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,839
OK, I'll follow your arrangements

377
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,400
Good balls

378
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:15,960
good

379
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,559
Mr. An

380
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,319
Although I don't know much about the ball

381
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,359
But you hit that shot just now

382
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,519
Very straight

383
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,319
OK, I've started to understand the ball

384
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,920
Mr. Song has always attached importance to young talents

385
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,960
But it rarely works for people

386
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,039
Such a high rating

387
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
I really admire Mr. Song very much

388
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
Always treat him as my role model

389
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,519
And the lead man

390
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
I don't remember

391
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,759
Mr. Song’s daughter is better than my son

392
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,480
One year younger

393
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,039
Where is she reading now

394
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,200
I heard only last year

395
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,319
Take the high school entrance examination

396
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:55,319
Don't know

397
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,559
Which school did you take the exam?

398
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,720
Mr. Na'an, your son

399
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,319
One year older than Mr. Song's daughter

400
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,440
I'll have to take the college entrance exam next year

401
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,839
You asked just now

402
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,759
It's my biggest heart disease

403
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,319
Don't look at me and Mr. Song.

404
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,359
But I'm one round older than him

405
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,759
I'm the third

406
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,720
When I graduated

407
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,799
Already in his thirties

408
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,599
At that moment I was thinking about it

409
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,519
Work hard and career

410
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,240
Ignore the family

411
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,240
Don't take care of the children

412
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,319
Wait for remembering

413
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,599
That child's grades are a mess

414
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,960
Then simply

415
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,839
Don't let him take the college entrance examination

416
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,079
Graduated from junior high school

417
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,279
Let him study in Australia

418
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,119
yes

419
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,519
College entrance examination is not easy

420
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,160
Studying abroad is also very hard

421
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,480
When I was in Germany

422
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,519
Not enough money from home

423
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,039
It's all about working part-time

424
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,119
Earn some living expenses

425
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,200
Life is very hard

426
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,200
Who is not

427
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,480
Don't think I'm in such a big group

428
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,519
That's a dead salary

429
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,519
Just pay it all for the children

430
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,319
How many can there be

431
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,880
so

432
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,319
I have to feel wronged that he is there

433
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,119
Living a hard life

434
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,000
As a young man

435
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,680
Just treat it as a tempering

436
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,640
nice shot

437
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,160
OK Mr. An

438
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,039
Mr. Wei

439
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,000
Mr. Liu

440
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,720
What's the matter in the office?

441
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,119
I have a private matter

442
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,480
Want to ask Mr. Wei for advice

443
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,000
Private affairs

444
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,480
Yes, Yes, Yes, Come on

445
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,880
That's it

446
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Everything is done

447
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,720
Just get the account

448
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,160
I'm packing my stuff

449
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,119
I know it's winter there

450
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,599
All of them are wearing thick clothes

451
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,839
round trip

452
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,079
About a week

453
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,279
OK, let's talk about it later

454
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,759
Received

455
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,000
The first phase of Beiyuan funds have arrived

456
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,920
It's worthy of being a big state-owned enterprise

457
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,200
More money will be received quickly

458
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,119
But when I got the electronic bill

459
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,720
Their finances told me

460
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,400
Kitahara also has its own difficulties

461
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
They've been in the first half of the year

462
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,200
Overall loss

463
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,119
Not particularly good business conditions

464
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,799
Such a big company in Kitahara

465
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,480
Why shouldn't you lose money

466
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,200
I'm not going to ask about it in detail

467
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,519
Anyway

468
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,319
We got the funds

469
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Just use it well

470
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,680
There should be nothing left

471
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,119
Let's go

472
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,359
cell phone

473
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,559
Don't forget

474
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,680
The one I asked you to buy

475
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,880
Australian sheep oil

476
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,240
Cashmere sweater cashmere scarf

477
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,480
You've said it eight times

478
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,319
I also asked you to buy a wool coat

479
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,839
Just didn't remember

480
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,440
OK

481
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,400
I'll carry you another lamb leg back

482
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,599
Look how fresh this is

483
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,519
Goose Goose

484
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,559
Song of song towards the sky

485
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,759
White hair floating in green water

486
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,319
Red palm splashes clear waves

487
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,000
Clear the wave

488
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,880
It's great, we read it very well

489
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,720
Teacher Fu

490
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,640
A friend of mine said

491
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,640
The city has recently adjusted its policies

492
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,759
I have already admitted your group

493
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,000
Qualification of substitute teacher

494
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,799
Acknowledge us

495
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,559
yes

496
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,960
Not only admitted

497
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,799
And a private teacher has been established

498
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,200
Insurance Benefit Fund

499
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,920
Improve your retirement method

500
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,160
Include you in

501
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,559
In a project of pension insurance

502
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,519
Payment from the city

503
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,519
After paying for one year

504
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,960
Monthly subsidies

505
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,279
What about the issuance standard

506
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,359
With the local

507
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,119
Disposable income linkage

508
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,000
Currently, it is five hundred and seven per month

509
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,839
this

510
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,400
I went there yesterday

511
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,279
Insurance information has been put

512
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
Received it for you

513
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,599
You are in these places

514
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,359
Sign up

515
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,799
After approval

516
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:05,119
Go with me to go through the procedures

517
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,000
Just do it

518
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,160
You have a look first

519
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,640
The government pays for us

520
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,680
Is this true

521
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:20,759
It's true

522
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,480
Since it has been admitted

523
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,400
Your qualifications

524
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,559
This money is OK

525
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,200
Expenditure from the Education Bureau

526
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,960
Educational expenses

527
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,880
educate

528
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,599
The government finally admits that I am a teacher

529
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,839
Finally admitted

530
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,640
I

531
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,680
You are the teacher, Mr. Fu

532
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,720
Teacher Fu

533
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,599
Two people walk slowly

534
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,799
Then if there is something

535
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,680
Just call me anytime

536
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,599
Walk slowly

537
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,960
How are there selected ones

538
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,920
No, no

539
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,359
The existing room in Lujiazui is just a corner

540
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
Now it's over 30,000

541
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,920
But the newly opened room

542
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:52,880
Will be cheaper

543
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,720
Do you want to see

544
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,880
Hongying, look

545
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,000
I have so many apartments in Donghai

546
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,359
Is it necessary to buy a house in Shanghai?

547
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,079
Of course I'll buy it

548
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,559
House prices will rise

549
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:07,960
You see

550
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,880
That old house

551
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,359
When the housing reform was carried out in 1995

552
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,079
Less than one thousand yuan per square meter

553
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,680
Look at it now

554
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,400
Someone is rushing to buy 4,000 yuan

555
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,359
Hongming said

556
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,079
To maintain your private wealth

557
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,160
The most effective method

558
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,440
It's about buying a real estate

559
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Never leave it in the bank

560
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,279
He was in Shanghai again last month

561
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,079
Invested in two sets

562
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:33,319
real

563
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,480
How much does your brother earn in a year

564
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,000
How much money to make

565
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,960
What does he do

566
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,880
What futures

567
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,000
Money is so fast

568
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,680
Come on, come on, help me choose

569
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,920
I'll choose for you

570
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,599
Yes Yes Yes

571
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,559
I'll help you choose

572
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,079
Do you like this

573
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,640
Border household

574
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,599
I like the quiet side house

575
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,240
Actually, choosing a house

576
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
The most important thing is to see it

577
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,839
The appreciation potential of the property

578
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,759
Your word is so small

579
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:15,920
Look

580
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:18,160
There are two big shopping malls here, right

581
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,200
A subway exit is the subway

582
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,559
It's convenient

583
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:23,640
This property in the future

584
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,839
It will definitely rise

585
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,960
Just one hundred and two

586
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,000
Then I'll calculate the discount for you

587
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:35,799
OK OK OK

588
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,240
I'll tell you

589
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,359
The real estate market is good now

590
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,279
But the rent doesn't increase

591
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,000
The money for buying a house is there

592
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,799
Calculate the rental return rate

593
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,640
Really worse

594
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,559
I'll get a lot of money by buying a new stock

595
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,400
Hongming said the same

596
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,200
Yes

597
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,279
right

598
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,880
He always asks me to take out the money

599
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,480
Give him money to trade futures

600
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,000
Say you make a lot faster and more money

601
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,160
But I don't dare

602
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,440
Always feel it

603
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,078
I have to buy a house

604
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,720
Can be seen and touched

605
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,599
That's peace of mind

606
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,359
you're right

607
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,119
I'll tell you

608
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,240
I'm the one who listens to you the most

609
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,799
Wait for this house to be obtained in the future

610
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,200
You have a home in Shanghai

611
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,119
We have a home in Shanghai

612
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:22,799
Stop talking

613
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Calculate

614
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,079
Ice Ice

615
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,079
Bingbing is here to eat

616
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,839
Here comes

617
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,960
This bun is still steaming

618
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,640
It's their family

619
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,200
The last few

620
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,279
That's not

621
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,240
What time is it

622
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,039
They closed the door after selling it

623
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,799
The durian you want to eat

624
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,759
I went to several places but didn't sell

625
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,599
After going to work in the mall tomorrow

626
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,559
I'll go and ask again

627
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,519
Need not

628
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,480
What do I want to eat tomorrow

629
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,400
Not sure yet

630
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,559
What do you want to eat when you are pregnant

631
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,599
I've heard of it all

632
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,880
I want to eat durian

633
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,279
This is the first time I've heard of it

634
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,599
My dad's pickled winter melon is also good

635
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,240
Why did you say that

636
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,079
So disgusting you

637
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,359
Power outage again

638
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,799
That's not

639
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,319
It's been the third time this week

640
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,920
Even this technology park is like this

641
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,160
Industrial areas are even more overwhelming

642
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,920
I don't know about this power shortage

643
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,319
When will it end

644
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,039
What's wrong

645
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,240
It feels a bit bad today

646
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,680
I don't want to eat it anymore

647
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,000
No

648
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,119
You eat

649
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,480
Go to bed early

650
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,480
Quiet Quiet Quiet

651
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,559
Everyone, calm down

652
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,640
Have this meeting today

653
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,400
Just understand the situation

654
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,119
Don't worry, everyone

655
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,759
Say it slowly one by one

656
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,680
Director Xu

657
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,480
Although there were power outages in previous years

658
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,480
But I'll give you a notice before stopping

659
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,200
But this year, it will be stopped at every three days

660
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,000
Sometimes there is no notification

661
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,039
If an injury occurs

662
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,640
Whose responsibility is

663
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,960
Yes, Director Xu

664
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,440
Electricity is tight in summer

665
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,599
We can understand this

666
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,319
Turn on the air conditioner when the weather is hot

667
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,279
High power consumption

668
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:57,960
But it's winter now

669
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,200
This situation of power shortage

670
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,519
Still not relieved

671
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,640
We must stick to it

672
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,480
When will it be

673
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,400
Yes, is it still over?

674
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,599
Dear everyone

675
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,599
Dear bosses

676
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,240
Dear factory managers

677
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,799
I can understand everyone's mood

678
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:15,039
But this power shortage appears

679
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,960
Not just because

680
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,279
More air conditioners turned on

681
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,480
This is a comprehensive question

682
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,039
There are all kinds of reasons

683
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,400
First of all

684
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,559
From last year to now

685
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,200
It's been drought

686
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,039
Reservoir storage capacity is urgent

687
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,279
Local hydropower

688
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:33,680
Greatly reduced

689
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,079
second

690
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,079
State control of small coal mines

691
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,880
Reduced coal production

692
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,880
Thermal power plant

693
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,680
No rice to the pot

694
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:43,359
third

695
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,440
Due to environmental reasons

696
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,359
The third power plant in Donghai is shut down and repaired

697
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,000
Prepare to burn coal

698
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,640
It's changed to burn natural gas

699
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,000
All three power supplies are shut down

700
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,559
At this time, it's still environmentally friendly

701
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
How can we live

702
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,480
that is

703
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:58,440
at last

704
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,400
It's also the most fundamental reason

705
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:03,000
That is the rapid economic growth

706
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,680
Our local substation

707
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,119
Can bear load

708
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,599
Nowhere near keep up

709
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,160
Electricity demand has increased

710
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,680
Invest in the construction of a new substation

711
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,559
It will take some construction time

712
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,079
According to our estimate

713
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,440
As fast as 2006

714
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,599
Only put into use

715
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,720
2006

716
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,640
This is a day when power outages happen

717
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,279
It will take two more years

718
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,319
I can understand everyone's difficulties very well

719
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,880
What about our management committee

720
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,640
Will definitely urge the power supply unit

721
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,440
Accelerate transformation and construction

722
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,279
That's the situation now

723
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,240
Please prepare, too

724
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,039
At least for the next two years

725
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,839
This shutter limits power

726
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:42,319
It will still be the norm

727
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:42,880
this

728
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,599
How can I persist in the past two years

729
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,559
Two years normal

730
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,480
I can't hold on for two months

731
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,200
You have to think of a solution for us

732
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,119
What should we do about this

733
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,400
This factory is going to be ruined

734
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,400
Stop two and open five

735
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,759
Mr. Liu

736
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,079
Our temporary generator

737
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,880
There is no way to do it at all

738
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,920
Production of the supply workshop

739
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,960
You can wait for anything else

740
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,839
I don't have to wait for anyone.

741
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:08,720
Lao Xu

742
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,359
The two diesel generators I ordered

743
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,319
When will the goods arrive

744
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,880
Now there is a general electricity shortage

745
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,559
Our orders are still in line

746
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,680
Waiting for two months and still queuing

747
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,960
There is no way Mr. Liu

748
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:19,960
Their production capacity is half

749
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,039
All were given an exit

750
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,920
I urge our orders every day

751
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:23,920
Urge them to push forward

752
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,160
Just promise us at the end of next month

753
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,200
Ship to us

754
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,200
That won't work

755
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Many export orders

756
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,680
No room for negotiation

757
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,160
Let's load the ship one day later

758
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,960
Foreign businessmen can refuse payment directly

759
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
Once this happens

760
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,960
Then the loss is gone

761
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,599
Increase the code

762
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,640
Extraordinary increase

763
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,119
Spend money at all costs

764
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,200
Within this week

765
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,680
The generator must be in place

766
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,759
good

767
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,759
Ajun Ajun Ajun

768
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:56,920
I'll listen to Luo Qing's speech

769
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,160
You want to buy two diesel generators

770
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,920
Prepare to spend several times the money to grab it

771
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,440
There is no way to not smash it

772
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:04,960
The factory is about to lose power

773
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:05,640
Urgent use

774
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:06,799
Don't spend money randomly

775
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,440
You need to find the right place, right

776
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,599
To hit the blade

777
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,800
Then what do you think is the blade

778
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,119
I'll do this, I know

779
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,920
Don't worry about it

780
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:19,960
Leave it alone to me

781
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,920
Wait for my news

782
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,880
Run two steps

783
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,159
How about it

784
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,320
I found out from the warehouse

785
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,400
Two machines will be shipped tomorrow

786
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,719
Sent to Anqing

787
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,280
Which logistics company

788
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:58,880
Datong

789
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,159
It is all the transportation in our factory

790
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,280
OK

791
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,360
Thank you for your hard work, brother

792
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,920
Go back

793
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,920
Help

794
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,159
Help, right

795
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:22,920
It's really difficult

796
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,000
Boss Liu

797
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,599
We are all doing business

798
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,519
What's the point

799
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,159
I should help you

800
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:29,840
But give it to me

801
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,320
This request was made

802
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,559
It's really hard for me to do it

803
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,599
this

804
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:36,880
I

805
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,599
boss

806
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,440
This is a list, please take a look

807
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:41,719
You get off work

808
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,159
OK, I'll leave first

809
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,000
Look

810
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,559
We are doing transportation and logistics

811
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,159
This one has picked up the goods

812
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,079
That end has to be delivered safely

813
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,639
You said there was a circle in between

814
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,159
Run to your factory

815
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,800
I can't ship to someone else

816
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,559
Let me explain

817
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,719
Why didn't you explain

818
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
This goods entered our Tengfei Factory

819
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,960
We take this responsibility

820
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:14,960
You can rest assured this

821
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,480
Tell them

822
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,880
When this batch of goods passes through the East China Sea

823
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,280
Being a local snake

824
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,159
Liushitang

825
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,280
Give it a disaster

826
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,360
Has a disaster

827
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,440
I'll tell people about "Water Margin"

828
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:27,480
this

829
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,679
Mr. Dai

830
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,079
Generators

831
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,880
It's not a non-standard product after all

832
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,199
Sell to whom it is not sold

833
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,199
I'll tell you

834
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,320
This generator

835
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,280
Enter our Tengfei Factory

836
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,320
It's impossible for me to quit

837
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,840
We've paid all the money, right

838
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,039
The easiest way

839
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,719
Just recognize it

840
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,360
Right

841
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,519
You can't place an order at the worst

842
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,760
Which one you sent to Anqing

843
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,440
Isn't it over?

844
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,440
How simple

845
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,159
For two generators

846
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,440
He fought with me for a lawsuit

847
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,400
Is it worth it or not

848
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,480
Do business

849
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,039
Is it right to be kind to make money

850
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,960
OK OK OK

851
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,199
Two generators

852
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,078
What a big deal

853
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,679
Be careful, be careful

854
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,039
The old factory manager has many ways

855
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,360
He taught me another vivid lesson

856
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,559
The urgent problem is solved

857
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,719
Is the production cost rising?

858
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,719
This generator

859
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,159
It's not diesel burning

860
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,559
That's white silver

861
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:28,119
Profits in our manufacturing industry

862
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,239
It's already meager

863
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:30,920
This cost will be overwhelmed

864
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,598
I can't make any money

865
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,800
Would rather make a profit

866
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:34,760
Can't give up

867
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,840
The market already occupied

868
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,000
All are optimistic

869
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,159
I believe the difficulties are only temporary

870
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,719
The country wants to develop the economy

871
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,199
These supporting conditions

872
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,159
All basic needs

873
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,960
It will definitely improve slowly

874
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,480
Hot water bag

875
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,719
Come in quickly

876
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,320
The quilt is cool enough

877
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,360
Generators can only be supplied

878
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,400
Workshops and laboratories

879
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,719
Can't be distributed to the villa

880
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,679
You're still pregnant with a child

881
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm frozen in every few days

882
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:27,760
Not OK

883
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,320
Or we can move back to the city

884
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,840
Now the government protects people's livelihood first

885
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:39,920
Reinsurance production

886
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,000
It should be in the city

887
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,360
There won't be power outages so often

888
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,639
I've thought about this, too

889
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,480
But my dad

890
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,039
Rent my house

891
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,599
Have someone refund the rent in advance

892
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,519
It's also causing trouble for others

893
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,119
Then live there

894
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,280
My transportation is convenient

895
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,360
The environment is good too

896
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,559
Just a little smaller area

897
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,079
Sorry Bingbing

898
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,280
They are all working hard for careers

899
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,880
The Hiroaki Family

900
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,360
Already moved to the top of the city

901
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,000
We're married for a year

902
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,159
Now I have to move back

903
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,400
The small apartment you had before your marriage

904
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,880
to be honest

905
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,199
I'm really unbalanced

906
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,199
But not for me

907
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,880
It's for you

908
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,079
What you get is far more than what you pay

909
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,119
Too much less

910
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,599
Not fair at all

911
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,760
I don't feel wronged

912
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,679
It's the path you choose

913
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:57,880
You know the bitterness and bitterness

914
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,280
I know

915
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,239
So that little bit

916
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,440
A sense of imbalance

917
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,039
It disappeared soon

918
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,000
And I believe

919
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,920
From a long-term perspective

920
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,639
My husband

921
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,599
Must be better than Carrie's husband

922
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,440
Whether it's spiritual

923
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,280
Or on a material level

924
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,159
Then I have to work hard if you say that

925
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,559
I have to go to Beiyuan after the Spring Festival

926
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,440
The second phase of funds are allocated by the Chief of Aggression

927
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,679
Now their company is in this situation

928
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:45,360
There is definitely no money approval

929
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,400
It was so easy before

930
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,960
Beiyuan's business conditions

931
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,360
Still so bad

932
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,760
It's all cold winter

933
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,239
Come and sit

934
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,679
I've held countless meetings

935
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,519
Few see everyone

936
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,119
So enthusiastic

937
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,599
It seems that our exchange meeting

938
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,639
Very successful

939
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,559
According to this R&D speed

940
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,039
Will the results be produced in advance

941
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:00,800
Technology research and development

942
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,239
It's not a constant speed process

943
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,159
All I can say

944
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,559
The current progress is more than expected

945
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,559
A little faster

946
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,719
But the final completion time

947
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,440
Not likely to be ahead of schedule

948
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,840
After all, so much workload

949
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,800
There

950
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:16,840
Mr. An

951
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:20,159
From the perspective of communication with various departments

952
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,880
It seems everyone hopes

953
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,519
Can produce products faster

954
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:25,960
I can understand this feeling very much

955
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,840
I will ensure quality

956
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,239
Try to compress time

957
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,880
No, no

958
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,679
Don't want your research and development

959
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,000
Influenced by our side

960
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,559
Donghai No. 1

961
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,639
Not only Mr. Song

962
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,280
A project I've been looking forward to for many years

963
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,880
It's also what our country has been looking forward to

964
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,760
A product

965
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,320
So we must do our best

966
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,679
Reach the highest level

967
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,880
My knowledge is a bit aging

968
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,480
But I know

969
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,880
The scientific attitude is rigorous

970
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,519
You follow your pace

971
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,199
Don't care about one more month

972
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,559
Even one more quarter

973
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:01,159
Few people can do this like you, Mr. An

974
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,000
Really understand

975
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:04,519

976
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,000
With your words

977
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:07,039
Now I'll

978
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,679
I feel more confident
