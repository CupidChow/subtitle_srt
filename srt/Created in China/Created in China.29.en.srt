1
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:54,840
Add this

2
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,120
Your money here is mine

3
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,719
It's already 500,000 or 600,000

4
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,719
Do you want it

5
00:01:59,319 --> 00:01:59,719
Take it home together

6
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,799
Manage for your parents

7
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,799
Need not

8
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,400
It's better if you help save it

9
00:02:08,158 --> 00:02:08,840
All right

10
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,000
We're this weekend

11
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,360
Planning to go out for an outing and barbecue

12
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,759
Do you want to bring it with you

13
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,759
Little peach came over together

14
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,120
never mind

15
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,000
I've been lately

16
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,478
Don't want to go out

17
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:35,840
Then you really don't want to move

18
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,120
I'll take the little peach over

19
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,918
Bubble has been making noise recently

20
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,039
Want to play with your sister

21
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,240
Good too

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,478
Then I'll bother you and Bingbing

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,639
fine

24
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,759
All asleep

25
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:38,800
Finally got to sleep

26
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,560
Little Taozi was having a crazy time today

27
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,879
My voice was hoarse

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,240
How introverted she is

29
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,719
Still a child

30
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,439
Stay at home with your mother for a long time

31
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,840
Don't see outsiders or contact society

32
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:58,960
This goes on

33
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:00,479
It's really not good

34
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
yes

35
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,879
This weekend

36
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,360
Still reading the report

37
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,840
Bank reserve rate

38
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,960
Already adjusted to the highest point in history

39
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,439
This amount is tight

40
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,040
The review is also more stringent

41
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,319
The workload is full every day

42
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,720
I can only go home after

43
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,360
Let's take a look at these analysis reports

44
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,160
Thank you so much

45
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,680
Come

46
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,560
Then I'll go and rest first

47
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,639
You wait for me

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,959
I'll take a break with you

49
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,639
Don't you still have to read the report

50
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,519
Nothing better than you

51
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,240
What's wrong with speaking so numb

52
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,040
On the bank

53
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,240
Is there no news at all

54
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,639
knew

55
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,959
I'll think of another way

56
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:40,800
Liu Jun

57
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,240
I heard of Taozi

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
Weekends at your house

59
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,319
It's causing you trouble

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,240
The child was taken last Friday

61
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,720
You've just heard it now

62
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:54,839
Are you

63
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,079
Haven't been home for several days

64
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,920
Don't think about it

65
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,199
I've really been working lately

66
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,040
No time to do anything else

67
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:04,959
Where are you

68
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,120
Where else can it be

69
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,000
Of course, I'm in the company when I go to work

70
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
I'll come to find you

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,160
Have something to talk to you

72
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,959
OK, come on

73
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,600
Are you sick

74
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,879
So bad

75
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,959
I'm not sick

76
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,680
Copper futures have fallen too hard recently

77
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,439
Must stay up late to watch the plate

78
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,480
bring it on

79
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,480
Wake up with a cup of coffee

80
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,480
You said you

81
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,480
months ago

82
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,399
Said me speechless

83
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,560
Now I am worried about this

84
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,759
Your financial market

85
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,720
I really don't understand

86
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,639
My dad told me yesterday

87
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,439
The stock index has reached 6,000 points

88
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,519
Your futures

89
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,839
How could it fall so badly

90
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,480
Not just futures

91
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,839
Second-hand housing transactions also fell to the bottom

92
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,000
Nothing at all in the past

93
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,720
The grand occasion of the golden September and silver October

94
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,639
Our company's capital chain

95
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,600
Something went wrong

96
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,360
Do you have six million on hand

97
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,120
The best cash

98
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,000
If not

99
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,040
Please issue a letter of credit for me

100
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,560
Our company's quota

101
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,639
Already reached the top

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Can't open it

103
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,360
cash

104
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
There is definitely no cash

105
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,319
The heat treatment center is being expanded recently

106
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,959
Money is being used everywhere

107
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,600
Bank monetary tightens

108
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:53,920
I can only open it for you

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,879
Three months letter of credit

110
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,000
Is it OK

111
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,399
That's great

112
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,319
It's only three months

113
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,879
I'm not polite to you

114
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,319
Follow with other companies

115
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,279
The same number of points

116
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,120
Pay your agency fee

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,160
Agent fees are not required

118
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,519
You find a time

119
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,399
Send someone here

120
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,600
Financial connection with me

121
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,639
Thank you

122
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,399
Things are resolved

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,120
OK

124
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,959
Don't drink coffee

125
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,120
Go home and go to bed quickly

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,519
good

127
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,279
Then I'll leave first

128
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,560
Take the clothes

129
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,279
Thanks

130
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,200
What a big deal

131
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,279
Bye-Bye

132
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,960
Eat

133
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't eat it anymore

134
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,559
Carrie should be at home

135
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,159
Why doesn't she answer the phone

136
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,799
Such a big brother and sister

137
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,639
What's so strange about going out for a walk

138
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,320
Right

139
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,799
Whoever stipulates that she must stay at home

140
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,559
Right

141
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,120
She has been in a bad mood over the past few months

142
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,159
It's a good thing to be willing to go out

143
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,240
Last week

144
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,720
I went to the villa

145
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,960
You don't know

146
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,799
Her mental state

147
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
Isn't this a little bit?

148
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,279
Let's take a look at the direction of the opening in the afternoon

149
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,399
The index is 6,000

150
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,440
Are you not afraid

151
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,519
Don't be afraid

152
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,440
I'll tell you

153
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
You'll see the price

154
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,279
Three thousand

155
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,840
Everyone says it's too expensive to afford it

156
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,240
When it was five thousand, someone said

157
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,039
What a bubble to say

158
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
What's going to crash

159
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,639
Look at it now

160
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,320
A house worth ten thousand square meters

161
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,720
Crazy robbery

162
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,200
The stock market is the same

163
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,000
You think six thousand is a high position

164
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,120
The next month is 8,000

165
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,399
Not to the top yet

166
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,000
Not the top of the mountain

167
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:01,840
Just halfway up the mountain

168
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,440
I know better than you if I sell a house

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,600
House prices are now available

170
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,840
Signs of decline

171
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,399
Several branches this month

172
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,519
All are zero deals

173
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,559
There is absolutely no situation

174
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,120
You imagined it was so optimistic

175
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,559
I know I know

176
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,759
Observation

177
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,559
I'll observe

178
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,440
Hate

179
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,399
Eat and eat

180
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,679
Eat some more

181
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,960
Have a meal

182
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:44,840
Jiali

183
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,080
I'm back

184
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,960
Jiali

185
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,720
A business trip a few days ago

186
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,519
I bought one for you intently

187
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,759
Lucky little hairpin card

188
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,600
Bless you to have a smooth and smooth life

189
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,480
Peaceful and safe

190
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,399
Come on, I'll put it on for you

191
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,679
Is it good looking

192
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,159
nice

193
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,440
Stop her stop her

194
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,559
Hello, please wait a moment

195
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,679
What's wrong

196
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:49,960
Hello

197
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,360
I am

198
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
I know Shen Jiali

199
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,879
What

200
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,440
Comrade police officer

201
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,399
Have you made a mistake

202
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,639
My friend

203
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,279
Her family doesn't lack money at all

204
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,200
How could she do it

205
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,559
What about theft

206
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,200
Not everyone who steals things

207
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,399
It's all because of lack of money

208
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,600
Have you heard of stole

209
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,039
Our colleagues are investigating

210
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,080
See if she has any previous studies

211
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,159
Absolutely no

212
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,399
Absolutely no

213
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,320
My friend, she recently

214
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,480
Not very good with her husband

215
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,159
Maybe mentally trance

216
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
But it's absolutely impossible to steal something

217
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
No quirks

218
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
What about this

219
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Not big in itself

220
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,000
Found it in the supermarket

221
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,559
She wears unpaid goods

222
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:37,960
I just want to see her bag

223
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,519
Have you hidden anything else

224
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,159
But this lady is very uncooperable

225
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,200
The supermarket cannot search for bags

226
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,559
So I had to call the police

227
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,279
That's it

228
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,720
Surveillance videos in the supermarket

229
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,440
Has been sent

230
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,559
Let's finish reading first

231
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,080
Thank you very much

232
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,559
I didn't steal

233
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,399
Liu Jun, I didn't steal

234
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,480
I really didn't steal

235
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,879
I really didn't steal

236
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,320
It's okay, Jiali

237
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,360
Look at my bag

238
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,399
You see

239
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:13,559
Look at my bag

240
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,720
Nothing to them

241
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,639
Liu Jun didn't have it at all

242
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,919
It's okay

243
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:19,679
All over

244
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,639
All over

245
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,360
fine

246
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:23,960
fine

247
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,759
All over

248
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,559
This is the case, no one else blames you

249
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,679
All capital city Hiroaki

250
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,639
Liu Jun

251
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,360
Don't tell others, okay

252
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,399
well

253
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,720
Hiroaki Abura

254
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,519
Don't tell Bingbing either

255
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,639
I won't say it

256
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,080
But Hongming is responsible to you

257
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,240
Hiroaki and others are not good at receiving this

258
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,000
Always talking to sleep at night

259
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,319
Not good-looking

260
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,559
I'm actually very worried about him

261
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,680
You said he was alone

262
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,839
Under such a great pressure

263
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,358
I can't help with anything

264
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:25,319
yes

265
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,720
I've seen him today, too

266
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,479
But don't worry

267
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,799
He is

268
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,400
Work has been too hard recently

269
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,720
No big problem

270
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,799
You two

271
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,519
All need to be adjusted

272
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,799
For each other and for the child

273
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,359
OK

274
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,799
It's okay, Jiali

275
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,240
fine

276
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,720
Thank you

277
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,039
The market

278
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,039
After a continuous decline of several days

279
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,079
Finally welcoming

280
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,160
A rare rebound

281
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,319
The Shanghai Composite Index closed today

282
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,319
Five thousand four hundred and twelve points

283
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,039
A sharp rise of 4.94%

284
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,640
Trading volume increased compared to yesterday

285
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,960
The stock market has fallen for more than a month

286
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,319
My dad has been buying at the bottom and waiting for the rebound

287
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,759
I don't know if it bounced back

288
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,440
Let him have a meal

289
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,079
Dad, stop watching and have a meal

290
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,799
Still blue chip stocks in the market

291
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,279
But the shortcomings are

292
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,440
This rebound

293
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,160
No significant increase in volume

294
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
So how to judge

295
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
What is the current market trend

296
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,359
I think

297
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,440
The market rebounded sharply today

298
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,079
It is an oversold nature

299
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,640
These stock analysts

300
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,559
Talk very well every day

301
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,480
In fact, ordinary retail investors

302
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,079
Isn't that just luck?

303
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,559
Put it in your eyes

304
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:18,920
Clip yourself

305
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,799
Sit there and there

306
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,079
What's the situation very serious

307
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,880
Dad, we have been teaching Xiaopupao

308
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,479
Can't watch TV while eating

309
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:33,759
You can't be a bad example

310
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,559
Know

311
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,039
I don't believe in those things either

312
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,759
I just watched it casually

313
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,759
Not that I'm talking about you

314
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:43,039
Your status really needs to be adjusted

315
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,119
My dad said

316
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,759
The easiest thing you are at your age

317
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,319
It's cardiovascular disease

318
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,359
Not only should you pay attention to your diet and rest

319
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,240
And there's not too much pressure

320
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,839
Otherwise, hypertension stroke

321
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,279
This is really not a joke

322
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,519
My in-laws are an expert in this field

323
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,960
I have to listen to him

324
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:58,519
Yes

325
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,680
Then don't think about having a good meal

326
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,440
OK OK OK

327
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,440
Get me that

328
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,680
Get that for you

329
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,119
Bingbing, I'll tell you

330
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm ready for the funds

331
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,759
Buy on dips

332
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,079
After this rebound

333
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,400
I'll clear the stock soon

334
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,599
Don't play anymore

335
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,359
I don't want to make money

336
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,400
Just pay less

337
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,119
How much pressure is there now

338
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
Have to leave

339
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,599
I have to make my life

340
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,359
Keep it

341
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,960
Yes or no

342
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,519
Don't eat or sleep

343
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,039
You're not as sensible as Bubble

344
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,160
Yes or no

345
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:26,920
Let's have a meal

346
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,119
Eat and eat

347
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,599
Don't say it, don't say it

348
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,759
Bubble and eat

349
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:39,039
Invested in such a big project

350
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,039
Don't tell me

351
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,920
Something went wrong and remembered me

352
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,640
What's the problem

353
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,559
only

354
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,200
It's just that the funds are tight

355
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,200
Mr. Money

356
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,160
Renovate such a building

357
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,160
You have to invest 100 million

358
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,720
More than 100 million

359
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,680
How much does that cost

360
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,279
I'm alone

361
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,680
It must be unbearable

362
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,319
Half of these shares

363
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,720
It's helping several clients to support it

364
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,680
They have special identities

365
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,359
Not convenient for public participation

366
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,839
A regular approach

367
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,720
Just find someone like me

368
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,640
agent

369
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,880
Risk

370
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,319
What about the risks

371
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,920
Futures stocks are falling now

372
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
Your own capital chain

373
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:27,920
All have problems

374
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,920
Now I have to start managing private lending again

375
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,000
This is too risky

376
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Don't worry

377
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,839
Stocks and futures

378
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,000
It won't keep falling

379
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,440
This project

380
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,559
There is no big risk

381
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:58,880
sister

382
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,200
Completed this project

383
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,000
We both have the rest of our lives

384
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,559
No need to work hard

385
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,799
All can retire early

386
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,559
We used to be a family of four

387
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,079
Living in fifteen square meters

388
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
Now we don't have it

389
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,599
Your own villa car

390
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
I also have my own store and business

391
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,480
The money you make

392
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,079
Mom and Dad and Me

393
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,680
I didn't even dare to think about it before

394
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,160
Hiroaki

395
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:37,000
Do you think you're not making enough money

396
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,079
We'll invest in it now

397
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,039
Take this risk

398
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,240
Is it worth it

399
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,920
Because we were too poor before

400
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,200
So I encountered such an opportunity

401
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,319
It should be seized more

402
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,839
I can't let us

403
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,319
Back to the past

404
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,160
Even if there is a slight possibility

405
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:00,960
None of them can do it

406
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,759
sister

407
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:11,039
A timid step is hard to move

408
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:15,960
This is a risk worth taking

409
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,119
You borrow money from private

410
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,559
How much interest can they be given

411
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,839
You guys come and talk about economic trends

412
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,039
As a result, the opening and closing

413
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,400
All real estate markets

414
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,559
Isn't other industries important?

415
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,640
Is people's livelihood not important

416
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,960
Isn't industry important?

417
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,640
I'll say you elites

418
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,000
Can you take some energy out?

419
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,599
Care about other aspects

420
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,519
I won't mention the stocks I bought myself

421
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,240
The strategic investment of the group

422
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,240
There are still a lot of people in your hand

423
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,160
What about the big and small non-bans in a few years?

424
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,000
Are you there

425
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,160
So is mine there

426
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,440
After this ban is lifted

427
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,680
It also limits transactions

428
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:30,519
Pay me a compensation

429
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,480
That's so uncomfortable

430
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,640
Look at this A-share index

431
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,880
Every drop

432
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,119
That's all real

433
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,680
Cutting the flesh in our hearts

434
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,240
If it were you

435
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,839
You don't have the heart to talk about anything else

436
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,559
I think

437
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,960
It's too exaggerated

438
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,799
Something turbulent in the policy

439
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,400
Finally, it can be pulled up to the stock index

440
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,000
I think compared to China's economy

441
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,200
The size of A-shares is not that big

442
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,400
Big brother

443
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,240
Your tone of speaking

444
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,839
It's a bit too outsider

445
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,640
You're slapping here

446
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,039
Can you do it without studying policies

447
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,880
Anyway, I didn't say it

448
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,039
No more chatting

449
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,160
You come on, I can't beat him

450
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,200
Practiced secretly

451
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:22,920
Dongdong

452
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,799
You are different from other investors

453
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,640
You're a business

454
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:30,039
Don't just focus on domestic policies

455
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Lun Copper suddenly fell some time ago

456
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,119
House prices in the United States continue to fall

457
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,200
Plus the hot money pouring into China

458
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:37,960
Retreat

459
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:39,839
Your analysis consultant

460
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,359
I didn't study it for you

461
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Global economic trend

462
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,599
this

463
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,720
It's our group

464
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,319
Research report on the international situation

465
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,559
My dad's deputy did it himself

466
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,279
Take it first and see

467
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,240
Any ideas

468
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,599
Let's talk later

469
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,160
drink wine

470
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,559
good

471
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:13,880
Hiroaki

472
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,160
Good news

473
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,119
My funds have been revitalized

474
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Tell the finances

475
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,799
I'll send someone to find him tomorrow

476
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,319
OK

477
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,200
Remember

478
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,519
Find Liu Jun when you have difficulties

479
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,880
Last month was a trough

480
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Copper futures have turned upward recently

481
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,759
After closing the position

482
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm also making a lot of profits

483
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,319
It's been unconfiscated

484
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,119
Although I've solved the problem

485
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,720
But you can't be too careless

486
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,440
Stock index fell from more than 6,000 points

487
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,440
I've never been back

488
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,559
The bubble in the early stage is too great

489
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,400
My capital pool is mainly in the housing market

490
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,559
For me, the stock index fell

491
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:50,599
Benefit

492
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:51,920
Good news

493
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,759
Of course

494
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,880
So much money

495
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,160
Withdraw from the stock market

496
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,680
There must be a place to go

497
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,960
Look at what you said

498
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,480
Is it difficult to make money

499
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,519
Either this or that

500
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,680
Out of the stock market

501
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,200
You can only enter your housing market

502
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,680
Then you don't agree

503
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,640
Can you point me the third way

504
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,160
I'll listen carefully

505
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,319
You say it

506
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,880
Where else can I go

507
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,440
I can't say it either

508
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,480
But I just think something is wrong

509
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,559
It shouldn't be so narrow

510
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,839
Macroeconomics

511
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,519
It's complicated

512
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,640
You don't believe in evil

513
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,599
Have to be in this mess

514
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,319
Develop a main line

515
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,519
It's useless to reason

516
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,039
Alright, let's not talk about it

517
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,799
I'm looking at the market

518
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:41,880
Talk back

519
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,559
Worry

520
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,200
This night

521
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,480
What are you busy with here

522
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,039
What's this dense

523
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,839
Are you modeling

524
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,839
I was complained by two people today

525
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:10,920
First, Dongdong

526
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,279
Say I act like an outsider

527
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,160
Inappropriate

528
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,359
Then there is Hongming

529
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,759
Say I'm trying to be in a mess

530
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,279
Develop a main line

531
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,359
It's just doing useless work

532
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,720
Their views

533
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,240
I don't agree

534
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,160
But for a moment

535
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,519
I can't think of a reason to refute

536
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,279
So I want to create a correlation diagram

537
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,159
Take major events this year

538
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,519
Policy direction

539
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,599
International changes

540
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,759
Enter all in

541
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Try to deduce it

542
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,680
The next economic trend

543
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,960
And manufacturing

544
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,240
Possibility of impact

545
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,039
Not small ambition

546
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,119
It is also necessary to deduce the economic trend

547
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,440
Are you going to join a think tank

548
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,519
What's your conclusion

549
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,000
The conclusion is that I gave up

550
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,160
Hongming is right

551
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,680
Everything is related to the macro economy

552
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,920
There are infinite variables

553
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:05,200
Infinite full relationship

554
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,759
Can't deduce it at all

555
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,680
The so-called conclusion

556
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,720
I know now

557
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,759
Why economic field

558
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,680
There are so many liars

559
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,200
Because of this thing

560
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,480
It's impossible to be rigorous

561
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,359
You're pure

562
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,279
Engineering chauvinism

563
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,480
You can't build a model yourself

564
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
Just say that economics is not science

565
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:27,839
Actually, don't care

566
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,680
Where will the economy go in the future

567
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,039
You have to follow the reality in front of you

568
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,079
Manage the factory

569
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,480
Is it going or retreat

570
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,720
There is no advanced choice

571
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,279
Maybe it's because of lack of confidence

572
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,039
Since the expansion of the center

573
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,160
I'm always trembling

574
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,000
Worried

575
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,720
But look at the people around you

576
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,519
Everyone is more confident than me

577
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,440
It seems like I don't care at all

578
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,880
Those risks

579
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,279
I've begun to doubt myself

580
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,759
Can't see anything clearly

581
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,559
There is no way to do it

582
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,480
Confident decision making

583
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,960
You said Tengfei lived to this day

584
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,160
Whether it depends entirely on luck

585
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,720
Has nothing to do with my ability

586
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,319
You are not the only one who feels guilty

587
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,200
After I'm promoted

588
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,799
I often doubt myself

589
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,000
Don't know yourself

590
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,598
Can you be competent for the current position

591
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,519
Otherwise,

592
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,319
Before we go out to work

593
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,319
Let's learn from that pyramid scheme organization

594
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,160
Have you seen it

595
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,400
It's the kind of shouting at each other

596
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,000
Come on, come on, you can

597
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,359
I think this is a good thing

598
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:43,960
Come

599
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,279
We can't do anything else

600
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,440
The first place in brainwashing each other

601
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,079
Try it, try it

602
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,519
Come

603
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,000
You have to be prepared sincerely

604
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,119
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come

605
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,519
Silently

606
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
Hello, are you visiting the house?

607
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,440
Hello, I'm not a house viewer

608
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,960
I'm here to find your boss

609
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,480
Then wait a moment

610
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,319
Sister Wei

611
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,319
Hirohide

612
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,720
How did you come

613
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,920
Sister Wei, it's been a long time no see

614
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,759
yes

615
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,839
Remember you just came to the company

616
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,839
When you go to work

617
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,920
Still a little girl with braids

618
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,119
It's different now

619
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,519
This career has developed

620
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,480
This style has come up.

621
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,720
It's obvious that he's a big business person

622
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,240
When I just worked

623
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,319
I don't know anything

624
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,559
It's not all up to Sister Wei

625
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,960
Teach me step by step

626
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,119
Is there any place to speak conveniently

627
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,599
I'll tell you something

628
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,839
OK, come to my office

629
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,200
here

630
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,400
Hongying

631
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,799
I heard from Old Wu

632
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,200
You're raising funds recently

633
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,200
This year's

634
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,599
There is such a high profit

635
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,319
Almost all old colleagues

636
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,799
All old friends voted

637
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,400
Why don't you call me?

638
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,519
Sister Wei, you misunderstood

639
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,680
First of all

640
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm not called fundraising

641
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,799
That is, everyone believes in me

642
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,920
I'm willing to find some benefits for everyone, too

643
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,279
I must have thought of you

644
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,720
But your son this year

645
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,359
Didn't you study in Canada?

646
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,880
That's a big expense

647
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,240
I think you prefer

648
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,720
Keep the money in your hands

649
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,519
This is right

650
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,880
Children studying abroad

651
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,960
The savings in this family

652
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,279
He will use it first

653
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,400
But what about my sister

654
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,880
There is a free money

655
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,200
And the house I live in now

656
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,319
Mortgage out

657
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,920
Can make up a deal, too

658
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,960
This totals about 700,000

659
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,920
You won't think it's too little

660
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,319
How could it be

661
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,079
But Sister Wei

662
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:54,599
Money is invested in

663
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,720
The principal cannot be moved for at least one year

664
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,680
You're fine

665
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,160
no problem

666
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
I heard from Old Wu that he had seen it

667
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,039
In the downtown area of Shanghai

668
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,799
There is such a big building

669
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,759
I trust you

670
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,000
This physical examination result is good

671
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,599
There are a few indicators that are not normal

672
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,839
Much better than last time

673
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,960
My in-laws are right

674
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,000
At our age

675
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,200
Health is the most important

676
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,079
I'll tell you

677
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,559
After the stock market clearance

678
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,680
I slept very, very stable

679
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,680
Not dizzy

680
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,920
I'm not panicked

681
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,519
Everything you eat is delicious

682
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,839
Very good appetite

683
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:42,000
It's still useful for the in-laws to speak

684
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,799
I advised you at that time.

685
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,039
Say you stop trading stocks

686
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,119
But you don't listen

687
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,240
All in the wind

688
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,880
That's different

689
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,200
In-laws talk

690
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,400
I'm listening with my ears

691
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You speak

692
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,400
I'm using this to listen

693
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,839
Two different paths

694
00:33:58,519 --> 00:33:59,279
Come and eat something quickly

695
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,920
You said this is hot pot

696
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,440
Also changed to Doulao

697
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,319
This one

698
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,599
The price is several times more expensive

699
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,480
You said you are now

700
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,639
Why can you make money so well

701
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Taste is OK

702
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,920
After you clear the stock

703
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,000
That's a lot of cash

704
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,199
You can't keep it on your account

705
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,679
Have you ever thought about it

706
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,000
Other investment channels

707
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,239
My daughter-in-law works in the bank

708
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,400
She knows how to manage money

709
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,920
I was about to ask her

710
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,159
Go back and ask

711
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,000
The bank is dead interest

712
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,320
Where do you put your money

713
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,880
It's definitely not worth it

714
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,679
Tianmao Building in Shanghai

715
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,679
Have you heard of it

716
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,599
Have heard of it

717
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,079
Hongming took it down

718
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,199
A project for renovation

719
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,639
Now in the early stage

720
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,840
You can invest in a stock

721
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,840
Profits after the renovation

722
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,239
It will definitely double

723
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,960
Do you want to think about it?

724
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,079
Hongming is too courageous

725
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,320
He dares to touch commercial real estate

726
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:09,920
Subprime mortgage crisis in the United States

727
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:10,880
Not over yet

728
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,840
You haven't invested in the United States

729
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,440
Let’s talk about the current housing market in Shanghai

730
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,800
Very popular

731
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,920
I know this

732
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,280
The project in Shanghai is good

733
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,679
But I'll tell you

734
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,199
The money in the stock market is not all mine

735
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,599
I have to take the principal of the soaring

736
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,440
Return it

737
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,880
The remaining profit

738
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,480
Ajun won't let me move

739
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,760
You may not know

740
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,920
Ajun kept asking me to change a house

741
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,239
He thinks the house I live in now

742
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,239
Too old

743
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,840
There is no place to park the car

744
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:52,760
Not safe yet

745
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,360
My tires were pricked twice

746
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,559
Even my little granddaughter

747
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,039
I don't want to come to play here

748
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,719
Not familiar

749
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:08,800
meat

750
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:34,719
Quick

751
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,039
Quick, quick

752
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,199
What's so anxious

753
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,239
I didn't have time to eat breakfast

754
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,519
Important matters and important matters

755
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,679
Ah Jun

756
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,679
I'll tell you

757
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,320
What about dad's hands

758
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,480
There are five million now

759
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,599
See what can you buy

760
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,199
Can spend this money as soon as possible

761
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,639
Give an idea

762
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,559
I thought it was a big deal

763
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:55,760
That's it

764
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,719
Is this a trivial matter?

765
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,159
Is this a trivial matter?

766
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,400
You cleared your stock the day before yesterday

767
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,760
Just one today

768
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,199
The situation of spending all the money

769
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,960
Hold the cash in your hand

770
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,719
Hot

771
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,440
I don't want cash

772
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:09,440
I just want to spend it

773
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,079
No

774
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,119
Anyway

775
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:13,880
Five million

776
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,360
right

777
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,920
Spend it out in one breath

778
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,639
Then you can only buy a house

779
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,400
Good to buy a house

780
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,679
Good to buy a house

781
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,880
I said so yesterday

782
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,599
Then I'm not lying

783
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,239
Who are you lying to

784
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:28,800
No, no, no, nothing

785
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,719
Where is this property located

786
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,039
You'll really give up

787
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,000
Where is Sanhekou

788
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,039
Opened a new property

789
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,800
A big luxury house in high-end decoration

790
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:37,960
More than 400 square meters

791
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,480
One set can cost you more than four million

792
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,599
Spend more than 100,000 yuan to buy two parking spaces

793
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,719
Make some furniture and the rest

794
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,159
Choose another good car

795
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,400
Miscellaneous and more than 85 million

796
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,280
Flowers are gone

797
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:48,639
Mikawaguchi

798
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,760
What is the name of this property

799
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,480
You really bought it

800
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,440
Buy it

801
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:53,760
No

802
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,440
So many years

803
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,519
You're guarding your old house

804
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,440
Refusing to move

805
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,800
Why did you suddenly change your mind so much

806
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,159
Don't you always advise me

807
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,320
Say I've worked hard all my life

808
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,599
Be happy when you are old

809
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,880
I'll listen to you

810
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,119
Have I said this

811
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,960
Said

812
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,559
Should I enjoy it

813
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,840
How should it be

814
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,239
Have breakfast

815
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,119
Stop eating and looking at the house

816
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,119
Look at the property

817
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,079
My bun

818
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,360
Stop eating, I'll treat you

819
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,320
I just said I would use money to manage my finances

820
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,119
I mention Tianmao

821
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,400
Just change your words

822
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,119
I've decided to buy a house

823
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,639
In fact, it doesn't matter whether you invest or not

824
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,320
The key is

825
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,679
He immediately got ready

826
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,840
That attitude

827
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,519
It's really chilling

828
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,760
Who is Liushitang

829
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,119
Always selfish and suspicious

830
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,199
You think you're helping someone

831
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,280
Find investment channels

832
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,960
But in other people's eyes

833
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,719
You're planning to be a bad person

834
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,320
Want to cheat on him

835
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,280
But it's good

836
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,440
You see his true face sooner

837
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,400
It's better than losing money in the future

838
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,239
he

839
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,639
He's a little selfish

840
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:15,199
But it's not what you said

841
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,960
sister

842
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,760
You won't be until now

843
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,760
Haven't seen him clearly yet

844
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
He is in front of his son

845
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,360
Maintain image

846
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,800
Sorry to find a young girl

847
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,000
But an old aunt of similar age to him

848
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:29,599
He doesn't like it

849
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,719
Of course I can only hold you and keep it away

850
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,280
As I said, you should break up with him quickly

851
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,000
You'll be entangled with him for a long time

852
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,719
I can't get his sincerity

853
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,079
How about Ah Jun

854
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,159
Open or not

855
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,400
Look at the restaurant

856
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,400
Is this light beautiful or not

857
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,280
The dining table will be here in the future

858
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,039
Baby, let's have a meal here

859
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,960
Look at how it is

860
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,679
This one is nearly six meters tall

861
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,840
Look at my landscape

862
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,280
I'll tell you what's invincible

863
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:31,719
Come to see if it's good here, baby

864
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,119
There are several rooms upstairs

865
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,960
baby

866
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,239
Go up with grandpa to check out the room

867
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,920
OK

868
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:37,920
You can watch it casually

869
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,400
good

870
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:39,599
Let's go up and see if it's OK

871
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,559
It's so beautiful

872
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,599
baby

873
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,199
Is it good to find you a room?

874
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,400
You choose one by yourself

875
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,679
Take a look

876
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,599
You didn't tell me

877
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:48,320
Your dad is one

878
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,000
The owner of a small street factory

879
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,119
Will you be stingy for life

880
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,920
What's the result now

881
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,440
Four million mansion

882
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,280
I also have a parking space and buy it if I say I can buy it

883
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,519
Repay the full amount

884
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,880
When you buy a larger flat layer

885
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,760
All generous

886
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,400
Then why don't we change with him

887
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,920
You're embarrassed

888
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,920
The windmill is lifted

889
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:15,760
How about it

890
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,519
I'll tell you about this environment

891
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,639
That's nothing to choose

892
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,559
Look at this green plant

893
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,280
Ajun, look at this

894
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,559
This lawn is so wide

895
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,880
How beautiful this color is

896
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,679
Is this style a bit European

897
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,440
yes

898
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,559
Dad, I'll take her to the front to take a walk

899
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:31,400
Go and go and play

900
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,280
Let's go

901
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,800
I'll tell you Ah Jun

902
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,239
Run

903
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,280
You and Bingbing are busy with work

904
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:39,920
This kid in the future

905
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,360
Don't bother your father-in-law and mother-in-law all the time

906
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,119
Send me here

907
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,199
Dad's house let her run away casually

908
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,360
Look how good the environment is

909
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:47,800
Such a big house

910
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,159
I don't believe you live alone

911
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,920
Dad and Nanny are looking for a hourly worker

912
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,079
Don't live at home

913
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:59,559
You know I'm not talking about nanny

914
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,880
I know you're not talking about nanny

915
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,800
Dad is about to tell you this

916
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,840
Hongying ignored me for a week

917
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:12,880
Why

918
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,159
Money is a mess

919
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:16,400
What kind of building did her brother build?

920
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,320
Renovation project

921
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,559
Honestly this project

922
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,280
Still good

923
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,679
But I'm talking about Qian Hongming

924
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,400
Distrust

925
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,800
I don't want to be financially

926
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,880
What's the ties to him

927
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,480
Renovation project

928
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:27,920
Hongming didn't tell me

929
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,760
He hasn't told you

930
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,599
I haven't said it's right

931
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,880
You just don't know

932
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,480
Never vote

933
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:35,400
I'll tell you

934
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,639
Taking advantage of the current situation

935
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,079
Get your entity well

936
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,039
Better than anything

937
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,679
I said

938
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,320
Such an expensive house

939
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,880
It's only been less than three days

940
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:51,800
Buy it if you say it

941
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,280
Do you want to spend the money

942
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:55,559
That way no one bothers you

943
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,760
Honestly, this makes sense

944
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,760
Isn't this a cause of trouble?

945
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
Hongying is unhappy

946
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,519
She thinks I'm on guard against her

947
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:05,400
Don't answer the phone

948
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,599
I can't see anyone even if I look for her
