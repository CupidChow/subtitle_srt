1
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,479
We're leaving

2
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,158
Go

3
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,759
Bye-Bye

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Listen to mom

5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Sister, listen to me

6
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,400
Qian Hongming

7
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,959
Sister, please calm down

8
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,639
You're so heartless

9
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,598
sister

10
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,038
sister

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,800
I'll find money for you

12
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,639
sister

13
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,199
Drag all the people I know

14
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,639
And you

15
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,199
You take the money I found

16
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Send your wife abroad

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,039
Are you still human

18
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,599
You dare to tell me when someone leaves

19
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,478
Qian Hongming

20
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:39,079
You talk

21
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,918
sister

22
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,840
What do you treat me as

23
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:45,478
Is your husband the couple?

24
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,759
Sister, can you please calm down?

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,800
Carrie immigration matter

26
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:50,759
It started last year

27
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,280
Isn't this a coincidence?

28
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,159
You happen to be head

29
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,478
Do you think I'm stupid

30
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,319
Qian Hongming

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,159
Your wife

32
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,080
She's a god

33
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,879
She can't stand the grievance

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,080
What about your sister

35
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,639
It doesn't matter if I'm just an old mom

36
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:20,879
I'll be my whole life

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,879
Is it a life for someone to be a cow or a horse?

38
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,879
Qian Hongming

39
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:28,079
Bastard, you

40
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,520
sister

41
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,240
How could I harm you

42
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,560
Since this is already

43
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,759
We can only find a way

44
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
Keep going

45
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
We've all survived so many times

46
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,639
This time it's OK

47
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,720
You believe me

48
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,680
Tell me the truth

49
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,480
This mess

50
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,759
Is there any rescue

51
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,319
Is it okay

52
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,040
This day is too depressing

53
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,119
Let's talk about some fun

54
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,319
No mention of R&D

55
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,240
No economic policy is allowed

56
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,800
I have to think about it

57
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,680
By the way

58
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,480
After the Spring Festival

59
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,759
Dongdong and Lawyer Chen

60
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,040
The third time breaking up

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,360
Dot yelled

62
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,000
Use a new relationship to dilute old wounds

63
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,240
Find a girlfriend quickly

64
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,759
A female host

65
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,560
What a happy thing

66
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,240
Lu Huadong's new love

67
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,759
What does it have to do with us

68
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,120
It really doesn't matter

69
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,800
But you haven't always been

70
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,879
Do you like to listen to gossip

71
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,759
Who likes to listen to gossip

72
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,639
Then what

73
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,720
You know the first quarter market

74
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,360
Lu Family's stock market suffered heavy losses

75
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,759
Take that land king

76
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,800
It's also a dilemma

77
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,240
Nothing intent to fall in love

78
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,839
New girlfriend is less than a month

79
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,800
Blowed

80
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,199
Just blow it

81
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
Don't you talk to Chen Qifan every week

82
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Go for beauty

83
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
She didn't say anything

84
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,399
OK I admit it

85
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,959
It's something to ask me

86
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,839
He asked me to ask you

87
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,639
What did she think of Chen Qifan

88
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,800
to be honest

89
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,759
Dongdong and Qifan

90
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,360
No matter how you break up and get together

91
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,639
It's also better than Qian Hongming's family

92
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,199
These bad things look good

93
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,720
What are you talking about Qian Hongming?

94
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,680
You're here again

95
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,720
Do you want to inquire

96
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,800
Inquire about it

97
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,439
I don't dare to make a promise

98
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,160
I can only test it for him

99
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,839
Thank you, wife

100
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,679
Feel, Sister Wei

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,519
Pay interest next week

102
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,039
How could I forget

103
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Arrive on time

104
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,919
You just wait to get the money

105
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,240
I know this

106
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,879
Can't affect us

107
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,440
Sister Wei

108
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,840
Do you want to refund the principal?

109
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,519
If you want to withdraw

110
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,440
I just happened to have a friend who didn't squeeze in

111
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,559
Keep chasing me to invest

112
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,240
If you want to withdraw

113
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,120
I'll take your share

114
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,120
Give it to him

115
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,840
Don't want to retreat

116
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
That's OK

117
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,840
Then I'll explain to others

118
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,080
Have time to have dinner together

119
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,840
goodbye

120
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,559
What to do

121
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,159
Give it to you

122
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,799
Thank you

123
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,519
Have a meal

124
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,159
Take out the milk

125
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,559
Thanks

126
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,320
What's wrong and what news

127
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,320
Do you know Jinyi Group

128
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,639
I know

129
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,200
Well-known enterprises in the province

130
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,320
Mainly engaged in textile

131
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,120
I have many customers

132
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,559
Have business dealings with them

133
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,600
Jin Yi is also

134
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,000
A powerful giant

135
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,679
Just went bankrupt

136
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,159
What's strange about this

137
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,480
Debt-ridden profits shrink

138
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,080
Plus the monetary tightening

139
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,000
What kind of giant you are

140
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,039
Can't stop all the negative problems

141
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,080
At the same time, it exploded

142
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,399
You're worried about Qian Hongming

143
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,960
There are many private loans in the East China Sea

144
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,559
The business is very open

145
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,120
Several nearby cities

146
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,639
All within their business scope

147
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,120
A giant like Jin Yi fell down

148
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,480
The impact must be very wide

149
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,159
I'm worried that Hongming will be affected

150
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,159
Call him and ask

151
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,399
Hello

152
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,519
The phone you called has been turned off

153
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,200
sorry

154
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,240
Turned off

155
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Maybe it didn't charge last night

156
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,879
You'll call again later

157
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,320
Mr. Luo

158
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,320
What's wrong with you

159
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,320
I feel panic as soon as I see your expression

160
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,639
What happened again

161
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,639
Mr. Sun

162
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,840
We are from Cole Group, USA

163
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,519
That finishing order

164
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,159
Technically finished, right

165
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,799
Finished

166
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,799
Design sample inspection

167
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,120
The process that our technology takes

168
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,960
All finished

169
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,759
Just wait for you to sign the contract

170
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,400
No

171
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,960
This business is gone

172
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:14,680
Kerr is a long-time customer of the flying

173
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,000
Where does it have any objection to us?

174
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,759
Not a product problem

175
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,279
It's a requirement

176
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:23,240
It does lower

177
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,720
Plus

178
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,160
The cost of trans-ocean freight is getting higher and higher

179
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,720
Anyway

180
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,519
The other party has sent a letter

181
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,839
The order was officially canceled

182
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,039
Fortunately, we were two months ago

183
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,039
Have noticed it

184
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,319
Adjusted production line

185
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,720
Avoid greater losses

186
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
Next step

187
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,119
High-end line output

188
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,559
Still need to shrink further

189
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,720
Try to consume

190
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,960
Mainly available inventory

191
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,119
Avoid further backlog of finished products

192
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,599
alright

193
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,519
Everyone cheer up

194
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,839
Everyone should believe it

195
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,799
Our technological competitiveness

196
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,680
As long as the overseas market recovers slightly

197
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,119
Currently unsubscribed products

198
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,160
The backlog problem caused

199
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,519
It will definitely be solved

200
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,519
Hope next quarter

201
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,720
It can be smoother

202
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,359
Hello

203
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,079
The phone you called has been turned off

204
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,519
sorry

205
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,240
The phone you called has been turned off

206
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,759
Liu Jun, your phone number

207
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm taking a shower

208
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,799
Please help me see who it is

209
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,680
It's Shen Jiali

210
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,640
Take it first

211
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:08,960
Hello Jiali

212
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm Bingbing

213
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,079
Liu Jun is taking a shower

214
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,599
The phone is placed outside

215
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,000
OK, don't worry

216
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,240
He comes out later

217
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,279
I'll tell him

218
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,039
What did Carrie say

219
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:36,640
She said she couldn't find Qian Hongming

220
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,000
Ask if you have contacted him

221
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,119
no

222
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,720
Why is she still the same as before

223
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,720
Old habit to use you

224
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,319
She can't contact Hongming, is she anxious?

225
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,559
Then who should I look for?

226
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,160
A big adult man

227
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,799
The phone has been off for a day

228
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,720
Is it necessary to be so nervous

229
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
Hongming has come to text message

230
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,920
This kid finally emerged

231
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,960
Just tell you nothing is wrong

232
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:09,480
When it's convenient

233
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,279
Come to Gate 3

234
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,279
Does our community have a gate number 3

235
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,000
Isn't it just facing the north door?

236
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,000
No one yet

237
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,480
Familiar with your own community

238
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,559
I'll change my clothes

239
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,799
What are you doing

240
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,519
He is not for your convenience

241
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,279
Go again

242
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,599
You eat the meal first

243
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,680
Hiroaki and others arrived

244
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,160
You eat first

245
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,480
Just give me some left

246
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,480
Do you like to eat or not

247
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,119
What are you doing

248
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,680
The phone is turned off all day

249
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,920
Jiali called me

250
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,839
Nothing to do

251
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,440
Just too tired

252
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,880
Sleeping in the car for a day

253
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
I'll call her back later

254
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,359
I heard that Jinyi Group went bankrupt

255
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,359
Those who have been collecting debts in the door

256
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,240
Blocked

257
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,160
This has no effect on you

258
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,440
No direct impact

259
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,480
But it will definitely be affected

260
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,319
Not to mention these

261
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,880
I have something to ask you

262
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,039
What is this

263
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:44,720
This is under my name

264
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,160
Real estate that has not been mortgaged yet

265
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,640
Including the large flat floor at the top of the city

266
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,359
There is also a villa you live in now

267
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,039
I hope you can buy them

268
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,079
I'll buy it

269
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:25,880
Hello dad

270
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,559
Qian Hongming just now

271
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,960
Called Liu Jun out

272
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,440
I won't go around with you anymore

273
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,119
Tell clearly

274
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,759
Just lack of money

275
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,480
Assets under my name

276
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,839
All these houses are left

277
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,720
You know what's happening now

278
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
I only dare to find you to cash

279
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,119
If sold to someone else

280
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
I'm afraid I won't be able to pass tonight

281
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,000
This story spread all over the sky

282
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,680
How big is your hole

283
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
You have to tell me clearly

284
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,599
I know how much I can help you

285
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,480
I've invested in the wrong project

286
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,160
Have been trying to remedy some time ago

287
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,519
But recently, the monetary policy is getting tighter

288
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,519
The deficit cannot be filled

289
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,039
So I want to ask you to help

290
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,000
Then you sold these houses

291
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,839
Can you get out of funds?

292
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,599
Although this money is not much

293
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,799
But I'll use it to adjust

294
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,440
At least two months

295
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,000
I have internal messages

296
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,640
These two months are very critical

297
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,240
Just get through this

298
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,279
Stay until the bank opens the gate to lend money

299
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,759
I can turn over immediately

300
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,680
How much do you need

301
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,160
I'll find a way to get it for you

302
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,160
You can take the house book first

303
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,400
Liu Jun, you don't understand what I mean

304
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,680
I'm not going to borrow money from you

305
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,039
I can only sell these houses to you

306
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,119
These houses are in my name

307
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,279
Very dangerous

308
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,200
If prosecuted

309
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,799
The first one to freeze

310
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,119
It's these real estates

311
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,400
I'll sell it to you

312
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,720
I can have a place to live

313
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,680
Not desperate

314
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,440
Being kicked out of the house

315
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,240
But the real estate certificate is obtained

316
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,160
It will take several days

317
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,519
Then I'll send you some money first

318
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,079
Liu Jun

319
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,839
I said I don't borrow money, just don't borrow money

320
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,359
You're not alone now

321
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,839
You have a family, too

322
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,680
I know Bingbing has opinions about me

323
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,519
So I can't make you embarrassed

324
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,119
Buying a house

325
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,759
Go back and discuss with her.

326
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,480
If she agrees

327
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,839
Go and get the transfer as soon as possible

328
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,759
Be sure to follow the real market price

329
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,519
Get all the procedures clear

330
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,200
You're worried about a lawsuit in the future

331
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,279
If things go wrong in the future

332
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,039
Probably someone will be sued

333
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
This transaction time is close

334
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,559
Easily overturned as a target

335
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,039
So be careful

336
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,519
You don't do this

337
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
What I've said

338
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,720
Just the worst result

339
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,319
Actually, the situation is not that serious

340
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,319
The money loosened in the past two months

341
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,960
I can do everything well

342
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,759
Stay in touch

343
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,319
I've gone up

344
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,519
Come

345
00:27:04,078 --> 00:27:04,880
Be happy

346
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,160
Take care of yourself

347
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,839
Thank you

348
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,279
fine

349
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,079
Leave

350
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,799
Hey Hongying

351
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,720
It's me

352
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,119
Haven't contacted for a long time

353
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,279
How are you

354
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,839
Can't say it's good

355
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,559
But still alive

356
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,920
Can still live

357
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,440
I'll call you

358
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,240
I want you to know

359
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,839
I'm still here

360
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,720
Hirohide

361
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,440
I'm the person

362
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,839
There are many problems

363
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,079
I'm no longer young

364
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,119
Many problems may not be corrected

365
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,039
But I'm willing to take care of you

366
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,920
Take care of you for the rest of your life

367
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,880
I'm willing to support you

368
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,680
I'll call your dad.

369
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,240
Say Qian Hongming is looking for you

370
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,799
It seems that it is my villain's heart

371
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,599
What did my dad say

372
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,839
Nothing said

373
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,200
Just telling you not to lend him money

374
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,759
Qian Hongming's properties

375
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,440
The quotes given are fair

376
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,079
It seems that he really treats you as a friend

377
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,680
I didn't want to take advantage of you

378
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,119
I'll hold on these days

379
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,440
Go and transfer the account

380
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,200
Say that

381
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,079
You don't object to me buying his house

382
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,920
to be honest

383
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,119
I think Qian Hongming's situation

384
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,319
More serious than what he told you

385
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,039
But I know too

386
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,839
How deep is the relationship between you two

387
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,440
He has already put the last few properties

388
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,319
Take it out

389
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,200
If I will never let you buy it

390
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,599
I am afraid

391
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,000
We are the two of us

392
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,400
The emotions between

393
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,279
Thank you Bingbing

394
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,480
The procedures are complete

395
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,519
This contract is obviously made by an expert

396
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,160
After you both sign

397
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,079
Check in the real estate center

398
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,160
Keep all payment certificates

399
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,839
No matter who will check it in the future

400
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,920
These transactions are legal and valid

401
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,640
That's fine

402
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,519
how

403
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,440
Show me the information

404
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,759
I'm not at ease with him

405
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,720
I'm not targeting him either

406
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,839
It's his real estate

407
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,559
some

408
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,359
Hot

409
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,079
Got it

410
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,039
So many flowers

411
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,200
Who gave it

412
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,240
Reconcile

413
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,759
right

414
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,000
I really envy you

415
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,839
Or do you know romance

416
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,759
Look at our fool

417
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,640
Since getting married

418
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,440
I don't remember the anniversary

419
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,839
Stop talking about spending

420
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,960
I haven't seen a dogtail grass before

421
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,640
What's going on

422
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,640
Run away when the earthquake

423
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:53,880
It's an earthquake

424
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,839
land

425
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:55,759
Go quickly

426
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,000
What are you still standing there

427
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,119
quick

428
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,359
Everyone see

429
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,759
This passage behind me

430
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,720
Now it's total

431
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,319
Completely broken

432
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,480
Then we also see

433
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,519
Earthquake disaster relief

434
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,119
Vehicles with armed police officers and soldiers

435
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,920
It's now urgent

436
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,559
Do everything

437
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:12,960
Hurry to Wenchuan

438
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,839
Got asleep

439
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,279
Got asleep

440
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,240
The magnitude has been changed to 8:00

441
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,839
This hasn't entered the epicenter yet

442
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,640
There have been tens of thousands of casualties

443
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,319
Tengfei also has Sichuan employees

444
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,799
I'll let Lao Zhu tomorrow

445
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,839
Learn about the situation

446
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,039
Organize everyone to donate to them

447
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,720
It's been a day and a night

448
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,160
Why is the road to Yingxiu still not open

449
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,440
There is a mountainous area and aftershocks there

450
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,239
Open a road again

451
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,639
Nothing as easy as you think

452
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,639
Look here

453
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,199
The whole road collapsed

454
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,599
Enter

455
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,039
Manager Zhu

456
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:26,760
Mr. Liu

457
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
Tengfei Tengdajia R&D Center

458
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,360
There are 15 Sichuan employees in total

459
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,159
They all contacted their home

460
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,239
The family is safe and sound

461
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,719
They don't donate either

462
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,400
Say what the company wants to donate

463
00:34:42,518 --> 00:34:43,880
Just donate it directly to the disaster area

464
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,119
I've heard the news report

465
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,079
Isn't there a shortage of supplies in the disaster area?

466
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,280
Like a tent quilt or something

467
00:34:50,518 --> 00:34:51,199
You go and ask

468
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,559
Manufacturers who are in contact with us

469
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,360
See where to buy a tent

470
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:54,960
good

471
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:55,880
This is the time

472
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,239
Everyone should do their best

473
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:58,599
Let's not wait for the management committee

474
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,559
Come and mobilize

475
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,119
I remember a few clients

476
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,159
It's a textile machinery

477
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,239
I'll check it now

478
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,719
This year it was a big snow

479
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Now there is a big earthquake

480
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,199
The second half of the year

481
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,280
Definitely not easy

482
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,920
Yesterday I heard Lao Xu say

483
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,679
Tengda, which is now used to run

484
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,880
Not enough work

485
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,159
Not to mention flying

486
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,880
And the newly opened heat treatment center

487
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,239
Let it go easily

488
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,119
Will get better

489
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,800
The backlog of finished products is increasing

490
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,880
This is the second

491
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:55,920
Temporary warehouse

492
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,519
next month

493
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,000
If you can't digest it

494
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,800
The cost of warehousing is superimposed

495
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,920
We have no profits

496
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,280
Many unsubscribed products

497
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,320
All are customized models

498
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,280
Buyers are hard to find

499
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,119
Our Sales Department

500
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,320
Everyone is trying hard to figure out a solution

501
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,320
Last night

502
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,679
One of my subordinates has drunk too much

503
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,920
Go to the hospital

504
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,119
Just to attract a big customer

505
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,440
yes

506
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,280
I know you're not easy

507
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,400
Let's go back to the company first

508
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:25,199
good

509
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,519
It's too hot

510
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,519
Hiroaki

511
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,239
What are you busy with

512
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,880
I've told you all

513
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,679
You don't have to do the next day

514
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,960
Just call me

515
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,719
What major changes have happened here

516
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,599
I'll definitely report to you as soon as possible

517
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,400
Is it OK

518
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,239
OK

519
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,440
As long as you don't have to keep your face

520
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,039
Just don't make old problems

521
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,480
Carrie gives me that money

522
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,920
Bank deposit expires

523
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,039
I'll let Bingbing take it to you

524
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,760
No

525
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,440
That's Carrie's money

526
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,280
I think you'd better keep it

527
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:04,639
Really no need

528
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,239
Only a few hundred thousand

529
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
I can't send it to me

530
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,239
What's the use

531
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,400
Then I'll ask the bank to renew its current date

532
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,519
When you want to use it

533
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,639
Just take it out anytime

534
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:14,719
OK

535
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,079
I've got a new phone call here

536
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,239
Have it been hung up tomorrow

537
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,559
Bye-Bye

538
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:21,880
Bye-Bye

539
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,599
Feed Dongdong

540
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,000
What do you say

541
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,400
Now

542
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,679
Is there really no way

543
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,320
I said Mr. Lu

544
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,480
I don't have any extra orders

545
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,360
From the beginning of the year

546
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:47,320
Working overtime here

547
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,840
It's already a historical term

548
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,840
I'm in the warehouse now

549
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,119
Full of backlog

550
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,760
Neither factory can eat enough

551
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,119
Where are there any extra orders

552
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,000
Give it to you evenly

553
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,760
No

554
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,320
You've ignored it

555
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,280
Is the city one-time

556
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,639
I'm not responsible for management

557
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:03,760
But the city is a

558
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,000
It's still our company

559
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,159
I don't care, can I

560
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,360
Exports are too poor this year

561
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,719
Orders dropped too fast

562
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,679
Currently only 70%

563
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,440
Starting rate

564
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,079
Domestic sales are not optimistic

565
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,000
Many factories have been suspended in North China

566
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,559
Cut off a large order from me

567
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,800
It's just a little worse

568
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,480
Now everyone is watching

569
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,599
Wait for this turning point

570
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
But I don't know the turning point.

571
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,400
When will it come

572
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,280
In theory

573
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,960
It won't be so deformed

574
00:39:32,558 --> 00:39:33,360
yes

575
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,280
The word deformity is particularly accurate

576
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,880
Traders are dying

577
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The raw materials are still ridiculously high

578
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,320
OK I won't tell you now

579
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,719
I have to continue giving the city a shot

580
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,679
Looking for a stutter

581
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,280
Can you bear it every day

582
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,880
Carry it

583
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,719
If you hold on, you will win

584
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,840
The cash I can move now

585
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,559
That's only about 100,000

586
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,519
You hold it

587
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,038
At least a few years of life

588
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,840
Life

589
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,360
What else can I have to live

590
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,159
A friend of a lifetime

591
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,360
Their money is like a bubble

592
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,400
It hit me

593
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,639
If there is no decent explanation

594
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,119
Can I still live

595
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,239
Hiroaki

596
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,440
Hiroaki

597
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,400
Let you hold shares on behalf of others

598
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:33,239
That key person

599
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,079
Isn't he very powerful?

600
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,679
Can't he help you

601
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:38,960
You didn't say

602
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,400
This matter lasts for a few more months

603
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:41,800
Can it pass

604
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,360
I thought he was involved

605
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:47,360
This is the safest business

606
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,760
Didn't expect his money

607
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,039
It's the most dangerous

608
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,559
If he knew my situation

609
00:40:59,159 --> 00:40:59,960
I am afraid

610
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:06,840
Then we now

611
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,280
Except for waiting for death

612
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,960
What else can I do

613
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,039
disappear

614
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,679
You and me

615
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,079
All must disappear immediately

616
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,400
Bubble

617
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:17,800
Have a meal

618
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,719
Come back

619
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,360
Wash your hands and have a meal

620
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,840
There is chicken and eggs

621
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,439
What do you want to eat

622
00:42:32,598 --> 00:42:34,880
Which kid is having a meal

623
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,960
What’s wrong with you

624
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Mom is so happy when she comes back

625
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,719
Qian Hongming Hengxiang Road Main Store

626
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,920
Did it fall?

627
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,280
When I was passing by just now

628
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,199
See many people

629
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,719
Looking for someone there to smash the door

630
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:51,400
No

631
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,559
When we called two days ago

632
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:54,599
He didn't say this

633
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:56,199
Then don't you give it to him

634
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,239
Make a phone call and ask

635
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:06,519
Hello

636
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,679
The phone you called has been turned off
