1
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,280
Our two families have been in a row for more than half a year

2
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,079
Development progress has been there

3
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,719
Some time ago

4
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,200
I want to join forces with you

5
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,280
He was responsible for the city's one machine

6
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,319
He can't hold on

7
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,719
Let him quit on his own initiative

8
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,920
Yeah

9
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,239
Then why didn't you come to me?

10
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,840
My dad said my method was too naive

11
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,319
He said he would solve it himself

12
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,478
Mr. Dong

13
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,039
The output value of the market one machine this month

14
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,599
Set a new low

15
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,639
Profits are falling to the bottom

16
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,199
Mr. Lin and I are here today

17
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
Mainly discuss

18
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,199
How to reverse this situation

19
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,918
You are the general manager

20
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,719
Let's talk about the current situation first

21
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,478
good

22
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,079
Machinery manufacturing industry

23
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,240
In the past two years

24
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,400
Competition is getting more and more intense

25
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,280
What about after the Spring Festival

26
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,240
Tengfei got a bank loan

27
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,639
Production capacity rises sharply

28
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,520
People have the confidence to reduce prices

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Everyone knows

30
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,639
Their company's products

31
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,479
From a technical perspective

32
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,919
There are advantages

33
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,159
What about this only shortcoming

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,919
It's just that the price is too high

35
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,319
But now

36
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,240
People have the confidence to lower the price

37
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
This price cut

38
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,800
Swallowed immediately

39
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,400
A big piece of cake on the market

40
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,719
so

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,478
Seriously affected

42
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,000
Our sales performance

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,079
Look at you

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,840
Know what the reason is

45
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,520
Then should you take out one

46
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,039
Decent response plan

47
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,520
yes

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,680
The company's management also

49
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,039
Have held many meetings

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,319
Two solutions were proposed

51
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:36,319
This is the first one

52
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,240
Of course, it's also a price reduction

53
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,319
Let's reduce the price with Tengfei

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,759
And it's more ruthless than them

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,680
Dumping on small profits

56
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,719
Regain market share

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,918
second

58
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,840
It's about expanding product types

59
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:50,918
at present

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,319
Our products of Yiji

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,120
Too single

62
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,159
This situation

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,918
Absolutely not to continue

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,319
So hope the board of directors

65
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,280
Able to approve

66
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,080
Allocate a special fund

67
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,840
Or

68
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,159
We do product research and development by ourselves

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,800
Or

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,759
Go and buy patents that are suitable for the market

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,599
Anyway

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
It is necessary to expand the product variety

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,759
Mr. Lin

74
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,480
This is the budget for new product development

75
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,319
Please review the two shareholders

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,560
Come on, I'll take you to see from the beginning

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,839
this

78
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,040
It's the cloakroom in the master bedroom

79
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,920
Not bad, not bad

80
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,800
Yes

81
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:03,959
Here

82
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,759
This is the main guard

83
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,680
I'm going to make one

84
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,759
Dry and wet separation

85
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,519
Look here

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,839
This is the master bedroom

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,720
Look at this scenery

88
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,959
It's a little cloudy today

89
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,040
When the developer brought me there that day

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,959
The sunlight spreads across the ground directly

91
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,560
Not only is the lighting good, but the floor height is also very high

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,839
Yes, look here again

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,160
What about this little door

94
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,920
The study is connected

95
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,800
Walking through the study is the living room

96
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,120
Yes

97
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,560
Your living room

98
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,279
Really a mansion

99
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,560
Long enough

100
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,399
Very bright

101
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,680
Look at this again

102
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,360
This is a children's room

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,720
I'm going to give it to Xiao Taozi

104
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,959
Brushed pink

105
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,439
Let Carrie on the wall

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,120
Painted with flowers, plants and small animals

107
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,600
You are the uncle

108
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,839
At least we have to contribute

109
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,680
A princess bed

110
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,879
Where can I have a princess bed

111
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,959
I only have a machine tool

112
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,800
You're really stingy

113
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,160
It's OK here

114
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,120
This is an invincible landscape balcony

115
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,079
These two sides turned around and sealed it.

116
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,319
Can be used as a storage room

117
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,879
All given by developers

118
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,759
Big enough

119
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,839
This house is so big

120
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,319
Yes

121
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,839
Before signing the contract

122
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,720
I'm going to take Jiali

123
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,120
I went to Shanghai once

124
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,639
Hotel's high-rise suites

125
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,839
You don't know how scared her

126
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,720
Why don't I hug her

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,040
She didn't dare to stand by the window

128
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:33,000
Tell me

129
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,639
She just needs to look down

130
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,879
There is an urge to jump

131
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,399
People are afraid of heights

132
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,800
Safe consciousness

133
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,920
What's so afraid of? How high is this?

134
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Be careful

135
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,720
How do you know

136
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,040
Is this guardrail strong?

137
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,959
Can this guardrail be not strong

138
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,959
Pure steel

139
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,839
What a pity

140
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
Such a good floor

141
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,040
Already robbed

142
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,680
My sister found someone for me

143
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,360
Get seventeen layers

144
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,560
The seventeenth floor is OK

145
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,040
There is an empty room next to it

146
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,199
Do you want to buy one too

147
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,319
Be my neighbor

148
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,040
I'll forget it

149
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,959
All my money is in the factory

150
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,800
Not like you

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,360
There are so many ways to make money

152
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,319
Don't cry with me

153
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,199
My business of this letter of credit

154
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Not bad

155
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,000
Our profits

156
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,560
It's not low

157
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,920
But in terms of return on investment ratio

158
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,720
It's really not as good as you

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,639
I've figured out one thing now

160
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,800
No matter what you do

161
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,519
Don't forget

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,959
Being back on a big tree is good to enjoy the cool

163
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,839
Do a career

164
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,720
It must be closely linked to policies

165
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,079
Becoming more and more enlightened

166
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,800
Still studying

167
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,839
What a big budget

168
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,399
Of course

169
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,839
If necessary

170
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,279
We can give

171
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,720
but

172
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,800
Where do you use it

173
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,279
Didn't write it clearly

174
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:20,879
Old Dong

175
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,399
These people sitting on your right

176
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,399
They are all from our technical department

177
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,680
Senior Engineer

178
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Each of you took it

179
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,399
All are at the deputy manager level

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,079
Now we ourselves

181
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,919
To develop a new product

182
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,799
You need an extra budget

183
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,399
Didn't our money be wasted?

184
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,240
So I want to say Lao Dong

185
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,799
Your management methods are a bit soft

186
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,000
If you were me

187
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,799
I'll send someone directly

188
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,600
Go to the technical department to take charge

189
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,720
Watch them do their work

190
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,799
Within one month

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,720
Take out the drawings of the new product

192
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,080
Mr. Lin

193
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,000
What about this budget cost

194
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,360
It's all departments in the factory

195
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,720
Proposed after the study

196
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,320
R&D objectives

197
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,840
It is the design and production of complete sets of products

198
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,440
Every kit requires

199
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,639
Repeated development and testing

200
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,720
So it's the cost

201
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,759
Old Wang Old Wang Old Wang Old Wang

202
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm a businessman

203
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,360
Don't tell me the process

204
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
I'll just look at the results

205
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,840
I know what you said

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
It's Liu Jun's trick

207
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:26,840
Right

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,440
I saw this with my own eyes

209
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,600
real

210
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,000
A bunch of high-priced alloys

211
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,720
The test was directly scrapped

212
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,600
That's a bottomless pit

213
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:38,759
Of course

214
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,879
This guy is lucky in the end

215
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,399
He smashed a kit

216
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,519
But how about it

217
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,600
Two or three months

218
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
It was imitated all over the street

219
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,519
I've said it a long time ago

220
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,000
Then our city can't

221
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,960
Take this high-risk path

222
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,720
A business

223
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,399
Want to gain a foothold in the market

224
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,159
Must have your own advantages

225
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,919
Although our city's first machine is large

226
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,960
But there is no fist product

227
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,679
Now

228
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,759
The market issued a warning

229
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,360
I think it's a good thing

230
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,279
Considering the long-term development

231
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,879
We must cultivate

232
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,799
Your own R&D team

233
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,720
Master core skills

234
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,399
Mr. Lu

235
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,720
Independent research and development

236
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,759
It's not a simple four words

237
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,799
It will be extended indefinitely

238
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,799
The time for the company's product transformation

239
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,279
You have to think clearly

240
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
A large amount of cash flow

241
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,879
That's how it was swallowed

242
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,960
This budget report

243
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,039
Since it is in front of me

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,919
I believe

245
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,120
From the management perspective

246
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,399
Chief Engineer Wang from a technical perspective

247
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,320
All pass the test

248
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,440
You see

249
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,799
Lin Chuan didn't make any comments

250
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,159
She obviously agreed, too

251
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,080
As a major shareholder

252
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,639
I agree with the management budget

253
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,120
Mr. Dong

254
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,799
Follow this direction

255
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,399
Keep moving forward

256
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,519
good

257
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,519
You didn't see it

258
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,919
Lin Yue's face at that time

259
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,159
Or is it still spicy?

260
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,519
My dad's trick

261
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,159
Just all the solutions I thought of before

262
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,279
It's much taller

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,799
That's

264
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,000
Independent research and development depends on cash flow

265
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Don't look at your short-term losses

266
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,639
But you are at least in the company

267
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,120
The core technology has been improved

268
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,120
Anyway, your Lu family has a lot of financial resources

269
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,960
Have the confidence to spend all the way with Lin Yue

270
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,879
In fact, Lin Yue's financial resources are not weak

271
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,360
But he is

272
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,000
Pay too much attention to immediate interests

273
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,879
As long as the R&D funds of the Municipal Yiji Machinery

274
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,879
Keep burning like this

275
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,600
I can't hold back and want to quit

276
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,000
It's definitely not our home

277
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,440
Sounds like this

278
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,679
Why is your dad so similar

279
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,200
In "Wall Street"

280
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,919
Douglas

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,519
He's far from it

282
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,720
Having said that

283
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,440
It's the same for Lin Yue

284
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,360
But what about our research and development progress

285
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,080
It's also a real move

286
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,519
Chief Engineer Wang said

287
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
One will be opened the day after tomorrow

288
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,919
Feasibility Workshop

289
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,120
Come on, come on, help us check

290
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,240
It won't work the day after tomorrow

291
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,320
I finally had a free day

292
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,120
Ready to pick up my new car

293
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,639
Finally a new car

294
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
What did you order one

295
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
How about it

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,879
Feel it

297
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,600
This is the essence of this car

298
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,039
Strong rigid control is very accurate

299
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:33,919
Full power

300
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,039
Is it worth it or not

301
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,759
Not worth it at all

302
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,879
I feel uncomfortable sitting and I'm almost vomiting

303
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,919
Such a small car

304
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,399
I don't have any face to drive it out

305
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,600
Oh my god

306
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,519
Hello Jiali

307
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,440
Don't worry

308
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,000
Put on your child first

309
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,360
I'll come here right now

310
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:00,960
Carrie is sick

311
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:01,720
The child has a fever again

312
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,480
I have to go there

313
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,320
What have you been through

314
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,519
It's not that he doesn't have a husband

315
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,799
Hongming is on a business trip

316
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,840
I'll leave first

317
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,000
Then how can I go back

318
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,159
You can take a taxi back

319
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,600
You don't like my car anyway

320
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,519
Liu Jun

321
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
You sit down and rest for a while

322
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,240
Don't keep holding

323
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,320
Hello

324
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,519
I'll finish driving

325
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,200
How about it

326
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,399
Are you holding your new car

327
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,879
I've had a few friends in the forum

328
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,080
Let's go and have a look

329
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,159
You'll make a little less

330
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,399
I'm in People's Hospital now

331
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,600
I have a friend who is sick

332
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,960
Not serious or not

333
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,279
Do you use me to help

334
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,480
No, no, no, no

335
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,399
I'll hang up first

336
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,399
Let's talk about it later

337
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,759
Mr. Sun

338
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,879
Luo Qing

339
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,960
Brother is back

340
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,200
Disturbed

341
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,360
We'll have not seen each other for half a year

342
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,120
yes

343
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,480
You don't say you're back soon

344
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,440
See us

345
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,639
Am I here now

346
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,679
How are you doing in the factory recently

347
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,480
OK

348
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,399
There is a new series

349
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,720
Look at his eyes

350
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,480
This was designed by Wang Gong in charge of

351
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,120
Awesome

352
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Wang Gong showed off with him

353
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,080
When this picture was drawn

354
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,879
It's so hard

355
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,399
Yes

356
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,519
This place it was

357
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,120
Xiao Luo

358
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,480
Old factory director

359
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,360
Luo Qing

360
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,120
Long time no see

361
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:45,840
Very good

362
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,679
fine

363
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Aren't you a civil servant exam

364
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,120
How about the exam

365
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,799
Very smoothly, I've passed the exam

366
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,000
What did I say come from

367
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,320
Surely no problem

368
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,039
Which unit was the exam?

369
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,279
Municipal Planning Commission

370
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,519
Municipal Planning Commission

371
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,519
A good unit that can be selected from one in a hundred

372
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,440
Golden rice bowl that can't be grabbed even

373
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,200
sharp

374
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,879
that

375
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,879
Is Mr. Liu here?

376
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,600
I want to go over and say hello to him

377
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,679
He was called away by his friend

378
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,679
Not back yet

379
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,440
Since you're here, you're here

380
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,519
Sit in my office for a while

381
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,320
Have some tea

382
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:13,879
good

383
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:14,679
Mr. Sun

384
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,960
Check it out and sign it

385
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:16,679
Leave it to the workshop

386
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,159
OK

387
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,720
Then you guys are busy

388
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,559
Then you guys are doing it first

389
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,440
good

390
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
The director of the Municipal Planning Commission

391
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,519
Called Zhao Zhao

392
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,039
Is Zhao Shuo

393
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:24,799
To Director Zhao

394
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,399
He has a daughter

395
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,080
very beautiful

396
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,519
Yeah

397
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,080
I'll tell you

398
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,240
Find an opportunity to introduce Ajun

399
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:30,759
Leave it to me

400
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,240
Go home, little Taozi

401
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,240
See what this is

402
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,399
Have a lollipop

403
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,679
Thank you Uncle Liu Jun

404
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,559
Take care of us

405
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,399
Liu Jun

406
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,279
You're welcome

407
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:40,960
Very good

408
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,879
Why are you here

409
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,240
Don't you say you're in the People's Hospital

410
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
I'll come here

411
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,159
Hello

412
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,000
Hello

413
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,840
I saw you as soon as I stopped this car

414
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,919
Very lucky

415
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,399
I mean

416
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,360
Why do you have to

417
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,519
Chase to the hospital

418
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:55,960
What's so anxious

419
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,080
I've made an appointment with more than a dozen friends

420
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,440
Say look at your new car

421
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,159
There are a few in our forum

422
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,360
All came for you

423
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,079
I don't mean to urge you

424
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,559
I'll see if I can help

425
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
After finishing our work, let's go together

426
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,358
Liu Jun

427
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,839
Did I delay your business

428
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,559
Don't listen to him

429
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,799
He's had a date for so many people

430
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,680
Didn't tell me

431
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,839
I'll give you a gift first

432
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,839
Go home with Xiao Taozi

433
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,720
No hurry

434
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,240
Send you back first

435
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,400
Where is your home

436
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,880
Port Authority Dormitory

437
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,759
My friend is here too

438
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:32,920
Sister Liang

439
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,559
Sister Liang

440
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,799
Such a coincidence

441
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,759
Long time no see Long time no see

442
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,799
haven't seen you for a long time

443
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,279
You two know each other

444
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:42,839
Actually last time

445
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,240
When you mentioned Liu Jun

446
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,960
I guess it might be him

447
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,440
Where are you here to have a meal

448
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,119
Have had a date for a few friends

449
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,440
Let's be together

450
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,200
never mind

451
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,319
I won't join in the fun today

452
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Something elsewhere

453
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,759
Invite us to dinner separately

454
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,279
Just kidding me

455
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,839
I have to ask you too

456
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,039
What you said

457
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,480
OK, I'll leave first

458
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,160
What's wrong with your hand

459
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,440
I remember seeing you last time

460
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,559
Had an industrial injury

461
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,319
to be honest

462
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,880
I've been in the industry for so many years

463
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,000
Haven't suffered an injury

464
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,240
This finger

465
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,599
It has nothing to do with machinery

466
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,400
This is impossible

467
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,319
Cut someone's fingers

468
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,480
Lin Yue won't

469
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,559
So lawless

470
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,240
I've inquired

471
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,839
The final police investigation facts

472
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,279
It's his guy who did it

473
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,079
That person has been sentenced

474
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,680
Lin Yue and Brother Lei jointly opened a hotel

475
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,640
There is this relationship in

476
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,920
Everyone outside thinks

477
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,119
Donghai Group is Lin Yue's backstage

478
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,000
Including the victim Liu Jun

479
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:02,880
I think so too

480
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,880
I asked him at that time

481
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,039
How did you get hurt

482
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,720
People don't want to pay attention to me

483
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,359
Is it salty

484
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,319
Not salty

485
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,240
This Lin Yue

486
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,759
It's really too much of a bottom line

487
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,359
Then how is Liu Jun now

488
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,519
Lin Yue

489
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,920
It's okay to be ruthless

490
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,599
Competing fairly with others

491
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,160
He really doesn't have the ability

492
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,119
But Liu Jun is different

493
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
I've heard from East China

494
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,279
He opened a new factory in Kunjiang

495
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,759
Less than a year

496
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,119
Just take the market share

497
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,519
A large piece of it was chewed away

498
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,319
It seems to be a practical person

499
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,119
What's his factory called

500
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,960
Take off

501
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,240
Take off

502
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,440
Let's go make dumplings

503
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,400
Here comes

504
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,640
Come

505
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,799
Can we take a sip

506
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,279
Come on obedient

507
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,599
You are obedient and open your mouth

508
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,880
I'll give you sugar after drinking

509
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Is it easy to come

510
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,160
You're obedient

511
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,240
OK OK OK

512
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,359
Open your mouth

513
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:22,640
good

514
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,319
You

515
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,480
Are you disobedient

516
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,680
I'll tell you

517
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,440
You don't take medicine well

518
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,599
I won't take you home tonight

519
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:29,559
Did you hear

520
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,160
You're good

521
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,558
We'll take our last sip

522
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,359
Come

523
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,319
Sister Wei

524
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,039
Xiaoxia is here

525
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,720
Have you eaten yet

526
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,640
have eaten

527
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,200
Brother Lei

528
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,839
how are things

529
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:44,880
fine

530
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,400
Just don't take medicine well

531
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,559
Brother Lei

532
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,200
You have to take medicine

533
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,799
Which day to come to play at home

534
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,680
Look at the baby

535
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,839
He said OK

536
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,200
We'll go together the other day

537
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,559
Okay, I'll pick you up another day

538
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,038
Lin Yue is upstairs, go quickly

539
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,440
OK, I'll go up first

540
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,519
The wind is blowing

541
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,319
What's wrong

542
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,279
Liang Sishen called me

543
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I want me to withdraw from the shares of Haoyuan

544
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,359
Haoyuan consumes too much energy

545
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,400
Give up if you give up

546
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,359
Not a loss

547
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,400
This is Song Yunhui

548
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,440
Need to clear my relationship with me

549
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:33,119
Who is it

550
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,279
Who did this

551
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,839
You let it go

552
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,839
Why do you have to go out to feed mosquitoes

553
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,480
I'm tyre again and again

554
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,920
I haven't driven for half a year

555
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,559
I just got my head back

556
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,160
You let it go

557
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,240
I'll squat all night today

558
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm going to catch him

559
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,720
I'll see who it is

560
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,559
Blood pressure, blood pressure, blood pressure

561
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,759
If you have the energy to come out, then

562
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:51,559
Not worth it

563
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,160
If you really can't swallow this

564
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,039
I'll help you catch him

565
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,839
I'll go

566
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:56,799
OK

567
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,079
you go

568
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,359
Hold

569
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,039
Sail your dad

570
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,640
Catch the bad guys

571
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,559
Catch the bad guys

572
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,720
Whoever stops, don't run

573
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,279
Don't move

574
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:22,920
Put down the things

575
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,960
Don't block me and let me go

576
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,400
Don't come over

577
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,240
Don't come over

578
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,279
Put things down

579
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,799
Don't come over

580
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,319
Aunt Fu

581
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:35,839
She was our aunt before

582
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,279
etc.

583
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:36,920
I don't know either

584
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,799
Why did she come today

585
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,559
Wait and wait

586
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,200
Comrades of the police

587
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:39,880
What are you doing

588
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,599
Ah Jun

589
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:41,440
Don't be impulsive

590
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,799
I'm not impulsive

591
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,119
Comrades of the police

592
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,519
Can I say a few words to her

593
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,160
Can

594
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:48,799
Fu Qiufang

595
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,319
Our Liu family is not bad to you

596
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,920
You're not just stealing my son's skills

597
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,519
You dare to come and tamp my tires

598
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,000
Are you not afraid of going to jail

599
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,880
I asked my son to work before

600
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,599
You won't

601
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,519
My son's future is ruined now

602
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,880
My old man died at home

603
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,799
We didn't see the last one

604
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,079
It's all your fault

605
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,079
I'm not finished with you

606
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,680
Your son stole my son

607
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,079
Million-worthy technology

608
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,680
Why are you making a fuss?

609
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,839
My son is a thief

610
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,519
look

611
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,880
Is your family a good person?

612
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,440
Your mother

613
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,680
To transfer back to the city

614
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,039
Just married your dad

615
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,599
He kicked the object at that time

616
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,079
What a shameful person

617
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,119
Keep your mouth shut for me

618
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,200
Dad

619
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:24,839
Forget it, let's do it

620
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,359
What nonsense

621
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,079
Pay attention to the heart

622
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,039
You're waiting to go to jail

623
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,559
Eliminate the air

624
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm not finished with you

625
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,160
I'm not finished with you

626
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,079
Didn't sleep all night

627
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,680
Go and have a sleep

628
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,039
dad

629
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,000
My mother back then

630
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,440
Don't listen to Fu Qiufang's nonsense

631
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,720
Your mother is a good mother

632
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,119
Believe me

633
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,720
It's enough to remember this

634
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,599
Your mother married me

635
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,519
Maybe I'm not your mom

636
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,359
Not to mention these

637
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:50,920
I know your mother

638
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,200
Not happy

639
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,400
But your mother

640
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,720
Haven't made any mistakes

641
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,160
Not even done

642
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,799
Things that make others gossip

643
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,359
If you have to say

644
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,039
Whoever is sorry for whom

645
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,200
I owe her more

646
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,640
This is not a weekend, either

647
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,559
Why are there so many people

648
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,759
I really can't understand

649
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,960
I caught something bad

650
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
She's also sensible

651
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,359
Talking endlessly

652
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,480
It seems she suffered

653
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,960
It's all our family's sins

654
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,359
Maybe I'm just an engineering brain

655
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,240
I really can't understand this logic

656
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,759
She has lived a hard life

657
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,160
Just finished jail

658
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,599
My son has no chance

659
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,200
The old man passed away again

660
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,279
You let her have a normal

661
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,839
Clear logical thinking

662
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,960
How is that possible

663
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,400
Hello

664
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,000
No location yet

665
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,680
Brother Qian, I'll make arrangements as soon as possible

666
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
Call me Brother Qian

667
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,240
I'm Brother Qian

668
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,319
Then what should I do next

669
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,960
A few tires were tied

670
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,279
Can't be locked up for long

671
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,039
After all, I have to release it

672
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,160
My new community is fine

673
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,119
Have monitoring

674
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,480
She can't do anything, either

675
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,279
But my dad's old community

676
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,200
Idle people are waiting in and out

677
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,440
Can't even defend

678
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,839
I wanted to sell the house

679
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,119
Let him move somewhere else

680
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,039
But he won't move anyway

681
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,920
Say you want to fight against bad guys to the end

682
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:51,759
He's fighting

683
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,839
That's all I cleaned up and arrested people

684
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,160
Your dad is becoming more and more like you

685
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,079
You're becoming more and more like your dad

686
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Or let's change the place

687
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,960
Don't change it

688
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,400
I've finished drinking this and went home

689
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,680
Carrie is alone at home

690
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,319
Don't stay with me again

691
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,519
I won't change it. Can you

692
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,920
Then drink another one

693
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,960
Drink one more

694
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,279
waiter

695
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,000
Lao Lin

696
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,079
Exit the market one-time

697
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,519
Not a trivial matter

698
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,039
You've really thought about it

699
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,319
Let's go one side of the road through the sky

700
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:13,799
Goodbye or friend

701
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,519
But I quit

702
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,680
There are conditions as well

703
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,079
We've been working together for so long

704
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,359
Know each other

705
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,960
Say any ideas

706
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,400
I try to satisfy myself

707
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,640
I want to go to the factory.

708
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,039
good

709
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,279
Mr. Lin

710
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,599
I won't give it to you

711
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
Shi Yiji is a good company

712
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,079
Young child

713
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,200
It really needs such a place to practice

714
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:07,920
Come on, Lao Lu

715
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,200
We'll have a date later

716
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,599
There will be a period of time later

717
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,240
dad

718
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:30,559
How about it

719
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,359
He wants the land in the factory

720
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,799
Promise to quit with his sister

721
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,319
What about Dong Qiyang

722
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,000
I stayed Dong Qiyang

723
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,400
Don't think you've studied for a foreign degree

724
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,839
I look down on people's local ones

725
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,599
MBA (Master of Business Administration)

726
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,440
Really operate

727
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,440
You'll know

728
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,440
Manage such a big city and one machine

729
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,880
Not as simple as you thought

730
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,159
Don't send text messages to Carrie

731
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,880
Come on, come on and have another sip

732
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,920
The last one

733
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,599
I'll get up one day early tomorrow

734
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,159
Finally found a table-patch

735
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,239
You'll be late

736
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,599
Feed Dongdong

737
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,239
I'm drinking with my friends outside

738
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,880
Then wait for me

739
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,280
Lu Huadong asked me to go

740
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,840
KTV (Singing Room)

741
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,800
Do you want to go

742
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,199
Then I won't go

743
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,480
Another day

744
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,518
What's wrong

745
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,159
Didn't we talk about meeting that day

746
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,199
Is it pretty good

747
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,760
I don't want to go today

748
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,239
Lu Huadong offended you

749
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,760
It's not a sin

750
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,599
I just feel like him

751
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,119
A little self-righteous

752
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,159
Is there any

753
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,039
Your rich young man's circle

754
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,119
I'm staying inside

755
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,239
Feel a little awkward

756
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,039
What do you guys talk about

757
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,559
Save it, I listen

758
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,639
I haven't talked about these

759
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,039
I know I know

760
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,639
I mean me

761
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,800
I can't understand it anyway

762
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,960
So I think

763
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,840
I felt like I was squeezing in

764
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,599
What a rich young circle

765
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,639
Just a bunch of netizens

766
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,000
Meeting offline

767
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,079
Let's talk about it

768
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,199
What do they say, you care about him

769
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,639
Then you have to talk about foreign trade

770
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,760
Don't they understand, either

771
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,039
Can't compare to anything else

772
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,440
Comparing to studying, right

773
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,480
Go! Go! Go

774
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,480
You're driving a luxury car and living in a luxury house

775
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,559
You're not confident yet

776
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,159
drink wine

777
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,000
Thank you two beauties

778
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,880
grateful

779
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,119
Why are you so anxious

780
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,639
They all came to our factory

781
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,119
Look at this

782
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,320
Not bad

783
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,079
Results are produced so soon

784
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:21,039
R&D has been advanced to this extent

785
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,840
It must be a huge investment

786
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,599
Lin Yue doesn't feel sorry for him

787
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,639
This is what I want to tell you

788
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:28,960
Lin Yue

789
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,519
Has officially withdrawn

790
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,559
Lin Yue quit

791
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,639
You're in the city

792
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,719
Real manager

793
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,480
So you're here today

794
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,400
Smart people are smart people

795
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,239
Our two

796
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,760
In the same market

797
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,880
Or a competitor

798
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,280
Or a partner

799
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm sincere today

800
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,239
Come with an olive branch

801
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,960
I won't cooperate with you

802
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,280
Our two

803
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,639
Too big difference in size

804
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,239
If I cooperate with you

805
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,079
Take off and become

806
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,199
Your colony is here

807
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,840
At least you can think about it or not

808
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,480
If we two have a price war

809
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,239
It will inevitably be a loss-making loss

810
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,039
It's better to sign an offensive and defensive alliance

811
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,320
Maintain product prices together

812
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:18,280
I won't do it

813
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,239
Let me become your colony

814
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,880
Be peaceful

815
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,239
It won't take long

816
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,559
Your dad can kill me

817
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,280
Then competition will not benefit you, right

818
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,920
Our company is a listed company

819
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:35,679
I really have to spend my money to dump you

820
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,599
Just your small factory

821
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,079
Can I withstand it for three months

822
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I said Mr. Lu

823
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:42,840
Can you speak

824
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,320
Don't be so hideous

825
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,199
I've been safe for a few days now

826
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,079
Are you going to start a war against me

827
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,599
Business in business

828
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,199
Are you doing business

829
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,320
I think you don't feel any crisis

830
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,639
Do I have to wake you up

831
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,599
There are countless products in the machinery industry

832
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,039
You can't be the only one

833
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,400
Low price dumping, right

834
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,880
Then I'll transform

835
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,480
This year, Tengfei can be developed

836
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,639
A lot of fun things

837
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,840
All locked in this safe

838
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,519
Once you suppress me

839
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,960
I'll let them see the light right away

840
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,840
Your technical team

841
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,079
Less than ten people

842
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,320
You're really sure

843
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,719
Things in your safe

844
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Can you lead

845
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,199
The focus is not on the size of the team

846
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,400
It's me, the leader

847
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:30,920
You know this year's

848
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,598
What is the proportion of R&D investment?

849
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,320
Do you know

850
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,760
Tengfei's current testing equipment

851
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,639
It has surpassed the market in a complete way

852
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:40,840
Dongdong

853
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,960
Tengfei is a high-end and sophisticated person

854
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:45,800
It's impossible to follow you

855
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,199
Low level of competition

856
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,639
The city's one-machine scale is large and sufficient funds

857
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,679
But the inventory is also large

858
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,719
It's not that fast to turn around

859
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,920
You talk to me about the tracking strategy

860
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,719
You obviously can't follow

861
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,039
So I don't understand

862
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,920
Why do you have to do it with me

863
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,960
What about the same series

864
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,079
Too shortsighted

865
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,440
Extremely short-sighted

866
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,679
Are the newly bought beans delicious?

867
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,159
Too bad to drink

868
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,280
It is a blessing to lose your horse

869
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,440
Managing a factory is so tiring

870
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,479
It's good if you and your elder brother quit

871
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,199
Focus on real estate

872
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,280
It's definitely easier for you

873
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,960
yes

874
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,400
The land in the city center

875
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,880
Build a high-end hotel

876
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,079
Really good

877
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,639
The last time I went on a blind date, Chen

878
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,119
How are you doing

879
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,400
Just want to tell you

880
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,000
We both think

881
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,760
They are quite suitable for each other

882
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,320
And he's getting old

883
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,280
So discuss

884
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Get married next year

885
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:17,360
You guys

886
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,519
Haven't talked for long

887
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,800
Really thought it clearly

888
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,039
Mr. Lu

889
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,519
Let's open the skylight and speak brightly

890
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,800
If you really don't want to

891
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,800
Compete with me

892
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,519
There is another way

893
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,760
What method

894
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,000
I can give up completely

895
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,559
Production of the entire series of products

896
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,559
Just give me ten million if I have one machine

897
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,280
Buy out my skills

898
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:53,400
How many

899
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,639
Ten million

900
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,440
Isn't you crazy or I'm crazy

901
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:57,360
Do you know

902
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,599
My investment in all R&D

903
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,960
Adding a piece is less than this

904
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,159
Do you want to hear one

905
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,159
The story of the antique world

906
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,599
I don't want to

907
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,079
You must be trying to fool me

908
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,400
I'll follow you and troll it

909
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,880
I'll be lame if I take a few steps

910
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,679
Don't sell abduct

911
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,800
It's a flower vase

912
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,239
There was such a person in the past

913
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,679
Get an antique vase

914
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,679
But at that time it was on the market

915
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,239
There are a few similar vases

916
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,079
He'll spend a high price

917
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,880
Bought all the other ones

918
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,760
Then they all smashed

919
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,480
From then on, he had the vase in his hand

920
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,800
It becomes an orphan

921
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,000
What's the result

922
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,519
His one-piece was taken

923
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,920
Added up than the other ones

924
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,199
Higher price

925
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:41,440
What's this

926
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,800
This is the market for

927
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,239
Response to scarcity

928
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,679
Do you understand

929
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,400
I feel like I'm almost lame

930
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,679
Not what you are going to say

931
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,559
Now that you are here today

932
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,920
Already spoken

933
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,239
I'm prepared for danger in times of peace

934
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,119
Regardless of competition or not

935
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,199
I'm going to transform.

936
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,800
Then the technology I have on hand

937
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,280
It definitely won't exist

938
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,039
Sell to other stores on the market

939
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:06,920
Everyone has it

940
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,480
Even if you have a plane

941
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,840
Finally developed

942
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,840
Still inevitable

943
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,400
Become a lot more and more dead

944
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,039
You might as well be direct

945
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,280
Bought from me

946
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,760
That way you can do it for a long time

947
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,760
Maintain monopoly production

948
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,519
How about it

949
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:27,360
Think about it

950
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,159
But ten million

951
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,559
friend

952
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,119
Can you pay the price

953
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,000
Fifty

954
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,639
Drink coffee

955
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Five million

956
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,320
I heard it right

957
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:49,199
One machine spent five million

958
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:50,840
Buy Liu Jun's skills

959
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,320
It's really ridiculous

960
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,639
When that guy was doing research and development

961
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:54,679
We all see it

962
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,039
This takes that little time

963
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:57,719
Used equipment

964
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:58,920
Consumed materials

965
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,280
Added up

966
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,320
