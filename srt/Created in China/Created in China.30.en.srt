1
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,878
Such an expensive house

2
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,439
It's only been less than three days

3
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:47,359
Buy it if you say it

4
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:49,840
Do you want to spend the money

5
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
That way no one bothers you

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,319
Honestly, this makes sense

7
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,319
Isn't this a cause of trouble?

8
00:01:56,878 --> 00:01:57,878
Hongying is unhappy

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,079
She thinks I'm on guard against her

10
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,959
Don't answer the phone

11
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,159
I can't see anyone even if I look for her

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,959
In my heart

13
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,840
Seven up and eight down

14
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
I think this matter

15
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,199
It's Qian Hongying's wishful thinking

16
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,919
She has to take you and Qian Hongming

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,360
Bring together

18
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:18,960
yes

19
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,439
Actually, you two

20
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,639
No one is happy to pay attention to anyone

21
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,478
That's it

22
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,599
These days

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,840
Explain to her

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,400
Just open the word

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,439
You kid

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Didn't I just say it

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,039
Can't see anyone

28
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,000
Isn't this a hurry

29
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:33,199
Then you choose the person you want

30
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,400
You can find a way for yourself

31
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,960
Let's talk about it

32
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:38,478
You really want to see you

33
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,039
You can't do anything about it

34
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,439
Hirohide

35
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,719
Haven't seen each other for several days

36
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,319
Let's find a place to sit

37
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,719
Have an appointment with a customer to see the house

38
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,759
No time

39
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,280
That's what I asked my friend

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,199
Call you

41
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,280
Imitate a customer

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,560
Otherwise you won't come out either

43
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,560
Let's go

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,800
Hirohide Hirohide

45
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,360
Let's find a place to chat

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,759
Let's go

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,918
Come

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
Have some tea

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,759
Hongying

50
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,560
To be honest

51
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,918
This is my age

52
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,280
There is a little bit of defense

53
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,240
The heart of being defensive is very heavy

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,000
I admit

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,759
This is all integrated into

56
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,840
It's in my blood

57
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,079
It's hard to change, too

58
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,039
But to be honest

59
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,080
I'm this age

60
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,479
Can't change it anymore

61
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,159
But I swear to God

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,719
I really didn't think about you

63
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,080
Don't think about me either

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,319
I'm just

65
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,840
Don't like investing

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,478
You don't have to explain to me

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,599
Whether to invest or not is your freedom

68
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,240
No need to explain to me at all

69
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,199
Actually, I'm not angry either

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,480
Just feel

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,839
This is how people get along

72
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,519
Very boring

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,959
Don't think you think so

74
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,639
I still have to go with you

75
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,680
Can't explain it

76
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,000
Hongying

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,680
You're clear

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,600
I want to go with you for a long time

79
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,680
Go on

80
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,800
you say

81
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm involved in your brother's business

82
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,519
OK

83
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Is it suitable or not

84
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,079
Business is successful and everyone is well

85
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,879
Then who is your brother

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,759
You know better than me

87
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,240
He loves adventure

88
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,159
What if the business is not successful

89
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,759
Can I still guarantee it

90
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:54,680
I can take care of you

91
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,560
My brother started from scratch

92
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,560
Work hard to start a business by yourself

93
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,199
Can you hope him to be better

94
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,839
Hirohide Hirohide Hirohide

95
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,800
Listen to me and listen to me and say

96
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Listen to me and tell you

97
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,759
Hirohide

98
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,879
I'm not going to get along with your brother

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,519
But I

100
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,360
I don't expect him to be unlucky, right

101
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,920
Let's talk about our Ajun

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Still good friends with him

103
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,879
If something goes wrong with him

104
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:18,800
Our home Ajun

105
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,920
Definitely won't stand by

106
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,279
Will definitely help

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,199
Then you say

108
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,959
Will Ajun's business be affected?

109
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,199
Yes

110
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,119
Sit and sit

111
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,319
That's something to be happy

112
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,920
I bought a suite some time ago

113
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
Ajun always advised me to buy it

114
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
He thought I was the house

115
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,759
Too broken and old

116
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,159
There's just such a chance

117
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,079
Many people are thinking about this house

118
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,159
It's still Ajun and the young master of the Lu family

119
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:53,920
Say hello

120
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,079
It's just in my hands

121
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,920
Not easy

122
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,720
This matter is urgent anyway

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
Then I didn't say hello to you

124
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,160
The house is well decorated

125
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,439
Don't worry too much

126
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,040
The taste is almost done

127
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,199
Just wait

128
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
You've come here to decide on the style of furniture

129
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,839
What style of furniture do you like

130
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,160
If you turn around, I will take you there

131
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,120
Let's choose

132
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,399
One day to choose

133
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,279
There are a lot of things happening in the store recently

134
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,519
I can't take time to accompany you

135
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,480
Let's talk about it later

136
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,120
Director Liu

137
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,639
This winter is snowing heavily

138
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,279
Cold can easily enter the heart

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,920
Pay more attention to keeping warm

140
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,399
Jiali

141
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,000
Your immigration procedures have been completed

142
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,000
Open it and take a look

143
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,800
So fast

144
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,160
yes

145
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,079
I'm looking for an immigration agency that is very experienced

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,800
Let's talk about it

147
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,240
Our conditions are so good

148
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,720
So it's done very quickly

149
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
After the Spring Festival at the latest

150
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,959
I'll arrange someone

151
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,240
Send you and your children

152
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,319
Hiroaki

153
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,000
I dare not take my children abroad alone

154
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,279
Can't you send us there

155
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,279
Don't be afraid

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,759
All the houses have been bought there

157
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,879
There are very professional people

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,199
Take you to familiarize yourself with the environment

159
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,240
Enrollment for children

160
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,279
You don't have to worry about anything

161
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,959
I'm mainly in Shanghai

162
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,759
Too many people stare at

163
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,800
You cannot leave this time

164
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll get everything done

165
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,839
I'll go and accompany you

166
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,079
OK

167
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,600
OK, ask mom, okay

168
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,199
OK

169
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,160
good

170
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,720
Why is the snow still falling?

171
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,240
I know

172
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,199
You tell him

173
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,240
I'll coordinate with him later

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,879
What about meetings

175
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,680
Low temperature

176
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,639
Blizzard

177
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,440
Now add freezing rain

178
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,159
Highways and railways to the north

179
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,519
It's barely understandable

180
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,919
Go south to west

181
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,399
Basically it's broken

182
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,480
Raw materials cannot be shipped

183
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Our finished products cannot be shipped out

184
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,080
Workshop work

185
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,240
No matter how you adjust it, it won't be smooth

186
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,759
I've read the news and said

187
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Some areas in the southwest

188
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,879
Water and electricity cut off in the whole city

189
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,000
No basic living security

190
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,440
The People's Liberation Army has dispatched to rescue

191
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,759
Our employees

192
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,840
Are there any of these places

193
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,559
There are seven or eight Guizhou

194
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,279
They called their hometown

195
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,279
None of them can be contacted either

196
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,120
Some people are ready

197
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,120
Quilt and dry food

198
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,200
Say it's leaving

199
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,600
Go home, too

200
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,759
It's too dangerous to go on the road at this time

201
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,000
I have to persuade them to stay

202
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,039
What difficulties

203
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,639
The company can help solve it

204
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:28,960
yes

205
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,840
I have another problem

206
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,159
What about our workshop

207
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,480
All are large-span steel roofs

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What about load-bearing design

209
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,639
It's all based on normal standards

210
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,639
Weather forecast says

211
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,039
There will be more snow in two days

212
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,039
Uncommon to meet in a century

213
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,240
I'm worried about the burden

214
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,799
Can you withstand it

215
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,799
Not to

216
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,039
Workshop equipment production

217
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,159
There will be a lot of heat

218
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,639
There will be no snow on the roof

219
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,039
Now there is no problem

220
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,960
The Spring Festival holiday is coming soon

221
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,080
Workshops will be shut down for at least half a month

222
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,039
If the snow keeps going

223
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,440
Then it's hard to say

224
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,960
Now

225
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,279
High technology is useless

226
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,279
I have a rustic solution

227
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,039
Mr. Liu, look

228
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,200
The heavy snow keeps stopping

229
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,879
This fire cannot be stopped

230
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,879
Don't worry

231
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,320
I'm asking employees who don't go home

232
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,639
Take turns staring at me for twenty-four hours

233
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,559
Will not stop

234
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,879
You have a way

235
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,080
What are the local methods

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,519
OK, then you can watch it

237
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,399
OK, I'll go there and take a look

238
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,320
Xiao Liu walked over there

239
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,720
What's idiot

240
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,000
After New Year's Day

241
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
All kinds of emergency in the company

242
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,399
Be very busy

243
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,919
No benefits yet

244
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,480
Seeing such a snow disaster begin

245
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,360
Think about it, it will be put into production soon

246
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,279
Heat treatment plant

247
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
In my heart

248
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,720
A little weak

249
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,120
I don't know how long it will take to fall.

250
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,759
yes

251
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,720
This is the situation now

252
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,519
Mr. Liu

253
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,639
You see if that's Mr. Money

254
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,480
Mr. Money

255
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,320
What kind of car is so handsome

256
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,399
This is your car

257
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,840
Good boy, you

258
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,679
When is the asset

259
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,840
So strong

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
All bought such a good car

261
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,679
Just buy a car

262
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
There is no need to be so excited

263
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,720
Money buys this car

264
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,480
Can still be excited

265
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,399
A little bit arrogant

266
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,639
Isn't it New Year's Eve in a few days?

267
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,279
I guess you're almost busy

268
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,679
I'll open it over

269
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,360
Take you for a walk

270
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,559
Give me the car key

271
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,480
You can drive without a key

272
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,080
Keyless Start

273
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,200
Mr. Money

274
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,799
Can you bring me one

275
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,480
Get on the car

276
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,320
OK

277
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,480
Is it appropriate for me to sit here

278
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,279
suitable

279
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,600
Thank you Thank you

280
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,080
who

281
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,519
Who is so big

282
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,240
Hongming

283
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,120
You didn't see Luo Qing

284
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,360
That's a terrible look

285
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,080
Almost drooled in someone's car

286
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,120
Qian Hongming

287
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,519
How is it possible

288
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,720
Such a good car

289
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,440
impossible

290
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,639
You don't look at others either

291
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,960
These businesses span

292
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,080
Futures Finance Real Estate Foreign Trade

293
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,159
All in recent years

294
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,399
The most profitable area

295
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,919
People have this strength

296
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,799
No, right

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,919
Qian Hongming is not relaxed

298
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,120
There is not a saying

299
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,639
There will be evil if something goes wrong

300
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,679
There must be monsters here

301
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,960
What monster is there

302
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,200
What you told me some time ago

303
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,240
Qian Hongming has problems with his capital chain

304
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,840
I've also opened this for you

305
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,399
Is the letter of credit turnover?

306
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,639
I'll tell you if there's a fraud here

307
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,039
Turnover is October

308
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,639
The external market improves

309
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,039
He immediately paid back the principal and interest place

310
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,439
Big ups and downs

311
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,759
It's the characteristic of their industry

312
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,679
Not as nervous as you think

313
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,039
and

314
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,840
This car is a regular car

315
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,080
Need to wait half a year

316
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,840
Then he picked up the car

317
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,120
It must have been before October

318
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,120
What a scam this can be

319
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,480
What can he cheat me

320
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,360
Waiting for half a year on routine

321
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,759
How long does it take to wait for unconventional

322
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:48,879
Right

323
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,240
Temporarily transfer an order from someone else

324
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,600
You can get the car in one week, right

325
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,120
Donghai says nothing is big or not

326
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,919
He's driving a good car

327
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,759
Go out for a walk

328
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,480
I won't say it once I've appeared too much

329
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,679
Ah Jun

330
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,960
At least he can pretend

331
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,120
Half a year's storefront

332
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,399
You smile

333
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,919
You don't understand, you're still stubborn.

334
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,440
Ren Bingbing works in the bank

335
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,360
People must understand

336
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,320
For those who borrow money

337
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,399
What is most important

338
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,079
Stabilize customer confidence

339
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,120
This is the most important

340
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,919
Your big bank

341
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm afraid of what kind of noise the customers hear

342
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,720
Hurry up and squeeze

343
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,639
Isn't that all messed up

344
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,559
It's not ice

345
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,360
Dad, don't worry

346
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,120
Even if Qian Hongming wants to show off his wealth,

347
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,919
The target is definitely not Liu Jun

348
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Just Liu Jun can control the millions

349
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,240
Qian Hongming

350
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,879
I don't like this little money at all

351
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,559
Qian Hongming has always liked to change cars

352
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
This is the hobby

353
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,600
Not as complicated as you think

354
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,679
Bubble

355
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,759
I want to eat an apple, too

356
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,440
Give me an apple

357
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,120
Give him an apple

358
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,840
Come

359
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,000
Reach your hand

360
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:48,639
Very awesome

361
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,480
Delicious and delicious

362
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,679
OK, it's finished

363
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,279
Is it okay for us to play

364
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,679
Do I need to help

365
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,120
You don't have to play with your kids

366
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:56,879
good

367
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,559
Let's go baby

368
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,919
Better

369
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,919
Let's go play

370
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,200
OK

371
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,600
What's this

372
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,399
rainbow

373
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,759
Then this is the rainbow?

374
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:18,840
Wife

375
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,879
You said dad

376
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,639
I've been here for dinner recently

377
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,399
Also help take care of Xiaopupa

378
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,559
Is he following Qian Hongying

379
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,320
Fewer contact

380
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,399
It's too lonely alone

381
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,679
It's possible

382
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,480
I'll ask you

383
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,600
If one day

384
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,240
Dad and Qian Hongying are really separated

385
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,200
What do you think

386
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,519
to be honest

387
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,519
When they were together

388
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm actually quite uncomfortable

389
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,279
But you want to say

390
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,879
That's it

391
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,879
I think it's even worse

392
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,879
Why

393
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,559
Dad's age

394
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,320
It's impossible to stay alone

395
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,360
Looking for another one

396
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,279
Love to make trouble

397
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,279
Scam him

398
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,879
That's not as good as Qian Hongying

399
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,840
Don't worry

400
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,200
Just dad is so stingy

401
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,960
No one can deceive him

402
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,080
Too

403
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,639
When I came just now

404
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,399
I saw a lot of people around the door

405
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,679
Why are you still here

406
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,679
Is something wrong in the workshop?

407
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:37,600
no

408
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,720
Those people are here to find jobs

409
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,399
Work has started after the holiday

410
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,960
Several groups come every day

411
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
This long holiday has just passed a few days

412
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,519
Is the job hunting peak coming so soon?

413
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,840
Stock market surged last year

414
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,480
Yangtze River Delta Pearl River Delta

415
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,559
All are shortages of labor

416
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,720
This year, it fell sharply

417
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,000
The first game after the festival

418
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,200
Fresh graduate job fair

419
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
Almost been squeezed

420
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,200
Mr. Liu

421
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,320
I'm just about to ask you for instructions on this matter

422
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,960
You've been recruiting people all year round

423
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:05,519
The process is so familiar that it can't be more familiar

424
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:06,839
What else do you ask me for instructions

425
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:10,720
I know Mr. Liu is willing to cultivate talents

426
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:12,880
There are also many college students this year

427
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,880
All sent a resume

428
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,559
Between them and skilled workers

429
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,000
How to choose

430
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,358
I want to hear your opinions

431
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,160
The new labor contract law has just been implemented

432
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,400
The specific implementation effect is not clear

433
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,680
There are risks in cultivating newcomers

434
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,680
Let's choose a skilled one first

435
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:36,920
good

436
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,839
The heat treatment center recruits workers

437
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,440
I've arranged this principle too

438
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,079
OK

439
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,799
good

440
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,720
What's wrong with you?

441
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,039
As soon as Lao Zhu came in

442
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,039
You'll stop talking

443
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,559
Don't want to tell him

444
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,640
Isn't this just resumed production after the holiday?

445
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,000
I really don't want bad news to spread

446
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,400
Refund order

447
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,720
These three F-1 devices

448
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,039
Completed on all lines

449
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,039
Just ready to ship

450
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,200
I've received it here

451
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,440
The other party's agreement to refund the order

452
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,079
Mr. Liu

453
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,039
This is since our factory was built

454
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,200
The first time I encountered foreign unsubscribe

455
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,799
Enter

456
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,799
Ice Ice

457
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,519
Liu Xing

458
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,480
Long time no see

459
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,119
haven't seen you for a long time

460
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,359
Why are you here

461
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,079
I happen to be doing business nearby

462
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,440
This is not here to see you

463
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,880
You don't tell me either

464
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,720
It's not too late for me to say it now

465
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,319
I heard you were transferred to the fifth branch

466
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,599
Undertake approval

467
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,799
Have you been busy lately

468
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,240
Don't just talk about me

469
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,359
I'll see you here

470
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,000
There are also many letters of credit application

471
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,440
Can't even approve it

472
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,240
You know the current trends, too

473
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,000
Just tighter and tighter

474
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,599
Take a letter of credit to mortgage

475
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,799
Anything like a little

476
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
Suspicion of loan arrears

477
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,519
It's impossible for us to do it

478
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,799
Approved

479
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,480
Every row is the same

480
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,680
The money from Xiangtong foreign trade

481
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,480
Is it your husband's friend?

482
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,759
yes

483
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,519
They are classmates since childhood

484
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,799
He's just done with us

485
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,599
Apply for a

486
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,279
20 million letter of credit loan

487
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,279
There must be no problem before

488
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,000
But now the financial environment

489
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,799
You know in the industry

490
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,000
If we want to get a card

491
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,519
It's definitely stuck them first

492
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,200
It's 20 million yuan

493
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,720
A little scary

494
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,319
Such a big refund

495
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,480
Have you asked what the reason is

496
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,039
It is said to be the European headquarters

497
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,359
A serious crisis

498
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,720
Rather pay a penalty

499
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,400
It must stop expanding immediately

500
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,759
But it's a specific

501
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,960
What kind of crisis

502
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,039
Their Chinese representatives did not say it clearly

503
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,759
Asking questions are just one sentence

504
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,279
Extremely serious

505
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,440
If you don't save your strength quickly

506
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,039
There is a risk of bankruptcy

507
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:25,920
It seems so

508
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,240
It must be a financial problem

509
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,000
This subprime mortgage storm

510
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,039
Finally affected us

511
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,400
In the past two years

512
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,359
CPI (price index) rises

513
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,079
Banks have been raising interest rates

514
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,839
Rate hike

515
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,119
Unexpectedly

516
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,720
The Fed will cut interest rates urgently

517
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,920
Seventy-five basis points

518
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:50,759
Mr. Liu

519
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,319
You think this crisis

520
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,559
Will it continue to spread

521
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,519
In turn, it triggers global

522
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,599
What about the recession

523
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:42,599
Enter

524
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,759
Is Sister Qian coaxing now?

525
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,200
What to copy

526
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,480
Didn't you ask me to copy the file

527
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,839
I forgot

528
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,160
Come on, come on

529
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,039
I have very important files in it

530
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't move around

531
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,920
Don't worry, I'll be quick

532
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,359
Hello

533
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,559
During the Spring Festival

534
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,480
I've met some old friends

535
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,480
Many of them told me

536
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,400
You've borrowed money from them, have you?

537
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,720
That's not borrowing money

538
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,039
It's about letting them participate in the investment

539
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,200
Hongming's project

540
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,799
You know this too

541
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,200
Yes Yes Yes

542
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,599
I'm wrong with my tongue

543
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,279
Investing in

544
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,279
I heard you're paying very high interest

545
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,839
Many people earn this interest rate

546
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,039
Borrow money from relatives and friends

547
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,799
Then invest the money to you

548
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,079
Hirohide

549
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,759
I won't say this

550
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,039
You should understand, too

551
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,319
What if the capital chain is broken

552
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:25,920
Is this very dangerous

553
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,279
We have physical projects on hand

554
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,200
High interest

555
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,200
It's because of the high expected returns

556
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,160
Not to make money

557
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,240
You have physical projects

558
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,720
Well, your physical project

559
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,640
When will it be available

560
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,440
When will the funds be returned

561
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,319
There's always a plan for this

562
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,759
Hongming said

563
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,759
The real estate market is fluctuating now

564
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,279
It's better to wait a few more months

565
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,920
Wait until the second and third quarters

566
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,160
New policies will be introduced then

567
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,279
Stimulating the economy

568
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,839
Then launch the project

569
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,079
income

570
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,960
It will definitely be more secure than now

571
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,200
And Hongming also said

572
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,359
Hongming still said

573
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,160
Do you believe whatever Hongming said?

574
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,319
That's my brother

575
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,759
Who else can I believe if I don't believe him?

576
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,880
Don't get me wrong

577
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,200
I don't mean that

578
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:27,039
I have no other meaning

579
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,559
I know

580
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,039
Hongming has done a good job in recent years

581
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,479
I did make a lot of money

582
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,880
But this year's situation

583
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,519
Totally different

584
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,079
Are you afraid of his mistakes in judgment

585
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,000
The background of Tianmao Building

586
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Although I don't know

587
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,680
But I know

588
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,480
The largest shareholder is not us

589
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,880
Hongming said

590
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,039
As long as that big man is still in place

591
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,680
There is no risk in this project

592
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:57,680
I believe

593
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,240
I believe he has a judgment

594
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Something else in the store

595
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:08,920
I'll leave first

596
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,640
Hongying

597
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,240
It's really a matter of

598
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,440
Under the bridge in front of the door

599
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,319
Swimming through a group of ducks

600
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,519
Bye-Bye

601
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,400
Wave to the big car

602
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,119
dad

603
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,200
I've told you all

604
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,279
After I get off work

605
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,720
I'll just pick it up at home

606
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,880
Who is it? It's mother

607
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,079
I'm going to go out for a walk.

608
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,920
Please come here.

609
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:51,759
It's okay

610
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,480
Then be careful when you drive on the way back

611
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,200
OK OK OK

612
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,839
Say goodbye to grandpa

613
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:57,920
Goodbye if you're not busy

614
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,160
Goodbye baby if you're not busy

615
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:00,920
Ice Ice

616
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
I have to tell you something

617
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,720
This matter is quite important

618
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,039
You turn around and persuade Ah Jun

619
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,000
You speak more effectively than me

620
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,960
He listens to you

621
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,519
What's the matter

622
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,480
My dad said

623
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,440
Tell me not to lend money to Qian Hongming

624
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,519
What are you talking about this?

625
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,079
They didn't ask me to borrow money

626
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,279
He didn't say it very clearly, either

627
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,119
But I think

628
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:34,359
With his relationship with Qian Hongying

629
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,119
What he must have discovered

630
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,279
Actually, I'm quite worried, too

631
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,960
I heard today

632
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,519
After the Spring Festival

633
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,279
Qian Hongming applied for a

634
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,640
A loan of 20 million

635
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,920
Approved by the bank card

636
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,440
I guess I can't get a loan

637
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,480
Hongming's recent funding situation

638
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,680
I really don't understand

639
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,079
Then refuse to loan for the 20 million yuan

640
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,480
Will it crush him?

641
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,039
Probably not

642
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,440
Qian Hongming's funding scale

643
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,319
Not small

644
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,559
What you usually do

645
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,920
The business of demolishing the east wall and repairing the west wall

646
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,079
Just 20 million

647
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,960
Even if the bank doesn't give it to him

648
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:11,920
He's on the market

649
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,440
It can be found too

650
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,799
The problem now is

651
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,160
You're afraid

652
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,559
There is one, there is two

653
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,240
There will be banks that refuse to loan one after another

654
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,559
Dong Yi's investment of 20 million

655
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,160
30 million in western

656
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,759
If this news spreads

657
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,480
He's even more trouble

658
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,160
the same as you

659
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,519
The credit tightens

660
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,759
The difficulty of taking off the acceptance bill

661
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,240
It must be bigger than before

662
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,119
When it's time to discount

663
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,480
The bank will definitely go to the factory

664
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,039
For more proof of transaction

665
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,680
You prepare your finances in advance

666
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,119
This financial department

667
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,920
Already ready

668
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:55,799
Don't worry

669
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:00,920
I still think

670
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,119
Hongming shouldn't have a big problem

671
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,440
If he really lacks money, he

672
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,799
Qian Hongying spoke out and borrowed money everywhere

673
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,200
He can't say nothing to me

674
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,759
And after the holiday

675
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,000
Carrie was just here with me

676
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,200
Saved 50,000 yuan

677
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,240
It was said that Hongming gave her living expenses

678
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,000
And Xiao Taozi's New Year's money

679
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,039
Don't this look normal

680
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,039
Your argument

681
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,799
No convincing at all

682
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,359
No matter how short of money he is

683
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,400
He can't be missing either

684
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,119
Wife and children's pocket money

685
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,160
What is the financial situation recently

686
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,519
Tengfei still has an order

687
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,680
Can help you issue a letter of credit of five million

688
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,920
Need

689
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,680
Wait for me at the company after get off work tomorrow

690
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,880
Talk to you

691
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,920
good

692
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,839
Still hot

693
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,599
What to drink

694
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:29,640
Coke or coffee

695
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,480
Coffee bar

696
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,640
Give

697
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:32,880
Thanks

698
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,000
Come to a fort

699
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,079
Something interesting

700
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,400
What's interesting

701
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,039
When you just returned to China

702
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,720
This is what I'm treating you to eat

703
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,119
Still this taste

704
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,119
Ten years have passed

705
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,440
Ten years

706
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,480
House prices have risen by five or six times

707
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,400
This thing didn't raise the price much

708
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,519
You are a physical one and will pass

709
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,559
Even if you invite guests, you won't be able to raise prices

710
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,720
Do you like to eat or not

711
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,559
eat

712
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,000
Thank you

713
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,559
What's wrong

714
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,039
I'll say thank you if you want a fried chicken

715
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,039
These years

716
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,680
I met a lot of people

717
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,000
Have made many friends

718
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,920
Only you really care about my situation

719
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,599
You're the only one

720
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,039
This time I offered to help me find money

721
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,359
There is no one else in this

722
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,519
Tell me the truth

723
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,160
Recent funds

724
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,200
Are you very nervous

725
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,160
It's true

726
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,599
Two bank loans were stuck

727
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,279
There is another

728
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,400
It's because the customer cannot apply for a loan transfer

729
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,160
I'm stuck in a lot of money

730
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,000
Can't take it back

731
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,440
It really makes me feel a little uncomfortable

732
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,599
Then you still buy a luxury car

733
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,119
Many people are willing to watch it

734
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Something on the surface

735
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,880
The market is volatile now

736
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,480
Buy a car

737
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,000
It is a strategy to stabilize confidence

738
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,799
Don't worry

739
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,079
In the past few years

740
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,680
I also have a good foundation

741
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,960
Vulnerabilities like this

742
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,279
I can fill it in

743
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:34,240
Don't worry

744
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,359
I'll never abscond with the money

745
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,279
That's fine

746
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,240
You can control it

747
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,680
I'll come to find you today

748
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,160
It has nothing to do with money

749
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,039
There is another thing

750
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,599
Want to ask for help

751
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,720
Everything is used to ask for words

752
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:00,480
We're here

753
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,039
A little bit below Shanghai

754
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,440
This is Australia

755
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,240
Where is Dad going to send us

756
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
There are so many seas

757
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,119
Yes

758
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,440
Do you remember last summer

759
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,000
Let's go swimming by the beach together

760
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:19,880
Australia

761
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,640
There are also big beaches

762
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,519
Dad said you will definitely like it

763
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,640
Then will we take a plane to go

764
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Take a plane to go

765
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,119
It will take a long time to fly

766
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,440
Mom, I don't want to go

767
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,640
It's too far from home here

768
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,960
I'll miss dad

769
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,880
Send Carrie and her children to Australia

770
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,880
Even if you give it, you'll give it

771
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,880
What's wrong with me sending it

772
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,880
The situation is so sensitive now

773
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:12,960
Financial capital

774
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,799
What I fear most is the rumor spreading

775
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,079
If I'm

776
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,079
Stay away last week

777
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,400
You think it will be transmitted

778
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,359
What kind of news is coming

779
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,720
This is also

780
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,519
But I really can't walk away lately

781
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,400
Import and export troubles are constantly

782
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,599
Domestic sales strategy is adjusted every day

783
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,960
The heat treatment center is ready to start production

784
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,519
This is a lot of tricks

785
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,680
Let's not talk about a week

786
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,920
Even if I squeeze out for three days, I'm going to be terrible

787
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,240
What about your subordinate of the foreign trade company

788
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,160
So many people who know English

789
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,599
You can always find someone who is capable

790
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,519
There are people who do business

791
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,200
But I'm afraid

792
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,680
They can't control their mouths

793
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,160
This is the matter of sending your wife and children out of the country

794
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,079
Don't know too many people

795
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,319
Let's talk about it

796
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,680
Carrie is most afraid of

797
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:03,920
Contact strangers

798
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:05,759
What she has always trusted the most is you

799
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,960
Then why don't you let Jiali go out a few days later

800
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,639
I'll start to adjust my work now

801
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,719
One month later

802
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,239
Maybe some time

803
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,880
I'll think of another way

804
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,440
If it doesn't work after one month

805
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,800
I'll come to you again

806
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,760
Then I'll tell Bingbing when I go back

807
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,480
Why promise him

808
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,039
What requests does Qian Hongming make

809
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,079
You promised him

810
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,639
You're his dormant

811
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,239
He made this request

812
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,280
That's weird enough

813
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,000
You're still asking me

814
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,159
You're more weird than him

815
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,920
Bingbing me

816
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:48,639
Shut up

817
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,880
I'll tell you Liu Qipa

818
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,039
Don't say you don't have time

819
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,079
Even if you have time

820
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,199
I won't let you go, either

821
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,760
Qian Hongming doesn't care

822
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,559
I can't

823
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,679
Why do I let my husband

824
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,159
Take care of other women in front of the saddle

825
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,079
I'm disgusted

826
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:00,960
Can you, Bingbing

827
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,679
Don't describe this as

828
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,760
So awkward

829
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,840
I'm awkward

830
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:08,760
OK

831
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,320
Then I'm not sorry

832
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,199
I'll go for you

833
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,159
No no no no

834
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,840
Her wife is Lin Daiyu

835
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,760
Your wife is rough

836
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,119
I'm a snail girl

837
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,440
Then do I have to hurry up

838
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,079
Go and ask for a New Year's leave with my leader

839
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
This year is not enough

840
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,280
I'll invite you for two years

841
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,679
I'll serve her for you myself

842
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,320
OK

843
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,599
No, no, no, no, no,

844
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,119
If you disagree

845
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:28,880
I won't go

846
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,639
I'll listen to you

847
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,920
You're so embarrassed to ask me

848
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,400
I'll tell you Liu Qipa

849
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,199
You'll make this request to me in the future

850
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,960
Break your legs

851
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,199
Are you crazy

852
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,599
Really

853
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,159
Have a good wife at home

854
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Dare to speak

855
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,159
Nothing to be embarrassed

856
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,079
I understand

857
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,400
After I came back, I thought about it again

858
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,320
It's true that I'm not thinking well

859
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,360
This is not suitable for you

860
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,880
There are so many things in your company and at home

861
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Bingbing disagrees

862
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,159
It's normal too

863
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:08,760
How about it

864
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,159
She's not angry

865
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,800
No, no

866
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,159
She's very calm

867
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,599
She just let me go

868
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,559
Tell me to you earlier

869
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,000
Don't wait for a month in vain

870
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:19,960
Can't help

871
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,199
Have you read the news recently

872
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
The Fed launches again

873
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:26,920
Two new measures

874
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,119
To stimulate liquidity

875
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,199
This is good for you

876
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,880
Not so immediate

877
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,320
What I care most about now

878
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,199
It is a domestic credit policy

879
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,440
Money has been tightly collected recently

880
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:43,920
Someday

881
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,320
Let's have a good chat another day

882
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,400
Let's go, another day

883
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,559
Bye-Bye

884
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,039
Parking Parking

885
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,320
Mr. Yan

886
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,760
You're looking for someone to watch my skull

887
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,360
Don't make a clever one

888
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,280
If I think it's good

889
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,719
Can still be received by your side

890
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,079
Be a bodyguard or something

891
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,679
No need to explain

892
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,639
Everyone is on the same boat

893
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,719
If I really force me to aggravate

894
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,320
In the end, no one can get any benefits

895
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,280
Sister, why are you here

896
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:18,000
What happened to your phone today

897
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,360
I've been busy after calling several times

898
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,480
I'll pour you a glass of water

899
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:23,519
What water to drink

900
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,719
The payment period is coming soon

901
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:27,960
Banks until now

902
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,880
Still can't put a penny down

903
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,599
Hiroaki

904
00:38:32,238 --> 00:38:33,280
If someone knows

905
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,199
We can't even pay interest

906
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:37,920
What to do

907
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,519
Sister

908
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,840
Don't worry, don't worry

909
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:42,599
Bank policies

910
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,039
It's impossible to be so tight forever

911
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,000
The loan matter

912
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,440
I'm already working

913
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,280
Surely can't be mistaken

914
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,519
You pay interest this month

915
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,239
Now interest is one thing

916
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,280
What I'm most worried about

917
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,519
Which one is urgently used

918
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,400
Find me to get the principal

919
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,239
Hiroaki

920
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,719
What's wrong?

921
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,960
Our brother and brother have a good life

922
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,880
Why did you live like before

923
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,119
Every day, I'm terrified

924
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,920
I'm afraid the creditor will knock on the door

925
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,800
How could it be the same as before

926
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,800
Accounts for this project

927
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,119
It's clear in my mind

928
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,480
Just get through this

929
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,760
The most intense period

930
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,639
That's fine

931
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,039
If you're really scared

932
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,800
You move to my high-rise building and live there

933
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:39,480
The security at the top of the city is pretty good

934
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,199
At least than where you live now

935
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,840
Be safe

936
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,719
You don't have to be hypocritical

937
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,199
So many people who invested money

938
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,280
Staring at me

939
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,719
You really dare to let me hide

940
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,599
Recently, you've also been looking for money every day

941
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,559
I often go home after three o'clock in the middle of the night

942
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,719
This day has been

943
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,800
Even I'm worried

944
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,280
Carrie must be even more scared

945
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,199
You'd better let her first

946
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,840
Move to that high-rise building

947
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,159
Your passport and boarding pass

948
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,119
Thanks

949
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,639
goodbye

950
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,480
Then you're done with it

951
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,679
You'll come here early

952
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,519
good

953
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,599
Dad isn't coming

954
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:54,119
good

955
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,840
Let's go there and wait for dad first

956
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,159
Wait until he's done

957
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,280
Come and find us

958
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,719
Jiali

959
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:04,880
Thanks

What do you want to give to your sister

961
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,800
My favorite toy

962
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:09,920
To my sister

963
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,400

966
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,239
When I'm not here

967
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,719
Please take care of Hongming more

968
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,880
He's having a bad sleep lately

969
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,199
I asked him to go to the hospital

970
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,400
He doesn't listen to me either

971
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,280
Please advise him

972
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:37,920
Don't worry

973
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,480

Ice Ice

978
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,239

980
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,440
After going to Australia

981
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,880
You'll have to rely on you alone

982
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,000
Be strong

983
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:26,880
I know

984
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,079
Don't worry

985
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,559
Let's go

986
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,800

Bye bye bye bye

991
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:45,000
We're leaving

992
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,199
Go

993
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,000
