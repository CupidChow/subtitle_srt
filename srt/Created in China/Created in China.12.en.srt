1
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,640
Ajun, I'm in the factory

2
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,598
Don't panic

3
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,598
Ah Jun

4
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,519
What's going on

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,920
Cao Fei from the heat treatment workshop

6
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,759
I fell while the production line was running

7
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:01,439
The back of the head hit the pull-up truck

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Just declared dead

9
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:04,879
Cao Fei

10
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,120
How did he fall in?

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,598
Isn't there a guardrail?

12
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,120
He opened the guardrail himself

13
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,919
I guess I want to take a shortcut

14
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,240
I'll remind me every day

15
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:16,840
I've scolded several times

16
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,759
Why are some people still not listening?

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,319
I'll tell you

18
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,199
Don't interfere in this matter

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,199
Dad has experience

20
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,000
Dad, come and deal with it

21
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,800
This Cao Fei seems

22
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
He is an only child

23
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,759
In addition to insurance,

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,478
Why don't we give more

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,599
Can you compensate him for the factory?

26
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,240
no

27
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,079
You always say you need to do things according to law

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,000
Do things according to law

29
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,759
Why is it not lawful at this time

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,960
We run a business, son

31
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,199
Not a charity

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,319
Because of this matter

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,360
The heat treatment workshop has been sealed

34
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,360
All subsequent processes are stopped for material preparation

35
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,400
Just had a bank loan

36
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
It's also ruined

37
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,919
Who will compensate for this loss

38
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,919
That's what it means

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,439
But we can't be too cold-blooded

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,159
Don't say it, Ajun won't say it

41
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,360
This is our takeoff

42
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,199
Death of the first work

43
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,239
Must be strictly followed by regulations

44
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,319
Dear leaders

45
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,719
In these files

46
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,439
There is a safety regulations

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,800
One is a safety training manual

48
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,280
and after the staff is trained

49
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,240
Signature record

50
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,400
There are two more books

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,639
Workshop safety operation files every day

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,360
and the supervisor's inspection records

53
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,159
Please review the leaders

54
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,079
Xiaozhi

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,478
hurry up

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,199
OK

57
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,800
Sorry, leader

58
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,840
Sorry for the meeting

59
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,800
I know you're busy

60
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:16,639
How is the situation

61
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,279
Just started the investigation

62
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,120
Take one step at a time

63
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,720
Always handled

64
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,879
Don't be too stressed

65
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,040
These days it's cold

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,639
Drink more soup and make up for it

67
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,040
Why are you so gentle and virtuous all of a sudden

68
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,040
They all look a little different from you

69
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,399
I've gotten hung up beforehand

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,800
Call you tonight

71
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,319
good

72
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,639
Mr. Liu

73
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,319
You can see how to arrange supper for a while

74
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,199
dinner

75
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,040
Let me tell you what I think

76
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,199
Don't mind

77
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,399
you say

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,319
I know Mr. Liu, you are confident

79
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,800
Our company is not afraid of investigation

80
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,079
But now some practices

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,279
It exists, and it exists.

82
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,279
We can't go against it

83
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,639
I understand what you mean

84
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,240
Now is not the time to be noble

85
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,000
You'll find a restaurant later

86
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,839
Order a private room

87
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,000
Everyone prepares a good cigarette

88
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,199
We'll go with you tonight

89
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,240
good

90
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,439
Pour some water for you

91
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,759
Thank you

92
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:34,959
You can also

93
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,000
Thanks Thanks

94
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:36,879
good

95
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,720
Really

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,639
You see, you work so late

97
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,600
Don't go to the hotel

98
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,439
Have some working meals in this cafeteria

99
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,879
Leaders like this

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,720
Efficient and honest style

101
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,040
We are really touched

102
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,639
Director Liu

103
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,279
We don't have to do these

104
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,199
Your factory is pretty standard

105
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,600
We all see it

106
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,480
The investigation has come to this point

107
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,720
I can also say with my conscience

108
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,639
Your operation process

109
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,040
Safety protection

110
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,800
That's pretty good

111
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,680
Thank you leader

112
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,199
Thanks

113
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,480
Stop talking about a private enterprise

114
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,360
It's from this industrial area

115
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,560
A few foreign companies

116
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,279
Not necessarily better than your family

117
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,720
But even if we manage it strictly

118
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,879
I can't guard against accidents

119
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,879
I'm an old security guard

120
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,560
There have been many accidents investigated

121
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,279
Some accidents look back

122
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,639
It's really hard to explain

123
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,680
Obviously there is no problem

124
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,839
But it just happened to be a fool and hit me

125
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,639
Rectification report

126
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,879
I don't know how to get out

127
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,240
Mr. Liu this time

128
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,759
The situation is almost the same

129
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,759
Thousands of precautions

130
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,759
Can't be prevented

131
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,279
A small probability of accident

132
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,279
It's okay not to admit defeat

133
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,240
Yeah yeah

134
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,319
Mr. Liu said so too

135
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,240
This is a life

136
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,040
But don't worry

137
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,959
We will definitely pay if it is time to pay

138
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,120
Yes Yes Yes

139
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,240
Aftermath

140
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,600
We'll do it well

141
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,399
Director Li

142
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,839
You see the accident scene

143
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,240
Checked already

144
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,439
Ours

145
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
Heat treatment workshop

146
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,680
When will it be unblocked

147
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,800
I asked this is not cold-blooded

148
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,240
You know too

149
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,318
The manufacturing process is a long chain

150
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,319
A certain link has stopped

151
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,920
That's affected overall

152
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,199
Look at our factory

153
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,199
So many workers

154
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,800
Everyone has to wait

155
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,959
Where to eat when you start working

156
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,759
Yes Yes Yes

157
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,639
I know the difficulties of your factory

158
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,560
But the procedure to go

159
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,680
Must be done

160
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,319
Three appraisal meetings

161
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,680
No less at once

162
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,279
Fortunately, your materials are clear

163
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,519
Time shouldn't be delayed for a long time

164
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,639
Two or three days

165
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,439
Thank you leader

166
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,199
Thanks Thanks

167
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,199
Thank you Thank you Thank you

168
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,879
Thanks Thanks Thanks

169
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,800
son

170
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,480
My son is back

171
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,839
son

172
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,480
How do you let me and your mother live

173
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,959
You don't leave

174
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,199
Don't leave

175
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,759
Mr. Liu, what are you doing

176
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,720
Director Liu said he called you

177
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,800
Tell you not to show up

178
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,600
Didn't it all yesterday

179
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,720
Has the agreement been reached?

180
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,959
In addition to the agreed compensation

181
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,800
My dad added it again

182
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,759
Ten thousand yuan funeral expenses

183
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,040
What else do they make for?

184
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,639
The heat treatment workshop was unsealed today

185
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,120
It could have started construction.

186
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,079
Mr. Liu

187
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,160
That's the only child's life

188
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,360
Who would let us go easily

189
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,279
Let's talk about it

190
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,040
This kind of thing

191
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,639
There is no performance solution at once

192
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,679
If they are not satisfied

193
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,039
Then can we discuss it again

194
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,720
Just dominate the workshop and prevent it from starting work

195
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
This is illegal

196
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,960
Illegal is certain

197
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,360
I've called the police

198
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,720
But this is the case

199
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,000
Even if the police leave the scene

200
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,080
He can't force it either

201
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,159
Usually both sides

202
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,120
Take it to the police station to mediate first

203
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,279
Ah Jun

204
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,480
You kid

205
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,320
Rest not at home

206
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,159
What to do here

207
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Look at your eyes are red

208
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,840
Go home to sleep

209
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,919
They can't do this

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,759
Don't worry

211
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,559
I'll tell you

212
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:57,840
Wait for the police to come

213
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,759
They always have to follow

214
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,799
Go to the police station

215
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,639
I and the security guard at the door

216
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,399
Have said hello

217
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,399
Start today

218
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,919
Keep the door for us

219
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,399
No stranger is allowed to enter the factory

220
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,480
It wasn't our fault

221
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,080
Yes or no

222
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,720
right

223
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,200
We suffer losses

224
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,440
Also blackmailed

225
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,000
Leave it to me to handle it

226
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,919
You go quickly

227
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,039
Let's go, Mr. Liu

228
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,960
haven't seen you for a long time

229
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,840
What’s wrong with you

230
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,399
This face is dark

231
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,919
I don't know if you should be lucky

232
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,919
Still unfortunate

233
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,360
Lucky

234
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,440
It was you who started construction for half a year

235
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,919
No work injuries

236
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,440
Unfortunately, it's time to come

237
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,360
You'll meet the deadliest life

238
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,279
Don't even have some experience in dealing with it

239
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,600
You have been managing the company for longer than me

240
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,960
You deal with similar situations

241
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,120
It should be more experienced

242
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,080
Have dealt with a lot

243
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,480
Hello uncle and aunt

244
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,480
Hello

245
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,360
Don't say it far away

246
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,360
Just last week

247
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,919
Steel roof of the new factory

248
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,919
Colorful steel tiles

249
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,080
A worker fell down

250
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,720
Not rescued

251
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,879
Don't wear a seat belt when working at high altitudes

252
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,279
Of course it's done

253
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,720
But who would have thought of it

254
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,919
The rope tied to the steel beam

255
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,840
It happened to be sawed off

256
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,559
This is happening

257
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,120
No one feels good

258
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,440
But this project is outsourced

259
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,360
Contracting responsibility

260
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,320
Written clearly in the contract

261
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,279
Have nothing to do with us

262
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,960
What about the boss of the steel structure company

263
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,919
I went missing the next day

264
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,960
The family of the deceased brought a bunch of fellow villagers

265
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,720
Can't find him

266
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,279
So I came over and asked us for money

267
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,159
Then you say

268
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,600
How could we give him

269
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,960
Some things are reasonable and legal

270
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,919
But it always seems a bit unkind

271
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,519
Say something unscrupulous

272
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
The more this time

273
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,720
The more you can't be a saint

274
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,879
How much responsibility should the company bear

275
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,159
How much compensation is paid

276
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,159
All must be in accordance with the explicit provisions

277
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,440
The whole process

278
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,440
You show a hint of softness

279
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,399
Then you will never see the end again

280
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,919
Then you say other employees

281
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,720
See one

282
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,120
A completely unkind factory manager

283
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,080
No rabbit will die and fox will be sad

284
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,720
Losing a sense of belonging to the company

285
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,879
Haven't you always emphasized the rules the most

286
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,960
Legal and compliant as it is now

287
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,480
Clear handling of responsibilities

288
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,879
Isn't it the most consistent with the rules

289
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,720
How to do it

290
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,600
Our Mr. Dong

291
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,639
I've visited Tengfei once

292
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,399
I'll praise you

293
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,960
Say you have a high IQ

294
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,639
Know both business and technology

295
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,600
Profitable in just half a year

296
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,399
It's really amazing

297
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,399
No, no

298
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,879
Nothing as good as Mr. Dong praises

299
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,799
We're just making some profit now

300
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,639
But still lack money every day

301
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,360
When you're tight

302
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,240
Want to sell all the cars

303
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,000
Hello

304
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,879
Hello Mr. Dong

305
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,360
Shanshan

306
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,239
Who is next to you

307
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,879
Who is talking

308
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,279
Lin Chuan

309
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,399
I happened to meet in the community

310
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,360
By the way, ask her about handling work injuries

311
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,279
Then why are your voice so small

312
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,320
Are you afraid she will hear it is me

313
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,759
After all, she is Lin Yue’s sister

314
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,480
What if Lin Yue knew

315
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,279
Our affairs

316
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,639
I'm afraid he'll cause trouble for you

317
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,919
you're right

318
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,879
I really want to let Lin Yue discover

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,679
Foreign information is given to you

320
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,720
It's really possible to settle the score later

321
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,440
Let's be careful

322
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,080
Don't be afraid if you really get to that point

323
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
I'm protecting you

324
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,519
I'll make a rest today

325
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,080
Cook something at home

326
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,960
You come here to have a meal later

327
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,159
OK, then I'll come to find you later

328
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:05,320
You said it was a coincidence or not

329
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,960
Mr. Dong asked me to have dinner together

330
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,440
I know I'm with you

331
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,919
I must let you

332
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,559
Does Mr. Liu appreciate his face?

333
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,639
Mr. Dong of the first machine

334
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,879
Is Lin Chuan accompanying him?

335
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,120
How to speak sourly

336
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,279
Jealous

337
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,759
Less gilding on your face

338
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,200
Don't come or not

339
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,120
I'll eat myself and clean up

340
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,799
It's indeed my fault today

341
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,000
But it's a coincidence

342
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,200
Can I compensate you someday

343
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,840
Then I'll drive, hang up first

344
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,120
What to look at

345
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,759
Is there any problem with the equipment?

346
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,879
Mr. Liu has no

347
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,159
The equipment is running well

348
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,519
I'm thinking

349
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,200
This fence door is now opened and closed

350
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,320
All depend on workers' awareness

351
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,279
Still not very safe

352
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,399
I want to make some modification

353
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,840
I've thought about this question before

354
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,600
Is there any solution

355
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,679
I want to be here

356
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,960
Install an infrared sensor

357
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,320
Connect with our control room

358
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,720
When the production line is running

359
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,159
As long as the person passes

360
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,159
What about this pull cart

361
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
It will automatically shut down

362
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,759
Then this matter will be left to you for responsibility

363
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,600
If the transformation is successful

364
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,559
We can also apply

365
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,440
On other devices

366
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,039
OK

367
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,799
Mr. Liu

368
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,919
Mr. Liu is not good

369
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,120
Something happened to Mr. Liu

370
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,440
dad

371
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,000
Is it okay

372
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,759
Is it okay?

373
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,799
Don't worry if you're okay

374
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,679
I'll come back this time

375
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,519
Just blocked to the door

376
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,679
I'm going to do it now

377
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,879
I ran in quickly

378
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,240
Look at the car paint that poured on me

379
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,679
Call the police quickly

380
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,440
No, no

381
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,399
Can't call the police

382
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,279
The key police are here

383
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Isn't it mediation?

384
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,480
Isn't it a talk about Lao Zhu?

385
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,639
See how the talk is

386
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:07,919
Don't worry, don't worry

387
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,799
Wait and see what's going on

388
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,039
How about it

389
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,320
The lion opens his mouth

390
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,519
Mr. Liu

391
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,879
It's not a big deal to keep going like this

392
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,159
I can't get out of this morning shift

393
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,399
Can't get in for the evening shift

394
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,519
This is impossible to work

395
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,399
yes

396
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Even if the workers can find a place to climb over the wall

397
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,639
But the truck cannot enter and exit normally

398
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,679
Then the production order will still be chaotic

399
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,399
OK OK OK

400
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,799
Let's go back to work first

401
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,600
I'll find a way

402
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,240
OK let him think of a solution

403
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,360
Let's go back first

404
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,000
I have to climb over the wall and go home

405
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,759
Otherwise, you will stay in the factory for two days

406
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,759
That's OK

407
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,519
They want to block it

408
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:10,440
Ten and a half months

409
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,598
I'm not going home yet

410
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,519
Mr. Liu

411
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,440
Old factory manager

412
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,160
sorry

413
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,680
What's wrong you are

414
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,039
Cao Fei's Alcohol Test Sheet

415
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,680
What's going on

416
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,160
The day of the accident

417
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,200
I'm having a meal in the cafeteria

418
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,799
The subsequent process

419
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,079
All work will be suspended and waiting for materials

420
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,839
Just had a bank loan

421
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,519
It's also ruined

422
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,279
Whoever compensates for this loss shall compensate

423
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,079
Even though that's what

424
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,559
But we can't be too cold-blooded

425
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,440
Not to mention Ah Jun

426
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,400
Not to mention these

427
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,039
This is our first job loss

428
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,519
Must be strictly followed by regulations

429
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,480
No negotiation

430
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,640
When the Labor Bureau came to investigate

431
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,160
Why don't you take it out?

432
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,440
Work after drinking

433
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,640
An individual violation

434
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,400
This is something that the Labor Bureau needs to know

435
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,000
Insurance companies won't lose money

436
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,880
Mr. Liu

437
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Compensation for work-related injury death is 200,000

438
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,839
If the government doesn't pay the money

439
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,440
The family of the deceased will definitely depend on us

440
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,440
Let's pay

441
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,279
He doesn't care

442
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,559
Are you working illegally

443
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,400
Lao Zhu made sense

444
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,279
We need to take it out first

445
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,480
Then we've talked about it earlier

446
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,200
So many insurance premiums

447
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,279
All handed in vain

448
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,799
It's different if it's this

449
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,359
I'll look for them later

450
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,240
Take the lead in causing trouble

451
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,160
I'll tell them

452
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,359
We have this thing

453
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,279
I'll show it to him

454
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,400
If he dares to make trouble again

455
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,319
Hand over the order

456
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
He can't get a penny

457
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,319
Manager Zhu

458
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,000
I know you're going to take off

459
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,079
But this thing

460
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,039
If found

461
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,440
It's not just the bad luck

462
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,799
You're going to jail, too

463
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,640
Look at your child

464
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,480
Who knows if we don't say it

465
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:09,640
What's this

466
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,759
This is Cao Fei's violation of safety regulations

467
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,680
Blood test form for working after drinking

468
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
Work deaths caused by alcoholism

469
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,240
Not within the scope of compensation according to law

470
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,799
We've just met with the Labor Bureau

471
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,480
Contacted

472
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,680
They'll come here in a while

473
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,799
Re-invest

474
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,759
Cao Fei's work died

475
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,920
Insurance companies

476
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,240
There will be no compensation

477
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,559
We take off for this matter

478
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,839
There is no responsibility

479
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,519
If you make trouble again

480
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,640
At your own risk

481
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,440
Tear whatever you want

482
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,400
This is a copy

483
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,680
Who are you lying to?

484
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,279
Who should I scare

485
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,319
You don't understand it if we are a country man

486
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:52,960
Yes or no

487
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,039
After drinking

488
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,640
I think you want to pay the bill

489
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What's the use of making this fake

490
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,160
Believe it or not

491
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,680
The labor bureau's people later

492
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,440
Will come here to explain to you

493
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,119
People from the Labor Bureau

494
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,759
Explain what to explain to me

495
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,920
What did I listen to him?

496
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,759
Return my son

497
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,759
Return my son

498
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,240
Return my son

499
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,079
The police are here

500
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,720
Let's ask them to judge

501
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,960
Return my son

502
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,440
Return my son

503
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,920
Return my son

504
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,359
Return my son

505
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,759
Return my son

506
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,119
Let them return my son

507
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,759
Who will drink in the factory in the future

508
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,960
Fired immediately

509
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:57,920
yes

510
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:05,680
Jiali

511
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,319
I'll bring back a fish cake

512
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,920
Can be steamed

513
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,960
Already steamed in the pot

514
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,599
OK

515
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,640
Liu Jun

516
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,519
You're back from a business trip

517
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,119
Just entered the door for a while

518
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,640
I heard something happened in the factory

519
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:38,920
How about it

520
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,680
Have you handled it

521
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,720
It's been temporarily calmed down

522
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,359
Since you're back

523
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,039
Come out to have a drink with me at night

524
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,599
My stomach is full of bitter water

525
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,519
Just want to find someone to fall in love

526
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,000
Hiroaki

527
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,880
Let Liu Jun have a meal at home

528
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,160
Then don't go out

529
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,680
Carrie asks you to eat at home

530
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,400
Didn't you have a girlfriend?

531
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,200
Bring here to get to know each other

532
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,319
Shanshan

533
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,160
Someday

534
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,200
It's such a complicated thing for the company

535
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,519
I didn't tell her much

536
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,680
OK, let it be as you wish

537
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,920
See you later

538
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:12,839
See you later

539
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,720
Liu Jun has a girlfriend

540
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,640
How about it? Have you seen it?

541
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,240
Previously in the city

542
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,599
I met when talking about business

543
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
The only impression is

544
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,599
Very pretty

545
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,480
If you can have a stable partner

546
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,960
When you are upset in your work

547
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,759
When stressed

548
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:38,680
Someone talks

549
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,680
Very good too

550
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,839
yes

551
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,039
What to eat

552
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,000
Didn’t you just let me steam fish cake

553
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,400
What memory

554
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,480
Liu Junlai

555
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,000
Then I'll add two more dishes

556
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,720
OK

557
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
Put all six hundred and eighty

558
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,079
All replaced by seven hundred

559
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,799
Director Xu

560
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,000
Fan Xiaolong just now didn't arrive

561
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,119
Have you asked for leave?

562
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,880
No

563
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,519
Find someone to check out the dormitory

564
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:03,559
Have you ever slept

565
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,680
OK

566
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,000
Continue to say

567
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,599
Just made some soup

568
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,119
You drink some to warm your stomach first

569
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,000
Thanks

570
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,039
How about Liu Jun

571
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,480
Is this meal suitable for your appetite?

572
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,599
So delicious

573
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,039
All are home-cooked dishes

574
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,200
That's why you didn't pay much

575
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,480
No loss

576
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,079
Why didn't I lose money

577
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,799
I've lost a lot, okay

578
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,359
Look at your husband

579
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,599
It's not a big deal

580
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,480
Yes, it's not enough to control big things

581
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,160
Right

582
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,000
I'll take care of our family affairs

583
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,920
You continue to say

584
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,039
Come

585
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,279
First of all, I lost people

586
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,559
One died in the workplace

587
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,640
There are several new employees

588
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,839
Feel it too dangerous

589
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,000
Resigned these days

590
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,480
The second is the supply time

591
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,519
I have a batch of goods

592
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,920
Delivery three days late

593
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,599
I will compensate according to the contract

594
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,000
Fortunately, the Party A saw this situation

595
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,160
Express special understanding

596
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,720
It doesn't matter if you say you're receiving the goods a few days later

597
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,920
I didn't ask for compensation in the end

598
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,039
You know now

599
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,480
The benefits of human relationships and society are

600
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,400
Yes Yes Yes

601
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,000
The last one makes me the most headache

602
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,319
Bank loan approval

603
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,119
I've been opening a factory to now

604
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,000
Waited for so long

605
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,839
Finally got enough qualifications

606
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,000
This incident is bleak again

607
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
Have to keep waiting

608
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,000
Then can you turn over your capital

609
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,200
It must be a mess

610
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,200
If it's not enough, please find private loans

611
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,440
The interest rate for private lending is high

612
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,599
Is it OK

613
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,200
It's not too high to borrow in the short term

614
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Basically still able to cope

615
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,400
If you can't turn over your capital

616
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,440
Within 500,000

617
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,799
I'll support you at any time

618
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,400
Your development momentum is quite strong

619
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,519
Just changed into a good car

620
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,759
You have so much money

621
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,640
But your situation is different from mine

622
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,359
The money you make is not yours alone

623
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:05,839
Jiali

624
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,240
Qian Hongming said he wants to give me 500,000

625
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,400
Do you know this

626
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,319
You're so heartless

627
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,359
Don't make trouble

628
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,119
Hongming reported to me

629
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,440
Money matter

630
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,920
Let him make the decision

631
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,079
Don't ask me

632
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
I'm confused

633
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,640
Your wife is so nice

634
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,799
My wife is a wise man

635
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,279
Eat some fruit

636
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,000
Hello

637
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,720
Say according to the program

638
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,200
He will not hand over the signature of this drawing

639
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,319
I can't get the factory certificate

640
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,119
It's impossible to leave the factory

641
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,960
Didn't anyone cause trouble a few days ago

642
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,240
It's very likely that it was then

643
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,319
Run out while the chaos

644
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Run away a few days ago

645
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,440
Why did you discover it today

646
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,640
After an accident in the heat treatment workshop

647
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,279
The processing workshop has been shut down for material

648
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Work resumed today

649
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
Coworkers in the same dormitory

650
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,039
I thought he had gone home to rest

651
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
So it didn't report

652
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,480
He's a crime of burglary

653
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,480
Call the police directly

654
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,599
It's been so many days

655
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,160
Even if the police have caught someone now

656
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,240
He had sold the drawings long ago

657
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,279
Can't catch it anymore

658
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,279
Lao Zhu made sense

659
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Let's forget it

660
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,359
We're unlucky about this

661
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,640
There is no need to do this

662
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,440
It's been spent so much energy, right

663
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,039
How to deal with Fan Xiaolong

664
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,240
Other workers in the factory

665
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,279
It must be watching

666
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,160
I think it's not just about catching him

667
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,839
Ancillary civil lawsuits must be filed

668
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,839
Ask for compensation

669
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,200
Thank you Mr. Liu, it's so strange

670
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,640
Why did you call me when you remember

671
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,240
Is there anything wrong with working?

672
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,880
My dad called the police early in the morning

673
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,279
The police attach great importance to this matter

674
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,160
But this Fan Xiaolong

675
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:11,519
He has no previous studies

676
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,279
In the factory

677
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,160
No more clues are available

678
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,480
It's hard for the police to make progress

679
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,200
Then what do you mean by looking for me

680
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,640
We didn't buy his drawings

681
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,359
You're right

682
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,599
That's what I mean

683
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,480
I mean Fan Xiaolong

684
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,519
After he got the drawings

685
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,559
Will definitely find a buyer

686
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,119
Who will the buyer be

687
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,960
It must be from Donghai City

688
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,200
Other machinery factories

689
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,240
If Miss Lin

690
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,160
Would like to help me

691
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,559
In the name of the city

692
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,079
It's the easiest thing to get him out

693
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,680
The whole East China Sea knows

694
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,240
I'm not going to deal with your elder brother

695
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,680
Fan Xiaolong would never think of death

696
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,440
I'll collude with you

697
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,960
Yes or no

698
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,880
Set up a trap to catch people

699
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,759
It sounds interesting

700
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:13,960
The most important thing now

701
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,759
Just catch people

702
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,839
Kill one to warn a hundred

703
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,759
Loss of drawings

704
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,960
This is nothing anymore

705
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,440
After all, it's just a part

706
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,920
I can give it to you

707
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,000
Just treat it as

708
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,200
Reward for help

709
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,000
I don't care about your drawings

710
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,160
Yes Yes Yes

711
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,839
Drawings are really worthless

712
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,359
Mr. Lin

713
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,960
Would you like to help me

714
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,000
I'll help this

715
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,640
That

716
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,079
Between us

717
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,079
Even if it's even

718
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,240
Hello

719
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,279
Mr. Lin won't change his mind, right?

720
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,160
I forgot to tell you

721
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,759
You have to keep this matter confidential

722
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,640
I don't want my brother to know

723
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,799
Don't worry, I'm so strict

724
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,440
As long as you disagree

725
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,759
I don't even say my dad

726
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,079
OK, wait for my phone number

727
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,039
OK

728
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,440
Who are you calling

729
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,680
So happy

730
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,920
Just arranged a troublesome thing

731
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,039
Very happy

732
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,160
What do you want to eat for dinner

733
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,799
Let's eat Japanese food, okay

734
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,880
OK

735
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,200
I just happened to know there was one

736
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,960
Take you there

737
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,400
Does the taste taste OK

738
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,160
Very delicious

739
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,440
Hello your sashimi platter

740
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,079
Please use it slowly

741
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,880
Thanks

742
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,000
You've looked recently

743
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,279
It's much easier

744
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:21,960
Yeah

745
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,759
Have you solved all the troubles

746
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:25,920
Not yet

747
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,599
All are going through the program

748
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,279
Is so much OK

749
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,839
A little less

750
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,359
Let's do some more

751
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,759
Hello

752
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,880
Can

753
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,799
But be careful

754
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,039
Can't be alert to the snake

755
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,880
Agreed time and place

756
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,880
Notify me again

757
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,720
Thank you very much for bothering you

758
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,839
Hello sir, this is your bill

759
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:17,359
Issuing an invoice for me

760
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,160
OK

761
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,720
I'll go to the bathroom and wait for me

762
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:09,960
Let's go

763
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,279
Let's go and have a walk

764
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Recently, Jinguang Department Store

765
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:15,960
It's so lively

766
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,359
OK, let's go

767
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,079
Have the invoice been issued?

768
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,000
Opened

769
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,599
It'll be fine in fifteen minutes

770
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,319
The beauty calls me if you have something to do

771
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,680
Thank you

772
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,039
You didn't talk much this night

773
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,920
Is there anything wrong with me

774
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,720
What I just dealt with

775
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,960
I'm helping Liu Jun

776
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,480
Liu Jun

777
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,240
It's hidden from your elder brother

778
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,720
But I think

779
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,400
There is no need to hide it from you

780
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,518
If the elder brother finds it out in the future

781
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,639
Can you still talk to me

782
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,360
You

783
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,639
Since Liu Jun was injured

784
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,199
You're becoming more and more concerned about him

785
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,760
This time I'll give him his personal relationship

786
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,000
The hurdle in my heart has passed

787
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,039
after

788
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,800
I want to be relaxed

789
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Got my way

790
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,559
Didn't you help me with the investigation

791
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,760
Are there several candidates

792
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,760
You can arrange it

793
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,440
I'm willing to go to a blind date

794
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,880
good

795
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,079
no

796
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:21,639
What's wrong

797
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,519
I'm nervous

798
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,559
Come on, come on again

799
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,159
Relax and relax

800
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,400
Come

801
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,159
Pay attention to movements

802
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,400
To stretch

803
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,599
good

804
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,800
Just a little bit short

805
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:40,559
Not bad

806
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,679
Actually, the movements are much better

807
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,719
But there are still problems

808
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,159
You see this is it

809
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,079
Just this moment

810
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,039
Must pull it away

811
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,440
Walk

812
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,320
Come on come on

813
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,840
I'll tell you something

814
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,480
Don't move

815
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:55,960
The legs should be swayed to the left

816
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,800
Waist belt shoulder strap hands

817
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,119
Walk

818
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,280
Look how relaxed this movement is

819
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,119
Yes or no

820
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,159
I'm thirsty

821
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,519
Let's have something to drink

822
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,800
OK OK OK

823
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,440
Should take you to play billiards

824
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,039
Billiards are relatively simple

825
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,079
Come on come on

826
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,000
Have a drink

827
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:13,719
Thanks

828
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,559
Your watch is always inaccurate

829
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,559
Otherwise, it would be better to change

830
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,760
I'll give you what brand you like

831
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,239
Don't be polite about what to change

832
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,159
Ajun told me a few times, too

833
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,440
But I'm used to wearing it

834
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,159
This table is a bit inaccurate

835
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,159
Nothing wrong

836
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,320
Just repair it

837
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:34,880
Drink

838
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,519
Hirohide

839
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
I really want to thank you

840
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,519
Look at this year

841
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,519
Mortgage a while later

842
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,039
Mortgage a while later

843
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,320
I'm bothered

844
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,519
It's all up to you.

845
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,880
If you try it a few more times

846
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,800
Your property

847
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,519
I've figured it all out

848
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,719
It's OK

849
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,320
I never hide it from you

850
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,119
real

851
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,719
Don't say you're now

852
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,920
It's a successful career

853
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:01,920
That's the year

854
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,840
I've never doubted it

855
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,239
What do you want to do to me

856
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,039
Never

857
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,039
Hirohide

858
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,760
I'm actually often in Ajun

859
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:15,920
Beat the edge drum

860
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,599
Don't say it

861
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,920
Ajun has been back for the past two years

862
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:19,920
I've been thinking a lot

863
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,000
About the past

864
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,159
He's not so scrupley

865
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,400
Your brother Hongming

866
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,039
I'm really

867
00:37:32,558 --> 00:37:33,639
Cars have lanes

868
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
Horse walks on the road

869
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,159
Let it be natural

870
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:41,239
You said this very well and let it go.

871
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,599
We're here to let it go

872
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:45,920
Have a drink

873
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,400
Sorry

874
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,599
My car was smashed two days ago

875
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,119
So I'll take a taxi in a while

876
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,119
Send you back

877
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,519
Just know that people are fine

878
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,159
Then are you

879
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,719
I have to buy another good car

880
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,719
Not in business

881
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,039
Is face the most important

882
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,000
Ajun is the boss

883
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,800
Let him keep his face

884
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:17,880
I'm now

885
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:18,599
right

886
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,199
Show you something

887
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,280
My title has changed now

888
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,000
You see

889
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,119
Tengfei Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd.

890
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,719
Marketing Manager

891
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,360
Reduced

892
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,119
I'll tell you

893
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,400
Since the start of Tengfei Run business

894
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:38,960
I've found

895
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,760
You're like Shanghai, Guangzhou

896
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,920
This is a big city

897
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,119
This title must be

898
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:44,960
Down

899
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,000
I'll call now

900
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,440
My son Liu Jun's banner

901
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:50,119
Look, German overseas doctor

902
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,000
This name works

903
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,800
There is no way for others to recognize it

904
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:56,519
fine

905
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,039
Besides, Liu Jun is also real

906
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,159
Doctoral studies in Germany

907
00:38:59,360 --> 00:38:59,840
yes

908
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,559
You're not guilty

909
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,159
Speaking of Shanghai

910
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,840
Real estate over there has been heating up

911
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,360
So I have several friends

912
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,519
Want me to take the lead

913
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,880
Organize everyone there

914
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,920
Buy a house

915
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,079
Do you want to be together?

916
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,158
Go to Shanghai to buy a house

917
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,960
This house price in Shanghai

918
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,280
Four or five thousand per square meter

919
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,559
This is better than our Donghai

920
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:26,400
House prices are high

921
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,880
Social engagement is definitely social engagement

922
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:58,760
Don't take it to your heart

923
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,639
Let's go and stop watching

924
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,038
Let's go

925
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,559
Hello

926
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,199
You're taking a nap

927
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,639
How could I be so lucky

928
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
The factory's progress has been delayed recently

929
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,760
All three shifts in the factory are open

930
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,000
Always rushing

931
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,119
I was late last night

932
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,559
Pulled over to adjust the equipment

933
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
Stayed up all night

934
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,159
Come back early in the morning

935
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,800
What about sleeping

936
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,960
Then do you still have the energy tonight

937
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,679
I'm going to close the internet

938
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,199
Where is so soon

939
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,159
Mr. Fan

940
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,400
Killed and robbed

941
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,759
Robbed and caught bad guys

942
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,519
Who is the bad guy

943
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,559
Robbed

944
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,320
Call the police quickly

945
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,639
I've registered all the situation

946
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,280
Tomorrow morning

947
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,519
You go to the police station again

948
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,719
Trouble the police

949
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,559
Leave

950
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:58,039
Is it going smoothly

951
00:42:59,039 --> 00:42:59,760
smoothly

952
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,000
It's good if there is a result

953
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,800
I haven't wasted these days

954
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,239
Help you fish everywhere

955
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:05,760
How to thank you

956
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,280
Send me home
