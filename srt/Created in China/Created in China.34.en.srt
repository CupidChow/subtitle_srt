1
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,039
dad

2
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:33,960
I heard you have a very bad temper recently

3
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:36,719
No

4
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,800
Why didn't you go to work for several days

5
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,120
I've also heard

6
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,478
The secretary calls you

7
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,120
You scolded someone

8
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,000
Go if you want

9
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,918
If you don't want to go, don't go

10
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,319
I have no shame to go to the company

11
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,199
Nothing can be done well

12
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,800
The land king has ruined his hands

13
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Am I going to do it

14
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,560
This can't bear it

15
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,039
All over thirty people

16
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,639
Still like a child

17
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,319
How can I feel at ease in the future

18
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,478
Leave the company to you

19
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,719
Stop eating

20
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Go and meet someone with me

21
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,240
Who is it

22
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,079
Less nonsense

23
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,120
Change clothes

24
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,680
Go after eating

25
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,719
Busy

26
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Why are you here

27
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:47,240
Mr. Lu

28
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,960
Rare customers Rare customers

29
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,840
Come presumptuously

30
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,759
Didn't say hello

31
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,240
Please forgive me, Mr. Liu

32
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,599
Welcome to come anytime

33
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,400
Guidance work

34
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,319
Nothing to say or not

35
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,840
Come

36
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:56,560
Please sit please sit

37
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,240
good

38
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,159
I think you can take off.

39
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,759
When we came in just now

40
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,599
I see there are two workshops

41
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,560
All started construction

42
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,560
Not like our city

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Cold and deserted

44
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,319
Just hold on

45
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,199
We are not like the city

46
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,159
Behind it is the support of Dongfu Group

47
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,317
Small factory

48
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,680
Can't stop

49
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,920
Mr. Liu has a lot of things

50
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,360
I won't go around the corner

51
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,480
Let me bring me here today

52
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,240
There is a business

53
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,519
Want to talk to Mr. Liu

54
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,198
City Yiji wants to cooperate with me

55
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,360
It can be said to be cooperation

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,439
But to be more precise

57
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,560
Probably an acquisition

58
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,759
dad

59
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,319
this

60
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,399
It's my offer

61
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,639
Mr. Liu, look

62
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,360
I don't know Mr. Lu's idea

63
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,439
Where did it come from

64
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,959
We're taking off at this stage

65
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:08,920
Stable operation

66
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
I've never considered it

67
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,240
Want to sell the company

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,839
Stable operation

69
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,920
The boss mortgages his car

70
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,000
Come and pay wages

71
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,839
Not considered

72
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,199
Operation is stable

73
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,199
Don't make up cash in the short term

74
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,480
A factory opened

75
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,720
It must have encountered it all

76
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:26,920
And Mr. Lu

77
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,160
You've seen it just now

78
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,399
My workshop's operating rate is OK

79
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,159
I won another new order yesterday

80
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,000
I admit

81
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,159
You are taking off in the price war

82
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,800
Play with great sound

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,120
Play with great sound

84
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,639
Some small fish and shrimps

85
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,879
Not your opponent at all

86
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,279
But have you ever thought about it

87
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,159
If our city is a machine

88
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,240
I'll fight you too

89
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,560
Mr. Liu

90
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,519
For Dongfu's strength

91
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,560
I don't know if you have

92
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,800
A clear concept

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,680
Mr. Luo

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Mr. Luo

95
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,839
How about it

96
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,439
Visiting customers this week

97
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,800
Any new achievements

98
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,560
What does it mean

99
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,720
Don't speak

100
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,560
No one order

101
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,759
Mr. Luo

102
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,639
Not only is there no new orders

103
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,279
I am responsible for Xingcheng Xingyu

104
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,759
Both families called

105
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,399
Says to cancel the contract in question

106
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,959
As long as Dongfu Headquarters

107
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
All subsidies to the market at any cost

108
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,360
You can make the leap and thrive

109
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,680
Start-up rate reaches zero

110
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,199
Let your capital chain

111
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,279
Break it directly

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,319
Mr. Liu

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,519
Do you believe it or not

114
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,240
No matter how much you don't care about the cost

115
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,120
There will be limits in the end

116
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
I heard from Dongdong some time ago

117
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,120
Something happened to one of your good friends

118
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,159
Destroy your family

119
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,199
Wife and child

120
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,199
All are very pitiful

121
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,279
What a pity

122
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,519
So young

123
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,079
So powerful

124
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,159
There could have been a lot of

125
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:57,959
Good time

126
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,279
Good time

127
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,199
I believe

128
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,199
He is making some judgments

129
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,399
When deciding

130
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,240
I also thought I could hold on

131
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,000
Think of the economic situation

132
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,399
It's already so bad

133
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,199
Have a little more time

134
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,839
Money can definitely be let go

135
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,680
But what the result

136
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
It's October now

137
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
It's just one rebate

138
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,439
Little Liu

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
I hope you

140
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,919
Learn from your friend's lesson

141
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,519
No matter how big the ideal

142
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,919
Not as important as survival

143
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,159
People must live first

144
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,519
So Mr. Lu means

145
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,960
Let me live in vain

146
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,440
Do you survive to work for you

147
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,799
What's wrong with working for me

148
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,840
I'm different from Lin Yue

149
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,080
I support you

150
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,399
R&D and innovation

151
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,240
Take this quote for example

152
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,240
It absolutely fully reflects

153
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,759
The value of your R&D center

154
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,480
Mr. Liu

155
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,159
You can check it out before talking

156
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,519
You can check it out before talking

157
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,080
Maybe you are different from Lin Yue

158
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,519
But you pursue profits with him

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
There is no difference in logic

160
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,080
The destiny that takes off in your hands

161
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,480
I can imagine

162
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,440
No matter how nice you say

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,759
It definitely won't

164
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,759
Same as before

165
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,600
Thank you Mr. Lu for looking down on me

166
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,119
pity

167
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,840
I'm going to let you down

168
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,600
My factory

169
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,360
Don't sell

170
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:29,840
It doesn't matter

171
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,960
Mr. Liu think about it carefully

172
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,639
When needed

173
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,320
Call me directly

174
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,279
goodbye

175
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,960
No gift

176
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,440
What's wrong

177
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,159
You asked me what's wrong

178
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,960
It's clear that I'm here to discuss business

179
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,360
You let me go

180
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,639
How to get along with friends

181
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,759
Business business

182
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,639
Why does it affect your friends

183
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,759
Hello

184
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,879
Mr. Liu

185
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,399
All sales staff of sales department

186
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,639
All received notifications from customers

187
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,639
Request to cancel the contract in question

188
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,679
I know

189
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,159
It was the city's first move

190
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,120
Lu Guangfa suddenly took action

191
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,679
When did it happen

192
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,320
About a week ago

193
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,720
Others from Liujun Company

194
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,879
Probably not known yet

195
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,399
It was what I told me

196
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,080
It looks like his style

197
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,480
Focus on the best target

198
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,480
Take advantage of the situation to rob

199
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,080
It's accurate and cruel enough

200
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,600
yes

201
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,000
Liu Jun's cost control is better

202
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,759
Can't stand the market

203
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,879
Pay money to grab the market

204
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,480
I've asked indirectly

205
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,360
Now it's not just a R&D center

206
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,320
Even his factory

207
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,799
All have started to take turns to suspend work

208
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,080
Don't know his capital chain

209
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,679
How long can it last

210
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Companies like Tengfei

211
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,480
It's really rare

212
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,679
I really hope it can survive

213
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,799
Don't be swept away by this huge wave

214
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,559
You've thought about it

215
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
These houses were left by Hongming

216
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,679
I really can't bear to sell

217
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,480
Take it as mortgage first

218
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,159
If he's still there

219
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
I'd definitely hope to fly

220
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,039
Be able to overcome difficulties

221
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,679
Survive

222
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,360
If the mortgage is used up

223
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,240
I can still go to the bank

224
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,879
Take out my original shares

225
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,279
That won't work

226
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,799
Your shares must not be moved

227
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,000
And my dad's pension money

228
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,559
Even if it's taken out

229
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,519
I won't want it, either

230
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,360
In fact, after this rate cut

231
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,320
The monetary policy has begun to loosen

232
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,960
The country has also released it

233
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,039
Policies to support small and medium-sized enterprises

234
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,960
I've tried hard to help Tengfei

235
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,559
Apply for a new loan

236
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,479
Fight before the next payday

237
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:33,440
Can be approved

238
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,840
Pay wages on loans

239
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,639
Pay daily expenses with production funds

240
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,039
Multiple mortgages for houses, cars

241
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,919
If this were before

242
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,559
Which one is not on the minefield

243
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,240
But what's the solution

244
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,960
Lu Guangfa is right

245
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,159
Living first is the bottom line

246
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:12,480
Come in

247
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,679
Master Lu today

248
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,039
What's the point

249
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,120
Talk about it

250
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,759
I don't have any high opinion

251
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,360
I just know Liu Jun

252
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,159
He said he could hold on

253
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,200
You will definitely be able to hold on

254
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,879
Look at this

255
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,399
What's this

256
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,799
List of shareholders of Tengfei

257
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,519
They're halfway

258
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,639
Capital increase and share expansion once

259
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,639
There are now a total of seven small shareholders

260
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,320
What's the use of this?

261
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,639
Small shareholders added together

262
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,720
Only a small part

263
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,639
Big head is in Liushitang

264
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,120
So the decision-making power

265
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,440
Still in Liu Jun's hands

266
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:37,759
You

267
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,639
Some things cannot be just looking at numbers

268
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,519
No matter these seven small shareholders

269
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,559
What's the proportion

270
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,320
They are all living people

271
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,320
It's with Liu Jun

272
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,120
Over the years of ups and downs

273
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,200
Partners

274
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,720
There is a relationship between them

275
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,759
Young people are full of energy

276
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:05,118
Can do whatever you want

277
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Persist until the end

278
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,240
Or for the ideal

279
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,240
belief

280
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:12,880
Fight to the end heroically

281
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,519
But what about the other people on the chariot

282
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,118
Have to accompany him too

283
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,920
Are you crushed to pieces

284
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,118
What are you doing

285
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,640
Nothing

286
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Just for everyone

287
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:32,960
Write a letter of acquisition

288
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,119
The conditions offered are extremely good

289
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,640
Then summarize

290
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,319
Copy a copy to Liu Jun

291
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,559
I want Liu Jun to know

292
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,160
As long as he wants

293
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,440
His partners

294
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,000
Get out of the car safely

295
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,119
All can get a big sum

296
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,519
Ready-made wealth

297
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,799
But if he continues to persist

298
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,720
It's like pulling everyone

299
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,599
Go bet with him

300
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,720
This is taking off

301
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,960
A bet on life and death

302
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,759
Once you lose the bet

303
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,440
Everyone will have nothing

304
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,200
Seven people

305
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,359
behind

306
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,960
But seven families

307
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,759
Mr. Lu

308
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,359
You said you know Liu Jun

309
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,960
Then you answer me now

310
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,039
He would carelessly

311
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,038
Drag everyone else off the cliff

312
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:18,759
Do you think

313
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,920
Liu Jun this time

314
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,319
Can't handle it anymore

315
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,240
This is your dad's decision

316
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,240
You can't change anything

317
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,479
At least not yet

318
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,039
When I chatted with Liu Jun before

319
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,400
I often hear him mention making in China

320
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,799
I always laughed at him at that time

321
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,839
Smile his mouth full of big words

322
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,400
But in fact, deep down

323
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,640
I envy him very much

324
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,680
Envy him for having a lofty goal

325
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,799
Envy his imagination of the future

326
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,920
Compare with him

327
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,559
I'm simply too ordinary

328
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,720
You must think I'm ridiculous

329
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,200
For someone else's ideal

330
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,559
One me

331
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,599
Ideal that can't be involved

332
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,839
It's so uncomfortable

333
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,200
Let's get married

334
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,640
Why

335
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,839
You haven't always been

336
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,400
Because I'm an ordinary person too

337
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,400
Ordinary people

338
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,440
Sometimes it just changes your mind

339
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,519
Liu Jun

340
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,799
I'm just here to get some breath

341
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
No idea

342
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,680
don’t worry

343
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,839
What obstacles do young people have to overcome

344
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,359
Don't learn from him

345
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,839
As long as people live

346
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,880
No matter how deep the pit is, you can climb out

347
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:55,559
yes

348
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,880
Will always come out

349
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:42,720
Hello

350
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,319
Mr. Song

351
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,000
sorry

352
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,519
I may

353
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,119
I'm going to disappoint you

354
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,039
Liu Jun

355
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,039
I'll just say one thing to you

356
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,319
This is a complicated world

357
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,720
You may fail

358
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,279
But you will never let me down

359
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,480
You really won't help him

360
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,519
Some storms

361
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,400
They have to face it themselves

362
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,680
them

363
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:02,920
them

364
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,319
Mr. Liu

365
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,359
You think it's going to be

366
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,759
Are they all your own business?

367
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,160
Initial

368
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,839
Heat treatment center

369
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,200
I've pushed it hard

370
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,680
No one ever complained about me

371
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,359
Now Lu Guangfa's acquisition letter

372
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,640
I feel it's really hot

373
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,839
I'm over fifty

374
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,559
I'll retire after working for a few years

375
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,480
It's too much to change the boss

376
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,160
Mr. Liu

377
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,160
The R&D center is your ideal

378
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,119
Your blood

379
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,359
But you have to admit it

380
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,920
It's also our ideal

381
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,079
Our heart and blood

382
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,640
I'm too impatient

383
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,680
I can't go together with Lu Guangfa

384
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,480
What you said

385
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,720
I don't understand

386
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,319
Mr. Liu

387
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,680
But I believe your judgment

388
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,720
You said the light of light is ahead

389
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,319
Then specify it in front

390
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,240
I'm willing to wait

391
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,319
This is embarrassing

392
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,240
Could it be

393
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,279
I'm the only one who comes to find Mr. Liu

394
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,960
Did you sign for salary?

395
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,160
Mr. Liu

396
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,319
Don't worry

397
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,759
What about this month

398
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:34,440
Patch together

399
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,440
We have money in the account

400
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,400
Enough

401
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,599
This month is enough

402
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,279
But next month

403
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,359
There's still a dad next month

404
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,200
I'm there

405
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,119
You see

406
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,720
I've told you that the house is valuable

407
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,680
I'll tell you

408
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,880
Sell these sets

409
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,720
It will definitely save your business

410
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,000
dad

411
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
This is your old job

412
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,759
Dad for you

413
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,799
Can sell in Qianjin Factory

414
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,160
What is this little thing

415
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,240
Come and hold it

416
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,599
The phone didn't ring in the end

417
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,519
You must be disappointed

418
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,599
A little disappointed

419
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,160
But there was no particular disappointment

420
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,720
People

421
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,119
Maybe in this world

422
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,000
The most contradictory animal

423
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Did you say yes

424
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,279
right

425
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,640
In your own industry

426
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,759
It's going with the flow

427
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,000
Still on the tide

428
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,480
Ten years later

429
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,000
Let's look back

430
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,880
It may determine our destiny

431
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,920
That's the choice in the past few years

432
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,159
Liu Jun

433
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,440
Liu Jun, wake up

434
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,639
Liu Jun

435
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,199
Get up

436
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,400
Get up quickly

437
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:32,400
Look at this

438
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Happy journey

439
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,519
Hello sir

440
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,599
Hello, please ask

441
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,840
Is the flight delayed?

442
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,159
Yes, mechanical reasons

443
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,280
Have to wait a little longer

444
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,559
How long does it take to wait

445
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:13,320
Excuse me

446
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,480
It's not clear yet

447
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,599
OK Thank you

448
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,639
Dr. Liu

449
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,599
Mr. Lin

450
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,000
Dr. Liu

451
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,960
How did I meet you here

452
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,320
Where are you going

453
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
I'm going to the United States

454
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,559
I'm going to the United States

455
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,599
Have been busy for a year

456
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:41,960
Finally some time

457
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,519
I said to see the kids

458
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,159
Stay with them

459
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,000
Very good very good

460
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,920
What are you going out for

461
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,599
I went abroad to negotiate business

462
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,400
A group conducts industrial transfer

463
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,039
Go to talk to me

464
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:52,920
ODM (original design manufacturer)

465
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,679
Meet a few engineers

466
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,119
This time the United States and Europe

467
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,400
Many people are unemployed

468
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,480
Now I'm going to poach talents

469
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,400
It can be much cheaper

470
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,199
Yeah

471
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,280
It's been a long time since I saw you

472
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,880
Then you don't worry

473
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,159
The talents you dug up this time

474
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,840
Are you as stupid as you did back then

475
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:13,760
Mr. Lin, the fool in your eyes

476
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,360
Maybe it's just right for me

477
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:17,840
I am

478
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,559
There is a problem that hasn't been figured out

479
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,519
Look at Mr. Song, Liang Sishen, right?

480
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,239
Appreciation of you

481
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,519
It's obvious to all

482
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Actually, I think

483
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,159
You hold these two thighs

484
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,199
How can it still be

485
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,800
Get yourself one

486
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,000
It's so embarrassing

487
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,440
Except that

488
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,599
Outside the troublesome East China Sea No. 1

489
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,199
You never thought about coming from Mr. Song again

490
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,960
Get some other benefits

491
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Believe it or not

492
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,280
Mr. Song and Sister Liang

493
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
I'm willing to help me

494
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,280
Support me

495
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:58,519
It's because they understand

496
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,840
The true value of creativity

497
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,559
They know the country

498
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,119
Where is hope

499
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,360
Maybe Mr. Lin, you

500
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,599
See more of the interests

501
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,440
I think

502
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,519
Is this a business?

503
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,480
What do you talk about if you don't talk about money?

504
00:37:16,158 --> 00:37:18,239
But you can consider it

505
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,159
Just like I said

506
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,719
Get some pieces of land early

507
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:23,599
Yes

508
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,400
I do

509
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,840
Prepare to do a few real estate projects

510
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,599
Enhance the company's risk resistance

511
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,199
But no matter how much money you earn

512
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,960
I'll use it in the end

513
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:33,800
Factory maintenance and R&D center

514
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,320
Don't be impulsive

515
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,199
I'll tell you

516
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,440
Now the situation is just a little warming up

517
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,599
What's going on next year

518
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,760
No one can say goodbye

519
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,760
If you pay the money at this time

520
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,320
All are on research and development

521
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,280
I'll tell you what if

522
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,599
Another fluctuation

523
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,599
You're going to take your life

524
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,880
Go fill this hole

525
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,840
For me

526
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,239
The more difficult the environment is now

527
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,440
The more I am

528
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,360
The more I want to persist

529
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,039
I still believe in the market

530
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,719
Will give me a fair return

531
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:12,639
and

532
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,719
With the steady growth of the country's economy

533
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,840
I believe in the country

534
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,480
Support for advanced manufacturing

535
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,760
Will get bigger and bigger

536
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,159
Mr. Lin

537
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,320
You are about manufacturing

538
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,760
No firm belief

539
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,440
so

540
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,480
You don't understand

541
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,439
Yeah

542
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:33,400
yes

543
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:35,800
I

544
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,000
How to say it

545
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,679
I just know I'm a businessman

546
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,000
So I always tell myself

547
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,480
It's a businessman

548
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,639
Profit Supreme

549
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,599
But there is one I understand

550
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,960
I know China

551
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,679
Need someone like you

552
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:56,920
But you are the minority after all

553
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:58,960
Then it seems

554
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,719
Mr. Lin and I will never be able to

555
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
Walking on the same road

556
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,639
Just meet by chance

557
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,440
Travelers traveling to Frankfurt

558
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,400
Please note

559
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Flight CA935 you took

560
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,440
Start boarding now

561
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,639
Your flight

562
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,079
right

563
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,000
You go to Germany

564
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,199
Go to Germany

565
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:24,119
You're back from Germany

566
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,360
It's been ten years

567
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,559
yes

568
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,559
It's been ten years

569
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:11,480
Maybe the future of China's manufacturing

570
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,119
It really belongs

571
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,360
For someone like you

572
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,960
You said we will

573
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:22,400
Can it be

574
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:23,920
Build such a large aircraft

575
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,159
Very difficult

576
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,840
But I believe

577
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,760
Surely
