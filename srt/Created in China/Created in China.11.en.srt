1
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,359
OK

2
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,400
Don't hold it in

3
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,680
What do you want to ask

4
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,799
Ask

5
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,840
I know

6
00:01:57,598 --> 00:01:59,439
Your SAR policies are different

7
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:01,200
High salary

8
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,079
But I didn't expect

9
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,200
It's so high

10
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,439
sure

11
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,960
You can

12
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,800
Hongming

13
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,960
You've learned humor too

14
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,719
High salary

15
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,199
High salary

16
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,240
to be honest

17
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,919
Look at me strange

18
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,000
Then I think you are even more strange

19
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,119
We've graduated for eight years

20
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,120
It's a fellow traveler

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,599
There are many things I won't go around with you

22
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,879
I just want to ask you

23
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,199
You're backing so big

24
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,478
A foreign trade company

25
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,199
Have authorization in hand

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,159
There is also a familiar bank

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,918
Why are you still so honest

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
Are you filing for a letter of credit?

29
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,960
During the credit period

30
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,240
Use this money

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,560
Do something for yourself

32
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,960
It's a business without money

33
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,719
Right

34
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,120
I'll just say

35
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,919
You're such a smart person

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
Don't not understand this

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Hongming

38
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:23,560
What are you afraid of

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,039
Your boss approves

40
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,400
That's a formality

41
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,120
A 120-day credit cycle

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,919
Actually in your hand

43
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,439
Brother

44
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,280
Be brave

45
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,560
The timid one starved to death

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,879
Jiali

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,159
This rice will be used up in the future

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,520
Remember to cover the lid

49
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,478
Recently, plum rain

50
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,639
If it is not tightly covered

51
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,319
Easy to grow mold

52
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,719
I'm so sorry

53
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,159
Hongming called in the morning and said

54
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,360
Can't come back today

55
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,719
I could have handled the past

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
Don't bother you to go there

57
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,439
What's so sorry about this

58
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,000
I just carried a bag of rice

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,120
Just two barrels of oil

60
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,759
fine

62
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,439
Liu Jun

63
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:17,120
You haven't been sick recently

64
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,439
Why is his face so ugly

65
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,160
Yeah

66
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,879
possible

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,759
I've stayed up late to watch the European Cup recently

68
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,519
It'll be fine in two days

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,040
Hongming

70
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,839
Qian Hongming

71
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,279
You've seen the world

72
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
You said you have been in foreign trade for so many years

73
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,439
The entire operation process

74
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,319
You're so familiar that you can't be more familiar

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,600
Bank customer interest rate

76
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,480
Which link you can't connect

77
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,639
If you said you never thought about this

78
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,959
I don't believe it

79
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,040
After all, it's on the edge of the law

80
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,439
Too great risk

81
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,040
When our class was in school

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,639
Just count you're the best money

83
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,480
A freshman

84
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,480
Sell squeezing tapes

85
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,839
Selling pirated books in sophomore year

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,519
I went out to work part-time in my junior year

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,199
On graduation day, pointing at the sky and saying

88
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,279
I want to make a fortune

89
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,439
The energy of the past was so energetic

90
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,360
Where did you go

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,839
I was in debt back then

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,680
I have to block the bottomless hole in my house

93
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,159
yes

94
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,879
I was not afraid of heaven and earth back then

95
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,399
As long as you can make money

96
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,680
I do whatever you ask me to do

97
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,959
It's different now

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,680
It's different

99
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,360
Show it to you

100
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,279
Carrie didn't get fat after giving birth

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,439
My daughter is so cute

102
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,240
I know

103
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,319
The more dangerous the

104
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,639
The more profitable

105
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,159
But for them

106
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,120
Be safer

107
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,839
Leave three, two, one

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,519
Fly

109
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
Fly one

110
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,480
How is this camera like

111
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,079
Oh my God, this is a DSLR

112
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,879
This has only been a few years

113
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,399
Lao Gao is so rich

114
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,319
I didn't want to accept it

115
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,240
But he insisted

116
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,600
Long time no see old classmate

117
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,519
Want to give a gift

118
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,240
My thoughts

119
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,480
I'll accept it for you

120
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,800
Do you think about dad, little Taozi

121
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,560
This digital camera just launched

122
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,879
The price is ridiculously high

123
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,600
Just this one

124
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
To top all my previous

125
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,240
The total price of the camera and lens

126
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,120
I don't know

127
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,439
Why do you thank others

128
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,319
OK OK OK

129
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,720
Don't always praise the camera

130
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,120
Promote the lens

131
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,959
Your husband bought the lens

132
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,519
Yes Yes Yes

133
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,519
This lens is even better

134
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,360
A good horse with a good saddle

135
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,720
My husband loves me the most

136
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,120
This is almost the same

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Come to Xiao Taozi

138
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,279
A little peach laugh

139
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,879
Looks so good

140
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,800
nice

141
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,600
This old high

142
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,439
Isn't he a deputy manager

143
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,600
Salary level

144
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
All are so tall

145
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,319
Or let's go too

146
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,560
Look at mom

147
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,680
See if my mother is a little money fan

148
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,920
What to cook

149
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,879
So delicious

150
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,439
My longan lotus seed soup

151
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,920
Haven't you been looking for Liu Jun in a while

152
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,120
You can bring him some

153
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,759
When he came to deliver rice last time

154
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,839
Say it's watching the ball

155
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,279
Staying up late and not sleeping well

156
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,399
You can make up for him

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Give him a supplement

158
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,839
He's not a fan either

159
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,879
You are still strong in business

160
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,560
These OEMs have been running

161
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,399
Although the amount is not large

162
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
But the price is really not low

163
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,519
Can also pay a lot of advance payments

164
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,439
I really want to take this result

165
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,320
But it is with my ability

166
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
It's really okay

167
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,919
It's better to have a machine tool from our new factory

168
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
You can do it first

169
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,000
Add these advance payments

170
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,720
Early startup overhead

171
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,720
Can't hold on

172
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,080
Hirohide

173
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,039
Is it a mortgage assessment?

174
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:08,960
Already out

175
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,159
I know I know it's okay

176
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
You continue walking down

177
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,159
I've already entrusted the greatest favor

178
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,360
Evaluation of the value of a residential property

179
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,200
Really not as good as

180
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,600
What shops in the city

181
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,159
Sorry

182
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,840
Look at what you said

183
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,559
This appraisal price is already very good

184
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,759
I know this in my mind

185
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,600
Thank you

186
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,960
I'll hang up if I don't thank you

187
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,399
How about it

188
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,759
Calculate it, is it

189
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,960
There is still a gap

190
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,519
The gap is big

191
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,919
This kind of OEM is limited after all

192
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,600
Two or three machine tools are finished

193
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,080
Next, there is installation

194
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,759
Purchase of spare parts

195
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,919
Expenditures for office and labor costs

196
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,240
what to do

197
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,639
Don't be discouraged

198
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,559
Isn't it all over the streets now

199
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,279
Those who don't have the money to the bank

200
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
Small and medium-sized private enterprises

201
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,519
Where did their funds come from

202
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,519
Isn't it all private lending?

203
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,440
It's OK

204
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,559
I'll tell you

205
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,799
I've contacted a few old friends

206
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,600
Fundraising

207
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,159
Is that OK

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,120
Do you care if he can do it or not

209
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,799
Let's talk about it

210
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,360
On the right side there

211
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,080
good

212
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,000
Red

213
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,399
All of you are your own

214
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,360
OK OK OK

215
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,840
I can trust your company

216
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,440
Within three days

217
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,559
Within three days

218
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,279
Funds below 10 million

219
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,679
I promise you will get the money

220
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,399
I'm really ignorant

221
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,840
Unexpectedly, private capital

222
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,320
So powerful

223
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,600
Mr. Li

224
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,120
You just said that they are all your own

225
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,919
Right

226
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,080
Everything else is easy to say

227
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,039
That's it

228
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,440
The number you reported to us

229
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,559
Mr. Li

230
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,279
We are small businesses

231
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,720
It's really unaffordable

232
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,759
So let's discuss it again

233
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,799
Down and drop another

234
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,879
Is it OK

235
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,000
Gojo

236
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,759
Involved

237
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,120
I'll hand me my bag

238
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,720
Come to Mr. Li

239
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,159
Suspension

240
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,720
Our

241
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,159
This is the interest

242
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,399
Have you beaten

243
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,159
West Wind

244
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,720
Mr. Li

245
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,399
This really doesn't work

246
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,279
This interest rate is so high

247
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,080
How dare you borrow a manufacturing enterprise

248
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,320
If you step in, you can't pull out your feet

249
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,559
Mr. Liu is not an ordinary manufacturing industry either

250
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,200
As far as I know

251
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,080
Your gross profit

252
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,960
Can afford to borrow

253
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,679
What you need to take off is

254
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,840
Long-term mobile loans

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,679
yes

256
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,879
This is your condition

257
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,919
We're the

258
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,200
Worked for interest

259
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,200
Then we do business

260
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
What's the point

261
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,480
That's not to say

262
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
You took my money

263
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,039
Big in and out in the bank

264
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,879
So few times

265
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,879
That financial data

266
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,320
It must be beautiful

267
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,840
By then

268
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,879
Then you must have borrowed it in the bank

269
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,600
Our private lending

270
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,360
What you do is discard it from the bank

271
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,720
That little business

272
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
I don't expect to keep you for a long time

273
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,559
Otherwise, Mr. Li

274
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,480
Mr. Li

275
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,799
You said just now

276
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,279
We take off with other companies

277
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:08,960
no the same

278
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,039
You see

279
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,200
Our products have a market

280
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,399
Strong repayment ability

281
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,399
You don't think about it

282
00:13:16,158 --> 00:13:16,960
Receive less interest

283
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,559
Ensure a long-term benefit

284
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,600
yes

285
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,200
No matter how good your reputation is

286
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,399
Isn't that a case also

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,360
And you can't guarantee it

288
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,399
Long-term profit

289
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,639
Our fundraising channel is different

290
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,399
That risk cost is too high

291
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,639
Your so-called long-term gains

292
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,679
We don't expect

293
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,120
What's really

294
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,879
How many years have you been an old friend

295
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,600
It's good not to mention money

296
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,679
Withdraw money

297
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,000
Nothing isn't

298
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,799
He wishes

299
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,080
Squeeze all your bones out of oil

300
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,600
Remember him I am

301
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,200
fine

302
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,799
Let's change this one.

303
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,679
Running one by one, right

304
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,759
Dad just runs by himself

305
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,759
Go back to sleep quickly

306
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,919
You see, your face is very bad

307
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,399
I'll have to go back to the factory

308
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,240
There are several OEM orders

309
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,159
Absolutely not to be lost

310
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,480
I have to stare

311
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,799
son

312
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,799
I'll tell you

313
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:29,840
You keep doing this

314
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,159
You'll be exhausted

315
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,119
This won't work

316
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,000
It's okay Dad

317
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm still young and physically

318
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,960
Just have a sleep

319
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,200
Not exhausted

320
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,159
But if you let Tengfei

321
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,120
Just collapsed

322
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,320
I'll die of shame

323
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,559
Ah Jun

324
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,399
you

325
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,440
Don't be affected by your father's emotions

326
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,559
Dad is just whining

327
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,519
No matter how big the difficulties can be solved

328
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,960
Just a matter of time

329
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,840
Take your time

330
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
Dad is the only son you are

331
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,480
If you have three long and two short

332
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,480
What to do with dad

333
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,600
Did you hear

334
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,039
knew

335
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,399
Hello

336
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,519
What are you doing? Open the door

337
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,960
What door to open

338
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,279
Where are you

339
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:31,759
I

340
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,679
I'm at the doorstep

341
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,759
Don't go home after get off work

342
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,360
What are you doing here

343
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,000
Stay

344
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't want to go back

345
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,000
The factory is built

346
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,159
I've never been here yet

347
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,639
Let's take me in and have a look

348
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,799
Don't want to move

349
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,639
Someday

350
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,799
Have a broken laboratory before

351
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,159
All took me to see

352
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,679
Now such a large factory has been built

353
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,840
All built

354
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,159
You won't take me to see

355
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,480
What are you taking

356
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,960
Carrie made it for you

357
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,279
Longan Lotus Seed Soup

358
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,720
Thank you

359
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,559
Look at your face

360
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,000
Better than when I was discharged from the hospital last year

361
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,320
What's wrong

362
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,839
The favorite team lost

363
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,799
The team did not lose

364
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,480
The company is about to lose

365
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,559
Loan matter

366
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,079
You've called it

367
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,559
Crow's mouth

368
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,079
Didn't do it

369
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,720
Can't get a loan

370
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,960
The normal business of the company

371
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,119
There is no way to carry out

372
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,960
The business cannot continue to operate

373
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,319
Financial data is a mess

374
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,559
Can't get a beautiful report

375
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,000
I won't get a loan

376
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,000
It's all a vicious cycle

377
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,960
One by one, one by one, one by one, one by one, one by one, one by one, one by one, one by one

378
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,400
So bad

379
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,759
Is there no other way

380
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,799
I thought about it carefully

381
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,960
Or just make fake accounts

382
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:06,680
Or

383
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,319
Just make a fortune

384
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,079
Where is your dad

385
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
Is there any way he can do it

386
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,720
My dad's family background

387
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:22,799
I've all caught in

388
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,799
Financial afternoon

389
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,839
Run over and say

390
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,759
He's ready to mortgage

391
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,039
Our house is now

392
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,720
When I came back, I laughed at you

393
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,759
Finance does not create value

394
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,240
Will not increase social wealth

395
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,039
Now it looks

396
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,279
I'm the one who deserves to be ridiculed

397
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,160
It's all your fault

398
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,839
I have to stay

399
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,720
Take off

400
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,000
Haven't left the ground yet

401
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,680
Just fell to the ground

402
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
This is too sweet

403
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,839
Got asleep

404
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,839
Got asleep

405
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,680
How is Liu Jun

406
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,359
He praises you

407
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,240
The soup made is delicious

408
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,839
Poor again

409
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,759
I'll ask you how others are doing

410
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,039
Have some trouble

411
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:23,960
But it's okay

412
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,839
Can solve it

413
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
The next period of time

414
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,039
I might be very busy

415
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,039
Your performance this year is so good

416
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,559
Why do you think of resigning?

417
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,640
Now there are many opportunities outside

418
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,799
The confidence to quit your job and go out for a while

419
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,400
Actually, you gave it to me

420
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,960
What about talent like you

421
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,240
The company wants to keep it

422
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,359
I'll see this

423
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,440
Branches of bonded areas

424
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,039
You will take the lead in building

425
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,079
I

426
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,319
What about the company's finances

427
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,599
Basic independent accounting

428
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,440
Letter of credit guarantee is listed in the head office

429
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,880
A fixed proportion of profits paid every year

430
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,680
What's the rest

431
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,000
You're free to play

432
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:36,920
You see

433
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,480
Liu Jun

434
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:06,920
Are you free

435
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,480
Come

436
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,759
The manager hasn't gotten off work yet

437
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,599
Come to have a friend

438
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,799
OK Then I'll leave first

439
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,559
Bye-Bye

440
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
What's so anxious

441
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
I'm busy

442
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,079
I have a way

443
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,279
Can raise three million for you

444
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,480
Do you want it

445
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,200
True or fake

446
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,319
real

447
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,279
Of course I want it

448
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,000
Do you know this

449
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,680
This start-up capital

450
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,559
Forced me to death

451
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,079
Come on come on

452
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,720
What about money?

453
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,759
Don't worry, don't worry first

454
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:44,480
Come on come on

455
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,799
Let's agree first

456
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,279
The interest rate is not low

457
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,359
Nearly twice as high as the bank

458
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,039
Repayment period four months

459
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,559
Your manufacturing industry

460
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,000
Achieve 8% gross profit

461
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,400
Already very good

462
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Do you want to calculate the cost and benefit

463
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,680
Don't worry

464
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,359
You just need to give me four months

465
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,359
Your interest rate is twice as high as the bank

466
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,279
No problem

467
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,680
Such a large amount of money

468
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,799
Where did you come from?

469
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,160
Actually, it's not that complicated

470
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,480
I'm going to the bonded area branch

471
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,119
Become a manager

472
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:17,640
Up

473
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:18,720
But

474
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,279
Can there be such a big money

475
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,039
Liquid capital

476
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,079
Three million

477
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:22,960
Yes

478
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,559
I can now operate independently

479
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,640
Forward letter of credit

480
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,039
Let foreign manufacturers

481
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:28,519
Deliver first

482
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,519
Go to the bonded area

483
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,680
I'll ask domestic buyers to pay cash

484
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,720
Then I'll give you the money again

485
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,400
Special funds

486
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,240
Wait until four months later

487
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,319
My forward letter of credit is expired

488
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,000
You'll get the money again

489
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,880
Return it to me with all your money and profits

490
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,160
I'll pay it to foreign manufacturers

491
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,039
Don't worry

492
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:52,720
This plan

493
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,240
I've thought about it repeatedly

494
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,200
Many times

495
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,440
As long as the time node is accurate

496
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,680
It's absolutely fine to operate

497
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,200
This is indeed feasible

498
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,359
But like you said

499
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,480
Every time node

500
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,759
All must be connected perfectly

501
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
No mistake can be done

502
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,839
You're really for me

503
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,920
Take a big risk

504
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,640
What are you polite between us

505
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:20,880
Funds for you

506
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,039
It's because I believe in you

507
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,000
This difference and handling fee

508
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,480
I don't want it all

509
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,880
You have to charge the handling fee if it doesn't work

510
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,720
Can't charge too high

511
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,559
I can't afford it

512
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,440
Why are you so stingy

513
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm about to take off

514
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,680
Take off quickly

515
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,799
Someone

516
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,839
Sorry, mom

517
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,279
You can't wait

518
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,960
Get a basin for you first

519
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:09,720
fine

520
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,319
I can hold it in

521
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,000
Say goodbye to dad

522
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:15,799
Bye-Bye

523
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:16,759
Bye my wife

524
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,480
Bye-Bye

525
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,400
Leave

526
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,759
You'll be slower on the road

527
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,319
Dad is at work

528
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,319
Go out

529
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,160
Come back

530
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,359
that

531
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,799
Not coming and raising it

532
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,599
Come

533
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,599
Slower

534
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:45,839
Slower

535
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,920
Last time, your house repaired it

536
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,119
Not fixed yet

537
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,480
What's wrong with the bus

538
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,200
How can I not give you money if I repair a bus

539
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,720
What kind of car you all

540
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,960
It should be repaired well

541
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,400
The key was thrown into the car

542
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,119
You guys come and drag it

543
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:41,920
Liu Jun

544
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,640
Are you free to tell me something

545
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,799
I'm going to be late for work

546
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,119
Let's talk about something tonight

547
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,599
Old place for Brother Qian

548
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,720
Thanks

549
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,960
You are busy, I am busy, too

550
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,519
Have to call me out

551
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,680
What to celebrate

552
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
Thank you for helping me with financial risks

553
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,200
What

554
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,000
Now Tengfei has finally recovered

555
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,039
Awesome you

556
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,559
Just four months

557
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,200
Making such a high profit

558
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,319
The factory has good operating efficiency

559
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,160
I'm not surprised

560
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,400
I'm about my equipment

561
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,559
There is confidence in the product

562
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,880
Say it

563
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,359
Help me so much

564
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,440
In addition to interest

565
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,920
How can I repay you

566
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,319
There is really

567
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,160
I don't want to drive a bus at my unit anymore

568
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,200
Bad every day

569
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,440
I told Jiali

570
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,000
I want to buy a private car

571
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:42,559
Is it okay on the weekend

572
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,720
Accompany me to Shanghai to choose a car

573
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,759
Buy a car

574
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,799
Or you buy it

575
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:49,839
That one for me

576
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,920
Just modified

577
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Five valve electric spray

578
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,039
Although the horsepower is only over 100

579
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:54,960
But it's not meaty at all

580
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:55,920
Started very fast

581
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,359
I want to buy three series

582
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,000
No

583
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,400
My profits in the past four months

584
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,039
Enough

585
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,279
Can't afford the three series

586
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,920
You earn more than me

587
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,920
I want to buy a unit

588
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:12,880
Original imported car

589
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,920
You need to take a day off

590
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Accompany me to advise

591
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,559
You're an amateur

592
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,000
The tax rate for original imported cars is particularly high

593
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,599
You're likely to spend double the money

594
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,559
The last one I bought was

595
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,480
OK OK OK

596
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,799
I don't need to know anything

597
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,799
Performance, parameter

598
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,640
My needs have been settled

599
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,920
Just different

600
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,400
You just say whether you go or not

601
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,559
If I don't go, you may be able to

602
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,200
What kind of broken car is coming back

603
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,359
I have to stare

604
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,119
Come and congratulate

605
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,079
You've bought a car

606
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,200
It's time to change to a new house next

607
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,400
There is indeed this plan

608
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,079
How did you know

609
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,440
Can your unit recruit people?

610
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,359
Go to Shanghai to see imported cars on weekends

611
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,759
Come back and comment

612
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,680
Enter

613
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,200
Mr. Liu

614
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,599
Do you have time

615
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,559
have

616
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,680
What's up

617
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,279
You're going to quit

618
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,599
Do you have any opinions on the company?

619
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,319
still

620
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,480
What difficulties are there at home

621
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,799
No, Mr. Liu

622
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,480
I like electromechanical

623
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,759
I like design, too

624
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,880
I am very happy every day at the company

625
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,960
But my family

626
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,279
Still think private enterprises are not stable enough

627
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,799
Just kept making trouble with me

628
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,200
I have no way

629
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Just promise them

630
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
Go to take the civil service exam

631
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,759
Your family

632
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,359
But this is yours

633
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,400
Job and career

634
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,680
What do you think by yourself

635
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,279
Sorry, Mr. Liu

636
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,400
The company is really good to me

637
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,559
But consider it in the long run

638
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,000
Maybe a civil servant

639
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,000
Can you give me more

640
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,960
Then since you've already

641
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,000
Having this idea

642
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,400
Then try it

643
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,559
In case you want to come back one day

644
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,079
Tengfei still welcomes you

645
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,480
Thank you Mr. Liu

646
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,759
Good luck

647
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:02,880
Thanks

648
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,839
Same plan for Shanghai

649
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,440
God will take me with you

650
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,640
Be a follower for you

651
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,279
Why do you still meet up with netizens on the forum?

652
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
Male and female

653
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,079
Probably a man

654
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,279
The car sector girls make little

655
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,599
We made an appointment at the sports center

656
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,559
Meet in the parking lot

657
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,960
Just go to Shanghai together

658
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,799
The weather is so good on the weekend

659
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,680
Have a friend or a guy

660
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,680
Look at your chance

661
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,559
When will you get rid of singleness?

662
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:58,400
You don't understand

663
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,119
Intimacy is a shackle

664
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,680
I'm not in a hurry

665
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,960
Then you and that Miss Lin

666
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,559
It's really over

667
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,280
What does it mean to end

668
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,079
Haven't started at all

669
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,760
What about the other girl

670
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,000
Another

671
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,119
Just secretly give you a machine information

672
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,719
The one who looks pretty

673
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,559
Yu Shanshan

674
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,480
She seems

675
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,518
There are better choices than me

676
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,079
In the East China Sea

677
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,719
There are better choices than you

678
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,840
I like you

679
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,360
A pretty word that is insincere

680
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,079
I'm sincere

681
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,719
Lu Huadong knows it

682
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,079
Major shareholder of Shiyiji

683
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,280
Lu Guangfa's son

684
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,400
He seems to be with Yu Shanshan

685
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,320
The eldest son of Dongfu Group

686
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,320
right

687
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,480
Have seen one time on occasion

688
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,480
I heard that he has also stayed abroad

689
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,719
besides

690
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,519
MBA (Master of Business Administration)

691
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,400
What about the degree

692
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:12,960
Here comes

693
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,760
Silver Jetta

694
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,679
No

695
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,558
Tornado Screwdriver

696
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,920
Drift King

697
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:37,880
Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello

698
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,280
I should have thought of it for a long time

699
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,280
How many can there be in the East China Sea

700
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,559
Doctors from Germany

701
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,920
Hello

702
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:43,800
Hello

703
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,760
Why didn't you bring that person

704
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,320
Who is that

705
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,280
Yu Shanshan

706
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:51,880
How could I take it

707
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,280
Isn't she your girlfriend

708
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,800
After that, are we

709
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,280
Did you miss it?

710
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,280
Misunderstanding

711
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,320
Anyway

712
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,559
Get in the car now

713
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,920
Not enough time for a day

714
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:08,679
Quick, quick

715
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,639
Drift King

716
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,280
Straightforward

717
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,920
Follow you

718
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Keep up with it

719
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Well enough

720
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:44,920
You really want to buy this

721
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,280
This car is expensive

722
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,119
It's not worth spending so much money

723
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,719
I'll spend money

724
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,280
This brand I bought

725
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,480
If it weren't for the price of the five-series

726
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,559
I can't bear it now

727
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,800
I'll set the five-system

728
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,679
You

729
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,679
You don't listen to my advice

730
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,880
Then why do you bring me here

731
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,480
Carrie doesn't like cars

732
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,519
She won't accompany me

733
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,360
I can only find you to accompany me

734
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,880
Rich people

735
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,559
Just half a year in charge of the branch

736
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,679
You can buy such an expensive car

737
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,239
My new factory

738
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,719
From last year to now

739
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,280
Every day, I'm as tired as a dog

740
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,480
Don't make much money

741
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,880
I have to fill it back and buy equipment

742
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,679
No wonder Luo Qing said he was going to resign

743
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,159
I was a little shaken

744
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,079
You said I'll change careers and go to your place now

745
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,079
Is it still time

746
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:38,960
Come on

747
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,880
I don't believe it if you change careers

748
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,000
I don't

749
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:43,880
I'm just going to change career

750
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,880
I can be a rich man

751
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,679
Young Master

752
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,519
I'm not a rich man

753
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,039
This drifting king is a rich man

754
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,760
Look at others

755
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,559
Only look at top luxury cars

756
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,320
Sir, have coffee

757
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,239
Thanks

758
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,920
Coffee Coffee

759
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,159
Liu Jun

760
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:03,519
Come

761
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,679
Come and have coffee

762
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:07,639
You go over

763
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,800
I have to find a salesperson to bargain.

764
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,679
Be a sucker

765
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,280
How is this car

766
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,840
This interior is too old

767
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,599
You looked at the cover.

768
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,000
What brand of coffee is this

769
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,760
Have you ever drunk it in Germany

770
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,480
Germany doesn't have this

771
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,360
American style

772
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,039
Great God

773
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,719
Have Yu Shanshan told you

774
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,559
Before she was thirty

775
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,599
Don't fall in love

776
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,679
No

777
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,800
That's an excuse for people to reject you

778
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,559
That seems to me

779
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,800
You even have the chance to listen to others' rejection

780
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,599
None

781
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,039
I'm with me

782
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,480
All talk about life and ideals

783
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,360
How can I talk about this

784
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,320
Nutritional topic

785
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:58,960
Talk about it

786
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,559
Even if they are single, they don't know

787
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,519
You know

788
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:11,719
Hello

789
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,119
Feed Shanshan

790
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,079
I'm Liu Jun

791
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,719
How are you lately

792
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:20,960
I

793
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,079
It's okay

794
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,719
Didn't say it last time

795
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,880
Watch a movie together

796
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,920
If you have time recently

797
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,639
Can

798
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,519
Last time

799
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
That time half a year ago

800
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,320
sorry

801
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:36,920
I've always been very busy

802
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,239
And I thought you

803
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:39,400
Let's go tomorrow

804
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:40,800
What

805
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,559
Come and pick me up tomorrow afternoon

806
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,920
Just watching movies is not enough

807
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,119
You have to go shopping with me

808
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,480
Mr. He

809
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,159
Our canteen's meal

810
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,519
Still so simple

811
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,840
This company just recovered

812
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,320
That should be saved

813
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:03,840
Save enough

814
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,480
Very good, you see there are fish here

815
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,880
Very rich, right

816
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:12,920
Old Zhu

817
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,239
Let's go

818
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,079
Sorry to borrow it

819
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,679
Sorry to borrow it

820
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,239
Just started

821
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,119
Old Cao, Old Cao

822
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,079
I'll go to the toilet and you'll stare at it

823
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
It's still early now

824
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,119
Let's go and eat something first

825
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,119
good

826
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,159
What's wrong

827
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,679
They are all in the factory

828
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,000
A phone call with my dad

829
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,639
Something must have happened

830
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:57,880
Wait a moment

831
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,679
Ajun, I'm in the factory

832
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,639
Don't panic
