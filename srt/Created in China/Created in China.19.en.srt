1
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,359
Look at this

2
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,039
What's this

3
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,759
A person who is as unlucky as you

4
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,560
But the two of you are unlucky

5
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Quite the opposite

6
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,079
You're the manufacturer and ran away

7
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,239
He made a complete set of equipment

8
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,719
The buyer went bankrupt

9
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:00,680
Don't want it

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,480
Do you think this thing is suitable?

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,878
What's wrong

12
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,439
Can't use it or

13
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,159
Their total price is too high

14
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,240
Very suitable price

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,599
Even if it is added

16
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,120
My deposit that I had previously evacuated

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,919
Overall, it's lower than my original budget

18
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:24,960
only

19
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,919
If I ordered environmentally friendly equipment

20
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,120
If it is a super sports car

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,520
Then this

22
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:34,520
At most it's an old rental car

23
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,680
Although it meets the national standards

24
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,400
but

25
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:38,960
Dust removal efficiency

26
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,599
It's definitely lower than I expected

27
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:41,960
Mr. Liu

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,639
Are you too pretentious

29
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,840
Most companies can use it

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,478
Why can't you use it?

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,439
You'll get past this hurdle first

32
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,719
Wait for the future

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
Can it be improved

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,680
Just talk about this phone

35
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,120
It must be

36
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,000
Upgraded generation after generation

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,960
This is right

38
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,360
I've been in a state of turmoil for several days

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,599
There is such a set of equipment to help

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,240
Already very lucky

41
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:10,919
Thanks

42
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,960
You're welcome

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,840
Bingbing also said

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,639
As a private owner

45
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,800
The most important thing is

46
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,560
Ensure the survival of the enterprise

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,240
Must be restrained

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,759
Too idealistic thoughts

49
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,680
Between principles and the overall situation

50
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,520
Find balance

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,159
It's true

52
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,520
I saw it

53
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,360
I spoke

54
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,199
No one's words work

55
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:31,360
You are my partner

56
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,759
You can arrange your job first

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,120
Come to my house for dinner tonight

58
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,079
I've got something to do

59
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,478
Want to hear your opinions

60
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,319
I

61
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,719
Yes, I want to hear it

62
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:42,478
An engineering student

63
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,039
Objective opinions

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,639
See you later

65
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,879
See you later

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,439
Leave

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,079
Juguli Come find me

68
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,879
Come here

69
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,199
Slow down

70
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,439
Run another lap

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,280
Jiali

72
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,399
Damn

73
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,120
Have some water when you're tired

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,319
Too trouble

75
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,839
Why are you alone again

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,199
Seven days this week

77
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,879
How many days does Hongming stay at home

78
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,079
He's here today

79
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Have guests at home

80
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,319
Didn't come with me

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,560
You two

82
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,639
It's a bit weird

83
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,920
So you want to pass

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
Real estate agency

85
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,839
Get a deposit from a customer

86
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
Use other financial tools

87
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,159
Amplify the leverage of funds

88
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,800
That's right

89
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,879
This controls the cash flow

90
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,560
With now

91
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,079
But it's not the same concept

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,519
But you are like this

93
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
The risk is also increasing exponentially

94
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
If there is an unexpected event

95
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,959
Causes a node to break

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,600
You can't afford to sell your money

97
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Breaking money

98
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,879
Where can we get opportunities without risk

99
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,800
I'm just a borrower

100
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,600
All financial institutions are used

101
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,279
Money from intermediary clients

102
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
It's leverage

103
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,920
I plan to add it little by little

104
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,639
It's impossible to get up

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,519
Just go straight to high risk

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
Actually, a model can be built

107
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,120
Calculate the critical value

108
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,160
Take every transaction

109
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:28,839
All controlled in one

110
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,879
Within the security limit

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,720
Even if one or two bad debts occur

112
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,159
It can also be adjusted in time

113
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,159
It will not affect the overall

114
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,240
Yeah

115
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,680
So how to build this model

116
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,720
When you first went to college

117
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,159
I write to you every week

118
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,319
It is recommended that you read one more

119
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,720
Double Bachelor of Mathematics

120
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,800
But you don't listen

121
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,879
Have to use your free time on weekends

122
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,040
Run out to work

123
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,040
Now know

124
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,600
Basic science is important

125
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,920
You're a full man

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,079
I don't know how hungry a man is

127
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,600
When I was in college

128
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,839
I won't go out to work

129
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,439
I can't even afford to eat in the cafeteria

130
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,240
Also studying for a double bachelor's degree

131
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,519
OK OK Let's go back to the model

132
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,079
so

133
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,279
I'm based

134
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,959
The data and requirements you provide

135
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,160
Go back and make one for you

136
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,800
Investment model under multiple variables

137
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,560
It should be enough for you

138
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,279
terrific

139
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,439
I'm going to hide it from you

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,759
Because of this

141
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,399
I've been in a state of silence

142
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,480
How about discussing with you

143
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,600
Always feel

144
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,800
This idea seems like it can't be settled

145
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Don't polite me

146
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,759
I can do digital model

147
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,879
This technology

148
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,600
When it comes to investing, I am an amateur

149
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,519
You've developed well in the past two years

150
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,920
Quick start with your eyes

151
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,360
Almost become the richest man in Donghai

152
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,800
Soon, very soon

153
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,000
I won't forget you

154
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,399
Brother, please take it

155
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,279
What does mom mean that I don't care about Hongming

156
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,879
Of course I care about him

157
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,439
Jiali

158
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,199
You said your personality

159
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,600
It's too quiet

160
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,519
Now

161
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,560
Read calligraphy, painting and painting at home every day

162
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,720
This person doesn't like talking

163
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,480
These two live together

164
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,000
Need to be fireworks

165
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,839
Have something to talk about

166
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,680
You said you're so depressed

167
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,000
No wonder Hongming is unwilling to go home

168
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,360
mom

169
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Who told you Hongming

170
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,680
Don't want to go home

171
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
He's busy with work

172
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,920
There are so many social engagements

173
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,879
Then you go to socialites with him

174
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,519
My dad and I

175
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,959
Isn't it living in the next building?

176
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,160
Leave the child to me

177
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,319
Look at you

178
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Don't know anything

179
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,560
My husband needs to arrange everything

180
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,439
Your heart is too big

181
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,120
mom

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,159
Na Hongming discusses business occasion

183
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,680
I really don't like it

184
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,439
you

185
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,759
What new model

186
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,879
New investment plan

187
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,959
I told you before that you forgot

188
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,399
It's Hongming's

189
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,279
You really built one for him

190
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,959
So what is the conclusion

191
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,480
Based on this model

192
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,839
His method is indeed profitable

193
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,519
The risk is not low

194
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,120
But overall

195
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,399
Still within controllable range

196
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,480
Unless there is a major financial crisis

197
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,399
Or all his investors

198
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,879
Suddenly, at the same time

199
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,360
There should be no big problem in normal times

200
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,320
What are you laughing at

201
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:40,600
I have a problem with the model

202
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,440
I laughed at you too seriously

203
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Qian Hongming's heart

204
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,519
Have made up my mind to take risks

205
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,159
Even if you are today

206
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,279
Bad evaluation results

207
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,039
Do you think he will listen to you

208
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,840
This is also

209
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm investing

210
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,919
Don't know much

211
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,519
He asked me

212
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,200
It really doesn't make much sense

213
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,480
But I understand his thoughts

214
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,320
After all, society is developing so fast now

215
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,879
There are so many things that don't take risks

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
Things that can make money

217
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,480
Even if there is

218
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,879
It won't be our ordinary people's turn

219
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,879
Qian Hongming

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,759
Much more courageous than you

221
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,720
He dares to play with financial leverage

222
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,799
You think he needs it

223
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,039
Do you cheer him up

224
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,519
Our Bingbing is right

225
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,279
Big weekend

226
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,039
A moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold

227
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,639
Let's play something else

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,919
No matter him

229
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,559
What to do

230
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,120
My hair is not dry

231
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,559
Not my hair is wet

232
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,320
Let me kiss one

233
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,720
My hair is wet

234
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,679
Vice President Cui is here

235
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,279
Don't call that

236
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,000
Just a big loan officer

237
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,120
Look at my project

238
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,399
How can I understand these

239
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,000
I only know I have a classmate

240
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,200
He wants to buy the Four Seasons Flower City

241
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,440
Say three months in advance

242
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,960
Fill in the intention to register

243
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,200
Then I paid the sincerity money

244
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,080
One day before opening

245
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,279
Specially with air cushion bed

246
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Go there to line up

247
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,440
In the end, I didn't buy it

248
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,840
The type of apartment you want

249
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,039
This property market is so hot

250
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,919
Mr. Qian’s project

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,159
Business will surely be prosperous

252
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,720
I've bought a room four times in total

253
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,039
I always feel that it is harder to buy every time

254
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,080
The last time

255
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,000
If it weren't for my sister's relationship

256
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,039
I'm afraid I can't grab it

257
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,320
The floor you want

258
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,039
Monkey has only bought a house four times

259
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,840
No

260
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
That small mansion in Shanghai is rented

261
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,440
What is Shanghai small mansion

262
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,320
I bought it for investment and rent collection

263
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,000
Miss Cui, don't joke like this

264
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,679
My sister and Liu Jun have no sense of humor

265
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,000
You're talking casually

266
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
They're easy to be real

267
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,000
Money Total Money Total

268
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,720
This lady is about our apartment

269
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,360
Very satisfied

270
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,879
Take a look

271
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,039
OK wait a moment

272
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,799
Go and do your business

273
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,399
Hello

274
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,559
You're optimistic about this

275
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,039
This is two bedrooms, two living rooms and one bathroom

276
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:16,879
What is its location

277
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,879
What's there

278
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,080
This park is there

279
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,279
According to planning conditions

280
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
A certain proportion of supporting housing built

281
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,200
There are apartments and villas

282
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,159
I've asked for two villas

283
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
In this way, researchers are in the tough stage

284
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,720
You can live in the park

285
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,879
I also kept a set

286
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,200
The R&D environment is really good

287
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,119
Thoughtful and thoughtful

288
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,240
No wonder we can retain talents

289
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
But it's not that easy

290
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,639
The status of private enterprises

291
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Still too low

292
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,879
Just like this time

293
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,639
The big bid for North China

294
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,799
It is clearly written on the bid

295
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,480
Only face state-owned enterprises and foreign enterprises

296
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,080
That's a big order

297
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,519
I'm really drooling when I see it

298
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,120
I said

299
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,679
Why have you invited me all the time

300
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,679
Come and visit

301
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,039
You want me to do it for you

302
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,240
Let's say something to the North China family

303
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,799
Yes, Mr. Song

304
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,200
You don't know

305
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,720
This time the bid was shortlisted

306
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,519
There is a foreign company

307
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,720
Just in Southeast Asia

308
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,960
Compete with us for another project

309
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,200
This means that it is abroad

310
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,039
We're totally

311
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,279
Qualify for opportunities

312
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,559
Compete with them fairly

313
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:51,600
How about it in the country

314
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,559
Instead, it won't work

315
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,759
Which company in North China

316
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,600
I understand quite well

317
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,679
Past

318
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,720
Their main responsible person

319
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,519
Still very supportive of domestic research and development

320
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,320
Four years ago he went against the crowd

321
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,679
Used a private company's product

322
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,960
Samples and first batch of supplies

323
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
They are all very good, too

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,039
But later

325
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,720
The small movements slowly began

326
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,279
Borrowing acceptance personnel cut corners

327
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,639
Eventually led to a

328
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Serious accident

329
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,360
That person in charge

330
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,600
It was also terrible to be investigated

331
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,879
Such a business

332
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,039
It's indeed a black sheep

333
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
But if it's because of this

334
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,799
And refuse from now on

335
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,120
All private enterprises participate

336
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,720
Isn't it a bit too arbitrary

337
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,559
You have to admit it

338
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,919
Even if the black sheep is only a few

339
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,759
But in the eyes of that company in North China

340
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,600
Many private companies come to bid

341
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:44,320
at present

342
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,919
No credibility yet

343
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,879
If there is no restrictions on North China this time

344
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,200
There will inevitably be a large number of private enterprises

345
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,200
Flocking to

346
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,879
Some bids are offered

347
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,039
Probably more preferable than anyone else

348
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
But once they get the advance payment

349
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,720
Just transform

350
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,039
In turn, he held Party A hostage

351
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,440
If you want to wash the sand

352
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,440
Sieve them out

353
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,320
It's going to cost a lot

354
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
Carry out pre-investment

355
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,639
If it were you who did the bidding

356
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,240
You don't want to do that,

357
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,879
yes

358
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,239
But credibility

359
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,960
It's also accumulated step by step

360
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,440
We're now having a chance to start

361
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:20,960
None

362
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,879
It's really a pity

363
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,879
But you'll try to visit me this time

364
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,000
It's right

365
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,480
You can stick to your consistent philosophy

366
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,480
Investment in R&D

367
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,879
So much real money

368
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,639
Give me a gift for you

369
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,919
Confidence to guarantee

370
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,080
Mr. Song, what do you mean

371
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,399
I am the boss of that company in North China

372
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,320
Good relationship

373
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,679
Can I ask for your favor

374
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,320
That's great, Mr. Song

375
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,320
thank you

376
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,799
I've always been to Qian Hongying

377
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:58,240
Just hear the name but not the person

378
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,679
The result is a look today

379
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,639
It's completely different from what I thought

380
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,279
Then what do you think of her

381
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,799
I want to

382
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,240
She must have the charm of

383
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,559
Then put on heavy makeup

384
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,840
Hot a big wave

385
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,879
Wearing a delicate suit

386
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:14,919
Carry a brand-name bag

387
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,200
There is the big mark on it

388
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,279
The result is a look today

389
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,519
They are quite quiet and capable

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,679
Your dad's eyes

391
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,039
It's really pretty good

392
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,519
What are you doing

393
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,439
You're not quite generous

394
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,679
Have you made a default

395
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,440
But I still don't like it

396
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,600
Talk about their relationship

397
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,159
Let's be honest

398
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,799
But your dad is pretty good too

399
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,279
I looked at the flower basket in the store today

400
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,879
None of them were given by your dad

401
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,919
No sense of presence at all

402
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,440
He's so afraid of Qian Hongming

403
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,080
This is just everyone

404
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,440
Tacit understanding

405
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,200
Hide each other for a little

406
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,919
Each has purity

407
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,680
If parents are still alive

408
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,119
you say

409
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,799
Will they believe it all

410
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,000
Why don't you believe it

411
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,680
This is just the beginning

412
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,599
sister

413
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,119
I promise within two years

414
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:50,880
Just buy a villa

415
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,519
Buy only a single house

416
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,119
I don't think about the township

417
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,480
You

418
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,920
The big house is not yet hot

419
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:00,960
Just changed

420
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,119
There's really that money

421
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,000
You should buy a store

422
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,240
No

423
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,319
I'm going to live by myself

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,720
Our years

425
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,079
Make money so hard

426
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,519
What is it for

427
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,000
Isn't it just for one day

428
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,920
Don't you have to envy others anymore

429
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,480
Capital is something

430
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,440
The hardest thing to earn is the first pot of gold

431
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,599
Snowballs that roll on my hands

432
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:29,920
Already big enough

433
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,839
Now the bank has taken the initiative to look for me

434
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,720
Interest rates are rising less and less

435
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,920
The margin ratio is getting smaller and smaller

436
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,039
Hiroaki

437
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,559
You are now compared to Liu Jun

438
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,359
Who has the larger asset size

439
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,960
It seems now

440
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,039
I'm not as good as him in total assets

441
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,160
But now

442
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,279
Can mobilize larger amounts of funds

443
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,480
He still insists on investing

444
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,640
His manufacturing industry

445
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,759
Let's wait and see

446
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,880
Finance is the high-end industry

447
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,519
Flying in the sky

448
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
It's faster than running on the ground

449
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,319
One day

450
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,160
Our dream

451
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,160
It will become a reality

452
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,319
fine

453
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,160
The hardness test can be done below

454
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,119
Hello, Mr. Song

455
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:03,640
Very good

456
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,599
We must be ready

457
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,559
Thank you Mr. Song for being so good

458
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,400
goodbye

459
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,640
How is Mr. Liu

460
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:12,880
Which company in North China

461
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,920
Let's prepare the materials

462
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,160
Participate in the technical exchange meeting

463
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,599
If the content of this technical exchange

464
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,359
No problem

465
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
Take off and you can officially

466
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Participated in the bid

467
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:21,920
marvelous

468
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,880
Come

469
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,000
Then when will this be set

470
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,000
March 7th

471
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,720
There are two weeks left in a hurry

472
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,640
No, Mr. Liu

473
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,599
Itinerary in South Asia

474
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,479
It's already settled

475
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,440
It will be open in early March

476
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,200
It's true

477
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,440
A car crash

478
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,119
Although

479
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,839
Xiaosun and I can also represent the company

480
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,079
Go to South Asia to participate in the bidding

481
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,440
But the key is

482
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,279
Only last time

483
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,400
Your visa alone

484
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,839
We're going to do it now

485
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,960
That's too late

486
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,559
Otherwise, the projects in South Asia

487
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,559
Put it aside first

488
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,799
This definitely won't work

489
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,079
But the exchange meeting is also important

490
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,160
Ah Jun

491
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,880
They're all here

492
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,839
I'll tell you

493
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,960
Our staff canteen

494
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,160
I just changed the master

495
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,039
Cantonese cuisine

496
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,799
Let's try the dishes at noon

497
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,720
Together

498
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,480
It's really clean

499
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,279
The back kitchen in the cafeteria

500
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,799
This hygiene standard must also be met

501
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,240
right

502
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,720
dad

503
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,599
Each one has a bad smile

504
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,440
What's wrong with holding on

505
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,200
Director Lao Liu

506
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,039
It's time to ask you to do it

507
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,359
Mr. Liu

508
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:02,759
Old Zhu

509
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:05,079
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

510
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,000
Thanks Thanks

511
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:06,880
It's okay

512
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,240
Mr. Liu seems to be tanned in South Asia

513
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,079
Yeah

514
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,319
The bid opening will go smoothly

515
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,599
Very smooth

516
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,000
After winning the bid

517
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,400
Sign the contract directly

518
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,240
What will happen to the exchange

519
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,759
Is the result not good

520
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,920
Why

521
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,079
You ask me

522
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll ask who to go

523
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,319
I really don't know

524
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,240
I'll tell you Ah Jun

525
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,680
I was afraid of being late that day

526
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,119
I got up early in the morning

527
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,480
Half an hour ahead of time

528
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,359
I'll arrive at the venue

529
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,599
Their company

530
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,079
Those who come to participate in the exchange

531
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,119
It's really a lot

532
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,880
I smoke whenever I meet

533
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,519
Switch hands when you meet someone and send a business card

534
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,200
The atmosphere before the meeting is pretty good, right

535
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,160
When the introduction was introduced later

536
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,799
I'm completely complete, too

537
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,839
According to your manuscript

538
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:50,880
I've memorized it

539
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,799
No word is bad

540
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,000
I didn't even beat me

541
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,960
But I don't know why

542
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,880
The boss in North China

543
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,000
Always dark with me

544
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,039
After I finish speaking

545
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:01,960
He got up and left

546
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:02,759
Ignore me

547
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,519
The boss's attitude is so obvious

548
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,319
People in his company who participated in the exchange

549
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,519
Can you still not understand

550
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:10,559
Later we were reluctant

551
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,599
Completed the meeting

552
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,440
But Mr. Sun and I

553
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,519
So many things have been prepared

554
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,519
Together

555
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,000
No answers to a few questions

556
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,640
Follow me

557
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,240
It really doesn't matter

558
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,720
Then it's considered accumulating experience

559
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,720
Not OK this time

560
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,519
Then next time

561
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,000
dad

562
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,119
We'll discuss it

563
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,920
Technical issues

564
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,079
Or you can go and do it first

565
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,599
You talk

566
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,680
Then I'll go back to the office

567
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,319
Ah Jun

568
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:02,920
I'll tell you

569
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,880
You should still take time

570
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,920
Contact Mr. Song

571
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,160
He must know what's going on

572
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:07,839
good

573
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,119
This is my fault

574
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,160
Mr. Song Mingming told me before

575
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,480
This is the person in charge of North China

576
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,439
Have suffered losses in private companies before

577
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,720
Have a knot in my heart

578
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,880
But my dad

579
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,319
But I was born with a big body

580
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,200
The face of a private business owner

581
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,799
External image is really

582
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,119
Too typical

583
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,000
Mr. Liu

584
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,319
We're taking off

585
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
The big occasions facing now

586
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,519
It's more and more

587
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,039
You can't be busy alone

588
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,359
We are all technical staff

589
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,839
Can't handle it either

590
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,759
And the company's delivery volume is now increasing

591
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,000
Payment often needs to be recovered

592
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
Which of these customers

593
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,559
Credit extension is possible

594
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,200
Which must be shipped according to the payment

595
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,039
A precise judgment is required

596
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:04,920
this

597
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,680
The old factory manager

598
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,960
Have missed several times

599
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,480
I understand what you mean

600
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,640
Take off now needs one

601
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,480
Existing technical foundation

602
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,160
Can also do external sales

603
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,160
Market-based talent

604
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,359
And my dad

605
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:23,839
No longer adapted

606
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,880
The company has developed now

607
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,279
It seems

608
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,359
You have to find someone to fly

609
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,079
Vice President of Marketing

610
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,839
I want to find a vice president to replace your father

611
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,680
Then does he know this?

612
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,200
My dad actually

613
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,519
Very self-aware

614
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
I hinted to him in a tactful way

615
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,400
He should understand

616
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,039
Then what's his reaction

617
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,559
A little lost

618
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,559
But it's not unacceptable.

619
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,160
There are tissues here

620
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,079
fine

621
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,680
I'll come I'll come I'll come

622
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,640
What's wrong

623
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,000
I just thought of it

624
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,680
What your dad looks like at the exchange meeting

625
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,720
I can't help it

626
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:22,839
What is this

627
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,359
Crown Hotel VIP (VIP) card

628
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:28,680
Who gave it

629
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,319
Lin Chuan sent it some time ago

630
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:31,759
This Crown Hotel

631
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,480
It's their Lin family's project

632
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,880
No. 00

633
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,359
This is the VIP among the VIPs

634
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,799
Lin Chuan still misses you so much

635
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,400
Lin Chuan and I

636
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,799
No deeper involvement

637
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,400
I've explained to you a long time ago

638
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,200
And you didn't see this card

639
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,799
Did I throw it in the armrest box?

640
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,200
No plans to use it at all

641
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,079
Why not use it

642
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,599
Can you get 25% off

643
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,640
You don't need me

644
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,160
What do you mean

645
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,200
No

646
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,359
I just mentioned Lin Yue

647
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,759
I suddenly thought of someone

648
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,519
There is

649
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,200
Experience in managing advanced enterprises

650
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,559
Know marketing

651
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,200
Please enter

652
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,880
Mr. Dong

653
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,799
Mr. Liu

654
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,119
This blink of an eye

655
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,279
Haven't seen each other for more than three years

656
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,039
Yes Yes Yes

657
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,599
When I first met

658
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,479
I'll know

659
00:27:32,598 --> 00:27:34,960
Mr. Liu, you are definitely not a thing in the pool

660
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,480
Mr. Dong is really over-reward

661
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,759
Come on, please sit down

662
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,279
please

663
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,559
It's time to serve

664
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,359
Just the two of us

665
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,079
When I booked a room before

666
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,200
This is the last one

667
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,000
Just go ahead

668
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,200
You're too polite

669
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,000
But then again

670
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,599
This three-year development

671
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,160
It's really fast enough

672
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,680
Not to mention the East Sea

673
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,519
Even if you look at the whole province

674
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,839
That's also eye-catching

675
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,480
I've also stumbled all the way

676
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,359
Come here

677
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
You are an insider in the industry

678
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,400
I must have heard a lot of jokes from me

679
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,000
to be honest

680
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,000
Really not

681
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,079
You know too

682
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,240
We are in our machinery manufacturing industry

683
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,200
Not everyone

684
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:23,920
All agree with your business

685
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,000
But Mr. Liu

686
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,599
Your philosophy

687
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,839
Perseverance and persistence

688
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
Everyone admires it in their hearts

689
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,079
Thanks Thanks

690
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,279
How much alcohol consumption of Dong

691
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,519
Mr. Liu

692
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,680
That's really sorry

693
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,680
Three highs in physical examination

694
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,000
What about the leader at home

695
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,680
It's been banned so

696
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,720
That's just right to use tea instead of wine

697
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,319
good

698
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,559
It's also considered health care

699
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,599
Thanks

700
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,559
Have some food first

701
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,200
You're here too

702
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,200
How busy is Mr. Liu

703
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,920
I know very well in my heart

704
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,079
You asked me to come today

705
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,559
If you have anything, just tell me

706
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,359
When it was difficult

707
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,279
Always ask Mr. Dong for advice

708
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,519
I hope that at that time

709
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,759
Work hand in hand with you

710
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,279
have no idea

711
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,119
Is it possible now

712
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,359
I see

713
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,680
Mr. Liu's career is developing rapidly

714
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,880
Currently, one is needed in terms of marketing

715
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,799
Is it the one who helps you take the helm

716
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,400
At the beginning, the city invited Mr. Dong to the first machine

717
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,680
Give it the position of the general manager

718
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,680
But I'm in

719
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,000
Only give you the deputy general manager

720
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,279
But I promise you

721
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Sales

722
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,359
The full responsibility of General Dong

723
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,400
No interference

724
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,799
As for the annual salary

725
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,480
It's definitely as good as possible

726
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,519
Your current value

727
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,880
How much is the annual salary

728
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,039
Is it the chief or vice president

729
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,480
None of these matter

730
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,200
I personally

731
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,119
Very optimistic about the future development of Tengfei

732
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,920
so

733
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,440
If Mr. Liu

734
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,400
If I really hope I join

735
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,200
I'll just ask one condition

736
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,160
Mr. Dong, please speak

737
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,440
Very simple equity

738
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,079
cheers

739
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,519
This hotel is too expensive

740
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,960
I can't bear to come at all

741
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,599
Look at the decoration of this hotel

742
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,480
How new

743
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,839
Yes, Sister Bingbing is generous

744
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,640
Thank you Bingbing

745
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,759
Thank you Bingbing

746
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:32,839
Thank you Bingbing

747
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,079
You're welcome, why are you here

748
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,400
Hello, I've been disturbed

749
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,480
This is our hotel

750
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,400
Red wine for this VIP

751
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,759
Do you want to open it for you?

752
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Open it for me Thank you

753
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:41,720
Hello

754
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,240
I have a microphone in the stands

755
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Can we sing

756
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,839
OK

757
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,160
You go up and talk to our pianist

758
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,440
Just communicate

759
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,960
Then let's finish the glass of wine

760
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,039
Then go on stage to sing

761
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,519
There are so many people

762
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,039
I don't sing too much

763
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,319
Drink slowly

764
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,119
How much to drink

765
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,119
Bingbing walks

766
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,759
I won't go, you go

767
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,240
Then you'll sing later

768
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:03,960
I'll wait for you

769
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:04,799
Let's go first

770
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,559
It's abnormal

771
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,400
You won't sing a song

772
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,240
This kind of noisy entertainment project

773
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,039
I'm completely out of interest

774
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,839
You're old

775
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,119
You're old

776
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,480
I'm just about to ask you

777
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,200
Lu Huadong made a bet with me

778
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,160
Say you've been transferred back to the East China Sea

779
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,359
It will definitely be within one year

780
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,400
Marry Liu Jun

781
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,119
Please tell me quickly

782
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,319
Did he propose to you

783
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Don't mention it

784
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,559
What's wrong

785
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,440
Liu Jun is not proactive enough

786
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,960
The situation now

787
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,039
A little complicated

788
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,839
Want to develop

789
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,319
It must be mobilized

790
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,680
The enthusiasm of the backbone

791
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,720
so what

792
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:56,839
Equity incentives

793
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,640
It must be the future development trend

794
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,119
Mr. Liu hasn't considered these

795
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,759
But we take off

796
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,000
There is a reward mechanism

797
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,079
According to the company's annual situation

798
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,319
and personal performance

799
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,079
From general manager to employee

800
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,519
All rewards are available at different levels

801
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,000
Anyway, they're all paying

802
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,200
Then this bonus and equity dividend

803
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,318
Is there any difference

804
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,480
At this stage

805
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,319
There is no difference

806
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,240
But in the future

807
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,440
We're flying

808
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,359
It definitely won't be listed

809
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,079
Then this equity

810
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,799
It will always be a dividend

811
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,720
Not available

812
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:33,960
right

813
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,599
Mr. Liu

814
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:43,200
I don't want to be a general soldier

815
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,279
Not a good soldier

816
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,599
Think about it

817
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,119
What about you suffering and suffering

818
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,319
Run a manufacturing enterprise

819
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,200
If it is not a target for listing

820
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,440
Make profits by selling products alone

821
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,759
Which year and month

822
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,640
Only by completing capital accumulation

823
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,119
Too slow

824
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,039
The benefits of this capital

825
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:13,599
I know

826
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,160
Is it convenient to raise funds after listing

827
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,519
But you and I understand

828
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:19,839
The disadvantages of this capital

829
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,720
No matter how it works

830
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,119
It's always its pursuit of profit

831
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
Core and ultimate goal

832
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,599
With my philosophy

833
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,319
Tengfei is not suitable for listing

834
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:33,799
clear

835
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,160
I can go back

836
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,480
Discuss with my father again

837
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,480
See if some equity can be given up

838
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,279
To Mr. Dong

839
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:52,559
but

840
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,319
Not available

841
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,839
It's my persistence in running a business

842
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,200
Excuse me

843
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,160
Sad Mr. Liu

844
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:06,920
Wherever

845
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,280
Thank you Mr. Dong for your guidance.

846
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,518
From a legal perspective

847
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,199
Liu Jun proposed to sign a prenuptial agreement

848
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,480
It's very reasonable

849
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,400
first

850
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,440
It's his father's rights involved

851
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,239
In addition, take-off operations

852
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,639
Stable guarantees are also needed

853
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,719
But as a woman

854
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,440
You feel uncomfortable

855
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,679
I can understand, too

856
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I can understand rationally

857
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:42,480
But emotionally, I can't accept it.

858
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,000
This marriage hasn't been settled yet

859
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,920
Just put divorce in future consideration

860
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,360
This is not the love I pursue

861
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,559
This will only make me feel

862
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,440
He doesn't love me

863
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,639
At least I don't love him

864
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,480
Love so deeply

865
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,199
You hope Liu Jun

866
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,559
Show your ideal love

867
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,559
This wish is not wrong

868
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,400
It's just not realistic enough

869
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,239
Regardless of male or female

870
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,920
To our age

871
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,480
Marriage is already mixed

872
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,079
Many more important factors

873
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,280
Is this marriage really that important

874
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,559
Worth a man for it

875
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,800
Give up all your fault

876
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,119
You guys slow down

877
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,519
Don't help me

878
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,960
How much has it been drunk

879
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:30,719
Didn't drink much

880
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,639
Many

881
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:35,159
OK, all the three of them were drunk

882
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,119
I'll send them

883
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:36,920
How do you go

884
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,760
I'll take a taxi by myself and leave me alone

885
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,280
Mr. Lin

886
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,159
Guests with card number eight

887
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,079
That's that one

888
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,880
Miss wearing rose red clothes

889
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,079
Then I'll leave

890
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,519
Feed Bingbing

891
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,000
Feel me at the Crown Hotel

892
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,119
Come and pick me up

893
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,679
See you at the gate after ten minutes

894
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,159
You can pick me up in the lobby

895
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:25,719
hall

896
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,639
Then I have to find a place to park

897
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,039
You don't think it's easy to park

898
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,840
I'm still afraid that someone will see it

899
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,880
Who am I afraid of

900
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,079
I'll go to the hall to pick you up

901
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,039
good

902
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,480
Liu Jun

903
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:27,960
You're not drunk

904
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,840
So happy after getting together with friends

905
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,599
Who did you show it to?

906
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,400
I said it has nothing to do with her

907
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,280
As for being so suspicious

908
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,119
As for

909
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,360
You tell me honestly

910
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,920
An old acquaintance like Lin Chuan

911
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,800
How many more do you have

912
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,800
An ordinary acquaintance like Lian Linchuan

913
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
You won't let it go

914
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,440
Then I still have some serious things

915
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,320
Where is the ex-girlfriend

916
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,039
What I cannot accept the most

917
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:11,599
It's you

918
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,800
A righteous attitude

919
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,880
You don't care whether I'm angry

920
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,320
Where is it

921
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,800
Let's get married sooner

922
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,840
Save you to make trouble again

923
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,079
Please don't use marriage as a shield

924
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:28,840
In terms of marriage

925
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,119
We have different ideas

926
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,000
I don't want to force myself yet

927
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,199
Can you be more rational

928
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,159
You are rational

929
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,960
Your rules and regulations are the most rational

930
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,639
Forget it, you drank too much today

931
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,119
Let's not discuss this for now

932
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
I didn't drink much

933
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:50,920
But I don't want to

934
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,119
Discuss this with you

935
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,400
Lao Luo is here again

936
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,079
Here comes

937
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,280
Mr. Liu

938
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,159
Luo Qing

939
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,679
Let's look at the alloy experiment again

940
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,199
no

941
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,599
I'll come to you today

942
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:25,960
Then come on

943
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:27,639
Drink water

944
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,360
Thank you Mr. Liu

945
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,760
Thanks

946
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,198
When I came two days ago

947
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,400
Listen to Manager Zhu

948
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,840
You want to find a sales deputy

949
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,079
yes

950
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,000
Do you have any recommendations

951
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,599
If you don't dislike it

952
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,039
I want to recommend myself

953
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,119
You resigned from Tengfei

954
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,280
Just to take civil servant exam

955
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,159
Now developing so well

956
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,320
All have already been promoted to the full-time

957
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:53,960
A bright future

958
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,639
Why do you want to jump out of the mechanism again

959
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,960
Because it turns out

960
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,400
The job of the agency is not suitable for me

961
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,199
These years

962
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,440
I've seen what everyone has obtained

963
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,840
These technical achievements

964
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,039
I really

965
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,880
A special desire to be involved

966
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,599
Desire to do it yourself

967
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,000
Proud results

968
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,239
Luo Qing

969
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,239
That being said

970
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,199
Mr. Liu

971
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,920
I'm proposing myself

972
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,000
Not trying to take advantage of old relationships

973
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,239
That's it

974
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,559
In the past two years

975
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,079
I've been working in the business system

976
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,639
I'm very familiar with the process within the system

977
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,039
Outside the system

978
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,719
I have also accumulated some resources

979
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,840
In my opinion

980
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,840
Sales Management

981
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,599
First, we must have a general layout perspective

982
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,519
The second is the ability to deal with people

983
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,360
I don't lack both of these

984
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,360
Other than that

985
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,840
I have the most advantage

986
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:40,760
That's often

987
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,920
Let's take off and watch

988
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,400
The technical foundation has not been lost

989
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,159
Mr. Liu

990
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,000
If you want

991
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,239
If you give me this opportunity

992
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,079
I believe I can do it well

993
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,599
Do you think I'm not suitable

994
00:40:58,559 --> 00:40:59,239
No

995
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,119
It's what you just said

996
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,480
Remind me of the past

997
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:05,400
You're here to interview

998
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,239
So can I come back

999
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,000
Luo Qing

1000
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:19,320
Can you come back

1001
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,559
Of course I can't ask for it

1002
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,840
But I know too

1003
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,159
Section-level cadre of your age

1004
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,639
How valuable is this location

1005
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,960
Salary bonus

1006
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:30,000
Welfare

1007
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,079
There is also social status

1008
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,039
You want to give up

1009
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,079
That's definitely a big deal

1010
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,920
You're quitting

1011
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,239
Does Mrs. Luo agree?

1012
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,159
I, I do

1013
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,400
Haven't discussed it with her yet

1014
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,400
childish

1015
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:45,719
Zhang Hai

1016
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:46,840
exist

1017
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,119
Get it

1018
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,519
Liu Lili

1019
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,000
Old Zhu

1020
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:57,599
President Liu

1021
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,920
This is yours and the old factory manager

1022
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,519
Zhang Weimin

1023
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,078
arrive

1024
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,719
I chatted with Mr. Dong that day

1025
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,480
He said his medical examination results

1026
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:10,199
Not very good

1027
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,039
This is aging

1028
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,000
Indicator data for each item

1029
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,159
Becoming ugly

1030
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,000
Wang Yang

1031
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,400
He's only in his forties

1032
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,280
I don't even dare to drink wine when I come out for dinner

1033
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,400
Isn't that true

1034
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,360
You see this blood pressure

1035
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,280
It's almost critical

1036
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,519
Since my dad was hospitalized that year

1037
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,119
Blood pressure has been well controlled

1038
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,599
Why is it suddenly so high

1039
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:32,439
Mr. Liu

1040
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,400
The following is from the old factory manager

1041
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,599
This is yours

1042
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,000
This is mine

1043
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,079
Zhu Zihao

1044
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,400
Give

1045
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,840
I won't eat it

1046
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:48,800
eat

1047
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,519
good

1048
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:56,719
Liu Jun

1049
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,519
uncle

1050
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,920
From your report

1051
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,360
Sit and sit

1052
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,960
Because of organic lesions

1053
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,000
This caused

1054
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,480
Possibility of increased blood pressure

1055
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,840
Can be ruled out
