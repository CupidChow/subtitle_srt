1
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,120
Mr. Liu

2
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,158
The procedures have been completed

3
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,079
We can go in

4
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,359
OK

5
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,639
Borrowing a test center is not easy

6
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,999
The cost is not low

7
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:52,919
I won't delay you

8
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,120
Time is precious

9
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,120
To use it on the blade

10
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,040
Talk less and do more

11
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,480
I understand

12
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,120
Thank you, Chief Executive Wang

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,799
Go

14
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,918
Here

15
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,319
Miss Lin

16
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,960
Xiao Yu is here too

17
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,039
Mr. Lin

18
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,759
Did Mr. Liu do it himself?

19
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,999
Do you need a helper?

20
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,960
How dare you trouble

21
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,640
sit

22
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,599
Don't let me help

23
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,680
Are you afraid of leaking

24
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,800
Trade secrets

25
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,358
How could it be

26
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,840
No secret

27
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,159
don’t worry

28
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,599
I have been majoring in chemical engineering for four years

29
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:27,599
After graduation

30
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,320
Haven't even touched a professional for a day

31
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
In addition to the three major mechanics

32
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,799
Remember a name besides

33
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,960
I've forgotten about the relevant content

34
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,440
Xiao Yu

35
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,679
You report it to your home, too

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,080
So that Dr. Liu can rest assured

37
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:41,760
good

38
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,599
That's not what I mean

39
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,520
You've also seen this is a rough job

40
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,119
How can girls do it?

41
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,000
Four years of mechanical major

42
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,719
I went down the workshop for three months

43
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,039
But after that

44
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,479
I've never touched the drawing board again

45
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,960
Even if you want to steal, you can't steal it

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,520
Two aunts

47
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm just afraid you're tired

48
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,599
I really don't have to be careful of anyone

49
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,560
You want to watch it, just watch it

50
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
It's OK to record with the camera

51
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,400
I guarantee the test results

52
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,919
Absolutely not concealing it deliberately

53
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
I definitely don't understand at all

54
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:16,039
Xiaoyu, you are a mechanical one

55
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,960
Can see

56
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,479
What is Mr. Liu doing?

57
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:33,880
Can you tell

58
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:37,400
In my opinion

59
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:38,719
They should be doing something

60
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,159
Repeated tensile experiments

61
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:41,760
I can't see it anymore

62
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,719
This is a tensile experiment

63
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,440
The key is that they record the data

64
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,320
We can see this clearly

65
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,200
but

66
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,000
Is it useful?

67
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,799
yes

68
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,719
Yes Yes

69
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,440
Mr. Liu recorded data

70
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,760
Although not avoiding us

71
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,960
But the dip fire corresponding to each data

72
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,400
Annealing or backfire

73
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,919
I'm afraid only Mr. Liu himself knows it

74
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,840
What's more, this alloy steel

75
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
Added a variety of rare elements

76
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,960
Even if you take photos of every metallographic image

77
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,320
It may not be able to figure it out

78
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,799
Corresponding temperature and content

79
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
So profound

80
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,520
No wonder Mr. Liu

81
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,039
Not afraid of us watching

82
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:20,679
What's the profound

83
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,000
Miss Yu has touched the door

84
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,159
I can't even step in when I get to the door

85
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,039
Just my big book for four years

86
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:30,960
Low level

87
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,880
At most, it can only be seen

88
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,119
Your heat treatment method

89
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,479
Can't continue processing at all

90
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:35,520
Your data

91
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,520
So Mr. Liu

92
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,080
You must not harm me

93
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,960
It doesn't matter if you say casually

94
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,479
If Mr. Lin becomes real, I will be in trouble

95
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,159
To be honest

96
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:47,640
After I return home

97
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,080
Can you meet you and General Manager Wang

98
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,159
Such an insider

99
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,760
I'm happy yet

100
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,919
How dare you

101
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,599
This guy is just messing around

102
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,520
I really don't believe it

103
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:03,799
What kind of reputation can he make

104
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,960
Don't watch it anymore

105
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,479
Since he dares to show up

106
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,840
Not a business secret

107
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,080
Waste of time

108
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:11,239
Then I won't watch it

109
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,560
Just shut down

110
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,719
Just like a TV

111
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,719
There are several days left in the next

112
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,320
Have to

113
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,039
Miss Yu is delayed from get off work normally

114
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,359
It's really a pity

115
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,599
This is the job arranged by the factory for me

116
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,000
Mr. Liu, please be welcome

117
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,119
It's already so late

118
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,520
Miss Yu went home alone

119
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,440
I'm afraid it's not safe

120
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,320
Do you need me to send you back?

121
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,520
No

122
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:46,119
I made an appointment with my friend to go out for fun

123
00:07:58,919 --> 00:07:59,960
Mr. Lin, I'll leave first

124
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:05,799
Hello

125
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:06,440
Hello

126
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,239
See it

127
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,000
Someone answered

128
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Then go home

129
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
Why do you treat it so differently?

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,799
Why don't you say you're sending me

131
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,000
Your car is here

132
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,799
Then you're driving in front

133
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,279
I'll take you home from behind

134
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,200
OK, you can

135
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:34,799
Follow me

136
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,840
Don't lose it

137
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
You really want to sell these shops

138
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,639
You're in real estate

139
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,960
There must be many customers I know

140
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,920
I can only ask you for help

141
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,999
The price is higher when it is sold

142
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,800
But the factory

143
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,239
These shops on the street

144
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,519
All are the best locations in the city

145
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,560
Now shops are getting more and more popular

146
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,119
The city center has risen particularly well

147
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,280
You sell it now

148
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,800
It's definitely not cost-effective

149
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,879
You don't know

150
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,800
Ajun develops a new product

151
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,040
Very expensive

152
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,320
The funds I prepared

153
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
I'm afraid I can't stand it anymore

154
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,719
So think about it

155
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Only these can be played

156
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
The store idea

157
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,040
no way

158
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,080
You've been committing so continuously

159
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:34,040
Have you considered the risks?

160
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,239
Of course I have considered

161
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,960
Ajun develops this project

162
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,800
There will definitely be results

163
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,200
Once you see profit

164
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,560
This is a big business

165
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
Profits are definitely high

166
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:52,800
Since

167
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,759
You have so much confidence in Liu Jun

168
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:55,999
I suggest

169
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,399
Don't sell it first

170
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,200
These are excellent real estate

171
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,879
Take it to the bank as collateral

172
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,800
And the current interest rate

173
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,800
Not high

174
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,080
Bank mortgage

175
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,239
If it's simple

176
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
For emergency response

177
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,960
This is a really good idea

178
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:14,920
You see

179
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,960
I'll talk to you about this matter

180
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,800
That's right

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,759
This is going to change to other account managers

182
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,359
Then they are waiting to get the commission

183
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Who will consider it for me

184
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,200
Thank you

185
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,639
You always forgot to eat

186
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,719
How can this work

187
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,800
Aunt Fu

188
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,879
Your job is so complicated

189
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,479
Can't do it if you change someone

190
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,080
Not complicated at all

191
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,960
Just follow my needs

192
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,639
Keep a close eye on time and temperature

193
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Just keep the record

194
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,080
As you say so

195
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,359
Those who don't know how to do it can also do it

196
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:20,919
Of course

197
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,080
Just need to be careful

198
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,560
Have to be patient

199
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,560
I've suffered once before

200
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:29,519
So I dare not look for anyone else

201
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,320
Stay at me

202
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,999
You continue to do this

203
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,239
The body can't bear it

204
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,239
Can I help with this matter?

205
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,840
I cook rice every day

206
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,320
Have a lot of free time

207
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,280
Why are you here

208
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,519
Why can't your phone be connected?

209
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,960
The phone is out of power and it's powered off

210
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,920
You're not afraid that I won't come back tonight

211
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,200
You're waiting here for a night

212
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,280
Come on

213
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,440
Where else can you go

214
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:36,719
How long hasn't I been sleeping

215
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,759
I don't know either

216
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,840
I probably squinted in the afternoon

217
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:45,560
Half an hour

218
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,280
What's the matter

219
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,080
What the hell is it

220
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,359
Liu Jun

221
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,759
Did we both agree that

222
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,599
No one will mention the past

223
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,200
Right

224
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:09,759
yes

225
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,599
Then can you let your dad

226
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,639
Stop looking for my sister

227
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,759
The state supports real estate

228
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,440
There are so many sales managers in Donghai City

229
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,200
Your street shops are so popular

230
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,719
Why is my sister selling it?

231
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,800
My dad wants to sell a shop

232
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,800
You don't know about this

233
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,680
I really don't know

234
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,040
My dad didn't tell me

235
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,879
Sorry, I'm too much

236
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,320
It's all my fault

237
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,599
I've been busy with development lately

238
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:38,879
I haven't noticed it for a long time

239
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:39,840
The amount of funds

240
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,320
Not only should you pay attention to funds

241
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,639
I think you need to be tight

242
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,999
What's the meaning

243
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,800
I've got from several clients of the company

244
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,840
The news heard

245
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,599
Lin Yuepai City 1 Machinery Engineer

246
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,560
Inquiring everywhere

247
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,440
What about your suppliers in the factory

248
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,719
This high-end product

249
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,759
Many special steels are required

250
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:02,320
East China Sea and even the whole country

251
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,680
Suppliers that can be

252
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,560
There aren't many

253
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,519
That is to say they

254
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,800
Willing to work hard to inquire

255
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,239
Sooner or later I'll ask

256
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,599
Then go to the supplier

257
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,280
Follow the map to search for the horse

258
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,359
He can figure it out roughly

259
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,560
What raw materials do I use

260
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,599
This Lin Yue

261
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,040
The city's first machine is so large

262
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,280
He has this energy

263
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,160
Why doesn't he spend time

264
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,320
Improve yourself

265
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,359
Why do you still have some leisure time

266
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,119
Do you care about others to improve or not

267
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,479
You'd better think of a solution

268
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,800
How to make your own loopholes

269
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,399
Make up for it

270
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
I originally thought

271
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,160
No matter how wildly it grows

272
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,479
It's not a primitive society now

273
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,960
Shamelessness of some manufacturers

274
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,960
There should always be a bottom line

275
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,519
What bottom line principle

276
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,398
Less emotion

277
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,440
My face is green

278
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,879
Go to bed quickly

279
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,160
Miss Yu kept staring at me

280
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:07,359
Is there anything on my face?

281
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,719
You're a little weird today

282
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
Although there was no error in the operation

283
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,440
But it's just a feeling

284
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,080
Can't concentrate completely

285
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,239
A little annoyed

286
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,399
Strong eyes

287
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,759
you're right

288
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm really upset

289
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,080
Mr. Lin

290
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,479
sit

291
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:55,599
Mr. Liu is very busy

292
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,719
Too much devoted

293
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,239
I'm giving it to you specifically

294
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,639
Come with surprise

295
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,879
Guess

296
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:01,759
What is it

297
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,999
Miss Lin, please take it out

298
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,239
You're so thin

299
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,759
There is no hidden thing behind it

300
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,960
You've been in Germany for so long

301
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,239
I must have gotten used to eating Western food

302
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:15,879
This is from the local area

303
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,399
The best steakhouse to order

304
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,239
While it's not cold yet

305
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,239
Come and eat quickly

306
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,999
Miss Yu is blessed with happiness

307
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,280
There are two servings to eat together

308
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,239
Thank you, I'm not hungry yet

309
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:06,560
Workload these days

310
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:07,598
Becoming bigger and bigger

311
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,079
Is it going to succeed?

312
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:09,878
Miss Lin

313
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,760
This is

314
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:13,319
Test data for product development

315
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,679
It's my knowledge and sweat

316
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,358
You probably shouldn't have watched it

317
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,439
People are naturally curious

318
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:23,240
Let's talk about it

319
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:24,839
It wasn't what you said last time

320
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,679
These data

321
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,079
Can we watch it casually

322
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,000
This is your territory

323
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:32,240
You have the final say

324
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,919
Then you eat

325
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,679
I'll leave first

326
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,040
Miss Yu

327
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,560
Together

328
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,080
No

329
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,599
This is the first time someone in the laboratory

330
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,879
It's not the eldest son here

331
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,159
Liu Jun said he would go out to eat at night

332
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,439
I don't have to go back to cook

333
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:32,480
Just help him do it for a while

334
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,240
OK

335
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,359
When you leave

336
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,399
Don't forget to turn off the lights and doors

337
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:37,679
knew

338
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:48,000
You're not doing experiments

339
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,840
Have you even had time to sleep?

340
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,040
Why do you still have the intention to drink with me?

341
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,639
I'm going to think about development now

342
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,040
Worry about funds again

343
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,840
Beware of Lin Yue

344
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,959
You won't let me come out for some breath

345
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,359
I'll explode

346
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,159
Finally, it's not easy

347
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
But it doesn't matter

348
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,560
It will definitely be even more difficult in the future

349
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,560
What are you doing

350
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,520
Where can I learn from you

351
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,959
No trouble, no trouble, no trouble

352
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,599
Alcohol Alcohol Alcohol

353
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,639
Wine is expensive

354
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,760
dirty

355
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,919
Who did you learn this from

356
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:24,320
Serious

357
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,439
As planned

358
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,199
I'm going to launch the entire series

359
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:29,439
It seems unrealistic now

360
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,359
So I have a new idea

361
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,119
Stop doing it

362
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,000
screw you

363
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,439
I'm going to put the whole series

364
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,800
The most mature one

365
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:40,040
Take it out as the finished product

366
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,080
Enter production

367
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,240
Use product rolling to develop

368
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,480
Reduce overall financial pressure

369
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,280
Isn't this a good idea

370
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,320
congratulations

371
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,280
All have such good ideas

372
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,280
What else should I sigh

373
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,399
What are you worried about

374
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,560
OEM

375
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:03,800
My dad asked many manufacturers

376
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,040
Productive

377
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:05,959
All are large-scale enterprises

378
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,159
You don't reach a certain total production

379
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,480
People won't pay attention to you

380
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:11,520
Ask and ask

381
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,159
Only one person is willing to pick up

382
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,399
City one machine

383
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,280
Didn't look for it

384
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,520
This office building

385
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,639
All the canteen workshops have been found

386
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,919
It's definitely not here

387
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,720
What does Aunt Fu say

388
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,599
Don't answer the phone

389
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,599
Call another one

390
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,959
No hurry or not

391
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,879
You told me

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,639
Aunt Fu is in our house

393
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,398
Have been doing it for several years

394
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,119
Very good person

395
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,080
I believe her

396
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:39,919
Then you can't

397
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,199
Tell her the safe password

398
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:41,959
Then I won't tell her

399
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,800
How did she put the book in

400
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:43,720
You have it

401
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,119
You drive well

402
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,480
Lock the car

403
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,840
Dad, please help me lock it

404
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:14,599
Aunt Fu

405
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,639
Aunt Fu opens the door

406
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,240
What's wrong with Liu Jun

407
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,800
Aunt Fu, my

408
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,079
Where did you put that book

409
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:21,840
Sweet

410
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,439
Why don't you answer this call?

411
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,639
I'm cooking

412
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,639
I didn't hear

413
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,679
You can help me record the data

414
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,080
Where did that black leather notebook be placed

415
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,760
I've put it in the safe

416
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:31,399
I've searched

417
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,280
Not inside

418
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,439
Sorry Sorry

419
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,840
I might be leaving

420
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,199
Put it in your bag

421
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm scared

422
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,159
Just find it

423
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,000
Sorry Sorry

424
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:04,399
Little fu pour me a glass of water

425
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,599
good

426
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Just like that, Xiao Fu

427
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,439
Thank you

428
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,399
Goodbye

429
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,280
Goodbye Aunt Fu

430
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,040
It's so coincidental

431
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:56,840
morning

432
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,520
Haven't seen you for several days

433
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,639
What have you been busy with recently

434
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,679
You go first, I have something to take

435
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:11,879
No need to wait for you

436
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,280
No, no, you go

437
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,240
I'll have to have a while

438
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,840
Chief Executive Wang

439
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,359
I heard how many days will Liu Jun have

440
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,720
Didn't come to the test center

441
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:34,959
Has his experiment been completed?

442
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,599
You'll get to know you first

443
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,480
Neighbor again

444
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,919
Why do you ask me the opposite?

445
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,560
Don't mention it

446
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,958
I don't know either

447
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,560
Did you do something wrong?

448
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,919
This Liu Jun talked to me recently

449
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,480
It's like playing Tai Chi

450
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,599
No honest word after pushing

451
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,919
His entire series is still early

452
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,800
Just picked a model first

453
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:58,599
Samples

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,480
You asked in a timely manner

455
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,159
He just called

456
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,040
Say I want to borrow a CNC workshop

457
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,280
I've made an appointment with him

458
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,359
Meet tomorrow

459
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,159
Tomorrow will pass together

460
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,679
Check out his new products

461
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,399
No

462
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,320
Stop him from feeling

463
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,679
We're spying on him

464
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,119
Then General Manager Wang, I'll leave first

465
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,840
They're all here

466
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,720
All the drawings are in sight

467
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,240
How about it

468
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,240
Actually, it doesn't need to look closely

469
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,679
Just look at this drawing

470
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,119
You will know the tolerances marked

471
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:45,119
boss

472
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,480
Only ours

473
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,119
The old master machine tool has been removed

474
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:49,840
Can't make it

475
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,280
Products with such high accuracy

476
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,080
yes

477
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,760
Ajun told me too

478
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,159
Just the machines in our factory

479
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,359
Just produce a rough blank

480
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,119
Have to start

481
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:07,119
Only CNC machine tools can be used in the city

482
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,000
If this is the key process

483
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,599
If you have to be in the city

484
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,599
It's better to start with the blanking

485
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:13,800
Leave it to them

486
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,639
Save this luck

487
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,560
Also add joints

488
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,439
Yes or no

489
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:21,599
Master Huang

490
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,679
You see

491
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,520
Let the eldest son calculate and decide

492
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,879
Don't want this craft

493
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,119
Not designed yet

494
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,439
Our gang of irrelevant people

495
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:33,439
Let's get lively first

496
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,199
Yes

497
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,560
Talking nonsense

498
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:36,679
How can we be

499
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,679
What about the irrelevant people

500
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,159
No matter how much Ajun reads

501
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,040
He has no experience in the workshop

502
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,599
In the end, it depends on our elders

503
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,959
It's not for him to correct it

504
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,760
Sorry to be late

505
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,959
Just right

506
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,919
Neither late nor late

507
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,959
Are we looking at the drawings right now

508
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,159
Wait for you to arrange the process

509
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,679
All the uncles are masters

510
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,439
Today I want to invite everyone

511
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,439
Help me with your eyes

512
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:04,280
not good

513
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,480
It's hard to say it's an arrangement

514
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,359
Come to Uncle Huang

515
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,080
This is the process I just planned today

516
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:10,599
Come

517
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,039
Take a look at it all

518
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:13,639
If you have any comments

519
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,599
Can be raised

520
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:18,119
This Ajun is not really a literary and martial arts

521
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,720
Not only is it powerful in hand

522
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,158
This design process

523
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,399
There is nothing to say

524
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:22,919
That's

525
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,199
Doctoral studies in Germany

526
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,080
Different

527
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,520
I've always been very proud

528
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,439
Look at your fifth step

529
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,359
This knife continues

530
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,840
Six or seven cliffs (referring to millimeters)

531
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,080
What a knife? It's so powerful

532
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,280
I really made a mistake in design

533
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,760
I actually thought of cutting it out with one size fits

534
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:51,919
Six or seven cliffs (referring to millimeters)

535
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,240
Thank you Uncle Huang for your advice

536
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,399
I'll change it now

537
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,919
Dear masters

538
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,480
Look at our drawings

539
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,760
It's time to read it all

540
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,879
I need to understand the process

541
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,399
Next we start

542
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,760
How about taking samples

543
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,320
Then I'm going to Shanghai soon

544
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,199
Go to the order

545
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,199
Ajun has no experience

546
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,599
I'm still saying the same

547
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,919
What's going on in the factory next

548
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,560
Rely on everyone

549
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,480
Uncle Huang has poured you water

550
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:33,840
You come

551
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,159
I'm looking

552
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,080
This lathe is not CNC

553
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,040
Can't be coaxial

554
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:40,439
You have to be tired of Uncle Huang

555
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,439
Take action in person

556
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:44,520
I'll do it

557
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,399
It's worthy of being Uncle Huang

558
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,359
Fast and good craftsmanship

559
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,359
No one else has done this before

560
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,359
The young master also praised him in vain

561
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,639
Is this the truth?

562
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,320
Uncle Huang knows it in his heart

563
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,480
Uncle Huang

564
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,359
These samples

565
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,520
Can I finish it today in one day

566
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,879
It should be about the same

567
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,679
Are there any arrangements tomorrow

568
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:16,720
I will make an appointment with General Manager Wang from the first machine in the city tomorrow

569
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,639
Go to their CNC workshop for processing

570
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,240
Then I have to go with me

571
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,000
You want to go too

572
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,919
Of course I have to watch it

573
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,800
I'm doing well

574
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,959
Don't let him process it wrongly for me later

575
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,000
Hurry up

576
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,480
Must complete the task today

577
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,560
I know

578
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,639
Don't worry if you know

579
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,280
Koyanagi

580
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,599
Chief Executive Wang

581
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,639
This is Master Huang

582
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,720
Our factory's boss

583
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:58,560
Hello, Mr. Huang

584
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,439
Lucky Meeting

585
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:01,040
Recognize the name well-known for a long time

586
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,280
See you today

587
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,199
Uncle Huang, why are you like singing an opera

588
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,599
Your child doesn't understand

589
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,840
Mr. Wang is in the industry

590
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:07,840
But it's very famous

591
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:08,480
No, no

592
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,679
Chief Executive Wang

593
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,639
Look at things first

594
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,560
OK OK OK

595
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:26,560
Your idea of welding alloy

596
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,599
It's really good

597
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,560
The hardness of the finished product has increased a lot

598
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,760
What a pity one way

599
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,639
Not applicable to

600
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
All kits in the series

601
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,280
I have to change

602
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,319
Different alloy materials

603
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:38,280
and welding method

604
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:39,720
I can't be busy alone

605
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,000
Only one set of things

606
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,679
How long does this wear resistance last

607
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,000
Haven't done a test yet

608
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,280
It is estimated to be achieved

609
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:47,320
More than one year

610
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,760
It's really rare

611
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:51,679
Chief Executive Wang

612
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,080
Our factory has insufficient processing capacity

613
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,999
Finally, I have to hire an OEM

614
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,359
But my dad told me

615
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,439
The current environment

616
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,639
I'll be plagiarized soon

617
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,720
So I suggest you

618
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,679
The first batch of short and fast

619
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,639
Save a little bit larger and the price is appropriate

620
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,879
Try to be one-time

621
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,359
Recover the R&D costs

622
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,520
As for being imitated later

623
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,879
You may not be able to do anything now

624
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:27,240
From the beginning, I developed it myself

625
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,959
Mr. Lin already

626
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,520
Take multiple steps around me

627
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,959
I want to be the first to imitate me

628
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,199
It's your city

629
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,280
A wise man doesn't say something secretly

630
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,000
Mr. Lin in advance

631
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,119
It's indeed a task on me

632
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:50,959
But we experts all know

633
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:53,159
You just need this last process

634
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,240
Pinch it tightly

635
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,599
No one can do anything to you

636
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,800
He just wants to copy

637
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,639
It also takes a lot of money to copy

638
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,080
But I can't figure it out

639
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,280
Just like Mr. Lin,

640
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,959
Stealing other people's knowledge and labor

641
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,438
Wouldn't he feel immoral?

642
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,478
If everyone wants to take a shortcut

643
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,079
If you don't want to develop independently

644
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:16,879
That's our country's

645
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,518
Where is the future of manufacturing

646
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,438
The current situation

647
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,639
Someone needs to find a way to turn it around

648
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,320
Isn't it

649
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:25,120
Why we

650
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,719
Can't do this together

651
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:47,719
Koyanagi

652
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:50,518
I appreciate your idealism

653
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,518
But so idealistic

654
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,239
I can't do it now

655
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,918
What I can do

656
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:58,720
Just try your best to

657
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,800
Help you go further and better

658
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,039
Do you understand

659
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,559
Thank you Director Liu for your hard work

660
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:13,479
Such weather

661
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:14,479
Go out to run the order

662
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,200
Thank you for your hard work

663
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,200
No hard work or hard work

664
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,559
Do business

665
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,519
How can I care about anything

666
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,600
It's windy and rainy

667
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:20,919
This has been spoken

668
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,760
Get the knife

669
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,280
Don't we do business too

670
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:24,760
I'll tell you

671
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,919
Once I was in Jiangxi

672
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,359
Catch the hail

673
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,559
I got beaten two big bags in the head

674
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,600
etc.

675
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
I remember our supply department

676
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:33,840
It should be the second floor

677
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,079
How to change the place

678
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,840
You're here to contact us this time

679
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,160
Isn't it an RF series?

680
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,120
We have to go up to the third floor

681
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,120
Foreign Investment Procurement Office

682
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,559
Vice President Liu personally receives you

683
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:43,399
Please

684
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,120
Walk

685
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,399
This product

686
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,879
Of course our company needs it

687
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,280
but

688
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:58,160
Parameters and accuracy on this data

689
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Can you do it

690
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:00,879
I'll tell you Mr. Liu

691
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,999
My son is very good

692
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,039
He returned from studying in Germany

693
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,879
Doctor of Mechanics

694
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:07,519
This thing

695
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,079
He has been experimenting repeatedly

696
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,959
Argument

697
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:10,800
Design made

698
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:11,840
Absolutely no problem

699
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:12,600
You believe me

700
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:14,800
Did you bring that kind of product?

701
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,280
Preparing

702
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,919
Will come out in a few days

703
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,680
good

704
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,280
Director Liu

705
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,320
What about high-end accessories like this

706
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,200
Can't follow

707
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,519
The old process has passed

708
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,079
right

709
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,200
You must bring the sample first

710
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,720
Wait for approval

711
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,200
Our quality inspection department's inspection

712
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:36,240
Only then can we continue to negotiate the contract

713
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,398
I promise to come next time

714
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:39,160
I'll bring the sample here

715
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,359
Some equipment in this workshop

716
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,399
Requirements for dust and shockproof

717
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:49,200
Very high

718
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:51,640
Even the ventilation ducts of the factory

719
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,760
All have special designs

720
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:55,240
Uncle Huang, look

721
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,200
These machine tools

722
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,840
Its bottom base

723
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,200
All have been treated specially

724
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,600
Otherwise

725
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:03,720
Even the vibration of the flatbed car passing by

726
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,640
It will deviate from its accuracy

727
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:09,959
Working in such a place

728
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,039
I definitely don't dare to throw the finished product around

729
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,280
The bonding of the solder joint is very strong

730
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:47,399
How to do this

731
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,640
Is it a new process?

732
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,800
This has something to do with the material

733
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:51,680
You'll tell me specifically

734
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:52,680
Chief Executive Wang

735
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,879
You see, you are an expert in this area

736
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,439
I have always respected you very much

737
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,439
But some things ask this

738
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,559
Not suitable

739
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,160
Sorry Sorry

740
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:06,039
Old Master Huang is right

741
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,479
I shouldn't have asked so deeply

742
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,240
Come

743
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,800
The ratio of the material of Xiaoliu

744
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:14,680
I'll see

745
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,640
Few people can understand it in one game in the city

746
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,439
You don't have to worry too much about being plagiarized

747
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:21,240
Chief Executive Wang

748
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:23,720
You're busy

749
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
I've looked at it

750
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,359
Workers in this workshop

751
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,559
Most of them are only in their twenties

752
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
The accuracy of this workshop

753
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,760
Depends on the equipment

754
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,840
As long as it is strictly followed

755
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:47,840
If it is standard operation

756
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,399
No need to be a master and apprentice for many years

757
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:50,280
Can also be made

758
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,879
Ultra-high precision products

759
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,359
Uncle Huang

760
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,079
Not all products

761
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,240
All can be used in CNC

762
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:07,760
Your craftsmanship and experience

763
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:09,320
It's still the treasure in our factory

764
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,359
My former cooper's master

765
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,320
When the scenery is

766
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,640
Everyone breaks their heads

767
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,919
Want to be his apprentice

768
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,399
Later, there was an enamel bucket

769
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,640
Fewer people are looking for him

770
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,399
Later

771
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,640
Everyone uses plastic buckets

772
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,800
No one wants his craft

773
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,240
We're old

774
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,079
Outdated

775
00:39:58,519 --> 00:39:59,240
Uncle Huang

776
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,439
I think you shouldn't be too pessimistic

777
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,999
Not all this is true

778
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,959
Ah Jun

779
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,640
Uncle Huang is not complaining

780
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,399
Uncle Huang just wants to say

781
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,079
You're on the right path

782
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,959
Our older generation

783
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:16,800
Can't refuse to admit it

784
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:17,959
I'm already behind

785
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,320
Advance the future of the factory

786
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,039
It depends on your own

787
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,600
Your tie is too ugly

788
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:46,519
I'll do it for you and I'll do it for you

789
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,200
I'll do it for you

790
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:47,999
You don't understand

791
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,200
This is popular in Germany

792
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:51,320
This is too rustic for China

793
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:52,720
Come on, I'll do it for you

794
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,120
Block my mirror

795
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,240
Director Liu arrived

796
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,519
Here

797
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,919
Come well

798
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,399
Here

799
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,399
Stop moving

800
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,640
Mr. Liu, please read

801
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,959
Mr. Liu

802
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,079
This is all independently developed

803
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:20,280
The overall investment is more than 2 million

804
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,399
right

805
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,439
Is the hardness clear?

806
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,600
Not only is hard

807
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,600
High temperature and corrosion resistance test

808
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,559
No problem, either

809
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:37,959
This is the test report we did

810
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:47,399
Not bad

811
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:49,359
Your performance

812
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:51,200
Better than what I originally set

813
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,640
I really only invested two million

814
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,800
Actually less than one and a half million

815
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,999
It's less than one and a half million

816
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,120
Then I might remember it wrong

817
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,240
Still honest, the guy

818
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:21,200
Ajun, I'll tell you

819
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:22,959
No matter who you talk to about business in the future

820
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,600
You care about technical matters

821
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,680
I'll do other things

822
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,840
dad

823
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,559
It's impossible for people to remember

824
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,800
All of my own lies

825
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,240
What's more, your lies

826
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
All are now edited

827
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,680
If someone asks a few more times

828
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,039
You must have exposed your feet

829
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,760
You might as well start

830
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,120
Tell the truth honestly

831
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,320
This way there will be no burden in your heart

832
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:40,519
What do you know

833
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,519
Who tells the truth in business

834
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,079
Anyway, do you know what I know

835
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,760
Dad, is this your thing?

836
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:48,320
Dad, please

837
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,039
OK

838
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:51,840
I'll get a small book in the future

839
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,399
Remember all your lies

840
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,840
You will definitely not forget this

841
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,399
You boy you

842
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:57,720
I'm here

843
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,479
Manager Qin
