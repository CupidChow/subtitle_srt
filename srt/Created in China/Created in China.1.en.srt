1
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,879
Hong Kong stocks have long been unsuccessful

2
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,999
Dow Jones in one day

3
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:58,999
It fell by more than 500 points

4
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,559
Wouldn't you cheat me if you let me rush now

5
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,559
Do you miss me

6
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,200
Think about it

7
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,039
Walk

8
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,120
I'll find a car to Donghai now

9
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,478
right

10
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,080
I'll go directly to the hospital

11
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,960
Not sure about the specific situation

12
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,960
Just now, the phone number at home

13
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,039
With dad's cell phone

14
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,559
No one answered

15
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,640
I've modified the design drawing

16
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,520
You guys arranged as I did

17
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,120
Just go through the trial process

18
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,240
OK Goodbye

19
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,200
I only have one hundred mark

20
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,520
One hundred and fifty marks go to the East China Sea

21
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,840
Leave now if you don't have a carpool

22
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:05,920
I'm Chinese too

23
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,719
Although there is no RMB

24
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,559
You can't cheat me

25
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,640
There is absolutely no pitfall

26
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,520
One hundred and two

27
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,159
Give me one hundred and twenty marks

28
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,039
Just not many

29
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,478
Fair Price

30
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,599
I'll definitely not cheat you, okay

31
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,920
I said only one hundred marks

32
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:15,879
No more

33
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,519
Now Santana costs two yuan per kilometer

34
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:18,920
My brand new rich

35
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,478
One hundred and fifty marks cost-effective

36
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,800
Qian Hongming

37
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,359
Come back

38
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,319
Why are you here

39
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,200
Come and pick you up

40
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,960
I'm on a business trip in Shanghai today

41
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,080
Just know you're back

42
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,200
Just thinking about taking you back on the way

43
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,840
I really didn't expect

44
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,039
The first person I met after returning home

45
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,799
It's you

46
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,560
That's it

47
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,679
I saw one

48
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,320
An enemy who has not been in contact for six years

49
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,320
not bad

50
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:08,479
Can you recognize me

51
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:09,560
Come

52
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,719
Shouldn't I come?

53
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,960
That's not what I mean

54
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,159
I shouldn't have hit you back then

55
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,599
I know that has nothing to do with you

56
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,679
I've wanted to apologize to you

57
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,239
It's said it was back then

58
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,320
Don't mention it again

59
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:31,719
Let's go

60
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,119
How is my dad going

61
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,320
Still rescued

62
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,640
I just heard

63
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know the specific situation either

64
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:47,279
Back from abroad

65
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,000
This habit is really good

66
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,560
Give

67
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,159
Thanks

68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,079
You gave this tape to me

69
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,560
I didn't expect you to stay

70
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,000
What are you doing right now

71
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:31,960
How do you make computer professional

72
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,760
Lost

73
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,719
I can't compete with you

74
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
In front of livelihood

75
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,359
Nothing can do anything to care about

76
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,840
Bread in the back seat

77
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,000
If you're hungry, eat something

78
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Time difference after eating and sleeping

79
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,159
Didn't you go to the hospital

80
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,440
Why did you turn the corner

81
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,159
Haven't come back for so long

82
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,279
I know the way

83
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,320
That road just now

84
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,919
Go straight is my dad's forward factory

85
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,279
Where I grew up

86
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,640
How could it be that I didn't know

87
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,479
The road just now

88
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
There was a period of cultivation

89
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,239
I won't go with you anymore

90
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:13,560
Thanks

91
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,359
Slower

92
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,000
Aunt

93
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,999
Ah Jun

94
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,239
You're back

95
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,840
Come back

96
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,800
Look at your dad

97
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,599
Almost couldn't see him

98
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,200
dad

99
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,239
Dad, I'm back

100
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm back, you wake up

101
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,080
dad

102
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:34,320
Ah Jun

103
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
The doctor said

104
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,119
Your dad is temporarily stable

105
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,200
No life is in danger

106
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,280
But

107
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,800
The emergency room I entered yesterday

108
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,359
Until now

109
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,280
He's been in a coma like this

110
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,479
When will you wake up

111
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,280
Are there any sequelae

112
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,599
neither knows

113
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,519
Aunt

114
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:08,599
My dad is only in his fifties

115
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,040
Usually in good health

116
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,599
Why did you suddenly have a stroke

117
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,399
Not because of the broken factory

118
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,920
Ah Jun

119
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,960
Your dad's one goes to the factory

120
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,320
Maybe I can't hold on anymore

121
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:54,320
Mom, I'm back

122
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,800
Come in and help

123
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,680
Come here Come here

124
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,160
I'll come I'll come

125
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,800
Help me lift it

126
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,160
Put it

127
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,800
It's always raining lately

128
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,239
It doesn't matter if it's sun

129
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,800
I'll wear it if I'll urinate

130
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,519
Now there seems to be a kind

131
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,879
Adult Diapers

132
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,759
Out of Japan

133
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,359
I'll buy it tomorrow

134
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:44,160
Forget it's too expensive

135
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,119
Sister, don't save that much

136
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:48,719
Time is also money

137
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,280
I'm fine

138
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:52,639
You can help me later

139
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,879
Take out the oil

140
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,960
Just roast it

141
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:03,879
Received someone

142
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,479
Liu Jun saw you

143
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,399
well enough

144
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,320
When I saw him

145
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,200
More or less in my heart

146
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,719
I want to show off to him

147
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,080
Want him to see

148
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,879
I'm doing well now

149
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,759
Become a manager and get on the bus

150
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,960
No longer the same

151
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,160
Need to curry favor with their Liu family

152
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,119
Qian Hongming

153
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,879
His dad is still lying in the hospital

154
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:42,759
Haven't woken up

155
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,040
I am afraid

156
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,999
I haven't noticed what you said

157
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,560
It's indeed

158
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,359
As soon as I saw him I understood

159
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
Even if there is no such trouble

160
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,560
These things

161
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,320
Not in his eyes

162
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,280
They are not like me

163
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,920
A full of vulgar ideas

164
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,680
Family conditions

165
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,080
Growth environment

166
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:10,359
Different

167
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,320
Not so good

168
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,479
You've been holding your breath all these years

169
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,080
Always working hard

170
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,680
I don't think you are worse than Liu Jun

171
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,759
Don't think you are vulgar

172
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,519
Are these workers who are in the factory

173
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,160
Stay here to listen to the news

174
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,560
Aunt

175
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,639
Then you just said

176
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,560
They've been in more than two months

177
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,719
No salary paid

178
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,639
What exactly is it?

179
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,999
I really don't understand what's happening in the factory

180
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,160
Anyway, I just heard of something

181
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,399
There is something wrong with the turnover

182
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,399
Someone is asking for a bill

183
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,879
Since the situation is so bad

184
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,800
Why didn't my dad tell me earlier

185
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,680
Your dad's thoughts

186
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,200
Can you still not know

187
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,719
actually

188
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,599
He is looking forward to you coming back every day

189
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,599
But he is afraid

190
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,519
I'm afraid you'll want you to come back

191
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,359
It's to let you take over

192
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,359
Aunt

193
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm here tonight

194
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:36,680
You go back and take a break

195
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,999
fine

196
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,359
Your dad has one there

197
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,840
Being a nanny for several years

198
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:42,440
Hands and feet are pretty neat

199
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,999
I won't be too tired when I take shifts with her

200
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,440
It's you

201
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,320
The plane has been on for so long

202
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:50,680
Must be very tired

203
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,680
You go back first

204
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,599
I'm OK

205
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,519
Hongming went to Shanghai to pick me up

206
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,680
I slept for more than two hours on the road

207
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,399
Did Qian Hongming pick you up?

208
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:01,639
yes

209
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,119
Did you tell him that you are back

210
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,680
No, I thought it was you

211
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,160
He probably happened to hear it

212
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,999
The East China Sea is so big

213
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,560
This kid

214
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,320
Must be unhappy

215
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,239
He knows your dad's current situation

216
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,119
Don't know it yet

217
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,759
How gloating are you

218
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,239
That's what happened to the factory

219
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:41,280
You haven't mentioned it to Liu Jun along the way

220
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:44,879
I haven't cared about it

221
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,160
Liushitang's factory

222
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,879
If Liu Jun asks about the specific details

223
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,960
I can't explain clearly, either

224
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:56,160
Since you are still friends

225
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,599
You still need it

226
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,080
For the past

227
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,560
Do you hold grudge against Liushitang?

228
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,879
That's his dad after all

229
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,080
I can still be friends with Liu Jun

230
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,599
That's because Liu Jun is also innocent.

231
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,080
He is also a victim

232
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,879
As for Liushitang

233
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:12,999
In the eyes of people like him

234
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,879
Only transactions only depend on benefits

235
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,280
He can end this day

236
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,519
It's entirely his own fault

237
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,680
No matter what you say

238
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,479
Medical expenses for parents

239
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,200
Your tuition fee

240
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,399
I borrowed it from him

241
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,320
Debt for more than ten years

242
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,599
Even if the money can be paid back

243
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,280
What about human debt

244
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:38,200
sister

245
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:39,999
You're going to be debted by this favor

246
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Kidnapping for a lifetime

247
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:43,040
Liu Shitang lent you money at that time

248
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:43,960
What's his idea

249
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,080
Don't you know

250
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,560
The rumors over the years

251
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,399
You can't get promoted

252
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,680
Can't get married

253
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,959
Has he come out to explain it to you?

254
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,320
No matter what it is

255
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,200
In the eyes of others

256
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,800
I just spent his money

257
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,920
The relationship has long been unclear

258
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,479
He's just explaining

259
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,079
Someone has to believe it

260
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,200
I don't believe it

261
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,079
She was trying hard to stick to your dad back then

262
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,200
I'm so angry that your mother

263
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,920
Aunt

264
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,040
It's been so many years

265
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,079
Why are you still taking responsibility

266
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,398
Push it on Qian Hongying

267
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:19,398
If what happened in the year

268
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,358
My dad and my mom sooner

269
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,480
Let's say it clearly

270
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:22,720
They won't have conflicts

271
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:23,720
For so many years

272
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,358
My mom won't get that disease

273
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,480
It is mainly responsible

274
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,119
Still my dad

275
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,520
Ah Jun

276
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,119
No matter how much you blame your dad

277
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,359
Wait for him to wake up

278
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:44,119
Don't say that

279
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:49,919
I know

280
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,720
I'm afraid you don't bring enough things

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Give you some daily necessities

282
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,560
Thanks

283
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:24,399
I guess that road

284
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,119
Not repairing

285
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:32,760
Qianjin factory closed down

286
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,840
I'm afraid of passing by the door

287
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,560
What do you ask me

288
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,800
I can't answer

289
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,800
Just think about getting around first

290
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,480
Your aunt is a family member after all

291
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,280
Is there anything she wants to tell you

292
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,959
Always clearer than I said

293
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,399
She said a lot

294
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,040
Unfortunately, I didn't say it to the point

295
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,159
I'll pick you up tomorrow

296
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,439
Go to the factory and have a look

297
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,000
That's really trouble you

298
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,119
yes

299
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,560
It's really troublesome

300
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,760
Then I won't go

301
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:15,439
Is anyone

302
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,118
Is anyone

303
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:18,520
What are you doing

304
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:21,399
Uncle Zhang

305
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,560
It's me, it's me

306
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,320
Where is it Liu Jun

307
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,919
When did you come back

308
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,720
I just came back yesterday

309
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,359
Uncle Zhang, please help me open the door

310
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,240
I want to go in and take a look

311
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:32,480
well

312
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,359
I'll get you the key

313
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,119
OK OK OK

314
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,119
How is Director Liu

315
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,199
Is he okay

316
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,159
The doctor said it still needs to be observed

317
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Stay in the hospital for a few more days

318
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,520
I want to go into the workshop again

319
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,520
Give me the key

320
00:20:59,119 --> 00:20:59,720
Give

321
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:00,720
Thank you Uncle Zhang

322
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:01,720
Go

323
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,399
What are you doing

324
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,359
Digging out childhood memories

325
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,399
I'm looking for such a big factory

326
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,520
Reasons for shutdown

327
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,280
Not solving this problem

328
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,639
Even if my dad wakes up

329
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:58,639
I'm afraid it's difficult to recover

330
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,439
Manufacturing workshops in Germany

331
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,159
The floor should be smooth painted

332
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,119
Different products

333
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,399
Can't generalize

334
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:15,720
No

335
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,480
This is actually a matter of attitude

336
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,480
Look at this saddle lathe

337
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,119
It's pretty good on the surface

338
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,399
In fact, the oil leak is serious

339
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:28,199
So thick

340
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:29,840
Not to mention the impact on accuracy

341
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,159
You can still see

342
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,439
Regular management cares about the head and feet

343
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,560
The equipment cannot be managed

344
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,439
Factory products

345
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,639
How good can it be

346
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,480
Must be a sloppy

347
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,720
Then you can't

348
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,320
For manufacturers of screws

349
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,199
and the manufacturer of spacecraft

350
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,679
Make the same request

351
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,119
Manufacturing industry can only have different standards

352
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,919
Can't have different attitudes

353
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,480
You're just talking about ideas

354
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,199
Business in business

355
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,919
Only pursue profit

356
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:02,639
If the market generally requires

357
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,520
Negative tolerance

358
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,399
Short scale

359
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:05,639
cheap

360
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,879
Then are you chasing the market

361
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,800
Or pursue the concept

362
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,439
yes

363
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,159
Adhere to the philosophy

364
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:21,560
It's already very luxurious

365
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,560
It's hard to do it yourself

366
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,080
It's even more impossible to force others

367
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,919
Shanghai has built an overpass

368
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,879
Urban construction is undergoing

369
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,439
Rapid development with each passing day

370
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,800
But these are the ones in the factory

371
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,560
Machine Tool Equipment

372
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,800
It's exactly the same as when I was a kid

373
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,520
No change

374
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:47,879
How could it be alive

375
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,359
What's wrong

376
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,080
What are you doing

377
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,840
You are Director Liu's son

378
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,639
I am Liu Jun Who are you

379
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,639
Admit it was his son

380
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,760
This is easy to deal with

381
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,000
Your dad hid in the hospital every day

382
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,119
We are honest people

383
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,879
We know that kind of place

384
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,240
It's not good to watch if it's very loud

385
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,000
So we can only come to you

386
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,639
Who are you

387
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,520
Why do I

388
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,599
I don't know you at all, okay

389
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,840
Don't know me

390
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:31,679
I can know you

391
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,639
Senior engineer in Germany

392
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:34,840
Great Doctor

393
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:37,879
Your dad keeps you on his lips every day

394
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,280
Since they are already so awesome

395
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,520
You shouldn't be lying to the account

396
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:42,119
Black and white letters

397
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,560
The pig iron ordered with me

398
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,280
He said he didn't want it, so he didn't want it

399
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:46,480
The factory cannot be started

400
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,560
That's your business

401
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,480
I can't bear the losses from stocking

402
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,879
good

403
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,159
Today we won't say anything

404
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,159
You can't give me a penalties less

405
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,840
Twenty thousand yuan

406
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,040
I'll leave if I take the money

407
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
You say 20,000 is 20,000?

408
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,879
Nothing that simple

409
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,639
Who signed the contract

410
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,280
Did he sign it

411
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,599
What's going on

412
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:10,760
What are you going to do

413
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,080
Pull him away

414
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,959
What do you do

415
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,679
Liu Jun run quickly

416
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:15,560
Run away

417
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,280
Let's go

418
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:16,840
stop

419
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:17,560
Walk

420
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:20,720
stop

421
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,520
Hiroaki, a fast run and a fast run

422
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,159
Let's go

423
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,040
stop

424
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,159
Here Here Here Here

425
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,000
Ah Jun

426
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,439
Uncle Xu Uncle Xu

427
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,000
Block back and block back

428
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,959
What to do

429
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,760
What are you doing

430
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:43,639
Don't move

431
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:44,800
release

432
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,199
You let go

433
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,720
Pay or fight

434
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,159
All bosses

435
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,000
I know you're anxious

436
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:53,760
but

437
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,679
You said we've been doing business for so long

438
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,359
Have to leave a little affection

439
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,000
Yes or no

440
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,280
This factory has not collapsed

441
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,080
Everything is easy to negotiate

442
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,720
What to discuss?

443
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,760
He is young and ignorant

444
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,240
Don't you know

445
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,199
You touch your conscience and say something

446
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,919
Should I ask for this money?

447
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,240
Xiao Liu just came back from abroad

448
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:13,480
Should this be

449
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,639
I have to wait for Director Liu

450
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,040
Let's talk about it after you wake up

451
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,560
I've been waiting for half a month

452
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,080
A lot of people in the factory

453
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,119
Wait for the rice to be put into the pot

454
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,040
I won't ask him

455
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,639
A large group of people ask me for it

456
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:24,320
His dad

457
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,359
Have money to support my son to go to school abroad

458
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,359
Don't you have money to pay back the 20,000 yuan

459
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:30,959
All bosses

460
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:32,760
In theory

461
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,159
I'm not involved in my dad's business

462
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,679
This debt dispute has nothing to do with me

463
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
But but

464
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:43,000
Morally responsible

465
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,119
I'm willing to take this responsibility for my dad

466
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,639
But I just flew back yesterday

467
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,000
Don't know anything

468
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,760
If it were you, the boss

469
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:54,520
No one can ask you for money

470
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,320
You give it all

471
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:56,280
Then you say

472
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:57,919
what to do

473
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,040
Give me two days

474
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,280
I'll get a good idea of the situation

475
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,159
As long as it is a legal payment request

476
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,840
I'll do my best to find a way

477
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:08,639
Is it OK

478
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:16,720
Little Liu

479
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,159
Empty white teeth

480
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,959
Say it nice

481
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
We can do it anyone

482
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,119
Why should I believe you

483
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:25,919
that

484
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:26,359
I am

485
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,560
Xiangtong Machinery Import and Export Company

486
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Manager Qian Hongming

487
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,439
Have you heard of our company

488
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,439
All bosses

489
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,359
Have never heard of it

490
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,320
State-owned

491
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,040
This is my work permit

492
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,080
Let's go to the factory

493
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,760
It is a year-round cooperative relationship

494
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,560
What Liu Jun said just now

495
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,679
We can make a guarantee

496
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:52,959
Manager Qian

497
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,679
Lucky meeting

498
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:58,359
This sentence

499
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,280
All are quite civilized

500
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,560
Two days

501
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,359
Just two days

502
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,199
Not given

503
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,080
I'm here to find you

504
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,480
Uncle Xu

505
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,840
Thanks to you

506
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,040
Otherwise we have to suffer a little

507
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,599
Ah Jun

508
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,760
Don't blame this boss for coming to you

509
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,879
We're all here to find you, too

510
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:34,800
Factory

511
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,639
Haven't paid for more than two months

512
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,320
You see, you're back now

513
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,760
You give me an idea

514
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,760
Uncle Xu, I want to know

515
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,520
Why can't the factory start work?

516
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,760
This casting list

517
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,240
Your dad didn't come up in one breath

518
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,480
Got to the hospital

519
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,639
Come and drink water

520
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,959
Thank you Uncle Xu

521
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:04,720
Uncle Xu

522
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,439
Isn't this a big order?

523
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:07,560
Why not hurry up on production

524
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,439
Instead, it stopped work at a critical moment

525
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:16,080
It's a big list indeed

526
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,199
High profit

527
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,439
Just make it

528
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:19,800
At least it can be given to this factory

529
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:21,040
Continue the life of the first half of the year

530
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,080
so what

531
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,959
Your dad was greedy for a moment

532
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,159
Knowing the customer

533
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,720
High construction period required

534
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,599
Still don't care about it

535
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,080
Just sign it

536
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:33,000
Then what

537
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Signing too fast

538
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,840
When the final product is proofed

539
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:39,679
Only found out

540
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,999
The number of stomata and trachoma

541
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,280
Can't drop down

542
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,199
Everyone is trying to do all kinds of tricks

543
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,199
Nothing works

544
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:47,679
As soon as the test results come out

545
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,080
Your dad can't stand the stimulation

546
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,599
I fell down after a stroke

547
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:57,760
how so

548
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:00,959
Ah Jun

549
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:03,280
All bosses

550
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,520
And the salary you owe

551
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,800
At most, your family will make up their savings

552
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Selling shops

553
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,879
Can deal with it anyway

554
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,639
This list

555
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,800
This order

556
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,000
The construction period will be next month

557
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,520
Once the delivery cannot be delivered

558
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,560
Your dad is going to spend his entire life

559
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:24,800
All compensation

560
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:26,919
It may not be filled with this pit

561
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:28,679
Is it really that serious

562
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,080
Is bankruptcy liquidation not OK?

563
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,760
How do you ask me to answer this

564
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:36,359
No one has calculated it carefully

565
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:37,639
I'll know

566
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,080
This contract amount is so scary

567
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,879
Don't mention the factory's operation is difficult now

568
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,480
It's when it's done well

569
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,879
I can't help but flip through such a big car

570
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,080
Uncle Xu

571
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,720
I want to keep this drawing first

572
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,679
Take a closer look

573
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,919
Leave me a phone number

574
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,359
If I have something to do

575
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,919
I'll definitely have to contact you again

576
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,520
I have a pager and I have something to call me

577
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:00,280
Must-time

578
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,240
Go back to the hospital

579
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,000
Do you know where is nearby

580
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,280
Do you want to play international long distances?

581
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,399
Let's go

582
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,639
I'll take you to one

583
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,919
You can play in the East China Sea

584
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,199
International long distance places

585
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,159
Want something to eat

586
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:22,879
have no idea

587
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,879
There is a new restaurant

588
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:26,679
I'll take you to taste

589
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,760
OK

590
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:28,199
Walk

591
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,679
yes

592
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:44,040
I didn't expect

593
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,560
There will be technical problems

594
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,560
good

595
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,919
Test the data running by software

596
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,119
Send it to me as soon as possible

597
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,359
OK OK

598
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:03,840
Thanks

599
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,080
Finished

600
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,199
Finished

601
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:16,879
Can you handle it

602
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,080
I asked my German assistant

603
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,199
Run the data with software

604
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,639
Discover this mold design

605
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,359
There is indeed a problem

606
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,320
The pouring temperature needs to be adjusted

607
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:28,679
But go to the factory

608
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,840
It won't be impossible to do it

609
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:32,320
Didn't Uncle Xu say that

610
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,959
Is it a problem with your craft?

611
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,760
It's because of the intricacies of craftsmanship

612
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,119
So the mold needs to be modified

613
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:38,720
Adjust the temperature

614
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,359
Can't understand

615
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,840
Have eaten

616
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,840
Have eaten

617
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:46,840
Come

618
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:48,919
Put it in

619
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,320
I'm really troubled you today

620
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,159
You can send me home in a while

621
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:56,240
Today my aunt is on night

622
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:58,359
I want to go home to clarify my thoughts

623
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
You can meet two groups of people in the factory

624
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,599
I don't think your house is quiet either

625
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,359
Go to my place

626
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:07,760
Is it convenient

627
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,879
inconvenient

628
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,039
When did you get married?

629
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,399
My college classmate last year

630
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,359
This community

631
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,120
It is the dormitory of the Port Authority

632
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,159
Catched up with the first batch of house renovations

633
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,639
I've found someone

634
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,518
According to internal cost price

635
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,359
Bought it

636
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,800
A square meter is less than a thousand dollars

637
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,679
The current housing unit

638
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,760
Can I buy and sell it too

639
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,359
Is housing commercialization

640
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:42,719
It has been released since 1995

641
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,879
You're among our classmates

642
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,760
The first one to buy a house

643
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:51,998
There are quite a few who have divided the rooms

644
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,760
I'm indeed the first one to buy a house

645
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:57,959
Come and have a look

646
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,720
See how our yard is like

647
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,439
Not ours, either

648
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,959
It's everyone's

649
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,079
only

650
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,919
Our family grows more things

651
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,039
Also bring a sky garden

652
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,039
How about it

653
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:11,720
Not bad

654
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,519
It doesn't seem to be your aesthetic

655
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,760
You have vision

656
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:18,359
My wife learned design

657
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,919
These are here

658
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:21,959
This is all her work

659
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,959
And this sun room

660
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:25,479
Do you think this looks like this

661
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,680
Monet's Garden

662
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,919
Come on, you have no water

663
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,359
Still so good at talking

664
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:34,999
Jiali

665
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:36,200
Jiali

666
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,039
Come back

667
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,399
Come on come on

668
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,439
I'll introduce it to you.

669
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:40,039
Hello

670
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,640
Shen Jiali, my lover

671
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:43,439
Jiali is Liu Jun

672
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,079
Hello Hello Hello

673
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,800
Hello

674
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,240
Sorry to cause trouble for you

675
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,039
Don't be kind or not

676
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,640
Hongming often mentions you to me

677
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:52,680
He said you are old classmates

678
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,840
Yes Yes Yes

679
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,399
He and I went from elementary school to high school

680
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:56,280
All are classmates

681
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm also

682
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,439
Your best friend

683
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,519
It's considered yes

684
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,879
Come into the house quickly

685
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:02,760
Please enter

686
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:03,879
Bring it to you

687
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:06,280
Looks like my house is quite small

688
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:07,559
Fried chicken

689
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,999
It's really good

690
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,280
Come to stay in this room

691
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,840
Don't keep it off, I'm still watching

692
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,760
What are you looking at? You're asleep

693
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,359
Get up and go back to sleep

694
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,439
There's still this show

695
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,800
You see you're sleepy

696
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,800
Get up quickly

697
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,200
Go to bed quickly

698
00:37:01,078 --> 00:37:02,559
My simulation data hasn't finished yet

699
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,120
You just turned off the computer

700
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,640
Go to bed first and get up tomorrow before doing it

701
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,519
Good night

702
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:23,959
He is your rival?

703
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,559
You said Liu Jun

704
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,160
What are you saying without any brainstorms

705
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:37,720
I guess it was when you two were in school

706
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,439
I liked the same girl

707
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:41,039
Afterwards broke up

708
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,439
Nothing is that complicated

709
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,840
Then why did you suddenly have extra

710
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:47,760
Best friend

711
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,320
I've never heard you mention him

712
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,240
There must be a problem here

713
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,359
Not suddenly

714
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:04,640
We both used to

715
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,200
Really best friend

716
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:08,800
As for why not mention him

717
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,399
If you are a good friend and you

718
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,359
There was a conflict before

719
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,039
Then he left

720
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,120
Haven't contacted for six years

721
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,600
Do you mention her to me often

722
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,039
That probably won't

723
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,200
Then between you

724
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:37,600
What's the contradiction

725
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,439
Not between us

726
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,840
It's between our two families

727
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,079
There are some contradictions

728
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:29,240
Help

729
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,240
This time it really saved my life

730
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,439
I said to be a grandpa

731
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,359
This is only one day

732
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:35,720
How did you get it out

733
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:37,120
I modified the mold

734
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:38,680
It made up for design

735
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Let colleagues abroad

736
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:40,919
Simulated with software

737
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,919
All results meet the requirements of Party A

738
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:46,519
And my process

739
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:47,559
Adjustments have also been made

740
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,600
Uncle Xu, take a look

741
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,320
Can we start construction

742
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:54,840
sharp

743
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,399
This is definitely no problem

744
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,439
I'll call now

745
00:40:57,479 --> 00:40:58,079
Call them all

746
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,680
Work quickly

747
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,559
Uncle Xu wait a moment

748
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:02,280
I want to ask our factory now

749
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:03,919
Who is in charge of technology

750
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,160
Me

751
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,519
There are also some Lao Huang and the others

752
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:09,959
You know them all

753
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,879
I've been with your dad for many years

754
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:12,760
Our craftsmanship

755
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:14,079
There must be no problem

756
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:17,280
I'm not talking about technology

757
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:19,399
I mean design

758
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,320
Who is in charge of the design

759
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:22,680
design

760
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,079
What to design

761
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:29,359
For example, the current situation

762
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:31,359
Stomatal trachoma does not meet the standard

763
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,280
That requires modification of the process

764
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,240
To achieve the goal

765
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:35,959
This is already abroad

766
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,479
Very mature process

767
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,160
So our factory

768
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,120
No supervisor in this regard

769
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,999
Technicians

770
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,720
The eldest son

771
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:46,919
Otherwise, you are a PhD

772
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:47,999
Your two tricks

773
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,359
We are the whole factory tied together

774
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:50,359
Can't beat you

775
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:52,320
And the one you said

776
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,959
Software simulation

777
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,919
I've only heard of it in the past two years

778
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,120
Haven't seen it before

779
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,680
We have always been to the factory

780
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:01,320
Come to the picture processing

781
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,320
What is the design drawing

782
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,919
What we do

783
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,439
Still so

784
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:13,240
Hello

785
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:16,359
Yes, right beside me

786
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,959
Your phone number

787
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,519
Hello

788
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,039
woke up

789
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,160
Your dad is awake
