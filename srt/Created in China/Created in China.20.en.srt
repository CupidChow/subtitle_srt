1
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,079
Liu Jun

2
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,878
uncle

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,280
From your report

4
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:48,719
Sit and sit

5
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,319
Because of organic lesions

6
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,359
This caused

7
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,840
Possibility of increased blood pressure

8
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,200
Can be ruled out

9
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm sure it might be

10
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,319
Excessive work pressure

11
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,079
Failure to combine work and rest

12
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,040
So I suggest

13
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,079
The current pace of life should be changed

14
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,680
Try to arrange time to rest

15
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Don't always think about work

16
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:11,759
Work is not a day or two

17
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,800
Just do it

18
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:13,639
yes

19
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,478
Should be out to play

20
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,919
Go out to play

21
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:16,759
Yes Yes Yes

22
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,719
You young people have good health

23
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,560
As long as you can notice these points

24
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,079
Blood pressure slowly dropped

25
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,360
It will be normal

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,478
Thank you uncle

27
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,560
Did you hear

28
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,000
Let you cultivate your character

29
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,960
Don't be angry and scold people in the factory every day

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,159
When did I curse

31
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,520
Scolding people often

32
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,079
Why

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,159
He will not scold people when he manages the factory

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,960
Which day's defective rate

35
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,120
It's going to rise above the standard

36
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,478
Uncle, don't listen to her

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,560
You're talking about Lin Yue

38
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,879
I'm not that irritable

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,360
I'm convinced by reason

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Uncle, I'll answer a call

41
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,800
good

42
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:55,639
Hello

43
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:58,879
Girl

44
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,840
Scolding people often

45
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,639
Will it be violent?

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,120
No

47
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,800
I'll give an example

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,479
He has a good temper

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,879
I usually beat him

50
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,960
What

51
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:11,400
Rigs fall off

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,199
Is it okay for people

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,800
This is the time

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,680
Of course I have to go to the hospital

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
I'll teach you

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
You turn around and let that Manager Zhu

57
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:17,360
Check out the driving supplier

58
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:18,478
The rivets are not tight

59
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,800
What quality is this

60
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,199
That's it

61
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,439
Hang up

62
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,000
Cultivate one's character

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,120
Convince people with reason

64
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:49,120
I heard you're going to have a spring trip

65
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
Go to the R&D center

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
How much does that cost

67
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,680
dad

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,918
That's just a little money

69
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,199
Can you afford it in the factory

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,280
Not daddy

71
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,400
Dad understands

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,719
What do I mean

73
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,840
You are the boss now

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,039
It's really not easy

75
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,360
Everything has to be taken care of

76
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,719
I have to take care of the staff's physical examination

77
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,919
Also pay attention to their mental state

78
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,159
I have to lead a team to the spring tour

79
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,238
Not easy

80
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,240
You can't eat this

81
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,319
This blood pressure will be high

82
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,279
You're a big fish and a big meat

83
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,160
This doesn't work either

84
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,959
This salt is very high

85
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,920
Eat vegetarian

86
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,399
This is for you

87
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,560
dad

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,120
Hongming is a workaholic

89
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,120
He is more stressful than me in his work

90
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,800
I think this activity

91
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,079
Very suitable for bringing Carrie and children

92
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,920
Go together

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,040
So you

94
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,920
You play yours

95
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,600
I didn't even want to go with you

96
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,639
You just want to

97
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,319
White meat

98
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,959
Where are you going? It's not far away

99
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,120
Not far

100
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,279
Xiao Ke's hometown

101
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,079
There is a reservoir that can still fish

102
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:55,800
good

103
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,759
Call

104
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,120
Miaoling Town

105
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,240
Have you been there

106
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,519
You've really been there

107
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Your mother is there

108
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,839
When I was young, I went to the countryside.

109
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,360
Too

110
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,879
Fu Qiufang's hometown

111
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,399
Hello

112
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,000
Mr. Sun

113
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,519
Hello

114
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,480
Mr. Liu is the boss's wife

115
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:38,600
E Yu

116
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,279
Is this the boss lady?

117
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,279
Hello, boss lady

118
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,839
Hello Hello Hello

119
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,800
Anyway, let's shout first

120
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,959
Zhang Heng

121
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,959
Zhang Heng

122
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,000
Zhang Yumeng

123
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:47,959
What about here

124
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,560
open

125
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:54,800
Hong Ming

126
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,279
New car

127
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,120
yes

128
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Big V8

129
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,439
The first batch of Donghai City

130
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,240
Yes

131
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,920
Don't be so stingy, okay?

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,279
It's time to change it

133
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,879
How fuel-consuming this big V8

134
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,000
Where can I afford to drive

135
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,800
You think it's expensive for four dollars per liter of oil

136
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,639
You might as well give you a car

137
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,839
Add the motor

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,120
50 cents per kilowatt-hour

139
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,240
Don't joke

140
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,839
All phones need to be charged overnight

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,199
This car can't be charged for a week

142
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
I'll see the interior

143
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,800
Mr. Liu has arrived

144
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,120
Depart on time in ten minutes

145
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,160
OK

146
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,680
Xiao Ke

147
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,519
What's wrong with Mr. Liu

148
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,560
Is your town big?

149
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,879
Not big but the scenery is good

150
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,279
There are many things to play with

151
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,759
Especially the fish in our reservoir

152
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,399
Taste is very good and worth a try

153
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,279
Not bad

154
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,800
There is a person named Fu Qiufang

155
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,639
Do you know

156
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,800
Teacher Fu

157
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,159
She taught me in elementary school

158
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,399
Teach to third grade

159
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,759
Mr. Liu, do you know her too?

160
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
She used to be a nanny at our house

161
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,240
Maybe there is a gap in careers

162
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,439
Not balanced mentality

163
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,959
Something happened later

164
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,120
Nothing done now

165
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,079
Yeah

166
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,959
I remember when she was a teacher

167
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,879
Very responsible and serious

168
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,399
At night we walked home on the mountain road

169
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,879
She's afraid of danger

170
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,879
We're always one by one

171
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,920
Delivered to the doorstep

172
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,120
Later, the village primary schools were merged into the town

173
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,519
Public teacher exam

174
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,519
She failed the preparation exam that time

175
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,680
Received a living allowance

176
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,439
Just go home

177
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,720
It's quite regretful

178
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,959
Does Liu always want to see her?

179
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,560
No

180
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,159
You go and do it first

181
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,480
good

182
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Very rare engineering students

183
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,560
So much talk

184
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,000
You're stereotyped

185
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,360
The liberal arts students are also taciturn.

186
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,600
Isn't there one?

187
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:49,959
have a look

188
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,360
Who's shooting himself in the foot

189
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,759
Hit me in the foot

190
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,680
Don't dare to mess with your leader

191
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,240
Do you want to try the big V8?

192
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,399
Give

193
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,120
Get on the car

194
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,959
Why did you suddenly ask

195
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,160
That Teacher Fu

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
My dad told me

197
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,960
She may not be able to live in the city

198
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,799
Go back to my hometown

199
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,558
Will she go back to her hometown

200
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,519
Does it have anything to do with you

201
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,799
I just don't understand

202
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,639
A student who is so obedient

203
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Loved teacher

204
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440
How could it become one

205
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,759
No bottom line

206
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,720
Unreasonable person

207
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:02,840
When a person

208
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,519
When you experience too many blows

209
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,360
No one can ask him

210
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,120
Keep the bottom line

211
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,559
Not to mention being rational

212
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Then say so

213
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,360
She's also

214
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,519
Poor person who can't help

215
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,639
What happened later

216
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,320
Is it considered that I'm making things worse

217
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,879
Another step on her

218
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,240
Causes of the times

219
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,879
Add personal reasons

220
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,080
No one can explain it clearly

221
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,519
Everyone has dignity

222
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,039
There are past events that you don't want people to know

223
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,879
You'd better give her some decent

224
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,440
Don't ask her

225
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,720
Carrie, look

226
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,759
What's wrong

227
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,039
It's all your girl who squirted

228
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,360
This kid

229
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,360
Rub quickly

230
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,919
Too sorry

231
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,039
It's okay

232
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,240
But she's really strong

233
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,200
She keeps stopping

234
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,039
It's a kid

235
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,519
It's like going crazy when you come out to play

236
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,320
Noisy

237
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,440
Ice Ice

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,960
When will you and Liu Jun get married?

239
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,559
We are not in a hurry

240
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,159
Then has he proposed to you

241
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,960
It should be soon

242
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,320
You didn't bring your camera today

243
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,600
I don't play photography much now

244
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
I'm reading a book recently

245
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,840
Tea Sutra and Buddhist Sutra

246
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,159
The two are in line with each other

247
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,559
It's interesting to study

248
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Do you usually drink tea

249
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,799
drink

250
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,360
A cup of milk tea every day when you go to work

251
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,440
milk tea

252
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,720
It's tea

253
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,440
It's great to drink tea

254
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,159
Tea can clear your eyes and clear your mind

255
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,919
I'll give you a book

256
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,360
Tea ceremony culture

257
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,320
It introduces all famous teas

258
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,399
Very well written

259
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,799
OK Thank you

260
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,679
You're welcome

261
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,000
Did they catch fish?

262
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,279
Do you think my request is too much

263
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,879
As far as the source of capital is concerned

264
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,600
Your prenuptial agreement

265
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,960
It's reasonable

266
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,960
Why did she react so much

267
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,840
What is your dad's opinion

268
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,600
I haven't discussed it with him yet

269
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,519
What is my dad's attitude not the key

270
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,480
The key is Bingbing and me

271
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
In this matter

272
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,639
Already frozen

273
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
Now I can't mention it at all

274
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,879
When she is mentioned, she gets angry

275
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,840
Will she be

276
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,480
Regarding the content of this agreement

277
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,600
What are the misunderstandings

278
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,759
I must have explained it to her

279
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,440
But she exploded when she heard it

280
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,960
It's very likely that I didn't hear it clearly

281
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,600
You said I might as well find a lawyer first

282
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,759
Draw a draft for her to see

283
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,639
Will this expression make her

284
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,639
Be calmer

285
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,960
Do you think it's OK

286
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,039
How dare I answer this randomly

287
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,000
I only want to get married once

288
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,519
And Carrie and Bingbing's character

289
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,320
Can it be put together and compare

290
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,840
It's better to get married when you don't have money

291
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,519
Nothing like this

292
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,799
All right

293
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,159
You won again

294
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,559
Win you again

295
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,519
Dad, this is sour

296
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,080
I'm sour too

297
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,399
You're sour, too

298
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,639
Some strawberries

299
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,639
Carrie, take a bite

300
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,600
Don't wash

301
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,399
Don't have pesticides and eat them with confidence

302
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,279
There is no pesticide spray

303
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,679
Give me some cucumbers

304
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,320
good

305
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,240
acid

306
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,600
This is not sour

307
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,440
Peaches are not sour

308
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,559
Have to buy more later

309
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,279
Can't be eaten for nothing

310
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,039
Buy something

311
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,840
Buy something

312
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,240
It's great to live here

313
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,960
Where is the best here

314
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,120
There are mountains, water and scenery

315
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,879
Look, there is a yard over there

316
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,759
How good

317
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,159
As the saying goes, there are flowers in spring and moon in autumn

318
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,519
There is cool breeze in summer and snow in winter

319
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,039
Just let you take a look

320
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Let you live here

321
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,399
You must complain

322
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,600
I don't know

323
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,879
Why am I complaining

324
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,919
Look at that house

325
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,120
How close to the waterside

326
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,759
It must be very humid

327
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,240
Not too good for joints

328
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,519
Look at the door and window again

329
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,120
The seal is not very tight

330
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,279
Summer mosquitoes

331
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,000
It must keep hiking in

332
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,080
I have to order a stove to keep warm in winter

333
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,120
Don't say anything about smoke

334
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,879
It is also prone to gas poisoning

335
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,679
There is danger

336
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,480
What you can't stand the most

337
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,120
I'm afraid it's still this dry toilet

338
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,519
When I went back to my hometown with my parents

339
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,279
I've used it

340
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,960
There are pigs next to it

341
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,480
piggy

342
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,279
What does it mean

343
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,200
Don't understand

344
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,120
without

345
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,519
When you squat

346
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,720
The little pig is running around you

347
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,200
OK, Dad, hold it

348
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,399
That little pig is running around you

349
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,240
If you can't squat properly

350
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,679
alright

351
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,840
Just confront you in a trap

352
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,200
What to say is a bad scenery

353
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,080
If there is a cow at the door

354
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,120
Your door can't be opened

355
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,840
OK OK OK Don't say it

356
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,360
It will ruin the scenery

357
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,720
Uncle, I'm right

358
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,720
That's right, right

359
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,759
Actually, these things

360
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,080
For us country people

361
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:42,840
It doesn't matter

362
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,360
But they've been in the city

363
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,679
Maybe I'm not used to it when I come back

364
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,399
You see

365
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,440
Someone really came back home

366
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,679
Enjoy the country life

367
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,159
Where is enjoying life

368
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,840
That's not going to be able to survive in the city

369
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:54,679
one

370
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,639
The old lady who works as a nanny for the city people

371
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,440
What's wrong

372
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
In comparison

373
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,360
I'm just lucky

374
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,960
Just better than Mr. Fu

375
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,320
Hello Luo Qing

376
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
You're going out

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,240
Luo Qing asked me to meet

378
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,840
Leave

379
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
You'll come back soon

380
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,279
I didn't take a computer

381
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,559
Go to your place to change a file

382
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,360
Is it OK

383
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,559
You come, I'm at Liu Jun's house

384
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,000
See you later

385
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,000
Luo Qing

386
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,680
Mr. Liu

387
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,279
This is my wife

388
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,960
Hello Hello Hello

389
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,519
Hello Mr. Liu

390
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,079
This has been a few months

391
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,598
It's been six months

392
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Then hurry up and sit down

393
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,079
sit

394
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,118
Tell me about you

395
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,240
Such a good thing

396
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,480
Why didn't you tell me in advance

397
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,079
Congratulations

398
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,240
Thank you Mr. Liu

399
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,640
Thanks

400
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,880
Then it seems

401
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,319
It's been agreed

402
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,640
As per your request

403
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,880
I've gone home

404
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
Obtained approval from our leaders

405
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,519
Now as long as you agree

406
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
I'll apply to resign tomorrow

407
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,759
Does Mrs. Luo really have no objection?

408
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,680
I thought

409
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,400
This is the situation now

410
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,599
You'll be more stable

411
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,000
I couldn't bear to leave it at first

412
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,599
Let him give up his civil servant status

413
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,920
I thought about it later

414
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,240
Our family is well off

415
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,279
Parents have public office

416
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,920
I'm still teaching in college

417
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,200
Compared to most people

418
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,359
We're already very resistant to risks

419
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,240
Modern people are outside of life

420
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,880
Can maintain passion and ideals

421
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,640
It's not an easy task at all

422
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,559
so

423
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,680
Please take him in

424
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,160
Take this word in

425
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,119
Then what else can I say

426
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,759
Welcome back

427
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,680
Thank you Mr. Liu

428
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:25,720
Thank you Mr. Liu

429
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,799
dad

430
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,960
It's raining now, why are you here?

431
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,839
I'm having something to do nearby

432
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,920
Come here by the way

433
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll take a towel for you

434
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,400
Don't need me to hold an umbrella

435
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,880
It's colder

436
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,799
You wear more clothes

437
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,680
Not cold

438
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,279
I'll give you some cold injection

439
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,880
OK

440
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,680
Prevent it

441
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,400
well

442
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,160
Drink some water first

443
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,480
Drink first

444
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,119
dad

445
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,720
I just finished meeting Luo Qing

446
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,799
He today

447
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,319
Come with my wife

448
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,480
Very good talk

449
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,279
Understand

450
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:14,680
Come

451
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,960
Luo Qing, this child

452
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,680
It's good to know the roots and bottoms

453
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,200
But sales

454
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,119
It's the first line to get in touch with money

455
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,480
There are many tricks

456
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,079
I'll tell you that it's absolutely impossible

457
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,880
I won't let it go

458
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,200
dad

459
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,519
Takeo has developed smoothly in recent years

460
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,119
You have helped me with a lot of trouble

461
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,119
But take off to the outside world

462
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,079
It is necessary to establish a high-end image

463
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,440
Luo Qing knows technology

464
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Know how to deal with people

465
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,400
Being a civil servant for a few years

466
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,720
Promoted to section chief

467
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,160
Who can do this without any real ability

468
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,720
Besides, Secretary Zhao is going to retire

469
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,079
Luo Qing can still run for the party branch secretary when he comes

470
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,880
Of course he sells it

471
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,680
Still lack of experience

472
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,480
I have to ask you to help him

473
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,240
Must be

474
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,880
I'll tell you

475
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,839
There are so many ways to sell here

476
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,359
yes

477
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,839
I'll teach him well

478
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,880
Dad is patient

479
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,720
In addition to this sale

480
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,200
That's the purchase

481
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,720
Profits of many products

482
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,960
All in procurement

483
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,039
I won't let it go easily

484
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,319
And I'll keep a good eye on it

485
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,279
Don't worry

486
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,119
Dad, don't worry too much

487
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,079
Luo Qing is still young

488
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,599
Unlimited potential

489
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,640
The most important thing is

490
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,279
He is willing to give up his civil servant status and come back

491
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:44,079
This means

492
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,960
He has a strong recognition of Tengfei

493
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,200
This is the most valuable thing

494
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,079
That's because we take off

495
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,799
Have a bright future

496
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,400
So he took the last bus

497
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,240
Be a veteran

498
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,559
This shows that he has vision

499
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,480
It means he is smart

500
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,559
Dad, why are you now

501
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,720
More arrogant than me

502
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,640
This is confidence

503
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,720
OK OK OK OK OK

504
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
You are my leader

505
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,039
I'll show you a statement

506
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:10,200
Is it okay to take the bowl to help others

507
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,160
Right

508
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I'll listen to you

509
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll retreat

510
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:16,920
But there is something

511
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,079
I have to tell you something

512
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,839
Ah Jun

513
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,160
Dad retreat

514
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,119
You can't be idle either

515
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000
Dad is not old yet, right

516
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,279
Give some money to dad

517
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:28,559
I want

518
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,759
Play with new stocks

519
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,000
People said this is very safe

520
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:33,680
I'll tell you

521
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm just trying my luck

522
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,039
What about entertainment

523
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,400
Your entertainment is quite trendy

524
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,839
There are trendy updates, you can see

525
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,200
Look what this is

526
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,160
Haven't seen it before

527
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,720
Is this not business

528
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,240
What business channel is this mobile phone

529
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,160
This phone

530
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,680
How to dial without a keyboard

531
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,440
It's so old-fashioned and still keeps you back

532
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,559
You see, there is a pen to take this point

533
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,119
Look at this one

534
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,240
What phone number, email address

535
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,319
Stocks game

536
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,319
It's a small computer

537
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,400
information

538
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,960
No need to click this text message

539
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,920
Don't order this

540
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,920
Such a new way of entertainment

541
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,680
Who taught you

542
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,400
Dad is smart and self-taught

543
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,200
Come on come on

544
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Just tell you that I remember correctly

545
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,440
This statement

546
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:23,720
At the last revision

547
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,160
It's been changed

548
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,880
This person has been in the job for two months

549
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,440
I've reminded her a long time ago

550
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,759
To add a label to the new version

551
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,119
Why can't she remember it?

552
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:32,598
OK

553
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,119
Assistant

554
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,240
If you encounter good things, you have to try your luck.

555
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,960
Don't be angry

556
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,400
Isn't this quite good

557
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,240
It's not delaying you to meet a big customer tomorrow

558
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,160
Closed for you

559
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:14,759
you

560
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,880
This has begun to be discussed

561
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,119
Do you want it or not

562
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,839
I'll check the terms for you in advance

563
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,480
Need not

564
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,799
I didn't discuss it with him

565
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
This was my last time

566
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,160
After explicitly rejecting him

567
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,000
Things he secretly fabricated

568
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,440
Good ice

569
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,119
Actually signing a prenuptial agreement

570
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,640
It's also Liu Jun's right

571
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,519
You can object

572
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,359
But you don't have to be so angry

573
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,599
His core idea is to guard against me

574
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,119
If we are between the two of us

575
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,279
Even a little bit of trust

576
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,039
If not

577
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,720
Why do I still want to marry him

578
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,079
I know

579
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,480
But now angry

580
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,519
Can't solve the problem

581
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,559
Be calmer

582
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,839
Wait for Liu Jun to come back

583
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,319
Talk to him

584
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,319
OK

585
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,240
What to eat tonight

586
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:44,720
Ice Ice

587
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,039
Why are you sitting here

588
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,759
The tea ceremony has been studied

589
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:14,119
I haven't read this carefully yet

590
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,640
I want to sort it out first

591
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,240
Please review and approve

592
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,400
If you think it's not suitable

593
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,319
Can we discuss

594
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,480
I didn't look carefully, either

595
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,359
Because of the nature of the problem

596
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,880
Not the content of the agreement

597
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,799
What I want is simple

598
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,119
It's your attitude

599
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,279
Ice Ice

600
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,039
For this matter

601
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,039
We have been froze for too long

602
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,200
Consume it again

603
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,720
No good for each other

604
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,319
I'll give it a brief explanation

605
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,920
Decision to sign this agreement

606
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,920
I won't change

607
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,720
Can you be calm and composed

608
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:52,720
Think carefully

609
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,960
Don't be so emotional

610
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:54,880
What's the meaning

611
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,119
You give me an ultimatum, right?

612
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,200
If I'm today

613
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,200
Just don't sign this agreement

614
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,319
You're going to break up with me

615
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,880
In a zero-sum game

616
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,599
Someone must exit first

617
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,640
The situation will change

618
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
To be honest, I don't know now

619
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,799
How to communicate with you

620
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,319
I'm already exhausted

621
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,319
Maybe we really need it

622
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,359
Split for a while

623
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,319
Think calmly

624
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,000
I'll know

625
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,640
Have you been right?

626
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,720
Can't leave you

627
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,880
I can't break up with you if I'm sure

628
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,240
Why do you always misinterpret it

629
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,319
What I mean

630
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:43,119
Take a look at this agreement calmly

631
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,440
Notify me if there is a conclusion

632
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,759
I'll leave first

633
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,039
Hello, something to say

634
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,359
It's not a good thing to hear this

635
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:50,880
Did you get bombed when you go home

636
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,160
How do you know

637
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,599
Cui Bingbing discovers your agreement

638
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,640
It's because Chen Qifan

639
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,119
Just now I went to talk to her about her job

640
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
Use your computer

641
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,799
She tells me when she comes back

642
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,279
Say you're too distorted

643
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,119
This matter was handled so carelessly

644
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,640
Say let me tell you

645
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,039
Of course

646
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,480
I know I can't tell you

647
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,720
But facing your girlfriend

648
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:13,640
It must be agreed

649
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,599
So this

650
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,599
You should learn from me

651
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,920
Don't be so honest

652
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,200
It's time to coax it

653
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,839
Then you mean I should give in

654
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Isn't signing this agreement?

655
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,759
That doesn't work for one code

656
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,000
I still support you in signing the agreement

657
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,119
Where are you now

658
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
In my own car

659
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,319
Someone was kicked out so soon

660
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,359
But it's also

661
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:34,759
When the anger is over

662
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,039
Don't mess with them

663
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:37,960
I'm in Haoyuan

664
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,799
Or you come here

665
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,759
I'll have a drink with you

666
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,039
never mind

667
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,160
This is when drinking to drown your sorrow

668
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,079
No sense

669
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,720
I want to calm down alone for a while

670
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,519
I'll have to go up and see her later

671
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,519
OK

672
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,519
Then call me if you have something to do

673
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:13,759
Ice Ice

674
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,519
Ice Ice

675
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,400
This is your territory

676
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,519
I should go

677
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,880
Start today

678
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,039
Be a firm determinist

679
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,559
Hello Ajun

680
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,200
Have you had supper

681
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,319
Dad doesn't care what happened recently

682
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,559
Don't call Bingbing

683
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,720
What's wrong

684
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,960
Just tell me directly

685
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,119
OK OK OK

686
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,160
Quarrel

687
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,440
fine

688
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,359
My own business

689
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,759
I can handle it myself

690
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,359
Just remember what I said

691
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,480
Where are the young people nowadays

692
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,880
Nothing to say

693
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,319
I haven't heard of them

694
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
What conflicts have happened recently

695
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,680
Hongying

696
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,160
Do you know something

697
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,160
Ah Jun

698
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,920
Ah Jun

699
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,400
Here comes

700
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,079
Ah Jun

701
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,960
Stop knocking

702
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:49,799
Quick, quick

703
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,200
You hurry up

704
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:52,839
What's wrong

705
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,039
Dad only found out yesterday

706
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,359
She's not here

707
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,440
Why didn't you tell your dad earlier

708
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,599
I'll tell you Ah Jun

709
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,200
This matter must not be compromised

710
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,000
Did you hear

711
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:01,880
What to say

712
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,440
Where is Ajun

713
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,359
Something

714
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,559
You may not be able to say

715
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,279
It doesn't matter if dad explains it to you

716
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,119
Dad explains

717
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,079
Tengfei funding

718
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,119
Dad spent his whole life savings

719
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,759
Have worked hard

720
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,519
We're right

721
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,680
We didn't think about lying to anyone

722
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:16,759
Didn't think about bullying anyone

723
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,119
Who told you about this

724
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,920
It's Qian Hongying again, right?

725
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,440
I've never troubled her

726
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Why does she like it so much

727
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,279
What a mess I'm messing about

728
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,200
No matter who said it doesn't matter

729
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,200
Dad is reminding you

730
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,279
In this matter

731
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,759
Absolutely no relinquishment

732
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,039
in principle

733
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,319
You guys are fine now

734
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,240
Who can tell the future exactly what happened

735
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,920
That Lin Linyue

736
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,680
Divorce makes a mess

737
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,000
It hurts the bones

738
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,359
That's really more cruel than killing a pig

739
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,079
dad

740
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,039
My differences with Bingbing

741
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,119
Not here at all

742
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,160
Can you stop interfering in this kind of thing?

743
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,839
My own business

744
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,880
How do I solve it

745
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,119
I know it in my heart

746
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,240
Yes, dad knows

747
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,200
Dad knows you know

748
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,319
Isn't this a reminder

749
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,200
The society is very complicated today

750
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:00,160
Different from the past

751
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,480
It's just a real father and mother

752
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,599
It's impossible to die before

753
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,440
Give you the property

754
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,519
What's more, my husband

755
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,960
She finished telling her father

756
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,680
She makes loans at the bank every day

757
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,599
Didn't see her say

758
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,079
If you don't sign the contract, just put the money

759
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,400
I can't figure it out at this time

760
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,240
Isn't that because

761
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,079
Is it easy to bully?

762
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,000
Is it easy for you to talk to

763
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,239
I'll tell you Ajun listens to daddy

764
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,400
Otherwise, you will definitely suffer in the future

765
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,319
Sorry Sorry

766
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,319
I'm really sorry

767
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,079
Can't stand my sister's questioning

768
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,200
At first I said

769
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,039
Don't know it's coming

770
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,480
But she just doesn't believe it

771
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,799
Can I treat you to a meal?

772
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,359
I'm really sorry, sorry

773
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:55,720
never mind

774
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,279
Not a state secret

775
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,240
Give me a cup

776
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,279
OK wait

777
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,720
Don't worry

778
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,319
so far

779
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,799
Most of you support you

780
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,559
We are not my type, I show

781
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,960
I'd like to have a text message to vote

782
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,519
Thanks

783
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,440
These friends around me

784
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,119
Your little peach

785
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,279
All are soy sauce

786
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,599
How old is Luo Qing younger than me

787
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,799
Be a dad, too

788
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,519
Not to mention Mr. Song

789
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,039
just me

790
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,680
Let alone having a baby

791
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,799
Can't even get married

792
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,519
Think about it for the better

793
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,960
The problem breaks out now

794
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,799
Can it be completely solved

795
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,640
Always compare to two people

796
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Inexplicably dragging it to be strong

797
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,839
Calm down for two days

798
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,359
Good to both of us

799
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,920
I'm upset when I think of this now

800
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,960
Think about work more

801
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,200
Work is the best anesthetic

802
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,719
Donghai No. 1 invests heavily in research and development

803
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,039
Probably higher than the entire equipment

804
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,360
Prices for full imports

805
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,280
If you only count the current economic account

806
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,440
Then this account

807
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,599
It's definitely not worth it

808
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,800
If you want to cultivate local manufacturing

809
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,719
Then this step is the only way

810
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,920
Sooner or later, they will leave

811
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:05,960
Of course

812
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,639
Some people will think

813
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,119
Buying is worse than renting

814
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,920
Is the economy globalized?

815
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,519
Since you can buy something

816
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,880
Why do you have to make it yourself

817
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,960
Objectively speaking

818
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,440
This view has its correct side

819
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,880
But in the long run

820
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,719
I always believe

821
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,519
The importance of independence

822
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,400
Regardless of the future

823
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,880
The environment for global economic development

824
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,480
How ideal and optimistic

825
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,519
Not mastering high-precision core technology

826
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,559
There is no real one

827
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,480
Competitiveness and productivity

828
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,119
The pre-ordered target of Donghai No. 1

829
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,280
It is a complete set of equipment independently developed

830
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,519
Requires every link

831
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,679
All must have complete

832
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,639
Independent intellectual property rights

833
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Current production line

834
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,880
Has been employed by various companies

835
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,800
Claimed most

836
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,599
I've looked

837
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,960
The most suitable for us to take off

838
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,480
Only a hard bone left

839
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,559
That's it

840
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,039
Fully automatic robot system

841
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,639
Fully automatic system

842
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,599
Located in Donghai No. 1

843
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,400
In the later process

844
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,719
This stage

845
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,039
Very high operating accuracy required

846
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,840
Not only temperature and humidity

847
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,039
High dust concentration

848
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,400
And there are dense

849
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,280
Infrasonic noise

850
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:06,159
Foreign manufacturers

851
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,239
Already abandoned

852
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,679
Manual or semi-manual operation

853
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,039
Specific working conditions

854
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,639
I've summed it up

855
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,880
You can take a look

856
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,239
Four sets of servos are synchronized

857
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,480
And set response time

858
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,320
So short again

859
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,320
Mr. Liu

860
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,039
You have to give us a mathematics department

861
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:21,760
That's fine

862
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,400
You're just one of the difficulties

863
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,199
There is also a working environment

864
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,199
Currently Donghai Group

865
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,199
Only available to us

866
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,199
Unverified

867
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,599
Approximate environmental parameters

868
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,960
I've written this on the third page

869
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,599
Analysis of the environmental components of Mr. Liu

870
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,760
Our database

871
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,679
Basically no

872
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,280
We're probably going to collect from scratch

873
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,559
no way

874
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,079
What Donghai Group is doing now

875
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,880
It's something no one has done in China

876
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:46,719
Data blank

877
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,079
It's our first difficulty

878
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,960
Mr. Liu, I want to ask

879
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,559
The total cost of this project

880
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,320
What percentage of our annual output value

881
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,440
I think it's about 20%

882
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,880
It accounts for such a high proportion

883
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,760
If the budget exceeds

884
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,760
Need to add it

885
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,400
If finally

886
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,400
The research and development is not successful

887
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,480
Donghai No. 1

888
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,440
With our leaping research and development direction

889
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:19,159
Basically consistent

890
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,199
That is to say

891
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,559
With the help of this project's financial subsidy

892
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,119
Once we have successfully developed

893
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,480
Our products

894
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,840
Will take a new level

895
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,199
And will have a long-term

896
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,880
Absolute advantage that is hard to surpass

897
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,679
Piracy of our imitation

898
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,800
Will no longer exist

899
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,119
Mr. Liu, I just returned to Tengfei not long ago

900
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,119
I don't want to be so fast either

901
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,679
Make negative opinions

902
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,800
But as the sales person

903
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,760
I have to care about costs and output

904
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,519
Such a long R&D cycle

905
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,719
Probably two or three years

906
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,920
No results can be achieved

907
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,639
Before we reach the end

908
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,119
The company's capital investment

909
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,280
It's already exhausted

910
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,639
Twenty percent of the annual output value

911
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,239
Everyone

912
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,079
This number

913
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,960
It can definitely be called adventure

914
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,840
So I personally feel

915
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,679
Still can't take too fast

916
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,000
Must be scientific

917
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,599
To evaluate this project

918
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,360
You're right

919
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,800
But everyone

920
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,199
Opportunities wait for no one

921
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,559
Joint development of Donghai No. 1

922
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,880
It will inevitably become a manufacturing industry

923
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,079
The pearl on the crown

924
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,239
You guys are all

925
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,440
Technically

926
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:31,960
Such an opportunity

927
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,960
Are you really willing to miss it?

928
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,679
cheers

929
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,960
Those you are struggling with

930
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,440
Attitude, trust

931
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:50,679
No sense at all

932
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,599
Break up

933
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,280
Where did you go

934
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,800
Find another one like Liu Jun

935
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,000
Aya is right

936
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,800
After passing this village, there will be no such store

937
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,719
no

938
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,440
Which group of you two are from?

939
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,039
I'm financially independent now

940
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,000
Can take care of one's own life

941
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,078
Why can't I

942
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,159
Pursuing a simple part

943
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,480
Love without conditions

944
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,440
Bingbing

945
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,199
You have to get married first

946
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,719
Only then can you be qualified to think about something else

947
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,519
He is a businessman

948
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:13,760
All the body is handled

949
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,519
Wait until you have the identity of a wife

950
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,119
Some ways to deal with him

951
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,599
What to say

952
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,719
Let's talk about it

953
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,920
Liu Jun has made it clear

954
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,840
Unwilling to give up the prenuptial agreement

955
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,159
Then what trump card do you have in your hand

956
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,880
Can you force him to change his mind

957
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
What's wrong with this lawyer

958
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Don't speak today

959
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,960
Why do you think they are two

960
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:39,880
It's right

961
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,239
They published

962
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,480
Actually, it's all my opinion

963
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,360
It doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong

964
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,519
Listen or not

965
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,760
All the choices are in yours

966
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,639
As for me

967
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,320
I only know a little

968
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,440
What

969
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,760
You really like Liu Jun

970
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,320
Well said

971
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,039
Come

972
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,519
You mean this robot project

973
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,719
Mr. Song has asked many

974
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,440
Yes

975
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:18,119
There are many people who are jealous of this system

976
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:20,119
No one dared to make up his mind

977
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,199
Mr. Song also knows that your assets are limited

978
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,760
He called you over and listened

979
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,119
Mostly, they ask questions

980
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,079
A little desperate

981
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:31,800
Then, Mr. Song’s greater intention is

982
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
It's not that I have to join

983
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,280
Instead, I want to use me as the standard

984
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,679
Evaluate the domestic technology market

985
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,519
Of course

986
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:40,840
The investment of this thing

987
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,079
It's not a joke

988
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,280
He doesn't want you to come out.

989
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,280
All tossed in

990
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,440
But this project is really tempting

991
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,760
I'm not willing to give up

992
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,679
Are you interested

993
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,400
Distribute half of the funds to join

994
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,360
Share R&D results in the future

995
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:01,440
I don't want to be interested

996
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,440
I've left the city

997
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:04,920
Entered the group management

998
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:06,519
you do not know

999
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,920
I've read the group statement these two days

1000
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,440
The more I look at it, the more I feel

1001
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,960
Such a huge asset in the city

1002
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,280
So many workers

1003
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:18,519
The heart that I can't finish working hard every day

1004
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,119
The final profit

1005
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:22,119
Still a little stupid money

1006
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,000
Revenues compared to other projects of the group

1007
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:28,960
Then that's simply

1008
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,039
Not the same as

1009
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,679
Liu Jun

1010
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,880
Don't be stubborn, either

1011
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,119
Now I have to think differently

1012
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,480
Don't tell me what to make money

1013
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,519
Two years ago

1014
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,760
I've been doing futures for a while

1015
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,719
It's so irritable

1016
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,519
Almost didn't delay the big thing

1017
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,840
You're still good

1018
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,360
Futures are really too strong

1019
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,360
I don't dare to touch it

1020
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:55,400
But safer than futures

1021
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,599
But projects with equally high returns

1022
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,440
There are also many

1023
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,519
I'll tell you

1024
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:00,840
This type of project has a separate threshold

1025
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,719
We take off without your Lu family

1026
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,519
Such a background

1027
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,119
Shut up you

1028
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,199
You know it quite well in your heart

1029
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,519
Beef hotpot

1030
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,639
Let's eat this next time

1031
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,480
Can

1032
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,280
Open 190 stores

1033
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,079
What's wrong

1034
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,480
That's Liu Jun's car

1035
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,559
Which one

1036
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,679
Black one

1037
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,360
You see

1038
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,519
The Cold War has little impact on men

1039
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,719
He still eats, drinks, and has fun.

1040
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,239
Still happy

1041
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:45,280
There are so many beauties in this street

1042
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,079
Otherwise, say

1043
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,800
This is a holy place for romance

1044
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,079
taxi

1045
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,239
Get on the bus

1046
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,519
Don't think about getting in the car

1047
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,119
You sit in there
