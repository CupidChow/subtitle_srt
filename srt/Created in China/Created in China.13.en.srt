1
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,719
Is it going smoothly

2
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,439
smoothly

3
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,079
110 verified the situation with the branch

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,519
Take the person away first

5
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:53,799
The police said his case was simple

6
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:54,799
The nature is clear

7
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:56,158
Tell me to go to the police station tomorrow

8
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:56,959
Make a transcript

9
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,200
It's good if there is a result

10
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,079
I haven't wasted these days

11
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,519
Help you fish everywhere

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
How to thank you

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,680
Send me home

14
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:06,879
Walk

15
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,000
To be honest

16
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,000
Our underground garage

17
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,400
The road to the elevator

18
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,879
It's really too dark

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,199
I'm scared every time I leave

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
That's because you're too timid

21
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,840
My first time seeing you

22
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,039
Just in the elevator

23
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,919
There is also monitoring when the light is on

24
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,400
You're still scared and shrank into a ball

25
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:30,280
Then you didn't keep going

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Staring at me

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,520
I don't have it

28
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:33,159
have

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,079
You won't admit it

30
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,879
Fan Xiaolong has officially approved the arrest

31
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,159
Prepare to be transferred to the procuratorate for prosecution

32
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,840
By providing your invoice

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
This case value

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,719
It's really not low

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,639
Our company also has account data

36
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,319
It can prove the value of this drawing

37
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,639
If there is anything in the procuratorate

38
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,840
Need to be supplemented

39
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,240
Please feel free to contact me

40
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:15,960
no problem

41
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,719
Please trouble you

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,478
You're welcome

43
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,879
Go out

44
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,039
This is my business card

45
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,560
Please ask you

46
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,039
Comrades who were transferred to the procuratorate

47
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,759
no problem

48
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:27,199
Director Liu

49
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,560
I'm begging you

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,240
What are you doing

51
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,000
Let my man go

52
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,000
You catch him in

53
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,198
Our family can't live

54
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,680
What are you doing? Get up quickly

55
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,800
You get up first

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,079
I'm begging you

57
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,400
What's this for you

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,439
It is said that theft is a public prosecution case

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,120
Has nothing to do with this factory manager

60
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:38,960
Director Liu, I beg you

61
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm begging you

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,759
Come on come on

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,360
Come on, kids

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,759
Let's go find mom

65
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,719
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good

66
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,240
That girl just now

67
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,520
Fan Xiaolong's second-married wife

68
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,759
After her husband entered

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,000
One person with three children

70
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,719
It's really not easy

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,840
Very heavy burden

72
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,639
By the way

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,599
She said her mother-in-law

74
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,719
Still living in a rental house

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,000
I broke a bone some time ago

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,159
No one cared for in bed

77
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
I have to go and see

78
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,520
If something happens, it will be bad

79
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,680
Stay in touch

80
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,719
Officer Zhou

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,639
Then you get in my car

82
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,680
I'll send you there

83
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,560
No need to worry

84
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,039
The 28th big squad will arrive in a while

85
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,238
No trouble

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,279
I want to go and see it, too

87
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,120
Is it OK

88
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,399
Arrived at the front house

89
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,240
This is their situation

90
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,839
Our factory's wages are not low

91
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,079
Where did he spend the money

92
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,279
That's it

93
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,040
It seems Fan Xiaolong

94
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,240
It's really this home

95
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,360
The only source of economic

96
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,439
so

97
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,439
I'll contact the civil affairs department

98
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,959
Set up this old man

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,040
Have a good meal

100
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,319
It seems like I stole your drawings

101
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,000
Who do you show it to?

102
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,439
dad

103
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,680
Fan Xiaolong’s commercial leak

104
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,680
I'm not going to pursue it anymore

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,800
Dad agrees

106
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,360
What's next

107
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,360
Do you want it

108
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,360
Fund their family of the elderly, weak, sick and disabled

109
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,240
Dad, I'm now

110
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,920
Neither willing but not willing

111
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,720
You haven't seen the situation in their house

112
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,399
It's really a bit pitiful

113
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,720
Yes, yes, understand

114
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,319
What are you doing

115
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,240
OK

116
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
What is this

117
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,279
The address of Fu Qiufang and their hometown

118
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,920
They must be old, weak, sick and disabled

119
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,920
And life is

120
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,120
It must be quite miserable

121
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,040
Let's just do it together

122
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,319
All funded

123
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,920
Dad, what are you doing

124
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
I just can't bear it

125
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,600
How else do you have to bear it

126
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,079
How do you feel patient

127
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,759
Ah Jun

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,079
Dad repeatedly stressed to you

129
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,279
We are business

130
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,600
Can't do this

131
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,240
Like them

132
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,240
Make life worse and worse

133
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,120
at last

134
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,040
Take risks and try the method

135
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,639
The character is generally not very good

136
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,720
Do you know Fan Xiaolong

137
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,360
Dad found someone to investigate

138
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,879
He is not only prostitute

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
All the other four are occupied

140
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,000
Especially good gambling

141
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,399
What a bet, my son

142
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,160
Then when you bet, your relatives don’t recognize you

143
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,399
Can do anything

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,000
He was worried that he couldn't find anyone to cheat.

145
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,199
You've delivered it to your door by yourself

146
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,560
He won't be your life

147
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,480
Dad has several such friends

148
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
You can call them over

149
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,040
Show me an explanation

150
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,600
All are bloody and tears

151
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,839
Some stories are told

152
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,800
You won't believe it

153
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,399
It's the truth

154
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,439
That way, you don't eat it

155
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,319
Come and tell you two dad

156
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,079
I don't listen, I don't listen,

157
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,839
Don't listen

158
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,960
Business management is really a big question

159
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,558
I was so arrogant before

160
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,840
This is no longer management

161
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,840
This is life

162
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,000
Have a meal

163
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,200
Please enter

164
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,159
Mr. Liu

165
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,120
What happened again

166
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,159
Nothing is OK

167
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,759
I'm sending some new tea to my hometown

168
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,279
Take it here for you to taste

169
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,559
Thanks Thanks

170
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,240
Something else

171
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,200
Mr. Liu

172
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,080
that

173
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,679
A whistleblower

174
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,720
I think it's pretty villainous

175
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
I've always looked down on it

176
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,519
but

177
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,320
But now that you're here

178
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,399
I think I should say it

179
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,919
Is it right

180
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,200
right

181
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,240
This is what Mr. Liu does

182
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,759
Yesterday I represented the company

183
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,559
Go to the new product exhibition

184
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,440
Meet an old classmate

185
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,080
He just happened to know Mr. Sun

186
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,440
He told me

187
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,039
Sun Gong in his original company

188
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
Salary benefits

189
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,759
All are higher than taking off

190
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,158
And the boss respects him very much

191
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,559
Logically he shouldn't

192
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,159
certainly

193
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,919
Maybe I'm too allergic

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,799
Thinking too much

195
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,279
They just jump to a job

196
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,120
Which company was Sun Gong's original company?

197
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,159
Takamori

198
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,600
Some of their company's products this year

199
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,879
It's just imitating us

200
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,960
I just think

201
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,559
This should be made by Mr. Liu

202
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,639
You know

203
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,440
Nothing else

204
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,039
Then I'll go and do it first

205
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,799
sister

206
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,720
What's up

207
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,279
I'm at your house

208
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,399
Carrie said you're this week

209
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,360
Haven't come home in the first half of the night

210
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,919
Too unreasonable, you

211
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,559
Come back early tonight

212
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,360
Our family

213
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:33,799
Haven't had dinner together for a long time

214
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,879
Not OK tonight

215
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,240
I've made arrangements

216
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,919
What are the overtime work and socializing

217
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,120
All excuses

218
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,000
You can cheat Jiali

219
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,919
You can't cheat me

220
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,039
The wild flowers outside are more fragrant than the home flowers

221
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,679
Yes or no

222
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,879
What kind of flowers are there in the wild flowers?

223
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,480
I don't know your evil fire

224
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,279
Where did it come from

225
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:50,919
I'll be here tonight

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,879
Go to Liujun Factory for a meeting

227
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,919
There are several products in their factory

228
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,639
It was exported by me

229
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,200
If you don't believe it, call Liu Jun.

230
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,679
You think I dare not ask

231
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,200
Mr. Liu

232
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,679
New infrared sensor

233
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,320
The sensitivity is not very good yet

234
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,519
But my design plan

235
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,440
It should be no problem

236
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,039
Does Liu have any different opinions?

237
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,399
Mr. Sun

238
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,399
Before you take off

239
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,919
Are you doing things in Longsheng?

240
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,399
You still know

241
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,320
Then why are you

242
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,639
On your resume

243
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,679
Concealing this experience

244
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,799
Longsheng wants your skills

245
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,919
The boss sent several people

246
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Come to the interview

247
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Only I passed

248
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,279
I know this is a business spy

249
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,799
I'm also very resistant

250
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,000
I just want to do it for a few days

251
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,360
Just think it's a job

252
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,600
Then tell the boss

253
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,120
It's over if you don't have a chance

254
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,159
But you're taking off

255
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,639
Already been around for almost a year

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,720
yes

257
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,759
Come and take off for a while

258
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,120
I like this

259
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,919
Working atmosphere

260
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,159
My salary is not as high as before

261
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,320
But you are a returnee doctor

262
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,720
Really deserved

263
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,080
I've really learned from you

264
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,000
Many new thinking and new technologies

265
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,360
I think the development after taking off

266
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,799
Must be far beyond Longsheng

267
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,679
So I'm having a showdown with the boss

268
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,639
I'm not going back

269
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,720
I'll do it here with you

270
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,320
Mr. Liu, don't make things difficult

271
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,360
I know

272
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,720
Just explain to you by my empty words

273
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,600
It's definitely hard for you to believe

274
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,000
If you feel disgusted

275
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,519
I'll leave

276
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,279
And I promise

277
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,679
I won't go back to Longsheng

278
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,720
You can rest assured this

279
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,120
I always felt

280
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,399
A person's way of thinking during research and development

281
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,000
Directly linked to his character

282
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,159
We've worked together

283
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,720
Almost half a year

284
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,720
I think I know you

285
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,919
Just think of it as gambling

286
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,840
But I think I have a big chance of winning

287
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,759
Mr. Liu, I am now

288
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,360
Nothing makes sense to say

289
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,679
People's hearts will be seen over time

290
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,360
Let's see in the future

291
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
Since we are today

292
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,360
That's all

293
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,799
Then I want to raise a question too

294
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,360
Since I decided to stay in the leap

295
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,519
Longsheng's boss

296
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,720
Feeling very shameless

297
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,000
He's been trying his best

298
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,519
Let me not stay in Tengfei

299
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,120
Of course I'm not asking you

300
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,039
Who said my thing in front of you

301
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,879
I just think

302
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,480
I need to wake up

303
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Get it to the end

304
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,519
Both R&D engineers have doubts

305
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,519
Neither of them dares to believe it completely

306
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,279
The key is that I can't

307
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,279
Go and ask Mr. Liao again

308
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,240
Isn't this worse the more I'm going to make trouble?

309
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,120
Manufacturing industry has some independent innovation

310
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,039
This environment is really terrible

311
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,080
You have two senior engineers in total

312
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,080
Made complicated enough

313
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,559
You know, too

314
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,440
Take the current funding situation

315
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,320
If you are not careful, you may collapse

316
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,600
This Sun and this Liao

317
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,279
All of them are my core technical personnel

318
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,360
I've invested a lot in them

319
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,039
It's impossible to let go easily

320
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,000
yes

321
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,840
never mind

322
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,519
Just bet on luck

323
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,559
If there is any problem

324
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,559
Just think that my vision is not good

325
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,799
No wonder others

326
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,840
I think you've been lately

327
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,080
It's a bit unhappy

328
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,840
Or I'll accompany you to burn incense

329
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:32,879
Just beg

330
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,279
Still burning incense

331
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,919
I'm going to burn money tomorrow

332
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,480
What about this 50,000 yuan

333
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,840
We took the initiative into consideration

334
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,279
Your family is in trouble

335
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,960
Humanitarian compensation to Cao Fei

336
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,320
Come

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,320
You confirm the amount

338
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,360
If there is no problem

339
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,400
Just sign the receipt

340
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,480
OK OK OK Don't cry

341
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:29,960
Don't cry anymore, don't cry anymore

342
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,799
You sign the receipt

343
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,000
Here

344
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,359
Just sign here

345
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,200
You are here at Window 11

346
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,240
Just withdraw money

347
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,799
good

348
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,440
Good for both

349
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,559
Please come here with me

350
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,039
Go well

351
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,720
Little Liu

352
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,119
These two are handling cash business

353
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,759
Show your ID card

354
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,960
Let's go

355
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,680
Wait for me

356
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,559
Hello, what business do you do

357
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,119
Hello, withdraw 50,000 yuan

358
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,519
Card you will collect it

359
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,680
Installed

360
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,440
Please wait a moment

361
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,480
The fifty thousand just now

362
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,559
Compensation in the factory

363
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,319
This is my personal statement

364
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,240
I know how much it costs

365
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,279
Can't even get a life back

366
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,279
Accept it

367
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,279
Please feel sorry for me

368
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,599
Let's go

369
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,599
I'm going to wait for a friend

370
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,400
Click again later

371
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,119
OK

372
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,119
My dad should scold me again when he goes back

373
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,920
As an administrative manager

374
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,160
I don't really agree with your approach

375
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,839
But as an ordinary person

376
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:12,960
I admire you

377
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,318
Thanks

378
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,200
Then I'll go back to the factory first

379
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,720
Liu Jun

380
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,039
Such a coincidence

381
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,799
I'll handle some financial matters

382
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,440
What about you to get a loan

383
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,359
Where can I get a loan

384
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,160
I'll deal with the compensation for the family members who died in the workplace

385
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,519
Have all been solved

386
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,960
Solved

387
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,119
That's good

388
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,319
OK, I'll go back first

389
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,319
taxi

390
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,839
Didn't you drive today

391
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,039
I won't fix it myself

392
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,000
Sent for maintenance

393
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,960
Then I'll give it to you

394
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,559
I just happened to go home too

395
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,920
Be sensible

396
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:13,960
bring it on

397
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,960
It's been awful lately

398
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,039
To deal with accidents

399
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,319
Thief is going to catch

400
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,839
After this accident

401
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,439
It is estimated that the loan will take off

402
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,680
I'm going to postpone the application again

403
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,519
Actually, now

404
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,680
It's not necessary to be in the four major industries

405
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,039
Have done it with the credit union

406
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,000
What's the meaning

407
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,039
Some time ago in the city

408
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,039
Just opened a joint-stock bank

409
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
Have you considered it

410
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,640
Yeah

411
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,359
I haven't really paid much attention to it

412
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,319
How to play joint-stock banks

413
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,279
It's definitely much more flexible than the four major industries

414
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,480
New businesses like you

415
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,440
It happened to be their business development

416
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,440
Major customers

417
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,119
I have a master

418
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Just been transferred to the supervisor of credit

419
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,160
Need my help asking

420
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,920
real

421
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,920
Would that be too troublesome to you

422
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll ask now

423
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,279
Thanks Thanks

424
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,160
Then we'll be about six o'clock

425
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,799
See you later

426
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:38,720
Get it done

427
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,799
It's such a great kindness

428
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,519
You should be my noble person now

429
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,839
Don't thank you so early

430
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,359
I'm just making a wire

431
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,880
How to talk about this specifically?

432
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,279
I can't control it

433
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,720
Already very helpful

434
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,519
Completed Completed Completed

435
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:07,599
Hello

436
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,079
Are you here or not

437
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,480
Sorry, sorry

438
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,039
I'll forget about it

439
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,079
There's something to eat tonight

440
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,000
I, have you arrived

441
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,079
Of course I've arrived

442
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,839
It's about 5:30 now

443
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,680
I'm not dealing with that

444
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,440
Is the work accident?

445
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,680
I just finished processing

446
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:33,799
Then when will you come here

447
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,920
Sorry, Shanshan

448
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,640
I'm having some trouble temporarily

449
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,440
This is related to the factory's loan

450
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,119
I promise

451
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,920
careful

452
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,839
Who is speaking

453
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,079
Is it Lin Chuan again

454
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,759
right

455
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,079
Very coincidental

456
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,559
Met at the bank entrance

457
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,759
I'll take her somewhere along the way

458
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,559
Liu Jun

459
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,039
Do you think I'm very good at cheating?

460
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,880
What to deal with loans and work deaths

461
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,000
It turns out that I want to accompany Lin Chuan

462
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:05,480
no

463
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:07,400
OK, please accompany you

464
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,759
I won't bother you

465
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:09,839
Shanshan

466
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,720
You and Yu Shanshan are together

467
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,279
yes

468
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,039
It's understandable

469
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,440
What a beautiful girl

470
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Always make people

471
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,039
Unforgettable at first sight

472
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,799
Actually, after the experiment

473
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,759
No contact

474
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,599
That's the recent

475
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Just got better recently

476
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,000
It sounds like you forgot to date

477
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,359
There's nothing to say

478
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,880
Seriously apologize

479
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,240
Let's coax it

480
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,759
Forget it, I'm driving now

481
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,799
Let's go for a while

482
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,200
Wait for her to calm down

483
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:46,759
Liu Jun

484
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:53,839
Hello

485
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,039
Hello Hello Hello

486
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,039
Hello Hello Hello Hello

487
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,519
Look at Xiao Taozi

488
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,400
Is it good for us to move a new home

489
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,599
This

490
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:17,240
You like this building

491
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,240
So big

492
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,559
Isn't this a little small

493
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,440
No matter how you have to be more than two hundred square meters

494
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,640
Two hundred square meters

495
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:27,960
That's better than our director's house

496
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,000
The houses are big

497
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,839
Your director can't afford this house

498
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:31,839
Yeah

499
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,000
This property

500
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,599
Large apartment with a size of more than 200 square meters

501
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,039
There are three sets

502
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,400
I've probably looked at it just now

503
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,680
I think E2

504
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,119
This apartment is the best

505
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,200
Look

506
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,880
Inside the Atrium

507
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,720
No obstruction in front and behind

508
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,400
Two hundred and eighty square meters

509
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,880
Absolute King of Buildings

510
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,680
I like this

511
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,559
The living room is so big

512
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,640
How bright

513
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:58,960
Focus on this

514
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,440
Ah Jun

515
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,200
Four million to be credited

516
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,000
Still small joint-stock banks are highly efficient

517
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,359
Just a few days

518
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,559
Just approved

519
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,279
I'll tell you Ah Jun

520
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,160
Repay the private loan quickly

521
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,480
This is a little less pressure

522
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,359
I'm leaving

523
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,200
dad

524
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,559
I want to discuss it with you

525
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,640
In addition to the four million loans from this bank

526
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,359
Private financing part

527
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,119
I want to keep it, too

528
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,480
Leave at least two million

529
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,680
Why

530
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,559
Our profit recently

531
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,839
It's accumulated quite well

532
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,640
High interest money can no longer be used

533
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,240
Hard-earned money

534
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,839
All paid back the interest

535
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,160
No matter how you think, why not make a profit

536
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,799
Even if this private loan doesn't make money

537
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,599
But the four hundred loans from the bank

538
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,000
Add these two hundred

539
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:51,960
Our capacity scale

540
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,160
It's completely different

541
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,000
Expanded production capacity

542
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,759
The financial statements are pretty good

543
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,920
The financial statements are good

544
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,720
Our bank entry and exit records

545
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,640
It's even more beautiful

546
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,200
Then we'll get it next time

547
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,759
Higher low interest loans

548
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,759
Then we take off and enter

549
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,200
A complete virtuous cycle

550
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,160
The battle makes you become more and more powerful

551
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,200
OK

552
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:17,720
Stop looking

553
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,359
How many differences

554
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,720
Go back so late

555
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,480
Don't stay alone in the company

556
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,200
By the way

557
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,839
Tomorrow is the 21st century

558
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,000
First New Year's Day

559
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,519
Take your girlfriend out for fun

560
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,759
Don't stay here

561
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,559
You young people don't like to call me

562
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,960
Happy New Year's Eve to New Year's Eve

563
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,039
OK I understand

564
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,759
I have no arrangements

565
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,279
What's wrong

566
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,680
Have a fight with my girlfriend

567
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,000
Called her for several days

568
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,720
No answer

569
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,880
Just quarrel

570
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm most annoyed by the cold war

571
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,440
Is there anything I can say in person?

572
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,680
Ajun, I'll tell you

573
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,119
Your girlfriend's condition

574
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,039
Dad doesn't like it

575
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,519
She's still shaking your face

576
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,119
dad

577
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,519
OK, don't say it, don't say it anymore

578
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,200
Dad won't make you angry

579
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,359
It's New Year's Eve tonight

580
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,319
How did you go through it

581
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,119
How can we live together?

582
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,039
Ajun's father thought

583
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,880
You young people

584
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,839
It must have its own arrangement

585
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,599
so

586
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,319
Dad made an appointment with some old friends

587
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,000
What old friends should I go together

588
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,799
No, no

589
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:18,160
Don't you see your past few years

590
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,720
Many uncles don't know you anymore

591
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,119
You're embarrassed to sit together

592
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,279
That's it

593
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,240
Dad is gone

594
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,599
Ah Jun

595
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,039
Happy New Year

596
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,119
Happy New Year

597
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,440
I don't know what uncle

598
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,720
I think

599
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,759
If you like the height

600
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,160
Then buy the top floor

601
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,119
This is the most popular

602
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
And now sales control

603
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,640
Basically no buy outside

604
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,079
But I have a way

605
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Determine a set for you

606
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,200
This second top level

607
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,240
Would it be too high

608
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,440
I'm afraid even if I think about it

609
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,240
Not high

610
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
It's because you haven't been there

611
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,519
Such a high place

612
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,599
you do not know

613
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,839
The night view of the city from the tall buildings

614
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,319
That's so beautiful

615
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,920
Yeah

616
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,279
It's New Year's Day tomorrow

617
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,480
Let's go to Shanghai

618
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,079
Go to a high-end hotel

619
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,680
Open a top-floor room

620
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,160
Let you and Xiao Taozi

621
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,359
Experience in advance

622
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,799
Is the little peach good?

623
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,599
Sister, let's go together

624
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:17,160
I won't go

625
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,440
I have something to do here

626
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,480
What's wrong

627
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,039
Didn't you say there was no schedule on New Year's Day?

628
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,039
It's the company that doesn't have a schedule

629
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,359
But I made an appointment with Sister Sun for dinner

630
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,119
shop

631
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,279
It's not good to say I won't go now

632
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:31,920
Too

633
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,680
Then let's go next time

634
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:34,440
good

635
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,680
Little Taozi

636
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,240
Dad takes you and mom

637
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,160
Is it good to go to Shanghai to see the night view

638
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,400
I'm downstairs of your house

639
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,960
Can you come down

640
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:33,840
Jiali

641
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That box of imported mangoes for Liu Jun

642
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:37,719
Put the door

643
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,480
Wait for him to greet the New Year

644
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,440
Take him away

645
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:41,039
This is good

646
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,079
Hongming Liu Jun’s girlfriend is coming

647
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,000
Do you want to prepare some gifts for her?

648
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,360
You don't have to worry about this

649
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,719
I heard I just blew it

650
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,199
Blowed

651
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,280
Why did you blow so quickly

652
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,000
It's not right to get along

653
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,199
Then you didn't mean they were both

654
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,400
Are they all studying engineering?

655
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,760
How could it be inappropriate

656
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,199
It would be better if there were other professionals

657
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,199
Everyone can complement each other in a row

658
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,639
But in the field of engineering

659
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,719
Their level is too different

660
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,960
How many words can I talk about in a serious chat

661
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,559
You both said it was off topic

662
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,000
In love

663
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,519
Not recruiting

664
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,280
Why are you still professional

665
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,280
Let's talk about it

666
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,559
Still not love enough

667
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,239
The relationship is not that deep

668
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,360
Who can compete with us

669
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,199
Yes

670
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,760
No one is better than you

671
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,519
You should be careful

672
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,480
Don't buy it

673
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,960
Are the internal organs cleared

674
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,800
Fortunately, it has been cleaned

675
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,000
You say it's pitiful

676
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,199
There is no one at home to cook

677
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,559
The hotel is not open

678
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,760
Others have a good meal for the New Year

679
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,039
Our family celebrates the New Year

680
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,159
It would be nice to have a cooked meal

681
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,519
Go and answer the phone

682
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:14,960
Hello

683
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,840
Good New Year

684
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,960
Greetings to you

685
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,840
See you after that year

686
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,599
Girl

687
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,440
No

688
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,559
Have some old friends for dad

689
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,719
Uncle Pi

690
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,719
Yes, you know him

691
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,320
Say I'll give it to you

692
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,199
What about introducing a girlfriend

693
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,239
Good conditions at home

694
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,199
Beautiful

695
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,400
But dad didn't agree

696
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,760
Dad is afraid you will be unhappy

697
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:03,880
Do you think it's up

698
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:05,360
Arrange to meet after the New Year

699
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,760
Dad, I'm thinking about my job after the New Year

700
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,159
Didn't think of anything else

701
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,719
Is there anyone? Is there anyone?

702
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,719
It's so boring to stay up with your elders

703
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,239
Let's get together in the third year of junior high school

704
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,239
OK

705
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,320
Didn't you say you wanted to play court last time

706
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,599
That's my strong point

707
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,679
Definitely crush you

708
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,239
Show off

709
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:19,880
Who disgusted

710
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:20,880
This is the New Year

711
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Who is disgusting?

712
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,519
Who stood up for me

713
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,960
This is too bullying

714
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,039
I'll tell you

715
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,159
I, Liushitang, is not easy to mess with

716
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,639
Too bad for this

717
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,280
You come out for me

718
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,159
I won't spare you

719
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,159
dad

720
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:35,880
dad

721
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,400
No matter who I did it

722
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,400
If you have the ability, come out for me

723
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,440
What's wrong

724
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,519
Too bullying

725
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,360
This is the New Year

726
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,400
Will you let me celebrate the New Year

727
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:45,920
I'll tell you to call the police

728
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,920
Call the police

729
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:48,920
Dad

730
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,480
There is no camera in your community

731
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:52,559
Where do you ask the police to catch them?

732
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,760
You go in first

733
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Let's take this car back

734
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:55,599
Move to the factory

735
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:56,760
You'll stop opening these days

736
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,480
Can you avoid being missed?

737
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,239
I'll scold you for a while

738
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,119
It's raining now

739
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,239
I'll tell you

740
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,840
Careful blood pressure

741
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,280
Not easy to bully

742
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,079
This is a ruin of my fortune during the New Year

743
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,280
Break my Liushitang's wealth

744
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Resolutely not

745
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,000
How to accept or not

746
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,800
Is there any motivation

747
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,280
I won't fight you or not

748
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,639
You won two games

749
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,719
I'll have another five games and three wins later

750
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,880
I'm in the factory every day

751
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,679
I can't beat you one

752
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,920
Take a stadium every day

753
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,760
I don't want to play basketball every day either

754
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,239
But what my dad wants me to do

755
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,079
I don't want to do it

756
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,000
What I want to do

757
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,199
My dad doesn't let me do it

758
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,119
What does your dad want you to do

759
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,719
He wants me to enter the city

760
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,199
But I'm annoyed Lin Yue

761
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,360
I won't go

762
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,440
Why did Lin Yue provoke you

763
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:04,960
I'll tell you

764
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,679
He's the person

765
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,159
Pure small farmers' consciousness

766
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,440
There's only money in your eyes

767
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:10,679
That eye world

768
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,840
You can see a place one meter away

769
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,719
That's good

770
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,599
You don't know

771
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:15,599
Our two partners cooperate

772
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Real estate projects

773
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,199
Too hot

774
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,559
It's your old factory and Qianxing factory

775
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,679
Demolition of the land

776
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,400
That's right, those places

777
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,039
You said that all the places are in the city center

778
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,519
Such a good plot

779
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,198
Should we use it to create some

780
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,159
High-end property

781
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:33,920
For our East China Sea

782
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,840
Building a new landmark

783
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,800
Let the people just mention good houses

784
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,679
You can think of our home

785
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,559
It sounds quite reasonable

786
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,079
Look, I said yes

787
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:43,800
But what about Lin Yue

788
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,679
Nothing to consider the future at all

789
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,880
Not considering building for the company

790
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,639
Good image

791
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,079
I wish I could put every building

792
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,119
All the shops are built below

793
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,039
Sell it for money

794
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:52,960
The property environment is a mess

795
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,440
Just for this

796
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:56,159
Our two families have been in a row for more than half a year

797
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,960
Development progress has been there

798
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,639
Some time ago

799
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:04,119
I want to join forces with you

800
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,199
He was responsible for the city's one machine

801
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,239
He can't hold on

802
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,639
Let him quit on his own initiative
