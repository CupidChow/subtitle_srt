(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,078
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,089
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,090
(Staff ensured the safety of children and animals in the drama.)

5
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:14,309
They must have gone far by now.

6
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,880
I would love to stay here with you in my arms.

7
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,419
But I need a moment to see what they are up to.

8
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,190
Stay put and wait here.

9
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,509
I will be back soon.

10
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,609
I love you, my lord.

11
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:57,609
I died...

12
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,789
in the hands of my lover.

13
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,819
And...

14
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,190
I did not cross over...

15
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,460
to the other side or was welcomed by the Grim Reaper.

16
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,870
I became...

17
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,798
(The first reincarnation)

18
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,339
the poltergeist of the woman who killed me.

19
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,840
(The first reincarnation)

20
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,380
(The tenth reincarnation)

21
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,119
(The 16th reincarnation)

22
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,380
I did not know...

23
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,049
- Bye. - this curse...

24
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:41,258
would last for 1,500 years.

25
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,319
(The 17th reincarnation)

26
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,728
There is only one way to end...

27
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:47,029
- We demand your resignation! - We demand your resignation!

28
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,199
this eternal torture.

29
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,130
Taking the life...

30
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,930
of her reincarnation with my hands.

31
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,769
That is the way to lift this curse.

32
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:01,340
Wait.

33
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,549
What is going on?

34
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,389
What happened?

35
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,590
I clearly remember you in the emergency room...

36
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,960
He passed away...

37
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,359
at 5:29:58pm.

38
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,070
No way.

39
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,840
I really must have a guardian deity.

40
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,070
A guardian deity?

41
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,309
What a relief.

42
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,950
I'm so relieved.

43
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,890
Thank you for coming back.

44
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,160
I thought you were really dead.

45
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,390
Thank you.

46
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,960
Thank you so much.

47
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,229
Are you that happy to have me back?

48
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,970
You hugged me first.

49
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,108
You could've just talked to me. Why did you scare me?

50
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:12,809
It took a long time...

51
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,249
until I got to stand here before you.

52
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,090
"A long time?"

53
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,660
Are you filming a period drama? The way you talk is odd.

54
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,530
Did you hurt your head?

55
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:32,770
Do not worry about me.

56
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
My mind is clearer than ever.

57
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,270
I don't think so.

58
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,580
Your mind does not seem clear.

59
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:45,780
What are you...

60
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,160
- Give it back. I guess it was... - It will not take long.

61
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:01,559
Mr. Han.

62
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,799
Are you sure you aren't ill?

63
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:07,669
My lord.

64
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:11,410
Do you not feel ill?

65
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,010
You might be feverish.

66
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,289
Mr. Han.

67
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,629
Wake up, Mr. Han.

68
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,999
Mr. Han!

69
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:40,499
(Moon in the Day)

70
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:42,140
What?

71
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:43,840
What do you mean, his body is gone?

72
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,009
His body isn't in the mortuary?

73
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,938
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

74
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,309
What are you talking about?

75
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,450
(Medical Center)

76
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:06,229
Mr. Han!

77
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,629
What happened?

78
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,529
He isn't in the mortuary.

79
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,969
Have you checked with the hospital staff?

80
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,570
I checked with everyone who worked here,

81
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,700
but they all told me the same story.

82
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:18,910
That Jun O...

83
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,879
came back alive and walked out.

84
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,280
I mean, we were there...

85
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,649
as witnesses when he was...

86
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,080
declared dead.

87
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,020
So how can this...

88
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:36,289
Do you think there may have been a miracle?

89
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,429
(Seoul Neungil University Hospital)

90
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,640
I still have a body.

91
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,619
Why was I unable to take her life?

92
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,749
Wait.

93
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,789
You might be feverish.

94
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,729
It was not a coincidence.

95
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,299
Something is protecting her.

96
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,280
Come back, Jun O.

97
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,350
If you aren't here,

98
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,389
I'll get fired.

99
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,659
Hello.

100
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,359
My name is Jang Yoon Je, and I will start working for you...

101
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,259
as of today.

102
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,930
I will make sure your journey is...

103
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,700
only filled with flowery paths.

104
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,210
What was that?

105
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,040
Someone get the security! There's a weird guy here.

106
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,609
Don't die.

107
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,778
Are these memories left behind in this body?

108
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:10,820
Wake up.

109
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,820
- How unnecessary. - Wake up.

110
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,779
The exam result is the same.

111
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,488
Not only is the tumour malignant...

112
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:21,619
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

113
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,960
He came back like a miracle.

114
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:29,228
He'll fall in bigger shock if he finds out he'll die again.

115
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,999
He may suffer from a shock at any moment.

116
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,299
The crash at Han River...

117
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,139
- may be related to his condition... - The only thing I ask for is...

118
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,909
keeping Jun O's condition secret...

119
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,080
unless the police make an official request.

120
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,820
That is all.

121
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,090
Is that clear?

122
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,889
Do you know one thing...

123
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,420
I heard the most when I was younger?

124
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:03,629
"You're nothing like your brother."

125
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,029
I've heard that a few times too.

126
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:10,100
Did you just chuckle? My gosh.

127
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,139
Man, I cried.

128
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,339
I mean, how could I be like you,

129
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,710
the school president who was also the top of the class?

130
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,248
Why are you suddenly all modest?

131
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:24,118
But I became the successor of an affluent family,

132
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:26,049
then graduated Harvard like three times.

133
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,320
And I played a deity in my début work.

134
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,029
I know it's you, but you can't beat a deity.

135
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,159
You're right. I can never beat you.

136
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,330
I want to continue to live my life in front of cameras.

137
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,229
So, don't tell anyone that I collapsed.

138
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,070
All right.

139
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,969
But just until the result comes in.

140
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,209
You know my life as a star ends...

141
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,840
the moment I seem ill and pitiful, right?

142
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,440
Even if I die tomorrow, I want to die as a star.

143
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
I won't go back...

144
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,350
to living life as Han Min O's inferior brother.

145
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,060
Please keep your promise. Okay?

146
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:17,840
I thought...

147
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,868
Han Jun O was refusing interviews...

148
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:22,079
until his condition got better.

149
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,238
What's going on?

150
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,979
This one doesn't concern him.

151
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,479
I wanted to ask for another favour.

152
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:38,989
("Gu Tae Ju's Alleged Affair Raises Questions")

153
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:39,989
("Does He Continue to Deserve to Play Lead Roles in Dramas?")

154
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:42,398
(- Baby, is the chairman home? - No, he's away for a week.)

155
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,259
(Gu Tae Ju, A)

156
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,399
Reporter Kim, you also heard...

157
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:49,269
about Gu Tae Ju's alleged affair, haven't you?

158
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,499
It wasn't just a rumour after all, right?

159
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,689
If something happens to him...

160
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,019
Let's have the production announcement...

161
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:10,690
for his drama as scheduled.

162
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,430
(Patient Name: Kang Y. Hwa)

163
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,839
My gosh.

164
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,040
Why did he collapse again only to make me concerned?

165
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,519
Han Jun O?

166
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,330
Is he up?

167
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,729
Han Jun O?

168
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,399
Han Jun O!

169
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:55,899
Kang Young Hwa.

170
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:00,040
Go anywhere you want.

171
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,050
This time, I will make sure...

172
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,420
I kill you.

173
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,119
- No way! - My gosh!

174
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:21,899
See? I told you it was Jun O!

175
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,629
I'm a huge fan.

176
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:27,529
Anyway, did you really come back from death?

177
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,969
May I...

178
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,540
Hey! Are you crazy?

179
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:33,869
He's so good-looking.

180
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,339
Move aside.

181
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,378
He has such a great voice!

182
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,609
Excuse me! Coming through!

183
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,278
We're on the first floor of the VIP ward.

184
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,180
I request an emergency escort for Mr. Han Jun O.

185
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,590
What are you doing?

186
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,858
You should've woken me up when you got up!

187
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:50,820
Why did you go out and walk around alone?

188
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,659
(Top Star Han Jun O did not do anything wrong!)

189
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,129
"Top star Han Jun O?"

190
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,670
Yes, Mr. Top Star.

191
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,800
You're no longer the nation's boyfriend,

192
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,570
but the resurrected boyfriend.

193
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,479
My goodness. What if you had died?

194
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:12,579
Jun O...

195
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,479
(Seoul Neungil University Hospital)

196
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,979
Does this always happen to me?

197
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,680
Are you kidding me?

198
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,489
Everyone is making a scene looking for you on the first floor.

199
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,629
Top star Han Jun O.

200
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:27,529
What are you doing right now?

201
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,129
Testing.

202
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,269
Hey, wait!

203
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,869
Mr. Han! Do you remember what happened to you?

204
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,908
Mr. Han! Do you have anything to say about your condition?

205
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,539
- He's here. - Excuse me!

206
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,638
- Excuse me! - Say something!

207
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,549
- Just one word! - Please don't do this.

208
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,608
Excuse me!

209
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:48,778
- How are you doing now? - Coming through.

210
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:49,949
Please escort him.

211
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,680
Did I come into the wrong body?

212
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,550
That would be disconcerting.

213
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,389
Han Jun O the top star?

214
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,659
- Jun O! - Jun O!

215
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,829
- Jun O! - Jun O! I love you!

216
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,469
- I love you! - Jun O!

217
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,300
I missed you, Jun O!

218
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,470
I cried all day when I thought he had really died.

219
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,268
Then, I heard he was fine.

220
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:13,939
My friends and I came by...

221
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,039
wondering if we could see him.

222
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,209
Han Jun O's agency, Beginning Entertainment, stated...

223
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,449
- he needs more time to rest... - Even death went past him.

224
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,449
- after the recent incident. - He's so cool.

225
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,478
- He plans to take a hiatus... - Look at him.

226
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,419
- and rest for a while. - I hope he's okay.

227
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,859
Yi Seul, I guess he really came back alive.

228
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:31,720
Anyway.

229
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,089
You really won't visit him?

230
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,969
Fans and those in the industry wished him well...

231
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,399
We broke up. Why would I do that?

232
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:43,300
I would've visited him if he had died,

233
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:44,899
but he was alive.

234
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,609
Yes, right. He's alive.

235
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,509
- Isn't that Gu Tae Ju? - Hey, you.

236
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,019
They made this quick decision...

237
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,820
Why won't you pick up your phone?

238
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:00,019
Why should I?

239
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,060
You're out of the drama production.

240
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,359
How can he be so brazen? That's so shameless.

241
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,898
Can you raise the volume?

242
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:12,229
His fan club announced their decision to disorganize.

243
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,070
This scandal caused a huge shock.

244
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,099
The alleged woman, Park of S Group,

245
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,608
denied the suspicion...

246
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,069
and announced she would hold people responsible...

247
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,810
- for spreading false information. - No.

248
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:25,879
- Gu Tae Ju's agency said... - I was deceived into this!

249
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,780
How can you get caught for having an affair?

250
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:30,520
That's so low.

251
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,590
- Who's behind this? - I wonder.

252
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,919
The security was very high.

253
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,090
Here too.

254
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,230
What is this?

255
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,899
Who did this?

256
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,540
It was Han Min O.

257
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,369
He blackmailed me and said...

258
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,709
he'd expose everything if I don't do this drama with Jun O.

259
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,980
What?

260
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,280
He had always been a sociopath only concerned about his brother,

261
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,050
but he never went this far.

262
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,719
Jun O must have threatened to take his life.

263
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:08,219
That's how...

264
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,119
you ended up like this, Tae Ju.

265
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,990
Are you saying his resurrection...

266
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,030
was just...

267
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,329
a lie?

268
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,429
He's not a deity.

269
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,169
The firefighter who saved him was probably bribed too.

270
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:27,209
That crazy jerk.

271
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,010
Those con artists.

272
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:45,119
(Beginning's CEO Han Min O)

273
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,159
Anyway, Jun O.

274
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,468
Where are we going, and why can't I pick up my phone?

275
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:54,829
I need to know where...

276
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,939
- Kang Young Hwa. - Who?

277
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,240
The firefighter who saved you?

278
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,209
Why?

279
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,280
Did you fall for the saviour of your life?

280
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,750
Because you got mad at Yi Seul?

281
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,990
Well, I guess you have a better chance with that woman.

282
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,019
Do not dare to be quick with your mouth.

283
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,158
If you do, you would rather beg me to kill you.

284
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,658
Jun O, I'm behind the wheel.

285
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:23,800
Let go of me.

286
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,850
- What is this? - Come this way.

287
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,079
What is it?

288
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,109
Ta-Da.

289
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,219
"Firefighter of the Month, Senior Firefighter Kang Young Hwa."

290
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,419
"This brave firefighter is..."

291
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:52,489
"awarded as the firefighter of the month."

292
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,659
Safety.

293
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,030
Safety.

294
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,128
All of a sudden?

295
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:02,739
You always wanted to win this award.

296
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,799
Yes.

297
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,010
You granted my wish, so I'm granting one for you.

298
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:08,169
I did? Your wish?

299
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:12,079
- Gosh, great job! - What is it?

300
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,179
I'm so proud of you, girl.

301
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,320
Do you know how desperately I prayed...

302
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:18,918
to bring Jun O back?

303
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,350
What? You were Han Jun O's fan too?

304
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,959
Hey, come and have a drink.

305
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:24,659
Okay.

306
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,669
Han Jun O?

307
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,040
What?

308
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,909
Was it a ghost? What was it?

309
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,379
It doesn't make sense.

310
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,949
Whatever protects you,

311
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:27,419
at least I should fight one more time.

312
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,159
What was...

313
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,469
What are you doing here?

314
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,600
There's blood on your hand.

315
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:46,909
- Are you hurt? - Don't come to me.

316
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:49,580
What are you doing now?

317
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,810
You are the one who has suddenly shown up.

318
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,580
That is...

319
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,949
Mr. Han!

320
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:09,800
I'm so sorry. If my phone weren't stolen...

321
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,699
By the way,

322
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,999
Jun O looks very strange.

323
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Where is it?

324
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:17,969
This way.

325
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:21,139
What was it that was protecting you?

326
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,209
You are surely ill.

327
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:26,550
You are severely ill.

328
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:29,719
Jun O,

329
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,990
I'm glad you came to your senses, but...

330
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,760
I'm Jun O's guardian.

331
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,760
If you are with him, please get my call.

332
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,129
What does this mean?

333
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,600
You came here in secret?

334
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,209
Give it back.

335
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:56,139
Finally, you see me now.

336
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,750
Finally...

337
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,219
Finally, you see me now.

338
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,218
You came here for this?

339
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:10,320
You came here to revenge me?

340
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,959
Hey!

341
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,330
Answer me!

342
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,560
What is it that protects you?

343
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:18,869
Gosh...

344
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,500
Goodness.

345
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,010
Do you know...

346
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,080
what firefighters are the most afraid of?

347
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,080
It's losing one's life just before them.

348
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,250
So I truly wished...

349
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,590
I had a guardian deity.

350
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,159
Because I did want to save you.

351
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,459
But your question was wrong.

352
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:50,830
If there's any guardian deity around me,

353
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,368
it doesn't protect me.

354
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,299
It will save people I want to keep safe instead.

355
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
You got it?

356
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Young Hwa.

357
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:06,209
Don't call my name! Are you a friend of mine or something?

358
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,679
I know this because I've experienced this a few times.

359
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,619
It's not right to act like this to a person who saved you.

360
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:17,859
I will let you go just because you are still alive after that.

361
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:20,030
Don't ever show up before me.

362
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,500
I will call the police and report that you are a stalker!

363
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Jun O!

364
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:40,280
Are you okay?

365
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,320
What happened to your hands?

366
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,100
I cannot kill her...

367
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,439
in this way.

368
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,300
As she will block all my attacks.

369
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,439
What should I do?

370
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,240
What can I do?

371
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:26,729
(Han Min O)

372
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,658
(Kang Young Hwa, Seoul Neungil University Hospital)

373
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:30,230
It sounds like an excuse.

374
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,669
But it's all true.

375
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,800
So,

376
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,540
all of his behaviour is because of his trauma?

377
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,639
That's what the doctor said.

378
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,340
The obsession with the person who saved his life is...

379
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:45,709
because of the fear in the spot.

380
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,179
The reason he reached you first would be...

381
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,879
the same as well.

382
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:55,689
That's why he said such ridiculous things.

383
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:00,629
I'm leaving soon.

384
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:03,358
Please make sure Jun O is coming back in safe.

385
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,330
(To Jang Yoon Je)

386
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,040
I will get you a new phone.

387
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:16,939
And...

388
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,609
I don't think this will happen,

389
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:21,678
but even if he reaches you again...

390
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,149
Maybe he doesn't know about it.

391
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,350
What do you mean?

392
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:26,889
The trauma.

393
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,689
Maybe he himself can be the last one to know about it.

394
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,128
It's because of my job.

395
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:37,730
I know pretty well about trauma.

396
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,429
I should understand it.

397
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,379
Fans sent you a lot of gifts.

398
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,550
(The Revived Boyfriend, Han Jun O)

399
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,859
Top star Han Jun O...

400
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,639
Why are you standing there? You make me awkward.

401
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,409
Come over here. Let's treat the cut.

402
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,179
Jun O, what's wrong?

403
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,490
Something is wrong?

404
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,959
Don't mind my business...

405
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,129
What was the voice?

406
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,859
It's because you lower your voice against your will.

407
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:22,939
Jun O, what kind of person were you...

408
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,600
Don't bother too much.

409
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:27,740
You came back not long ago.

410
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,010
I will take care of the rest.

411
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:33,149
What can you do...

412
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,419
for me?

413
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,919
Okay. I should've taken care of you more.

414
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,649
Jun O.

415
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:47,990
Would this be the answer to you?

(Nakrang: The Romance)

417
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,199
You really wanted to shoot this.

418
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:54,868
When an opportunity comes, you should take it.

419
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:57,439
Take it and make it yours.

420
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,639
The same opportunity...

421
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:02,840
may not come ever again.

422
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,859
The way he speaks and his eyes have changed a lot.

423
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:23,199
Is it a usual symptom of trauma?

424
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,730
It was a terrible accident.

425
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,800
The way he speaks and his behaviour can vary a lot,

426
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,570
but those will be temporary.

427
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,810
Please don't say anything about it before him.

428
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,340
It can worsen the symptoms.

429
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,320
(Kang Young Hwa, Seoul Neungil University Hospital)

430
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:52,119
Hope he went back home safely.

431
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,260
He didn't look fine, even at a glance.

432
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,070
The trauma will pressure him a lot.

433
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,810
Have you recently seen a scary movie or read a scary book?

434
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,050
What are these all about?

435
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,560
She said someone kept chasing her.

436
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:26,490
Sorry?

(Nakrang: The Romance)

438
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:58,320
How can this kind of relationship play...

439
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,030
be an opportunity for me?

440
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:08,570
(What do you mean by soldiers?)

441
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,539
(The princess of Nakrang is an amulet...)

442
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,968
(that protects the country.)

443
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:19,080
(Once you get rid of the princess, Nakrang will be destroyed.)

444
00:31:20,949 --> 00:31:21,980
An amulet?

445
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,219
What is that?

446
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,530
So? Do I look pretty?

447
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:42,199
Excuse me?

448
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,139
Sir!

449
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,540
That's it.

450
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:53,679
She still...

451
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,619
has the amulet.

452
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,629
Indeed, this can be an opportunity...

453
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:14,530
that may not come...

454
00:32:16,469 --> 00:32:17,469
ever again.

455
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,230
Why?

456
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,100
Does Lord Do Ha still have trouble sleeping?

457
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,780
Do you think you are the first one to try this?

458
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,480
Who sent you?

459
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:23,259
My family and my parents that you murdered sent me.

460
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,069
Then,

461
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:30,369
did you come here for your revenge?

462
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:34,109
Revenge is not enough when I think about the sad cry...

463
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,040
of my dead family!

464
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,480
Lord, is everything all right?

465
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,679
I heard something.

466
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,580
You should keep your mouth shut first.

467
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,989
It's just a rat.

468
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,730
You are dismissed.

469
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,659
Yes, my lord.

470
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:22,790
How is your injury?

471
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,190
The injury won't stop me.

472
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:30,029
You are still out of your mind.

473
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,238
You can come at me with the injured arm...

474
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,400
and die like a dog.

475
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,540
Or you can survive...

476
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,080
and plan for the future.

477
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:51,750
You are trying to humiliate me, but it won't work.

478
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,920
Just kill me.

479
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,060
Did I not tell you already?

480
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,429
Killing you is easy.

481
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:05,600
For an arrogant girl like you,

482
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,730
you need a proper punishment that suits you.

483
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,969
Good choice.

484
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,839
You can't do it!

485
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,298
The press conference for the drama...

486
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:47,238
is also for Jun O's comeback.

487
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,540
- Why are you against it? - It's just...

488
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:50,909
He's not sane.

489
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,850
He strangled me.

490
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:55,380
And he even threw the phone.

491
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:58,350
He's way too strong too.

492
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,818
The way he speaks is scary too.

493
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,088
It's due to his trauma, so it's temporary.

494
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:05,689
No. It's beyond that.

495
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,789
He's not Jun O that we knew.

496
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,830
Jun O.

497
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400

498
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:15,798
People will think I'm crazy if you say it like that.

499
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:16,839
What's wrong with you?

500
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,009
Did you call me Yoon Je?

501
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,639
Are you back to your normal self?

502
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:29,150
Hey, Jun O!

503
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:35,290
Keep smiling like that, so no one will get suspicious.

504
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,560
I need help to look like...

505
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:40,529
real Han Jun O.

506
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,060
Real Jun O?

507
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,170
What?

508
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:53,639
Mr. Jang, are you all right?

509
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,319
I want to ask you a favour.

510
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,919
The viewers loved it.

511
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,059
Did you feel the pressure about the popularity and ratings...

512
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,719
of the following work, "Nakrang: The Romance?"

513
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,089
- The pressure about the ratings? - Yes.

514
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,299
I want to say that I'd rather feel confident.

515
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,630
Since this is my second work with Mr. Han Jun O,

516
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:22,899
I think the chemistry...

517
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,940
between the two main characters will be greater.

518
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,738
I see. Can you give us a spoiler...

519
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,408
about a scene...

520
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:31,909
filled with chemistry?

521
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,149
- Why did you ask me to come here? - Overall,

522
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,679
- Jun O said... - there were many scenes with him.

523
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,278
he wanted to tell you something.

524
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:40,448
The scene I look forward to the most is...

525
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:43,388
the first encounter between the two main characters.

526
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:44,459
In order to destroy the amulet,

527
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,028
Without knowing their fate, they meet under the moon.

528
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:49,088
I need to keep her near me and find the gap.

529
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:50,758
I wonder how beautiful the scene will be.

530
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:54,399
We'll ask Han Jun O this time.

531
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,798
It's fair to say everyone is focused on Jun O...

532
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,409
who came back from the death.

533
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,409
It feels like you're making an unexpectedly fast comeback.

534
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,479
Is there a particular reason behind it?

("Nakrang: The Romance" The First Episode in August)

536
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,819
But first,

537
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:19,460
I want to express my gratitude...

to Ms. Kang Young Hwa, the firefighter who saved my life.

I'll promise you...

542
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,610
that I won't miss the opportunity you gave me.

00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,350
Is there a reason you came here?

554
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:20,088
We'll do a separate interview some other time.

555
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:21,588
I'm sorry. I'll get going.

556
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:23,289
- Ms. Kang Young Hwa! - How do you feel?

557
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,520
I didn't expect this.

558
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,060
She's running away.

559
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,859
Attention, please.

560
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,798
Since it's noisy inside,

561
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:33,500
we'll start again in a moment.

562
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,830
Jun O is...

563
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:37,440
Where are you going?

564
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,610
To the restroom? Yes.

565
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,179
We'll begin again in ten minutes once they are ready.

566
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:46,810
I'll be quick.

567
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,850
It's been a while, Jun O.

568
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,659
Is it our first time seeing each other...

569
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,460
after the breakup?

570
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
- I'll get going. - Hold on.

571
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,630
I apologize.

572
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:12,500
Come on. I was afraid you would leave me...

573
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,170
just like you came to me.

574
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,420
Attention, please.

575
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
It will begin In a short moment.

576
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:29,959
The press conference of the remake of the story...

577
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,289
between Prince Ho Dong and the princess of Nakrang...

578
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,119
in the oldest prince's perspective.

579
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:36,630
This beautiful and sad love epic, "Nakrang: The Romance,"

580
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:38,900
is the most anticipated piece this year.

581
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,929
The press conference will begin soon.

582
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:44,769
If you're waiting for the première...

583
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:45,969
Oh, gosh.

584
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:49,810
Seriously.

585
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:56,350
Where is it?

586
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,819
Oh, you scared me!

587
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:06,089
Do you know how strange you are? Do you think this is funny?

588
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:08,460
No. Do you think this hide-and-seek is funny?

589
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,299
You and I are different.

590
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,730
Don't tell other people about me.

591
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,540
It's my job to save lives,

592
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,409
and anyone would have saved you if they were in my shoes.

593
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,278
That day, I was coincidentally...

594
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:26,339
It had to be you.

595
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:30,350
If it weren't for you,

596
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:33,319
I would never be here.

597
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,319
The CEO was right.

598
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,159
He may look normal, but his condition is severe.

599
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:42,860
A trauma isn't easy to cure.

600
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:44,960
Let's do it then.

601
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:48,830
But keep your promise with me.

602
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,798
Don't miss this chance...

603
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:54,040
that you worked so hard for and do a good job.

604
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,980
And don't succumb, even in a rainstorm.

605
00:43:01,509 --> 00:43:02,949
Are you...

606
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,150
cheering me on or something?

607
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:11,520
If you're done being impressed, let's get going.

608
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:13,060
I'll have to get used to it.

609
00:43:14,889 --> 00:43:16,560
- Get used to what? - Your support.

610
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,599
Because I want it close to me forever.

611
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,439
The less you see a firefighter, the better.

612
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,770
Forever.

613
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:28,369
You can quit your job then.

614
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,639
What?

615
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,630
Stay by my side...

616
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,670
so that I can see you up close...

617
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,000
every day.

618
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,709
We worked really hard for "Nakrang: The Romance,"

619
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,718
so please show us a lot of support by watching it. Thank you.

620
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,319
It's time to go.

621
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:14,448
We have to open our shop now.

622
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:16,589
This is my first historical drama.

623
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,758
I'm practicing very hard...

624
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:20,830
- and studying my role... - Tae Ju.

625
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,799
How long are you going to keep this up?

626
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,270
How could I leave now...

627
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,400
when the production presentation isn't even over yet?

628
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:33,710
Yes.

629
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:37,678
Let's say a chant for the success of your drama.

630
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,909
- That is my spot. - In 1, 2, 3.

631
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:41,210
- Let's go! - Let's go!

632
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:45,279
It's my spot, you fraud!

633
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,819
Come on. They were all sponsored.

634
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:52,960
He used to beg me to hold hands,

635
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:55,029
but now he's smiling?

636
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,400
Didn't Jun O seem suspicious today?

637
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,799
He did. He was suspiciously...

638
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,069
handsome.

639
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,400
"Because I can never forget you."

640
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:06,939
So cool.

641
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,969
Gosh. Tell me about it.

642
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:10,509
He gave a surprise gift for another wench.

643
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:12,739
(Gieun Fire Station)

644
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,849
(Han Jun O)

645
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:17,480
(Han Jun O and Jung Yi Seul Admits Their Love?)

646
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,150
Who cares if he has a girlfriend or not?

647
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:30,630
Hello?

648
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,460
Yes, I reported a missing item.

649
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:36,770
No?

650
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,569
Did you check the waiting room?

651
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,810
Where's the amulet?

652
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,350
Where and how did she hide it?

653
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:58,690
I'm looking for a small temple.

654
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,189
A Buddhist monk who's similar in age to Young Hwa...

655
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:06,229
and another one who's haggard and old if he's still alive.

656
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,369
All you talk about is Young Hwa!

657
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,199
That stuff in your room is also for her, isn't it?

658
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:14,710
Have you lost your mind?

659
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,080
Are you trying to ruin your life?

660
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,610
Why do you care?

661
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:21,948
Who cares what happens to the life that isn't even mine?

662
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,649
It's not your life? What are you talking about?

663
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,250
Because no one died around Young Hwa so far.

664
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:29,389
There you go about Young Hwa again!

665
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,759
Wait.

666
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,919
A poltergeist is cursed to be restrained to a place,

667
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,230
so it can't freely roam around to find the deceased.

668
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:37,429
The day that Jun O died,

669
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,969
it merely found a body to possess.

670
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:46,069
Does that mean...

671
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,069
you're not Jun O?

672
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:51,610
Han Jun O...

673
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,409
is dead.

674
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:09,289
Possession...

675
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:12,400
and ghosts don't exist in this world.

676
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,600
What if they do?

677
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:21,940
Wait.

678
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,678
What's going on?

679
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,048
How on earth did you do that?

680
00:47:27,049 --> 00:47:29,049
Mom!

681
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,679
I'm still trying to figure out what I can do.

682
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,519
Gosh.

683
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,318
Lord. Buddha. The King of the underworld.

684
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,219
And who else?

685
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,190
They usually don't listen even if you beg.

686
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,799
Do you want me to leave?

687
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:45,329
Yes.

688
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,730
No. Yes, sir.

689
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,739
You're lucky.

690
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:53,969
Because I'm the one who wishes to leave.

691
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:56,710
Leave? For where?

692
00:47:57,279 --> 00:47:58,610
Where I came from.

693
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:01,580
I've returned so that I could leave.

694
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,279
So, find the temple...

695
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,520
if you want me to leave.

696
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,770
What are you doing outside? It's bedtime.

697
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,440
The wind is blowing lightly,

698
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:37,179
so we may have a guest.

699
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,250
It's already as boring as it is in the mountains.

700
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,420
I'd be thankful for any guests.

701
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:44,719
Am I right, Chief Monk?

702
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:03,540
You're a funny guy.

703
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,380
Stop acting like you're not scared.

704
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:09,909
What?

705
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:13,279
Hey, con artist.

706
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:17,259
You're a third-rate idol singer. How could you take my place?

707
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,889
Be gone now,

708
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,389
I may look past it.

709
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:22,830
What's with that speech?

710
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:30,400
What was the name...

711
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:32,839
of your accomplice?

712
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,139
Right.

713
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:40,710
Kang Young Hwa?

714
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:45,380
You know what? I could go and ask her myself.

715
00:49:46,179 --> 00:49:48,190
But what do I do?

716
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,690
I don't even have her number.

717
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:54,690
Gosh. When did you get here?

718
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:56,190
Whatever you do,

719
00:49:57,299 --> 00:49:58,830
I don't mind.

720
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,139
But if you mess with Young Hwa,

721
00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:07,869
I will...

722
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,380
kill you.

723
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:15,909
Whatever. You're just a loser.

724
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,588
Does it look like I'm lying?

725
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:23,049
You think you're getting me with your terrible acting?

726
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,460
Mark my words.

727
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:28,690
Mess with Young Hwa,

728
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,960
and you will not survive.

729
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,589
We must look past this issue.

730
00:50:56,589 --> 00:50:59,020
There's no point in borrowing trouble.

731
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:02,060
Is Mr. Jang ready yet?

732
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,869
Good evening.

733
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,039
I will be guarding you 24 hours a day, starting today.

734
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,239
My name is Park.

735
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:18,239
It was Mr. Han's orders.

736
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,350
I requested it.

737
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,880
Tae Ju might storm in again.

738
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:28,489
So,

739
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,290
he's going to stay by my side...

740
00:51:33,889 --> 00:51:35,630
- twenty-four hours a day? - Yes.

741
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,830
I won't take my eyes off you even for a moment.

742
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:44,540
What could a ghost do with this huge guy around?

743
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,610
Thank you. You came at the right time.

744
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,750
Yes, sir.

745
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,560
Jun O.

746
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:11,060
It seems that you should hire a new bodyguard.

747
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,969
Someone of my choosing.

748
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:24,540
Firefighter of the Month Award, Senior Firefighter Kang Young Hwa.

749
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,380
You have sincerely fulfilled your duties as a firefighter...

750
00:52:28,509 --> 00:52:31,079
to protect the people and property.

751
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,150
We hereby present you with this award.

752
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,119
May 20, 2023, Director Choi Bo Eun of the National Fire Agency.

753
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:41,589
(Firefighter of the Month Award Ceremony)

754
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,299
I've heard a lot about the Miraculous Firefighter.

755
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,928
You've become a model...

756
00:52:48,929 --> 00:52:51,900
to all the firefighters through Mr. Han's incident.

757
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:54,210
I'll keep doing my best.

758
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,540
- Safety. - Safety.

759
00:52:57,739 --> 00:53:01,350
In that sense, I'd like to give our best firefighter...

760
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:03,580
a miracle.

761
00:53:04,279 --> 00:53:06,020
A miracle, sir?

762
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,649
"Kang Young Hwa of Gieun Fire Station has been chosen..."

763
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,219
"as 1 of the 3 agents..."

764
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:14,560
"to be dispatched to the Antarctic Research Station."

765
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,060
"Director Choi O Geun of the National Fire Agency."

766
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,729
Come on.

767
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,599
- Give it up! - Stop.

768
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,338
I never thought I'd get it,

769
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:27,269
so I wasn't even looking forward to it.

770
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,569
Jun O,

771
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:31,480
you're such a precious man.

772
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,838
Thanks to you,

773
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,579
Young Hwa is going all the way up.

774
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,579
- Thanks, man! - Great.

775
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,718
Come on now.

776
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:40,888
- Cheers! - Cheers.

777
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:42,588
- Yes, let's clink glasses. - Gosh.

778
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:45,318
- Cheers! - Thanks, everyone.

779
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:47,388
(Different Class)

780
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:49,889
The meat is burning. Eat the food too.

781
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:52,429
I'm not that thankful.

782
00:53:52,799 --> 00:53:54,769
I'll pour you a glass.

783
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:55,900
Here, Young Hwa.

784
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:59,298
- I want that bottle. - Sure.

785
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:01,170
- No, you're drunk. - I can still drink.

786
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:07,909
Oh, my. The weather's amazing.

787
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:12,750
It's okay. Stay awake.

788
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,850
Stay awake.

789
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:17,889
What?

790
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,560
(Have a drink.)

791
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:20,830
How about a drink with me?

792
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:22,589
Sure.

793
00:54:23,389 --> 00:54:24,699
It's just one drink.

794
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,429
Cheers. I'll drink one with you.

795
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,339
I feel good.

796
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,110
You had a drink, so I'm really going.

797
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,420
Oh, I have to go.

798
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,549
I must go.

799
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,589
Where do you think you're going?

800
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:51,360
What?

801
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,429
What?

802
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:06,100
Did you just come out of that thing?

803
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,439
I can't do that for now. I'm pretending to be a human.

804
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,639
Right?

805
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,580
It's so hard pretending to be a human, right?

806
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:17,619
That's so interesting.

807
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:19,980
Speaking of which...

808
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:24,420
Be my bodyguard.

809
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,060
"Bodyguard?"

810
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:30,460
An actual guard?

811
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:33,429
For now, this is the best possible way...

812
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,600
to keep you by my side at every second.

813
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:44,479
No, you should be finding a way to stay away from me.

814
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,409
That's how you'll be cured.

815
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,750
You're the only one who can cure me.

816
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:54,290
If you refuse, I will...

817
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:56,389
lose that opportunity.

818
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:01,528
- For the Antarctic! - For the Antarctic!

819
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:02,889
- Cheers! - Cheers!

820
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,229
We're sending Young Hwa to the Antarctic!

821
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,500
Did you hear that? I'm leaving soon.

822
00:56:07,569 --> 00:56:08,900
And to a faraway place.

823
00:56:09,569 --> 00:56:11,639
Ask the National Fire Agency if you don't believe me.

824
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:13,639
You can't go...

825
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:15,940
wherever that is.

826
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,610
Because I won't let you.

827
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,909
Do you want to bet if I can go or not?

828
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,989
Would you like a bet with me, my lord?

829
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,130
If I win, promise to stay away from me.

830
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:42,798
Well, I won't be seeing you if I go, anyway.

831
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:43,929
But if I win,

832
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,639
you will...

833
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:52,409
come to me, at all costs.

834
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:57,310
If you do not look back...

835
00:56:57,449 --> 00:56:59,219
until you cross it...

836
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,690
Then, will you promise me...

837
00:57:03,049 --> 00:57:04,619
that you will leave this place immediately?

838
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:11,500
But if I win, you will have to admit...

839
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,699
that you do not want me to leave.

840
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:20,139
But I am going to win.

841
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:24,509
I do not think I will lose either.

842
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,029
Will you...

843
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:49,630
really not look back?

844
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:55,040
Do not blame me.

845
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:59,040
You are the one...

846
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,380
who started this bet.

847
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:02,469
This is against the rules.

848
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,639
I know that it is.

849
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,199
So I won.

850
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:04,100
Do not say it is unfair.

851
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:07,369
Men never know...

852
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,310
how they truly feel.

853
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,009
Who says that I do not?

854
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:07,699
Do not blame me for going against the rules.

855
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,429
I merely...

856
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:14,000
learned from you.

857
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:47,909
(Moon in the Day)

858
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:50,139
He was looking for that amulet!

859
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,739
If something happens to that monk...

860
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,909
Ms. Kang is a firefighter.

861
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,480
- What are you doing here? - To see you.

862
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,350
Someone tried to kill me,

863
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:02,750
and I'm the safest...

864
01:02:03,449 --> 01:02:05,060
when I'm next to you, Young Hwa.

865
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,520
If I could just get rid of you, Jun O...

866
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,790
Jun O wasn't the only target.

867
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,199
Hey!

868
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,259
Even Young Hwa?
