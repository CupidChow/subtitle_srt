1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:13,380

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,500

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,390

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,200

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,450

6
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,170

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,420

8
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,820

9
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,670
 The Great Gaya betrayed Silla.

10
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,120

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,590
 The king sent a punitive force...

12
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,800
 and conquered them.

13
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,670
Advance!

14
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,520
We are the people of Gaya!

15
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,130
Advance!

16
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,160
It's an order from the great general!

17
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,240
Fight until the end!

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,620
Do not forget your pride as the people of Gaya!

19
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,780
 This hellish war...

20
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,330
 needs to end immediately.

21
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,870
There is no time.

22
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,190
Capture the entire family of the great general of Gaya.

23
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,000
- Yes, sir! 
 - Yes, sir!

24
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,690
What are you doing? Go inside.

25
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,060
Yes, sir.

26
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,200
Open the door!

27
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,010
Open the door immediately!

28
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,460
- It is Silla's army. 
 - Mother, please.

29
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,060
Open the door. Right now.

30
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,880
Mother.

31
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,090
- Mother. 
 - Please...

32
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,730
No, Mother.

33
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,100
Mother! Mother...

34
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,430
Mother...

35
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,820
 They are here.

36
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,580
 The great general's wife and daughter are here.

37
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,680
 Who are you?

38
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,330
 Mother, you must live.

39
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,780
 - We have to live. 
 - Let go.

40
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,490
 Shut up and follow us!

41
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,950
 - Do not do anything stupid. 
 - Mother.

42
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,260
Look.

43
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,080
Watch carefully.

44
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,960
This is what you call...

45
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,120
the last bit of pride of the people of Gaya.

46
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,960
 Oh, no!

47
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,820
 - They're dead! 
 - Oh, no!

48
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,010
There is no one to force you to die anymore.

49
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,630
It is up to you to decide.

50
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,550
The ones who try to fight will die...

51
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,060
and the ones who try to live

52
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,580
will be graced with mercy.

53
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,320
 We let a lot of people live,

54
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,360
 but a lot of blood was shed.

55
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,330
 And that day...

56
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,910
 I met you.

57
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,480
Who sent you?

58
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,600
My parents and the rest of the family who died in your hands sent me.

59
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,790
Do you want to join your parents, too?

60
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,830
 Whether it is an arrow or a sword,

61
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,170
 it will end up in your chest.

62
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,060
 I have become stagnant here.

63
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,280
 But you keep flowing...

64
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,830
 endlessly.

65
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,610
 Go wherever it might be.

66
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,210
 I will make sure to...

67
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,090
 go back to you.

68
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,130

69
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,480

70
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,090
Look at all this sweat. Did you cry?

71
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,730
Me?

72
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,870
What do you mean, I cried?

73
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,210
- Whatever. I don't remember. 
 - No, come here.

74
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,650
You don't feel hot, either. Look at this.

75
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,510
The pupils seem normal.

76
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,840
Should I tell you if I'm normal or not?

77
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,910
Look at her. She needs to be examined.

78
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,900
That's enough, Senior.

79
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,350
Yeong Hwa isn't the only one with trauma.

80
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,570
W-Why can't she remember, then?

81
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,990
She sweated and screamed, too.

82
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,120
Don't exaggerate. I didn't scream.

83
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,190
My dad said you slept well if you don't remember your dream.

84
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,200
Should I consult someone about it?

85
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,090
Why don't I remember the nightmares? Why?

86
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,520
Whatever.

87
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,940
It's okay if I slept well.

88
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,240
 Fire dispatch. Fire dispatch.

89
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,120
- Proceed. 
 - Proceed.

90
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,470
Be careful.

91
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,050
Be careful.

92
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,800
Just look!

93
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,780
What's going on?

94
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,170
I don't see the man in a suit anywhere.

95
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,630
- It's been confirmed that no one is inside. 
 - What?

96
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,420
W-Why don't we see him, then?

97
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,530
He used to sleep in there because he had no home.

98
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,540
Yes. He always took the paper I was recycling.

99
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,710
But it was all there yesterday.

100
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,530
Got it. Hold on. We'll figure it out.

101
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,320
 Rescue Team. There might be someone in there.

102
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,010
What? I don't see anyone.

103
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,770
Senior, do you see anyone?

104
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,600
- I don't see anyone— 
 - Hold on. Be quiet.

105
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,680
What is it?

106
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,560
Senior.

107
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,170
We found the person. We found the person.

108
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,000
Are you okay?

109
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,330
Are you okay, sir?

110
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,930
 They got him!

111
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,560

112
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,680
Well done, Senior.

113
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,620
Good job.

114
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,940
Three, four, five, six, seven...

115
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,350
You've done enough.

116
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,040
It's too late.

117
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,170
Did it come back to life?

118
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,490
She saved it.

119
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,180
We'll take care of him until you recover.

120
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,470
Be careful and take care of yourself.

121
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,430
Bye now.

122
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,460

123
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,340
 The person of the moment, Firefighter Kang, is called the miraculous firefighter

124
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,720
 who never had any fatalities at the scene.

125
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,830
- Gosh! 
 - Wow!

126
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,600
Did you get yelled at a lot?

127
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,970
You're even in the news. You should've stood your ground.

128
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,600
It's my fault for not following the order.

129
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,730
I should be begging for forgiveness instead.

130
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,930
 She wants to live rescuing people...

131
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,140

132
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,370
Dad,

133
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,460
you helped me this time, too. Right?

134
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,510
Since you're helping me,

135
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,680
help me get the job at the station in Antarctica, too.

136
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,500
Goodness gracious...

137
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,150
Miss, Miss, Miss...

138
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,840
Have a seat here. Here. Sit here.

139
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,760
Oh, no, I'm okay.

140
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,520
Be careful. Rest here.

141
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,310
Thank you.

142
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,010

143
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,660
Excuse me. Here.

144
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,260
Oh?

145
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,350
Oh, this is mine. How did you—

146
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,930
It was on your seat. I thought it might be yours.

147
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,860
Well...

148
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,840
Your virtuous deed...

149
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,690
- Is it a righteous deed? 
 - Virtuous deed.

150
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,770
Oh, yes.

151
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,770
I'll never forget it.

152
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,870
Thank you so much.

153
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,530
By the way, haven't we met before?

154
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,810
I've met you?

155
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,130
Well, I think you're mistaken.

156
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,640
I've been on TV lately.

157
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,710

158
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,660
I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

159
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,710
No, not at all.

160
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,290
Safe travels, then.

161
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,300

162
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,010
I remember. She's the lost soul.

163
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,980

164
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,570

165
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,300
 Venerable!

166
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,160
 Venerable! Venerable!

167
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,360
 You disobeyed again, didn't you?

168
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,750
 I lent mine for a moment.

169
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,030
 Did you see it, too, Venerable?

170
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,800
 Good job.

171
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,530
 - Pardon? 
 - At least, it won't be visible anymore.

172
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,030
 It'll help you while you live.

173
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,710
 I've never seen anything so scary.

174
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,380
 I was so scared.

175
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,520
 It's a lost soul.

176
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,950
 It's a ghost that was forced to stay where they died.

177
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,100
 Sometimes, they stay with a person, too.

178
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,490
 Dad, a bow.

179
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,930
 Make a bow for me.

180
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,390
 If you run into her again,

181
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,220
 make sure to ignore her.

182
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,950
 That lost soul isn't one you can handle.

183
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,190

184
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,910
Why on earth? For what reason...

185
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,640
are you still there?

186
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,530
 Isn't he so heroic?

187
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,130
I'd love to be in his arms like that.

188
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,690
Cut! Cut!

189
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,140
Joon Oh, what's wrong?

190
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,330
Hey, what did you have for dinner earlier?

191
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,570
Gosh, so heavy. My arms hurt because of you.

192
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,180
You weigh more than earlier.

193
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,410
He's crying. The kid is crying.

194
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,160
He's crying, refusing to shoot.

195
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,090
He's crying. He's crying.

196
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,810
Director...

197
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,220
let's use a body double.

198
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,800
Let's apply his face later and use a body double.

199
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,100
You just have to hold a four-year-old.

200
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,420
Well, the fire's too hot

201
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,340
and the situation is too dangerous right now.

202
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,140
We killed all the fire

203
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,750
and we're using CGI for all the fire.

204
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,250
Why don't you try it? Why are you telling me to?

205
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,140
It's extremely hot. And the kid is too heavy.

206
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,880
- Why do you always tell me to? 
 - Wait...

207
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,120
I won't do it. I won't do it.

208
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,280
It's really hot!

209
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,900
I'm sorry.

210
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,720
Joon Oh isn't feeling well because he's been so busy.

211
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,200
But still, we can't use a body double for a public service announcement.

212
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,760
It's because he doesn't care about anything.

213
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,030
Of course, we care.

214
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,840
Hey, come here right now.

215
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,730
Huh?

216
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,730
Wow. Nice...

217
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,370
Wow, they're coffee trucks.

218
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,300

219
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,340
Seriously, why are you doing this?

220
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,190
- Damn it. 
 - Who told you to come up with this concept?

221
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,330
What's this? Seriously!

222
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,370
The theme is a miracle this time.

223
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,640
She's the miraculous firefighter.

224
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,360
Yes, that's all good. Everything is fine.

225
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,110
But look.

226
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,710
This woman is holding a puppy. Why should I hold a person?

227
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,450
My arms hurt too much. I'm about to die!

228
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,200
Hey, man. That's why I told you not to skip training.

229
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,650
You're a man. Why are you so weak?

230
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,970
I said I hated doing physical labor, didn't I?

231
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,220
Men are supposed to use their brains.

232
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,050
Joon Oh, to make you an honorary firefighter,

233
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:41,200
our company is donating our talent. Just think about that.

234
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,390
So, what do we gain out of this? Haven't you heard of "Give and take"?

235
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,970
If we gibu our talent for free, we should get something in return!

236
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,100
It's "give" our talent. Not "gibu."

237
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,470
It's not bu as in buchimgae or bujangnim. 
  (Pancake or manager)

238
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,280
I told you not to look down on me over that stuff.

239
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,030
Hey. Hey.

240
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,900
And, of course, we get something out of this.

241
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,520
We're doing this to stop the rumor from spreading.

242
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,380
Just don't bother. We don't have to.

243
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,050
We might as well tell everyone.

244
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,540
- That I'm dating Jeong Yi Seul. 
 - Hey!

245
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,250
- I'm dating Jeong Yi Seul! 
 - Quiet!

246
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,080
- Hey, hey. 
 - It hurts! Seriously.

247
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,350
Mr. Honorary Firefighter, can we...

248
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,070
please shoot with honor?

249
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,980
No.

250
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,640
Today...

251
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,100
I have plans with Yi Seul.

252
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,470
Wow.

253
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,800
Yes, Honey.

254
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,580
Of course, it already ended.

255
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,530
Of course! Where are you?

256
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,710
Honey, why are you out here?

257
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,800
Why are you running?

258
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,910
Wow, how come you look so pretty today?

259
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,110
Hurry up and get in. Jang Yoon Je is following me.

260
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,720
Get in, Honey. Here he comes. Here he comes!

261
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,250
Hey, Han Joon Oh!

262
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,560
Hey, hey, Joon Oh.

263
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,440
Where are you going? Hey.

264
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,860
Where are you going? Excuse me.

265
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,590
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

266
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,570
Hey, Joon Oh. Don't go.

267
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,170
Where are you going? Joon Oh.

268
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,870
- Is it Joon Oh? 
 - Yes, it's him.

269
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,280
My gosh, it's him.

270
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,750
Honey, you wanted a mint chocolate chip Frappuccino with cream. Right?

271
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,600
Just get in.

272
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,230
Let's go.

273
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,830
What if someone sees us? You have to be careful.

274
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,600
We can just make it public.

275
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,030
We can be like Brangelina of Korea. We can shoot dramas and films together.

276
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,800
Pitt and Jolie divorced a long time ago.

277
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,400
Did they?

278
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,300
Joon Oh,

279
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,530
why do you think I like you?

280
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,790
It's because of my amazing physique and looks.

281
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,430
The thing is, I like you because you're a star.

282
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,740
I also like that you're a top star.

283
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,240
I guess I really am a top star.

284
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,040
But you know what?

285
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,650
A star is a rock if you look closely.

286
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,790
Yes, I'm a rock. I work out a lot these days.

287
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,550
Feel it right here. It's really hard.

288
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,270
It's seriously rock-hard.

289
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,640
Feel it. It's really hard.

290
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,110
Put it away.

291
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,970
I work out a lot lately.

292
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,590
One. Two. Three.

293
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,060
 Sir, we're in trouble.

294
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,170
Keep checking Joon Oh's location for now.

295
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,980
Okay.

296
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,180
Something happened during the shoot today.

297
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,230
Let's reschedule the public service announcement shoot.

298
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,810
Here we go again...

299
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,810
Let's finish what we started first.

300
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,380
As we have said, we're suing the people who made hate comments

301
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,160
and preventing it from spreading as much as possible.

302
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,540
But the biggest issue is...

303
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,780
this photo.

304
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,480
The paparazzi are demanding an incredible amount of money.

305
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,640
We're tight on time, too.

306
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,000
I want you to contact him, Attorney Go.

307
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,990
Pay him what he wants.

308
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,890
 Mr. Han?

309
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,700
Yes. Got it.

310
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,990
Han Joon Oh is all about the nation's boyfriend image.

311
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,600
If we couldn't create that image for the past three years,

312
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,220
he would've been one of those failed idols.

313
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,780
What we need to protect isn't the top star, Han Joon Oh.

314
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,920
It's that image.

315
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,120
Oh. Whoa.

316
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,180
Whoa. Wow.

317
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,720
Seriously.

318
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,630
Hyung.

319
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,960
Isn't it so romantic?

320
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,790
Why do you look so happy today? You're making me nervous.

321
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,700
Today is the 300th day since Yi Seul and I started dating.

322
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,350
We'll celebrate at home. We'll keep it private.

323
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,190
- Today? 
 - Yep.

324
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,530
How about the shoot tomorrow? Are you crazy?

325
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,650
No, I'm not crazy. Hold these first. Here.

326
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,030
You need to take a photo of stuff like this.

327
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,860
What?

328
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,010
Hyung, I saw you recently.

329
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,180
It's polite to not say hello when the other person won't.

330
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,700
Don't you know?

331
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,510
Is that so? Anyway, was it at the YDD Group's

332
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,710
chairman's birthday party? We saw each other then.

333
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,530
Because I got invited just like you. Are we done?

334
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,330
No, not just like me.

335
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,580
I brought a gift, but you got paid.

336
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,270
What?

337
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,560
I know well because I used to be an idol. You're...

338
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,430
not so good at dancing. Just sing instead.

339
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,740
It was kind of embarrassing to watch.

340
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,960
- You bastard. 
 - No, no.

341
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,450
You just heard Goo Tae Joo calling me a bastard. Right?

342
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,670
I think you went too far. Let's go.

343
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,170
What do you mean? I was just trying to be helpful.

344
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,910
Hey, you'd better focus on managing the rumors.

345
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,410
Don't make Yi Seul suffer.

346
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,220
Yi Seul? You don't know her. Don't pretend to be friends.

347
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,360
Didn't you know?

348
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,280
We're shooting a drama together.

349
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,730
A drama? She didn't tell me anything.

350
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,730
Because it's a historical drama.

351
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,590
Goo Tae Joo was like that because you stole the nation's boyfriend status from him.

352
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,510
Let's not worry about it.

353
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:32,400
Yi Seul didn't tell me anything. Don't you know what that means?

354
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,980
I know. She kept it a secret from you because...

355
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,360
she wants to end it with you?

356
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,710
End it? W-W-What do you mean? What?

357
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,550
- What do you mean to end it? End what? 
 - Hey, hey.

358
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,900
Who said it's over?

359
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,590
- Does she expect me to just sit still? 
 - Then, what?

360
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,150
She won't suddenly stop switching boyfriends in every project.

361
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,850
The project...

362
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,280
Yes, her next project.

363
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,700
I can do it.

364
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,610
We came here to pay for the photos of you and Jeong Yi Seul.

365
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,160
But you suddenly want to take Goo Tae Joo's spot? What do you mean?

366
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,010
I love Yi Seul, Hyung.

367
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,640
D-D-Do you even understand love?

368
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,940
Doing a drama together doesn't mean they'll date.

369
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,420
But Yi Seul does that.

370
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,820
I'm not doing this for no reason.

371
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,820
I understand what you mean. Let's prepare for the shoot tomorrow first.

372
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,990
Did you look at the storyboard?

373
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,320
Have I ever not listened to you? The honorary firefighter thing, too.

374
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,910
I didn't want to do it, but I did it anyway.

375
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,430
I know.

376
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,330
Of course, I know you try your best.

377
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,160
You don't know. You don't.

378
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,150
I don't think you do. It's just about Yi Seul

379
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,910
They already cast the leads.

380
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,820
I'll keep checking on Jeong Yi Seul's situation, so—

381
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,620
You did all sorts of dirty things when you fired CEO Seok.

382
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,090
Whatever.

383
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:19,090
If you keep doing this, I'll tell everyone the dating rumors are true.

384
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,000
- Joon Oh, have a seat. 
 - Whatever.

385
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,140
Mr. Han, don't worry so much.

386
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,220
He can't act rashly because of Jeong Yi Seul.

387
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,800
Should I let the guest in?

388
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,340
- Attorney Go. 
 - Yes, Mr. Han.

389
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,020
Did you figure out Mr. Seok's whereabouts at all?

390
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm not sure. He hasn't been seen since he left prison.

391
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,890
Should I look into it?

392
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,720
No.

393
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,770
That's all I need to know.

394
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,000

395
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,070

396
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,410
Stop by sometime.

397
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,660
I should return the favor.

398
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,200
Take care.

399
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,130
That suit must be real.

400
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,930
Huh? What?

401
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,990
It's a designer suit.

402
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,190
Huh?

403
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:41,660
He's been living in his past until he ended up that way.

404
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,380
That little thing keeps doing that to you.

405
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,730
So what? He's so cute.

406
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,930
Bye.

407
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,260
 Mom.

408
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,550
 Dad.

409
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:05,010
♫  Moon, moon. The bright moon  ♫

410
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:12,930
♫  Where do you go during the day  ♫

411
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:21,220
♫  and come back when the night comes?  ♫

412
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:29,830
♫  Moon, moon. The bright moon  ♫

413
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:37,810
♫  Where do you go during the day  ♫

414
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:46,110
♫  and come back when the night comes?  ♫

415
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,970

416
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,010
By the way,

417
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,980
why did you do that to me?

418
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,090
I told you. I didn't get a chance to tell you.

419
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,620
Don't do this on a day like this.

420
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,600
Gosh. Okay, okay, okay.

421
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,480
Instead, you should do that drama with me.

422
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,510
Instead of Goo Tae Joo.

423
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,130
Come on.

424
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,920
We already finished the table read, and we're starting to shoot soon.

425
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,180
But I have Hyung.

426
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,070
There's nothing Han Min Oh can't do.

427
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,960
It's a historical drama, I said.

428
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,570
You hate old language.

429
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,010
Historical dramas aren't that special. I'm really good.

430
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,780
Look.

431
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,980
Come here.

432
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,000
Go there.

433
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
There are enemies there. Go there and capture all of them!

434
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,950
Bam! Charismatic.

435
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,790
- I'll just go. 
 - Oh, hold on, hold on.

436
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,510
It's my fault.

437
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,840
I'm so sorry.

438
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,160
You know...

439
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,370
I thought you might leave just like...

440
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,740
when you came to me.

441
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,330
You know what?

442
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,200
You're the first one I had a long-term relationship with.

443
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,680
R-Really?

444
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,300
Just focus on now, Joon Oh.

445
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,400
- Today is our 300th day together. 
 - Okay.

446
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,720
I really, really like you.

447
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,120
I'm going there as fast as I can.

448
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,980
I'm not getting angry.

449
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,710
I'm in front of his house now. I'll stop by the shop and head over immediately.

450
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,720
Okay, okay. Got it. We'll be right there.

451
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,570
Han Joon Oh. How could he still be in bed?

452
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,850
Han Joon Oh! Hey.

453
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,760
Get up while I'm asking nicely. Do you know how many people are waiting?

454
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,570
What's this?

455
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,300
 I'm Jeong Yi Seul. Let's break up.

456
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,360
 Bye.

457
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,800
Is she serious? Geez...

458
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,680
Hey, Joon Oh.

459
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,070
Han Joon Oh? Wake up.

460
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,510
Han Joon Oh. Wake up right now.

461
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,100
Joon Oh! Why isn't he waking up?

462
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,060
Hey, Joon Oh.

463
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,580

464
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,480
Joon Oh.

465
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,550
- Where's Joon Oh? 
 - He's being examined right now.

466
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,710
Where's the examination room?

467
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,520
Joon Oh.

468
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,780
What? What took you so long?

469
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,690
Do you know how scared I was?

470
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,870
When I woke up, I was stuck somewhere white.

471
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,500
Did the test result come out?

472
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,500
- Dr. Choi will tell you in person. 
 - Got it.

473
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,650
How are you feeling? Are you in pain at all?

474
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,790
My leg. My leg hurts so much.

475
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,480
I think I got bruised somewhere.

476
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,930
How did you bring me here, anyway?

477
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,750
How could you say—

478
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,440
Let's just rest today.

479
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,320
I'll change the schedule.

480
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,470
Well, the press release came out

481
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,710
and the people from the National Fire Agency and reporters are waiting.

482
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,530
Yes, I'm just hungover. Hungover.

483
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,820
Yi Seul said she'd come today, too.

484
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,780
What?

485
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,010
Today is our 301st day together.

486
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,460
She said I'm the first one she has had a long-term relationship with. Gosh, amazing. Geez.

487
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,160
She said I'm the first one she has had a long-term relationship with. Gosh, amazing. Geez.

488
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:56,530
I'll no longer cause trouble and listen to everything you say.

489
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,550
So you'll do me a favor. Okay?

490
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,940
- Joon Oh. 
 - Hyung, seriously.

491
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,530
Just listen. Listen carefully.

492
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,600
Your brother only counts on you, Hyungnim.

493
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,570
Yes.

494
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,260
I think I'm good at historical drama.

495
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,410
Aren't I good, Hyung?

496
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,370
- Yes, that was nice. 
 - He said it was nice.

497
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,500
He thinks I'm talented.

498
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,110
How did you bring him here, by the way?

499
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,330
I couldn't call 911 and let everyone know.

500
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,920
I called Dr. Choi and came here straight.

501
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,100
Let's follow the schedule today.

502
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,540
- Jeong Yi Seul— 
 - She won't come.

503
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,680
I thought he did something terrible because of this.

504
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,310
Did Jeon Yi Seul write this?

505
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,670
He doesn't seem to know at all. Right?

506
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,030
How could she break up with him when he's asleep?

507
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,020
Listen carefully.

508
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:02,180
He can't know about this until the shoot ends today.

509
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,900
Of course not. He'd freak out the moment he saw it.

510
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,400
I don't even want to think about it.

511
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,820

- Public service announcement? 
 - Yes.

512
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,040
The theme is "miracle," apparently.

513
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,680
They're begging the miraculous firefighter to come since they're reshooting.

514
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,000
Wow! So great! My goodness.

515
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,440
I'll show them what a miracle is.

516
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,050
Safety first.

517
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,480

518
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,190

519
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,550
 Please turn to your left.

520
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,300
 Look over here, please.

521
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,660
 - Please look to your right. 
 - Joon Oh.

522
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,230
 Ms. Firefighter, please come up here.

523
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,010
Okay.

524
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,090
Excuse me.

525
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,660

526
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,650
Are you okay?

527
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,270
Thank you.

528
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,670
- Come up here. 
 - The photoshoot will start now.

529
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,430
We need advice on CPR afterward, too.

530
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,300
 Look this way, please.

531
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,350
 - Look this way, Ms. Firefighter. 
 - Please look this way.

532
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:40,000
 Please look this way.

533
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,580
 Look straight ahead, too.

534
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,600
 Look to the left. To the left.

535
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,700
You just need to remember three things.

536
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,820
Center. Five centimeters. Twice.

537
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,610
You compress the center of the chest with this part, not the whole palm.

538
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,010
That way, you can press five centimeters deep.

539
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,950
Do that twice a second.

540
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,210
Keep your arms perpendicular to your torso.

541
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,070
Do you want to try it?

542
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,280
Like this?

543
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,320
You can't bend your elbows.

544
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,890
Straighten them out and apply your body weight.

545
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,740
Use the bottom of your palm like this.

546
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,610
I think that's enough now.

547
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,730
Let's move on to the next one.

548
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,640
Let's go to the next photoshoot spot.

549
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,300
Joon Oh, you can learn the rest and come to the shoot location.

550
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,290
Let's get going.

551
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,210

552
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,030
Ugh, my legs. Gosh.

553
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,790
Should we continue, then?

554
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,000
Gosh, seriously.

555
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,680
Your elbows were bending like this earlier.

556
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,140
This is driving me crazy.

557
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,850
What did you say?

558
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:15,280
Hey. Send me Yi Seul's manager's phone number.

559
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,890
I can't reach her!

560
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,170
What? She's free today.

561
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,060
Send it right now.

562
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,730
Send it if I say so. Stop talking and send it!

563
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,250
Excuse me.

564
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,520
Let's just get it over with. What is it? This?

565
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,960
What about it? On the chest here?

566
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,580
 Let's just start shooting first.

567
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,330
What are you doing with just one hand?

568
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,310
Send it, I said.

569
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,580
- Mr. Han Joon Oh. 
 - Mr. Jang Yoon Je.

570
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,160
Do you think I'm joking?

571
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,040
Send the number right now!

572
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,660
Yi Seul—

573
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,790
What?

574
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,400
Hey!

575
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,080
Now you're looking at me.

576
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,870
You've got to be kidding.

577
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,470
- Give it to me now. 
 - I told you three things.

578
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:23,360
Center. Five centimeters. What was the last one?

579
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,100
Gosh, I'm about to go crazy.

580
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,170
How did I end up with this amateur?

581
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,820
What did you say?

582
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,630
If we just do enough, they edit, shoot, and everything.

583
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,910
Saying those three things won't even show in photos.

584
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,130
You can't just do things willy-nilly in that uniform.

585
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,570
You think CPR is a joke?

586
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,750
What do you want from me? I don't care.

587
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,750
I... Give me the phone.

588
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,320
Apologize, Mr. Han.

589
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,120
Apologize for what?

590
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,850
You brought dishonor to the firefighters

591
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,140
and you assaulted a civil servant on the job.

592
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,830
Okay, okay, okay. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

593
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,170
I'll do it. Ouch!

594
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,520
Go ahead and apologize.

595
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,880
Are you crazy?

596
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,090
Crazy?

597
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,640
A-Are you insane?

598
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,970
How dare you touch me...

599
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,310
You assaulted me just now. I'll call the police.

600
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,190
Call them.

601
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,100
Make sure to call them, you bastard.

602
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,710
The phone. The phone. The phone. The phone. The phone!

603
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,230
The phone. The phone. Give it to me.

604
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,680
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

605
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,490
Gosh, what a piece of work.

606
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:38,940
So what that he's a celebrity?

607
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,570
Who?

608
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,530
Han Joon Oh? What happened?

609
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,640
Kang Yeong Hwa, where are you going?

610
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,430
I'm going to remove the makeup. Why?

611
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,970
I told you to send her manager's number. Why won't you?

612
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,170
Aren't you doing the rehearsal? Why are you here?

613
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,400
I don't know. Whatever. Well...

614
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,100
Find out the woman's name first. I'll actually call the police.

615
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,190
The woman? What woman?

616
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,890
That firefighter just now.

617
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,370
Did you cause trouble again?

618
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,430
What are you talking about now?

619
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,010
My arm got twisted. Okay?

620
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,380
Do you want to see? Look. Look.

621
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,710
Gosh, what is this?

622
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:18,140
What? Hey, w-what happened to your arm?

623
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,110
What did she do, anyway?

624
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:22,060
Did she beat you up?

625
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,810
Well, no, she didn't exactly beat me up.

626
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,200
Where is she right now?

627
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,050
Why would she do this to an actor who came for a shoot?

628
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,010
So the phone number. The phone number. What about the phone number?

629
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:36,520
I'll go find Yi Seul myself.

630
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,900
I'll take this car with me.

631
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,830
Have you heard of...

632
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,620
cardiac tumor?

633
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,620
You mean...

634
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,540
Joon Oh has cancer?

635
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,410
Yes.

636
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,490
The tumor spread inside the ventricles of the heart.

637
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,670
He can't be operated on, either.

638
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,920
If he was in that state,

639
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,580
how has he not detected any symptoms?

640
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:11,340
Cardiac tumor can show no symptoms until it becomes serious.

641
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,780
It's a miracle if he wasn't in pain at all.

642
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,580
That's enough.

643
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:22,330
He'd better get tested at a different hospital.

644
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,450
It might be hard to believe,

645
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,260
but it has spread a lot already.

646
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:33,570
I think you should prepare yourself for the worst.

647
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:40,090
 Let him spend a lot of time with someone he loves.

648
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:44,880
 That's the best medicine right now.

649
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,570
It's me.

650
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,470
Don't ask me anything. Starting now, the rumors regarding Goo Tae Joo

651
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:03,040
will be publicized using all media platforms.

652
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,040
Noona, what's wrong?

653
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,390
Please don't do this.

654
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:12,580
I... I...

655
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,360
Noona. Noona. Noona.

656
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,780
Hold on...

657
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,550
What's going on?

658
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,460
Joon Oh! Han Joon Oh!

659
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:44,740
 No, Han Joon Oh.

660
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,120
 I'll make sure to save you.

661
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,150

662
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,790
Yeong Hwa!

663
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,410
Yeong Hwa, are you okay?

664
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,120
Are you okay?

665
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,100
Careful. Be careful...

666
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,030
Cardiac arrest. A male in his 20s.

667
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,720
No pulse. No breathing.

668
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,290
Dispatch immediately.

669
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,210
You can't come in here.

670
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,820
- Yes, I'll update you immediately. 
 - You managed to get out of there.

671
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,450
Don't die.

672
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,720
I'll let you be an asshole. Just come back!

673
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,790
That's enough! Let's go!

674
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,780
Let go. I promised I'd save him.

675
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,760
I promised I wouldn't let him die.

676
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,640
Han Joon Oh. Wake up!

677
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,330
Han Joon Oh...

678
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,490
Joon Oh.

679
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:22,090
Joon Oh! Shit...

680
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,580
Joon Oh! Joon Oh.

681
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,460
Wake up. Pull yourself together a bit.

682
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,210
Joon Oh. Geez...

683
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,010
Joon Oh.

684
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:38,030
 Guardian angel or whoever's out there, help me.

685
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:41,070
 Do something about Han Joon Oh.

686
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:44,110
 I really want there to be a miracle.

687
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:54,200
You can stop now.

688
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,800
I'll announce the death of Mr. Han Joon Oh.

689
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:11,110
- Joon Oh! 
 - He passed away at 17:29:58.

690
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,420
I pronounce him dead.

691
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,820
 See?

692
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,720
 There's no such thing as a guardian angel.

693
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,490
- Yeong Hwa! Yeong Hwa! Yeong Hwa! 
 - Senior. Hey, hey.

694
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:27,660
Joon Oh! Wake up.

695
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,770
Wake up.

696
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,290
Yeong Hwa, wake up.

697
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,250
Yeong Hwa.

698
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,610
- Wake up. Yeong Hwa! Wake up! 
 - Excuse me.

699
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:10,110
 It's my body.

700
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,890
 I have a body.

701
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,380

702
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,390
 Top star, Han Joon Oh, who's been loved as the nation's boyfriend

703
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:22,140
 passed away while filming, and the whole country is in shock.

704
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,990
 The police are investigating the circumstances and the cause of death.

705
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,400
 Mr. Han Joon Oh's body was sent to the hospital immediately

706
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,330
 and they're preparing for the funeral right now.

707
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:34,470
 The police said this accident was due to...

708
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,400

709
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,000

710
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,470

711
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,660

712
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,910
Are you awake now?

713
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,310
Are you okay?

714
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,930
I thought you were dying. I was worried.

715
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,460
Han Joon Oh?

716
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,240
I've been wanting to see you.

717
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,110
I've been wanting to see you like crazy.

718
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,920
Kang Yeong Hwa.

719
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:03,180
I love you, sir.

720
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:11,400

721
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,670
 I...

722
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:19,010
 was killed by my lover.

723
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:31,580
♫  The bright day has gone  ♫

724
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:38,600
♫  and I'm stuck under the dark sky  ♫

725
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:45,380
♫  Through a lonely flower petal that's blowing in the wind  ♫

726
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:50,790
♫  I'm conveying my desperate heart  ♫

727
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:53,720
♫  Since I met you again  ♫

728
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,380

729
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,210
 If it was not for you, I never could have

730
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:02,180
 ended up here.

731
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,850
 Thank you for coming back.

732
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:06,280
 Are you that happy that I came back?

733
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,410
 You should've woke me up if you got up.

734
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,970
 Why did you walk around on your own?

735
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:12,890
 Kang Yeong Hwa.

736
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,900
 Huh? Gosh, you scared me.

737
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:20,660
 Be by my side like this every day.

738
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:24,290
 I will kill you.
