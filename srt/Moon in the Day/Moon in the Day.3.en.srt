(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

9
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,529
This is against the rules.

10
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,899
I know that it is.

11
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,800
So I won.

12
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,539
Do not blame me...

13
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,840
for going against the rules.

14
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:21,639
I merely...

15
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,049
learned it from you.

(Episode 3)

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,639
I have to quit drinking.

19
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,710
Why did I say something so absurd?

20
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,310
I'll just go to the Antarctic.

(Firefighter Kang Soo Han of Korea, may he rest in peace)

22
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:09,560
I missed you, Dad.

23
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,859
I came to brag about something.

24
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,798

Look.

27
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,269
Didn't I tell you...

28
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:27,680
that I'd make all your dreams come true?

29
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,039
I'm going to the interview today,

30
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,548
so you have to help me.

(Application for Dispatch to Antarctic Research Station)

32
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,799
What am I looking at right now?

33
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,370
I'm telling you. This is the place.

34
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,370
This is the only location that meets all your needs.

35
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,470
We'll see when we're up there.

36
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,079
How did Jun O come here?

37
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,989
This is a very suspicious coincidence.

38
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,189
(Mount Gieun, 861)

39
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,859
That's him.

40
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,570
The chief monk who can drive out powerful ghosts.

41
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,339
You're dead now...

42
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,039
Wait. Is he already dead?

43
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,340
It's been a while, Monk.

44
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,080
What? What's happening?

45
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,320
My memory has been poor nowadays.

46
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:46,850
You must have stopped making amulets now.

47
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,729
From what I remember, you had tons of them back there.

48
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:54,030
My vision has been blurry.

49
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,129
I have them in stock, so feel free to look around.

50
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,729
Well, then.

51
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,609
It did not look like these.

52
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,910
One could not even hide it if it were this large.

53
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:59,358
But I was told he was a great shaman.

54
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,200
How come he didn't even recognize him?

55
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,609
Chief Monk!

56
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,919
Did you see him?

57
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,650
The one I saw in the subway.

58
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,720
He was haunting the girl.

59
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,660
Back in the day...

60
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,789
Did you forget?

61
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,558
That poltergeist is too powerful for us to...

62
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,660
No, he was looking for the amulet.

63
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,998
What if something happens to that saint?

64
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,570
Not everything is as it seems,

65
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:42,799
and just because it's invisible doesn't mean it's non existent.

66
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,839
- Pardon? - Everything happens...

67
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,140
for a reason.

68
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:50,340
That saint may look good for now,

69
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,010
but she must have committed a grave sin in her previous life.

70
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,879
She is now paying for it.

71
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,289
It's not something that a man can stop!

73
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,010
Yes, sir.

74

Where are you, Young Hwa?

75
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,738
I'm on my way to the National Fire Agency...

76
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,249
for my interview.

77
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,220
The interview has been cancelled. You don't have to go.

78

What?

83
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,429
Get here now.

84
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,229
Okay.

85
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:52,470
It was Jun O!

86
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,309
Please make way!

87
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,280
I thought it was weird when he was at that temple.

88
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:04,080
Now, he cancelled my interview?

89

91
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:14,899
- Look at me! - I'm a fan!

92
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,600
Wait there.

93
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,269
- Jun O. - I love you.

94
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,600
Please take a photo with me.

95
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,650
Come to your car right now.

96
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,150
Or I'm going to Young Hwa.

97
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:39,550
What was the name of your accomplice?

98
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,389
Right.

99
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,859

I saw him come in here.

101
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,170
Where did he go?

102
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:13,420
I got you now.

103
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,229
This is the best footage among the nearby dashcams we got...

104
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,859
on the day of the accident.

105
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:22,359
The security cameras at the park had such low definition,

106
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,729
so we couldn't identify the faces.

107
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,470
Do we have the exact account of the accident?

108
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,639
Well,

109
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,470
it may not have been an accident.

110
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Sorry?

111
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:37,779
Are you saying...

112
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,609
that someone tried to murder Jun O?

113
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,590

Jun O, wake up.

117
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,109

Where is Jun O right now?

121
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,570
I'm at the parking lot, but I don't see our van.

122
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,800
What about the security cameras?

123
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,999
Have you checked them?

124
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
What?

please alert us.

133
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:06,129
Maybe I should get going.

Where is Jun O?

135
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,979
How would I know?

136

Where is Jun O?

137
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,320
Wait. Don't do this.

138
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:29,690
I said I didn't know.

139
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,259
Wait.

140
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:32,829
We put out an APB for the vehicle,

141

Open it.

145
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,170

- No, get it yourself. - Just for a second.

188
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,889
- Come here. - Doing this in uniform is so wrong.

189
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,789
Why can't you take down a girl?

190
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,790
Move!

191
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:36,609
I got it.

192
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,080
They found them.

193
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,810
The officers from a nearby station are on their way.

194
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:41,979
- Okay. - They're probably too late.

195
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
What's this?

196
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,129
You.

197
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,999
What are you doing here?

198
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,899
- Where's Jun O? - How would I know?

199
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,200
What are you talking about?

200
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,368
I saw him getting abducted on his van.

201
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:09,940
What are you saying? You told me to bring my men here at one o'clock.

202
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,379
What?

203
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,080
Then, who abducted...

204
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,190
Jun O?

205
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:21,690
How ridiculous you are.

206
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,658
Come on. Take them to the police station.

207
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:26,959
- No. - What?

208
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,529
- Stay there. - I didn't kidnap him.

209
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,940
Just kill them...

210
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,879
both.

211
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:47,909

213
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,050
Hello?

214
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,619
That rude punk.

215
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,090
What do we do with her?

216
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,060
- He told me to kill them both. - What?

217
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,529
But for that little money? It's not going to work.

218
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,290
Just hide her somewhere. We're leaving.

219
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:03,159
Okay. Let's go.

220
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,369
Wait.

221
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,340
She needs a few punches...

222
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:12,009
for hitting us.

223
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,369
Shoot.

224
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
What's this?

225
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,449
Where did this come from?

(Gieun Fire Station)

227
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,820
You shouldn't have touched her.

228

Who do you think you are?

229
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,729
Didn't you say he was just a celebrity?

230
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,340
Goodness.

231
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:55,850
Take one step further.

232
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,450
Don't move.

233
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:00,350
Stay right there!

234
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:08,800
Who ordered you?

235
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,300
He only left the money.

236
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,600
He looked like a homeless guy.

237
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,740
This number...

238
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:35,520
Please let me go.

239
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,219
Please.

240
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,000
Do not worry.

241
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,000
In this life,

242
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,500
I will not let anyone else kill you.

243
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Move!

244
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,250
What happened?

(Seoul Gieun Police Station)

246
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,399
Should I call it interesting or awesome?

247
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,039
Ms. Kang, so you have no injuries whatsoever...

248
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,109
except for that little cut?

249
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:35,409
But what happened to Jun O?

250
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,438
He was kidnapped with me.

251
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,479
Well... Detective?

252
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,879
We found Mr. Han far away from the abandoned building...

253
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,490
where we found you.

254
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,750
He's currently hospitalized.

255
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,958
He's hospitalized?

256
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,459
That's not important right now.

257
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,560
I don't think you should be worried about him for now.

258
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,628
- Pardon? - The kidnappers are...

259
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,699
under critical conditions,

260
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,969
so we can't just let you go.

261
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,669
From this point on, you are a testifier...

262
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:04,569
to be interrogated as a suspect.

263
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,639
But...

264
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,540
But I was kidnapped by them as well.

265
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,010
Why...

266
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,719
I don't exactly remember right now,

267
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,149
but isn't it self-defence, strictly speaking?

268
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,059
That's true, but when the degree...

269
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,889
of self-defence surpasses the original crime...

270
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,159
It's called excessive self-defence.

271
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,129
Anyway, you are fine...

272
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,129
when the kidnappers are hospitalized.

273
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,569
That is...

274
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,409
You should come to the police for some time and be investigated.

275
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:44,540
Firefighter Kang, who was found on the spot two days ago,

276
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,879
is now under...

277
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:49,820
Don't worry about Young Hwa.

278
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:51,979
I will make sure her reputation...

279
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,219
Life is more important...

280
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,959
than her reputation, no?

281
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,428
What are you talking about?

282
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,300
Somebody tried to kill me.

283
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,330
Even twice.

Yi Seul!

287
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,679
Finding the person who instigated it seems the first thing to do.

288
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,320
The police is investigating the case.

289
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,819
You just stay in a safe place and recover...

290
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,618
This incident already proved it.

291
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,189
Staying next to Young Hwa...

292
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:31,419
is the safest.

293
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,830
They investigated you again?

294
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Give it to me.

295
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:54,510
- No. - Give it to me. I will do.

296
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,449

297
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,889
The wound on your neck. Is it okay?

298
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,230
It got better.

299
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,230
When did this happen?

300
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,030
Still, you don't remember it?

301
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,799
If I catch the brat,

302
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,600
I will hit with...

303
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:20,639
What if this isn't the last?

304
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:25,980
What are you talking about? You hurt somewhere else too?

305
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,179
No...

306
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:30,149
I mean, what if I don't remember it?

307
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:34,820
What if I did everything and just don't remember it...

308
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,320
- Darn! - Gosh!

309
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,129
You really think you hit them all and can't remember it?

310
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,599
I almost killed one.

311
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,830
I don't know!

312
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,229
I just want to say thank you...

313
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,770
as you came back in safe.

314
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,000

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,010

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,280
- Yes. - The person you see...

373
00:27:33,189 --> 00:27:35,149
in the video is you?

374
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,790
It's somewhat different from the actual scene.

375
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,489
On that day, CPR training was held...

376
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,260
Please answer yes or no.

377
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,969
Yes. That's me.

378
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,399
Have you beaten Jun O, stolen his phone...

379
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,369
and thrown it?

380
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,439
- That's not... - Answer yes or no!

381
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:01,980
Yes, I've done those actions.

382
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:03,878
Expel her!

383
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:05,378
How could this happen?

384
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:07,188
Expel the violent firefighter!

385
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:08,948
- Expel her! - Expel her!

386
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:09,959
Guys!

387
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,030
Apologize to me.

388
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:17,658
You've compromised the honour of firefighters...

389
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:19,299
He is not at home now.

390
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,969
I know he's here.

391
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:23,868
Unconscious?

392
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,840
I knew it was bollocks!

393
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,480
How is it? The editing skill is amazing, isn't it?

394
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,409
I ordered it to my manager.

395
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,980
I wanted to film what you have been doing since I dumped you.

396
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,090
But he said he forgot it.

397
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:42,349
He said she looked familiar, but...

398
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,359
Get out.

399
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,859
By the way,

400
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,359
your pretty head must be just a decoration.

401
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:54,629
You should ask me.

402
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,169
Why should I?

403
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:04,179
It's an advice.

404
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,679
If you don't quit my drama, I will reveal all of these.

405
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,419
Then you'll fall.

406
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,889
Fall?

407
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,189
Then I can't help it.

408
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,389
We should fall together then.

409
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,990
What?

410
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,560
Why can't you understand what I'm saying, you fool?

411
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,129
Why can't you understand what I'm saying, you fool?

412
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:34,108
You really thought Tae Ju and I just did the rehearsal only?

413
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:36,378
Yi Seul. Why are you doing this to me?

414
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:38,040
Please, don't do that.

415
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,879
I...

416
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,679
This could be my last work. Please?

417
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:49,119
- So please... - Stop being clingy.

418
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:50,889
I'm sick of you.

419
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,389
Stop being clingy and get lost, okay?

420
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:56,959
I'm sick of you.

Jun O was this powerful?

425
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,209
Then what about Young Hwa's dispatch to Antarctic Station?

426
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,780
I can never get there.

427
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:14,810
Aren't you angry about this?

428
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:16,850
It was all self-defence!

429
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,780
I'm angry.

430
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,790
I feel wronged about all these things.

431
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,418
Then go to Jun O for help.

432
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:26,590
Tell him that he should tell the truth!

433
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,928
Alert!

434
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:30,600

Please text me when you are available. Thank you.

438
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:57,759
I want to interview you on Han Jun O's case...

439
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,919
that went viral on the internet.

440
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,330
Please call me when you can.

441

(Turn off)

442
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,899
Are you really not going to sue Kang Young Hwa?

443
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,639
The hired gang members all pointed at Jun O after they woke up.

444
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:14,868
Even if we bought their silence with money, we don't know...

445
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:16,740
Don't tell me you believe what they say.

446
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,740
Of course not.

447
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:20,509
There's no way Jun O did that.

448
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,379
Money is all they are after.

449
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,919
And I let them know who can give them money.

450
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:28,649
They won't give up...

451
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,159
their cash cow deliberately.

452
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,989
But it's better to be safe than sorry, isn't it?

453
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,458
Since the assault video went viral,

454
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:37,000
let's put all the blame on Young Hwa.

455
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:40,770
I'm just...

456
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,840
You saw the video.

457
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,510
I feel uncomfortable Jun O is involved with such a woman.

458
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,609
What if that's what Jun O wants?

459
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,780
Pardon?

460
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,379
Ms. Kang Young Hwa is a firefighter.

461
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,908
It's nonsense to make her your bodyguard.

462
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:58,119
Did it make sense to steal Tae Ju's role?

463
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,119
Min O is always on Jun O's side.

464
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:07,929
That's what I thought.

465
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:11,600
I can do anything for you.

466
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
But this is different, Jun O.

467
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,969
A bodyguard's role is to protect someone.

468
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,769
I can't force her to do it.

469
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,869
I think you are getting me wrong.

470
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,609
I'm not asking for your permission.

471
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,609
- Jun O. - This is my last wish, I said.

472
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,449
Are you going to object to it?

473
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,730
My time is...

474
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,899
running out.

against my will?

481
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:21,399
Leave? To where?

482
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,040
To where I am originally from.

483
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,840
I came back to leave.

484
00:33:27,469 --> 00:33:29,209
I mean, he intends to leave.

485
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:33,050
I should rather help him so that I can send him away.

486
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,608
First things first, I should take this shirt...

487
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:36,719
Excuse me.

488
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,619
- Hello? - Yes?

489
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:42,520
Hello.

490
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,419
- Hi. - Yes, hello.

This is Han Jun O's place, right?

492
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,389
Yes.

493
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,129
It is, but what brought you here?

494
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,270
Well.

496
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:05,679
Excuse me.

They are the police who are investigating this case.

499
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,420
Gosh.

500
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,529
Gosh. You must be surprised.

501
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:24,860
Well,

502
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:28,069
we'll ask you a question and vanish quickly.

503
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,469
- Officer Moon. - Yes.

504
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,710
Do you recognize this face?

505
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:37,278
The photo of that person was taken...

506
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:38,940
near the paid gangsters' office.

507
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,409

510
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,230
She got suspended. And we couldn't reach her.

511
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,068
Where are you going this time?

512
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:04,698
The phone is turned off.

513
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:06,368
You can't let others see you!

514
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,540
It will be charged.

515
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,069
I can't reach Young Hwa.

516
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,350
I have to check if she's all right.

517
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,350
This. What do I do with this?

518
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,690
- Gosh. - Hop in.

519
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,719
Wait.

520
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,790
I need to get rid of that first!

521
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,710
Young Hwa.

522
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,569
I'll take care of it. Leave it to me.

523
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,860
Where's Jun O?

524
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,389
You said he was in a comma and in a critical condition.

525
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:03,799
Was that a lie?

526
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,560
It was a lie, indeed.

527
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:06,929
Why would you...

528
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:10,069
- Why did you lie? - Because Jun O...

529
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,400
is running out of time.

530
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:17,480
What do you mean?

531
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,549
When Jun O had the accident at Han River,

532
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,880
I found out he was a terminally ill patient.

533
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:26,489
If it weren't for you,

534
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:29,520
I would probably have lost him...

535
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,819
without the time to prepare to say goodbye.

536
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:38,259
I wouldn't have known that someone was trying to kill Jun O.

537
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,639
I heard that you are called "The Miraculous Firefighter."

538
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,368
Jun O miraculously survived...

539
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:49,839
from grave dangers.

540
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:52,239
But from now on,

541
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,080
I'm going to sincerely believe that it wasn't a coincidence.

542
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,619
Please let me help you.

543
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,860
I'm going to make sure...

544
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,420
that you'll return to work...

545
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:07,989
by explaining everything.

546
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,460
In return,

547
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,170
please protect Jun O...

548
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,069
for just a month.

549
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,639
That's all I'm asking you.

550
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,779
I know I'm being brazen, but I beg you.

551
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:35,049
You're the only one who can cure me.

552
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,520
If you refuse, I will...

553
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:40,830
lose that opportunity.

554
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,500
Jun O.

555
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,069
Where is he right now?

556
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
I...

557
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,679
I will go inside by myself.

558
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:07,850
Okay.

559
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,560
Thanks for dropping me off.

560
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:42,389
Jun O.

561
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:52,299
Jun O.

562
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:56,569
Jun O.

563
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,949
Mr. Han called you, right?

564
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,569
Jun O.

565
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:47,650
Did I...

566
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:50,819
win the bet, then?

567
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,159
Didn't you hear me calling you?

568
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:57,029
Why didn't you answer me? I was worried.

569
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,770
You didn't answer my call, either.

570
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:03,029
Why?

571
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:05,100
Did you want me to worry about you?

572
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:09,509
Why would you worry about me?

573
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,339
You're not in the place to worry about others.

574
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,719
Is it true that you only have...

575
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:22,489
one month left?

576
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,520
I'm sure it is.

577
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,690
Is it also true that someone wants to kill you?

578
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,060
Yes.

579
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,069
You should have lived well.

580
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,639
What does that make me...

581
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:44,080
when I risked my life to save you?

582
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:48,850
Don't worry about me.

583
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,779
I cannot die.

584
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,049
What?

585
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:58,060
I can't leave this place...

586
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,860
as long as you are here.

587
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,600
Are you saying I have to stay by your side forever?

588
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:11,638
Because you won't die...

589
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,408
even if you were diagnosed as terminally ill?

590
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:15,810
No, one month.

591
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,080
One month will be enough.

592
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,750
It'll be impossible to stay beyond that.

593
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,449
Therefore,

594
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,889
help me leave this place...

595
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,730
in peace.

596
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,569
What do I have to do?

597
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,170
Just stay by my side...

598
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:52,940
so that nothing can get in my way...

599
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,409
for the little time...

600
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,719
I have left in this life.

601
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:07,929
I know...

602
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,299
- he has a month at most. - I have a month at most.

603
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,929
Will I be able to...

604
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:16,500
protect you?

605
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:17,770
I must...

606
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,270
take your life.

607
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:28,080
(Bodyguard Services Agreement)

608
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,690
(Beginning Entertainment, Han Min O, Kang Young Hwa)

609
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,699
To be honest, I thought you'd decline.

610
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,899
I have to expose the truth...

611
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,909
behind the video to lift my suspension,

612
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:57,339
as well as suspicions of excessive self-defence for the abduction.

613
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,879
Please just stick to the terms and explain the situation.

614
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,409
I will take all actions required according to the contract...

615
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,250
and provide compensation too.

616
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,179
As stated in the contract, I can't accept money.

617
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:09,219
I may be suspended, but I am still a firefighter.

618
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:11,489
Not that.

619
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,929
I will find another way to compensate.

620
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,060
All I want is to return to my job.

621
00:43:17,259 --> 00:43:18,830
That is the best compensation you can give me.

622
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,749
Gosh, stop staring at me.

623
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,549
I feel awkward too.

624
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,189
Hey. Put on lots of makeup. Who knows how long this will take?

625
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,758
- Why? Like an hour, right? - I'm sorry.

626
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,130
Hey, Han Jun O is practically dyslexic.

627
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,100
Last time, it took eight hours.

628
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:55,770
I have a video to prove it.

629
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,739
Rain.

630
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,770
Right. Rain,

631
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,249
bow is in the sky...

632
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,449
Right. When rain, bow is in the sky,

633
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,719
the freaking sunlight...

634
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,888
Right, the flickering sunlight.

635
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:19,559
Wait. Did he just say, "Rain, bow," instead of "Rainbow?"

636
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,560
Yes.

637
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,758
He's awful at reading, isn't he?

638
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:26,229
- Seriously. - Isn't that cute?

639
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,068
He has the best looks and is in the best shape,

640
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:31,069
so his himbo aspect is a total game-changer.

641
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,369
Gosh, it's freaking great.

642
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,710
So Jun O's popularity is...

643
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:40,750
thanks to his himbo quality?

644
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,080
Say hello.

645
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,850
Say hi to him.

646
00:44:49,549 --> 00:44:50,560
Hello.

647
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,420
Yes.

648
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,229
(Han Jun O)

649
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,399
Don't just stare at him.

650
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,469
- You should say hello. - Where's Young Hwa?

651
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:03,270
She's still in the restroom.

652
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:07,968
Also, bodyguards are supposed to remain outside.

653
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:09,610
In that case, I have no reason to stay here.

654
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,440
What? What's wrong? All right.

655
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:15,250
Fine.

656
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:21,549
Anyway, have you read this script, even just once?

657
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,819
Did you expect me...

658
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:26,619
to read this?

659
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:33,429
I've seen him more often on the news lately.

660
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,199
Can he really pull off this difficult drama?

661
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:36,529
That's all the more reason why he should do it.

662
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:39,139
Why would Jun O do something easy?

663
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:41,670
He just came to get his ex-girlfriend back,

664
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,309
but you seem confident about him.

665
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,179
That confidence brought in more investment,

666
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,310
and it was much easier to sign with streaming services.

667
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,480
Do you wish to call this contract off?

668
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:56,150
He's right, Director Kim.

669
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:58,420
What he said wasn't wrong.

670
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,489
I'm against casting him as the director.

671
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,029
Why do the higher-ups insist on taking him?

672
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,400
- Man. - Wait...

673
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,509
Hello.

674
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,049
Director Kim is in a foul mood.

675
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,750
The table read won't be easy today.

676
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:28,750
Hey, Young Hwa.

677
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:30,389
Yes?

678
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:32,319
Hello.

679
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,428
Something urgent came up for Mr. Jang,

680
00:46:42,429 --> 00:46:43,869
so he asked me to film the table read.

681
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,000
I already told him I can't do this.

682
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:47,739
What?

683
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,040
Then why are you here?

684
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,380
To meet you.

685
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,420
This was what they meant when they called him a himbo.

686
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,719
You ended up coming.

687
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,989
How brave.

688
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,289
And you look quite familiar.

689
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,400
Let's go.

690
00:47:10,799 --> 00:47:12,029
You can't leave now.

691
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,630
So? What time will you let us go home, Jun O?

692
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:17,539
At 10pm?

693
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,698
(Jung Yi Seul)

694
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:19,739
At 11pm?

695
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,409
I'm tired already.

696
00:47:30,819 --> 00:47:31,920
You said...

697
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,549
there was no obstacle that could stop you.

698
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:44,060
Show them who you are. Okay?

699
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:52,639
(Jung Yi Seul)

700
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:55,839
(Jung Yi Seul)

701
00:47:57,739 --> 00:47:59,440
Get ready to be humiliated.

702
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,480
You should've taken a hint when I gave you advice.

703
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,580
Be prepared, Jun O.

704
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,659
Did I just fall...

705
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:13,190
into the trap I made?

706
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:15,690
You can do it.

707
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:19,960
Gosh. Why did he end up with a director who has a bad temper?

708
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:23,940
Goodness, it's over.

709
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,899
Stop blocking my way. Move aside.

710
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,569
Yes, hello, Director Kim.

711
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,508
- Hello. - Hello.

712
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:32,838
- Hello. - You're here.

713
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:33,909
Hello.

714
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,580
(Director Kim Chang Hyuk)

715
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,480
Go.

716
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,189
Our drama is an epic faction based on the story...

717
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,520
of Prince Ho Dong and Princess Nakrang.

718
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,158
It's told from the perspective of the historical eldest prince,

719
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:47,659
the older brother of Prince Ho Dong.

720
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:51,330
The lead role, Prince Hae Woo, will be played by Han Jun O.

721
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,429
Enough.

722
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,839
Jun O, this is your first time playing a period drama.

723
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,369
You must be nervous to death.

724
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:02,969
You don't have to feel burdened.

725
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,709
We had already read this with Tae Ju before,

726
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,080
so you wouldn't be able to keep up.

727
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,919
This read is only a formality.

728
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,619
So today, we'll just read through.

729
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:16,949
Focus on your pronunciation and getting the story across.

730
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,988
You can forget the emotions and relax.

731
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,060
Now, let's go.

732
00:49:20,529 --> 00:49:22,690
"The royal subjects are at the Crown Prince's abode."

733
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,560
"Prince Ho Dong lies face down in front of Prince Hae Woo."

734
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,069
"The subjects begin to raise their voices at Prince Hae Woo."

735
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,100
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

736
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:33,699
- We beg your kindness. - We beg your kindness.

737
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:38,639
The Kingdom of Nakrang is like our brother.

738
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:42,549
We cannot let you volunteer to become a spy.

739
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:45,279
This is preposterous, Your Highness.

740
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,600
Enough is enough.

741
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:07,138
Do you expect me...

742
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:09,440
to break the royal command if you do not approve?

743
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:14,650
Do you dare to live...

744
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:18,350
even after defying His Majesty's order?

745
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:20,919
- What? - He's good.

746
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,819
- What's going on? - What's he doing?

747
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,929
Prince Ho Dong, pick up from there.

748
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:29,830
Yes.

749
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,860
How can you seduce the Princess of Nakrang?

750
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,600
How can the Crown Prince of a kingdom resort to such a trick...

751
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,639
Did you just call this a trick?

752
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,409
In that case, tell me...

753
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,250
how else we can destroy the self-sounding drum.

754
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,879
How can we retrieve the land they took from us?

755
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,580
How can you become...

756
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,190
the king of a kingdom with such a faint heart?

757
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:01,429
Ho Dong, lines. Cue.

758
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:05,830
You are the Crown Prince, Hae Woo. I am not the one.

759
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,600
- I am the second son. How... - A king is...

760
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,369
destined by the skies.

761
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,540
Our people are the skies.

762
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:22,480
And the skies share their affection...

763
00:51:24,279 --> 00:51:25,580
for you, not me.

764
00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:29,089
Trust me.

765
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,619
I will make sure I turn you...

766
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,190
into our king.

767
00:51:43,529 --> 00:51:44,569
Goodness.

768
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:06,159
Good work, Jun O.

769
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,830
Thank you for your hard work on day one, Young Hwa.

770
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,199
Don't mention it. I didn't do anything.

771
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:13,699
Enough is enough.

772
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:18,199
You did so well today.

773
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:22,170
I was worried about the sudden change in the way you talk.

774
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,739
Hey, Jun O!

775
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:26,339
How much did you practice?

776
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,350
Look at that.

777
00:52:28,351 --> 00:52:30,850
The sun is still up after the table read.

778
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,279
Did you see the look on people's faces?

779
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:36,219
I must've gone crazy.

780
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:41,159
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jun O.

781
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,790
Your clothes are in the car.

782
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,759
Should I pick it up?

783
00:52:46,259 --> 00:52:48,469
Will you do that?

784
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,600
Thank you, Young Hwa.

785
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,170
- Thank you. Okay. - I'll be back.

786
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:57,069
Jun O.

787
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:59,838
When did you practice so much?

788
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,779
I thought you came straight from that period.

789
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,819
Goodness, Mr. Han. Why didn't you tell me?

790
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,888
If I had known he had a knack for period dramas,

791
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:11,059
I would've cast him first.

792
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,059
Why did we go through so much trouble with Tae Ju?

793
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,429
We hope to do well...

794
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:29,210
Goodness, I thought he was practically dyslexic...

795
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,639
and traumatized.

796
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:36,509
Did he really recover thanks to me?

797
00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:53,730
What was that about? Tell me.

798
00:53:54,429 --> 00:53:55,699
What just happened there?

799
00:53:56,469 --> 00:53:57,669
You heard him.

800
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:00,170
- Jun O was unbelievably good. - That's crazy.

801
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,039
He's a terrible actor.

802
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,440
I was shocked too.

803
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:06,679
Something doesn't seem right.

804
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:08,778
I'm sure something is going on.

805
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,009
Nothing's going on.

806
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,389
So? Why are you here?

807
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:18,419
I thought you were in the detention center.

808
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,060
I proved my alibi.

809
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,790
How many times do I have to say that it wasn't me?

810
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,798
Who cares?

811
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:29,130
- You've been over for a while. - What?

812
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,000
Your life as an actor is over.

813
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:34,139
You need to be on a certain level before you feel inferior to him.

814
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,009
Hey.

815
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,049
Yi Seul.

816
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,179
Hey!

817
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,690
Darn it! Goodness.

818
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:49,920
Gosh.

819
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,799
- Mr. Seok? - It's nice to see you, Mr. Gu.

820
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,259
I've been dying to meet you.

821
00:55:01,069 --> 00:55:02,069
Me?

822
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:07,270
Sure. It's been a while, I guess.

823
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,239
What?

824
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,850
Everything will go back to its place if he disappears.

825
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,250
Sorry?

826
00:55:20,889 --> 00:55:22,549
Darn it. That's my hand...

827
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,920
Is Young Hwa not back yet?

828
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,319
I haven't seen her since she left.

829
00:55:56,049 --> 00:55:57,119
You still haven't found her?

830
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,900
What are you doing over there?

831
00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:16,069
This is that shirt, isn't it?

832
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:19,480
The one you wore when we got abducted.

833
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,049
That's not mine.

834
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:29,020
Feel free to ask Mr. Jang.

835
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,290
Have you heard of scattered bloodstain?

836
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,699
The stain shows that the blood got splattered nearby.

837
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,540
I've seen many bloodstains like this when I got dispatched.

838
00:56:46,339 --> 00:56:48,170
Why is this on your shirt?

839
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:50,009
How can you be sure?

840
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,639
I can find out through a DNA test.

841
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,920
What are you doing?

842
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,600
That bracelet.

843
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,400
Why did you do that, Young Hwa?

844
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,940
I told you never to take it off.

845
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,439
The kids made fun of me...

846
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,210
and called this a weird necklace.

847
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,940
No, I don't want this!

848
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:32,949
You had found it back then...

849
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:37,150
and came up with a trick to make her wear it all the time.

850
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:40,119
Once I get rid of that,

851
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:43,560
everything will be over.

852
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:50,130
Han Jun O.

853
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,270
Without you...

854
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,040
If you disappear...

855
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,610
Move, Jun O!

856
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,029
I said...

857
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,569
I would never let you die in someone else's hands.

858
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:25,900
Young Hwa.

859
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:29,509
I must kill you with my own two hands.

860
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,480
It is time to wake up.

861
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:40,949
What's going on?

862
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:43,690
Was I not dead?

863
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:48,029
Your wound should not be too severe.

864
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,029
I avoided...

865
00:58:56,569 --> 00:58:58,069
Han Jun O?

866
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,170
the vital points on purpose.

867
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:06,880
I will kill you without fail!

868
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,619
What's all this?

869
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:13,650
What's going on?

870
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:31,699
Young Hwa.

871
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:39,080
Young Hwa. Wake up, Young Hwa.

872
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,639
Young Hwa!

873
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,330
(Moon in the Day)

874
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:40,299
You need to know how to shoot an arrow...

875
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:42,469
to shoot one and kill me.

876
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,278
Find out more about that girl.

877
01:00:52,279 --> 01:00:53,850
I must have returned...

878
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,389
from the dream.

879
01:00:55,889 --> 01:00:57,350
Gu Tae Ju was with who?

880
01:00:58,259 --> 01:01:00,889
When someone is reborn, they usually don't remember.

881
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,290
My lord.
