00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,019
(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,049
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,050
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,090
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

5
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,660
I'm scared that I'll regret it again.

6
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,230
I'm afraid the tragedy...

7
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:09,740
from my past life will repeat if I fall in love with you.

8
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
But I can't help it.

9
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,509
I've fallen too deeply for you,

10
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,589
and I want to live.

11
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,259
I just want to...

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,630
be with you as Kang Young Hwa.

13
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,130
I want to...

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,199
live with you.

15
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:45,169
Yes.

16
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,640
Let's live.

17
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,080
We'll live.

18
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:58,690
I will make sure...

19
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:04,220
to change our destiny.

20
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,569
I promise you...

21
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,870
that our ending in this life...

22
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,009
will not be a sad ending.

23
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,639
But to do that,

24
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:59,650
we can't let anyone get hurt because of me.

25
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,079
I'll protect...

26
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,220
you and all those people.

27
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,859
Let me do it with you.

28
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,259
Two people are better than one.

29
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,569
I will not...

30
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:23,340
back down or run away anymore.

31
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,310
Then,

32
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,250
you're going to need a weapon.

33
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,489
Never take it off again.

34
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,060
This amulet is...

35
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,100
the only weapon that will keep you safe from So Ri Bu.

36
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,669
I was sorry that I left the amulet.

37
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,239
It felt like leaving you behind.

38
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,739
Though I was determined to end everything,

39
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,410
I looked back so many times.

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,079
Maybe you were going to come back to me.

41
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,750
Thanks for holding on to me...

42
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,660
and not letting me give up on us.

43
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,190
You were the one who always...

44
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:20,289
reached out to me.

45
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,200
Thank you...

46
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,100
for not letting go of my hand.

47
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:41,820
(Moon in the Day)

48
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,379
(Episode 13)

49
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,900
I've only come here to dive in and rescue people.

50
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,799
But this is what people do at the Han River.

51
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,269
- Here's the photo. - You took a great one.

52
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,479
Did you pray so desperately at that time?

53
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,780
Of course. I genuinely thought I was dying.

54
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,248
"If I do have a guardian deity, please save me."

55
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:22,419
While thinking that, I passed out.

56
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,189
Wait.

57
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,330
That was you?

58
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,629
Do you have other guardian deities but me?

59
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,840
We've already kissed numerous times.

60
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,669
Don't be too surprised.

61
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,379
I just thought that it was unfair.

62
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,450
You've kept an eye on me...

63
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:23,350
and saved me, even when I didn't realize it.

64
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,559
But it took me so long to decide to be with you.

65
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,419
I already told you.

66
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,629
I didn't always feel this way.

67
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,030
But it feels like those moments existed...

68
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,299
for this moment.

69
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,809
To look in the same direction as you...

70
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,010
and walk side by side.

71
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:01,660
Promise me that we'll come back here.

72
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,830
The view of the sunset is amazing here.

73
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:08,100
We should come back for the sunset.

74
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,729
We can lay down a mat and eat cup noodles...

75
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:14,229
next to each other.

76
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
What do you say?

77
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,710
Sure. Let's do that.

78
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,179
Now, you sound like Young Hwa.

79
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,320
But first,

80
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,150
we have a job to do.

81
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,220
We should find a way to get rid of So Ri Bu.

82
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,419
Before that,

83
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,799
there's one important matter that we must deal with.

84
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,938
Why are you being so stubborn?

85
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:55,438
You can't leave the hospital yet.

86
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,710
But Young Hwa seemed way too strange.

87
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,950
She's been ignoring all my calls too.

88
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:01,479
That ghost guy...

89
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,820
also stormed out with a bizarre look on his face.

90
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,890
Congratulations!

91
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:11,989
- Gosh. - This is awesome.

92
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:13,590
When did you have time to set up all these?

93
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:17,128
I went to the hospital to see her,

94
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,399
but they told me that you were discharged.

95
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,970
So, I improvised.

96
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,100
Hey!

97
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,070
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

98
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,809
Do you have any idea how worried I was on my way here?

99
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,379
You should have stopped me when I told you about this plan.

100
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,350
We should still try...

101
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,960
since we want her approval.

102
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,508
None of this can change my mind.

103
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,970
Over my dead body.

104
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,509
My precious Young Hwa?

105
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,580
I'm never letting her go to you.

106
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:08,950
Come on, Na Yeon.

107
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,720
We should at least hear them out.

108
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,359
Are you serious?

109
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,259
Whose side are you on?

110
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,060
I think we've done enough.

111
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,369
We already had...

112
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,399
our wedding 1,500 years ago.

113
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,639
So what?

114
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,138
I have to give you my approval...

115
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,509
because you were married in your past life?

116
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,979
What's more important is...

117
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,580
that Young Hwa is currently in grave danger.

118
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:43,450
I've watched all the previous lives of my wife,

119
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,649
and she was always...

120
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,590
killed before her 30th birthday.

121
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,029
"Killed?"

122
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:56,999
What are you talking about?

123
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,869
So, I plan to protect her.

124
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,769
To do that,

125
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,909
I need help from people around her.

126
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,909
If you keep pushing me away and stop me from seeing her,

127
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:14,710
she will be in bigger danger.

128
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,779
Is that her birthday?

129
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,889
Does that mean she only has a week left?

130
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,489
Young Hwa, you say it.

131
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,430
What's all this nonsense?

132
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,560
It's true, Na Yeon.

133
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,170
There's an evil spirit that wants to kill me.

134
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,868
All the accidents so far...

135
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,739
and what happened to you recently...

136
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,909
were all related to that evil spirit.

137
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
That spirit is...

138
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,379
possessing Seok Chul Hwan's body.

139
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,379
What?

140
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,479
I don't have time to convince you of every detail.

141
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,050
Just trust Young Hwa and let me stay by her side.

142
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,159
For Young Hwa...

143
00:10:58,629 --> 00:10:59,889
that you love.

144
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:01,899
Are you threatening me...

145
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,629
that Young Hwa will die if I don't allow this?

146
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,869
It's because you almost died because of me.

147
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,369
The evil spirit has always come at me through the people around me.

148
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,970
We're telling you this...

149
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,180
because it's for the safety of all of us.

150
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,009
And you are...

151
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,450
my only family left.

152
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,580
I won't let Young Hwa or anyone else get hurt.

153
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:25,820
I promise to keep everyone safe...

154
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,690
as much as I can.

155
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,389
So, that's why.

156
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:34,690
I had no idea it was a life-or-death situation.

157
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,229
I've always complained.

158
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,170
Na Yeon,

159
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:41,399
please trust us.

160
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,909
That's the only way to protect yourself and Mr. Jang.

161
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,479
You.

162
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,850
Do you drink?

163
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:13,028
They say that you must drink with a man...

164
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,330
to tell his true colours.

165
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,469
Why are you drinking out of the blue?

166
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,340
It hasn't even been that long since your surgery.

167
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,310
I have my knight.

168
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,238
If you win, we're going on a trip to Sokcho for three days. Deal?

169
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,550
Deal.

170
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,879
Drinking is about your will.

171
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,190
I'll be your knight.

172
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,920
I've never lost a fight before.

173
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,489
Let us begin.

174
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:42,930
What?

175
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,170
I like your grit.

176
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,239
Shall we begin?

177
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:53,269
- We're going to Sokcho. - Sokcho.

178
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,180
Yoon Je.

179
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,420
You can't do that!

180
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,589
- That's... - Please don't do this.

181
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,258
- You're so cool. - One of them is going to die.

182
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,758
If we drink this fast, we're all going down.

183
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,029
Jun O, are you sure you're all right?

184
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,440
Come on, man.

185
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:31,540
I'm still older than you.

186
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,450
He calls me in a friendly way only when he needs me.

187
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,119
He never even told me his name.

188
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,619
What...

189
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,190
"Kim Do Ha."

190
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,859
Was that so hard to tell me?

191
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,729
You can stop.

192
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,699
Please stop this, Na Yeon.

193
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,100
They're way too drunk.

194
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:55,769
You can hold your liquor.

195
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,239
I've been good at most things in life.

196
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,710
You were talking about a thousand years or something.

197
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,479
Which country are you from? Goryeo? The era of the Three States?

198
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,179
I'm from Seorabeol, Silla.

199
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
I used to live in Silla Apartment.

200
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,050
What a coincidence.

201
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,119
- No! - Yoon Je!

202
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:15,789
Don't even think about vomiting here.

203
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,158
- Come outside, Mr. Jang. - Where?

204
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,659
Wait! No.

205
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,259
Go that way.

206
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,398
- What are you... - Stop talking gibberish.

207
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,800
Come with me.

208
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,300
It's this way.

209
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,070
Get inside.

210
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:36,079
You wanted my approval,

211
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,210
so let me ask you one thing.

212
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,109
Why Young Hwa?

213
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,319
Why does Young Hwa have to be involved...

214
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,920
of all those people?

215
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,060
Because there's no one else like her.

216
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,060
Young Hwa,

217
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:06,739
the woman of my life...

218
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,979
There's only one of her.

219
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,739
Na Yeon was too mean.

220
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,440
She even got a ghost drunk.

221
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,180
That was the 1st time I was drunk in 1,500 years.

222
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,859
This scar...

223
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,029
seems darker than before.

224
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,070
It's my first time possessing a human's body.

225
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:43,869
It's probably the light.

226
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,540
You seem unwell.

227
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,180
You know that this scar isn't new.

228
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,749
Don't worry.

229
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,519
It's probably nothing.

230
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,330
Have you ever regretted it?

231
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:10,000
When I killed So Ri Bu,

232
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,100
you could have made a different choice.

233
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,439
You went so far...

234
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,179
to save me.

235
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,679
I didn't want to leave you feeling anxious for even a second.

236
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,580
That's why I wanted to protect you...

237
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,719
and make you happy.

238
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:40,459
I'm sorry...

239
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,500
for being inconsiderate and saying that I was right...

240
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,270
in making that decision in the past life.

241
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,609
Is it too late to apologize?

242
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:08,889
Right now is all I need.

243
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,290
We'll never be separated again.

244
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:17,859
To feel all the happiness we've missed,

245
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:21,830
the rest of our lives wouldn't be enough.

246
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,469
Sure. We'll do that.

247
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:27,770
Just like now,

248
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,480
we'll always be together.

249
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,379
Yes.

250
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:54,230
Goodness.

251
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,740
What on earth...

252
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,270
Are you serious, dude?

253
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,010
Hey. Open the door.

254
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,010
This guy.

255
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:09,850
Open the door!

256
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,149
Hey, you can't just park...

257
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,260
I mean, can you move your car...

258
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:30,639
Darn.

259
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,909
I can't possess another body at this state.

260
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,179
I must...

261
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:48,050
destroy Young Hwa's amulet, no matter what.

262
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,699
What brought you here...

263
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:10,139
We could've missed each other.

264
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,379
Where are you going, sir?

265
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:15,820
I was headed to pray for a hundred days.

266
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,580
Please spare time for me.

267
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:26,959
Off you go.

268
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,560
I mean, the kettle...

269
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,010
I'll ask straightforwardly.

270
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:50,879
The evil spirit in the past life...

271
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,750
is trying to kill Young Hwa.

272
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:56,359
If there's a grudge,

273
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,790
we can work it off.

274
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,859
But how could we handle this evil spirit?

275
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:04,929
By any chance...

276
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:07,600
Do you know its weakness?

277
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:09,740
The reason for its existence...

278
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:13,409
must be its weakness.

279
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,810
A ghost should leave when its grudge is satisfied.

280
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:19,310
A spirit without its reason for existence...

281
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,409
should leave this world too.

282
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,780
The same thing is applied to an evil spirit.

283
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,550
The things ghosts are obsessed with...

284
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,060
usually have their answers to solve the problem.

285
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,859
It's because that obsession is what ties them here.

286
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,600
Just like you.

287
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,300
What are you obsessed with?

288
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,250
I'm not tied here...

289
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,090
because of the obsession.

290
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:06,629
It's because of my foolishness,

291
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,429
believing that I had a grudge...

292
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,500
for her killing me.

293
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,570
The mere lotus seed became the amulet...

294
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,938
because of the earnest wish...

295
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,179
to protect someone the person loved.

296
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:24,780
Sometimes, a wish is...

297
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:28,149
more powerful than a grudge.

298
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,060
However,

299
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:39,359
a ghost who does evil behaviours...

300
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,790
only has grudges.

301
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,799
(Administration, reception, and payment)

302
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,869
Take a look at what the evil spirit is obsessed with.

303
00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:57,240
Think about the reason you are here...

304
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,609
and the obsession of the evil spirit.

305
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,520
You'll be able to find the answer from them.

306
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
(Jun O)

307
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,030
Where are you?

308
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,800
Are you done with the task you wanted to finish?

309
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:37,280
Why is it getting darker?

310
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,389
Is he really fine?

311
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,889
I'm not sure yet.

312
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,689
Everything is fine at home?

313
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:50,530
I'll be there soon.

314
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:53,169
Yes, come here already.

315
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:59,608
How could she like the ghost so much?

316
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,270
She makes me crazy.

317
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,139
Wait. Was he her ex-husband?

318
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,679
By the way,

319
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,649
are we going to Sokcho or...

320
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,179
Your phone is ringing.

321
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,290
Yes, I'm Mr. Jang from Beginning Entertainment.

322
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,659
Sorry, a hospital?

323
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,859
Why? Should I go back there again?

324
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,330
- What should we do? - Why?

325
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,409
Mr. Han is...

326
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,378
- What's up? - Mr. Han's in a critical condition!

327
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:46,790
We all are heading to the hospital.

328
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,219
(Siin Hospital)

329
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:54,030
I'll go up first to see how bad it is. Please take care of her.

330
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:55,858
Don't worry. We'll soon catch you up.

331
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:56,929
Okay.

332
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,899
(Administration, reception, and payment)

333
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:02,000
Excuse me. I got a call from the hospital...

334
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:03,639
that Mr. Han Min O was in critical condition.

335
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:08,340
Nothing's serious about him.

336
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,909
I heard a nurse called us and said he was in a bad condition.

337
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,149
Didn't you call someone earlier? I think I saw it.

338
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,580
Me? I didn't call anyone.

339
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,010
Don't you think you came too late even after hearing the call?

340
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:43,639
Of course. It was you, So Ri Bu.

341
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,810
I told you.

342
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,179
If you don't die, people around you will be in danger.

343
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,080
I told you too.

344
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,949
The amulet is with me now.

345
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,990
As long as I keep this, you can't hurt anyone.

346
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,359
Good. That damn amulet.

347
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:08,169
I could've finished you already if you didn't have that.

348
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,340
You knew I've kept this all along.

349
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:14,209
I couldn't kill you because of it,

350
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,780
but I could kill others instead.

351
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:19,250
It goes the same for Min O.

352
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,550
I won't allow you to touch him, even with a fingertip.

353
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:23,878
You're protecting the person who wanted to kill you?

354
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:25,519
How naive.

355
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,889
It's because I know he was tricked by you.

356
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,020
But his ill will was real.

357
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,429
I just blew it off...

358
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,929
to go in the right direction.

359
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,030
By touching the most earnest mind?

360
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,669
I understand what you mean.

361
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,000
I also...

362
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:47,969
wanted to save someone I loved,

363
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:51,240
even if I had to kill someone.

364
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,709
Then try to understand...

365
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,080
why I need to kill you too.

366
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,820
Why do you keep doing this?

367
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,689
You're to blame for that.

368
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:07,958
I killed you so many times,

369
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,600
but you were born again and again.

370
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,928
It's so exciting to see you...

371
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:17,600
dying and being drawn in pain...

372
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:20,570
without knowing any reason.

373
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,840
Just die at my hand.

374
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:27,149
It doesn't matter. You'll be reborn again.

375
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:37,859
Wait.

376
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,889
- What's wrong? - We can't go in, Na Yeon.

377
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,730
What?

378
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:45,330
We should get out of here.

379
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:47,129
What?

380
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:51,169
It's a trick. What should we do?

381
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,740
Young Hwa is with Chul Hwan now.

382
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:55,639
Young Hwa.

383
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,780
I won't play in your playground anymore.

384
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,050
Even if I should be killed, it won't be by you.

385
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,350
My condition is simple.

386
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:12,119
If you don't take it off,

387
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:14,959
Min O will die.

388
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:35,280
You should chase me now.

389
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,280
I'm the one you want to kill.

390
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:47,790
Take a look at what the evil spirit is obsessed with.

391
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,500
Think about the reason you are here...

392
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,129
and the obsession of the evil spirit.

393
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,100
You'll be able to find the answer from them.

394
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,520
You dare to give Min O the amulet.

395
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:22,060
You'll die because of the person who tried to kill you.

396
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:24,060
I said I won't allow anyone...

397
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,500
to be hurt because of me.

398
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,869
Then, what about Do Ha?

399
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,108
Not only did he become a poltergeist,

400
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:35,510
but he also put all his efforts into protecting you.

401
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,350
You must've seen the scar on his neck becoming darker.

402
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:42,780
Do you think it's easy to pull oneself together with the dead body?

403
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,090
Soon, the pain will devour Do Ha.

404
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,119
You will confine...

405
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,090
the one you love in such misery again.

406
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,730
Is that your love?

407
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:04,639
Young Hwa.

408
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:14,409
It is love.

409
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,820
That was the love he taught me.

410
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,560
The evil spirit who knows nothing but revenge will never know...

411
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,359
the desperate wish...

412
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,429
to protect your loved one despite the misery.

413
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,070
I do not care how long this lasts,

414
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,040
as long as I can keep you safe...

415
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:44,740
and be with you.

416
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,949
I am willing to do...

417
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,189
everything.

418
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,629
Ending the cycle of Han Ri Ta's karma...

419
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,260
and presenting her...

420
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,500
with a safe 31st birthday...

421
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:09,399
was my wish.

422
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:20,909
I'm sorry.

423
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,719
I gave my amulet to Mr. Han.

424
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,520
It is okay.

425
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,189
Because I will protect you now.

426
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:42,629
No matter what happens, do not open this door.

427
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,669
Jun O.

428
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,279
I told you that you can't stop me.

429
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,020
The same goes for you.

430
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,959
The reason Han Ri Ta in her past lives had to die...

431
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:07,729
The reason your power weakens...

432
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,000
as Young Hwa's birthday approaches. Everything...

433
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,230
had to do with the age of 30 you were obsessed with.

434
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,810
The time of her death, her 30th year...

435
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:24,310
meant the time limit...

436
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,879
until the extinction of your soul.

437
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,179
So what?

438
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,750
What difference does it make that you found that out?

439
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,389
It changes everything.

440
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,158
If I protect her to become 30 years old,

441
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,590
you will be extinct.

442
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:44,300
And that...

443
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,399
will happen now.

444
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,240
Protecting Young Hwa...

445
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,740
from you...

446
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,280
has been my reason for being.

447
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:02,949
The curse will come to an end now.

448
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:11,659
You and I are holding a double-sided sword, anyway.

449
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,628
The reason for your existence...

450
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:17,230
is to protect the girl from me.

451
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,029
If I am extinct, the reason for your existence will vanish too.

452
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,100
You will cease to exist, then.

453
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,340
You two...

454
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,439
will never see each other again.

455
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,419
You are not my target anyway.

456
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:58,040
It's Jun O.

457
00:33:58,699 --> 00:33:59,709
It's Jun O.

458
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:03,740
Na Yeon, let's hurry up too.

459
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,709
- What? - Is that really him?

460
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,389
Hop in!

461
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,069
We shouldn't go back to your place.

462
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,210
When he sent you the yew tree or whatever,

463
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,079
I told Chul Hwan your address...

464
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,479
and places you would go.

465
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,850
Why are you helping me, then?

466
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,389
Because I should side with you to save my life.

467
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,830
This is the company card Mr. Han used to use.

468
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,770
Only Mr. Han can track it, so no one else can find it.

469
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:01,999
It doesn't have a limit, so use it...

470
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,100
to go somewhere away from people.

471
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,339
Why do you help us this much?

472
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,170
Because you told me to be careful.

473
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,710
Thank you.

474
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,110
Just say thank you in a situation like this.

475
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,110
There's no need to ask questions. Bye.

476
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,520
If you are really helping us,

477
00:35:20,049 --> 00:35:21,420
Chul Hwan will come for you.

478
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,190
I should go to a place where I'll be safe.

479
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,738
(Seoul Gieun Police Station)

480
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:39,499
How come we can't find anything in Han Min O's case?

481
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,008
Gosh, I know.

482
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:43,480
The reporter didn't see the perp.

483
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,939
I mean, how can he not remember the face...

484
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,449
when he confronted the guy face to face?

485
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,020
Was he possessed or what? Gosh.

486
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:51,850
- I... - Goodness.

487
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,290
saw the guy.

488
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:57,159
The guy who hurt Mr. Han Min O.

489
00:35:57,619 --> 00:35:59,189
I saw him myself.

490
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,588
Really?

491
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:01,860
Also, there is another person.

492
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:04,929
Believe it or not,

493
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:09,069
what I am about to tell you is all true.

494
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:13,839
So lock me in first...

495
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,739
and keep talking.

496
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:34,029
(Transferring patients)

497
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,190
Darn it!

498
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:41,528
Yes. I will take care of things once I get there.

499
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:42,730
Then, I will come find you.

500
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Okay.

501
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,639
Why? We can't go home now?

502
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,839
Let's follow what they say.

503
00:36:53,549 --> 00:36:55,679
He says that's the only way for all of us to be safe.

504
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:36,790
Didn't they just put out a BOLO for that car?

505
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,029
We found the wanted car, 25C 0614.

506
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,790
You must've seen the scar on his neck becoming darker.

507
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,659
Do you think it's easy to pull oneself together with the dead body?

508
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,460
Soon, the pain will devour Do Ha.

509
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:25,069
Have some. You haven't eaten all day.

510
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,339
You know that I do not die even if I do not eat.

511
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:29,310
That's not how a human body works.

512
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,810
You have to eat well to fight back. Here.

513
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,719
Do not mind what Father told you.

514
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:44,420
Okay.

515
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:53,969
- Young Hwa. - I'm sorry.

516
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,339
I didn't know how tough it had been for you.

517
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,239
But I won't give up.

518
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:05,710
There must be a way.

519
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,080
I will find a way...

520
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,380
so that you can stay in that body without suffering.

521
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,580
I already found the way.

522
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:14,989
The way to get rid of So Ri Bu.

523
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:17,219
Really?

524
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,089
He wants you...

525
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:26,130
to continue to suffer by the karma from the past life.

526
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:30,369
That's why he keeps killing you...

527
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,610
so that you will be reincarnated.

528
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:37,980
If I can protect you to become 30,

529
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,409
he will go extinct.

530
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,020
Because the reason for his existence will be gone.

531
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,589
If I just survive past my birthday,

532
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,830
So Ri Bu will disappear?

533
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,060
That's right.

534
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,670
I found the car numbered 25C 0614 on the wanted list.

535
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:14,909
Nobody is here.

536
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,219
What is this?

537
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:01,489
That night,

538
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,330
in the taxi we were on to run far away from my father,

539
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:10,869
Young Hwa dreamed about the rest of our past,

540
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:14,969
the last moment...

541
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:18,339
we shared together.

542
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:21,150
I will be back soon.

543
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:52,310
I love you,

544
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,210
Master.

545
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
As I thought,

546
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,080
we should never have been together.

547
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,310
But even if we return to the beginning,

548
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:34,190
I know I will fall in love with you again.

549
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,159
Do not die.

550
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:43,960
Please do not die.

551
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,699
Live.

552
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,940
Even in this moment, you are...

553
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:54,170
Please. I ask of you, Ri Ta.

554
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,339
Live.

555
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,719
- Save yourself. - trying to save me.

556
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:50,960
It was true.

557
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:55,100
You stayed by my side to save me.

558
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,909
Everything was a dream,

559
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,210
a thing of the past.

560
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:06,310
It's all right.

561
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:12,850
In the past and even right now,

562
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:16,719
you are the only reason why I exist.

563
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,670
What if we had never met like this?

564
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,110
We wouldn't have had a chance to talk...

565
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,639
and only remembered each other with so much pain.

566
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,980
Even so,

567
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:44,779
I would have stayed by your side.

568
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:47,589
Always.

569
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:52,819
But it's a huge relief we can talk to each other...

570
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:54,960
face-to-face.

571
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,699
Let's stay together for a very long time.

572
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:07,009
Do Ha, you and I are holding the same double-edged sword.

573
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:09,968
You exist here...

574
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:12,440
to protect that girl from me.

575
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,709
If I am extinct, the reason for your existence will vanish too.

576
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:16,920
You will cease to exist, then.

577
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,389
I cannot...

578
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:24,389
bear to tell you the truth.

579
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,560
Will you forgive me someday?

580
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:32,500
Then,

581
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:37,639
why don't we try doing everything we wanted to do,

582
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,670
starting now?

583
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:12,238
Did you think I wouldn't be...

584
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:13,469
able to find you if you hid away like this?

585
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,810
I can't do anything to you as long as you're in there.

586
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,980
Sit with me for a moment.

587
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,480
If you call the police, more officers will die.

588
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,549
Is that okay with you?

589
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,989
I went through lots of trouble after you reported me to the police.

590
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:36,529
So?

591
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,600
How's life in the detention center?

592
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,500
Whenever I close my eyes,

593
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,639
I hear Gu Tae Ju shrieking.

594
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:46,100
But...

595
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:49,069
yesterday night, I had a good sleep for once.

596
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:54,009
Listen up.

597
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,520
Where is Kang Young Hwa right now?

598
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:05,920
I dropped her off in the middle. I don't know where she is now.

599
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:08,960
Also,

600
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,330
I couldn't tell you anything...

601
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,929
even if you threatened to kill me here!

602
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,170
Your turn comes after those two!

603
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:19,900
So stay locked up in there...

604
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:22,369
until I return to kill you.

605
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:24,610
So?

606
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,909
Do you think you'll get a good sleep tonight?

607
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:36,719
Now, it's your turn to tell me where you dropped off...

608
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,520
those two.

609
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,319
Are you worried?

610
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:16,960
No.

611
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,869
I was just enjoying the sunlight.

612
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:25,739
I don't think so.

613
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,709
You're thinking, "Will everything really end well?"

614
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,540
"Is everything all right?"

615
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,239
That was your worried face.

616
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:36,778
You've been glued to the book the moment we got here...

617
00:48:36,779 --> 00:48:39,179
because you didn't want me to see you look worried.

618
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:42,819
No, I'm really enjoying the book.

619
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:47,159
I think you're lying.

620
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,830
I even memorized everything I've read so far.

621
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,000
Let me see. What is it about?

622
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:55,928
- Show me. - I'm serious.

623
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:56,929
- Let me see. - I read it so intensely...

624
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:58,440
- that I memorized it all. - Show me.

625
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:11,650
Why didn't you keep the door shut?

626
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,089
I had no idea.

627
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,069
Gosh.

628
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:35,539
How did you find such an isolated place?

629
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,908
Even the navigator got lost,

630
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:39,239
so it was tough to get here.

631
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,610
I found an adequate place in Han Jun O's memories.

632
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,580
This place was the least public.

633
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,949
"Han Jun O's memories?"

634
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:52,389
He must have thought of a place where Mr. Han and Jun O...

635
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,488
came by from time to time.

636
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:55,559
I see.

637
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,730
They came here to go off the grid whenever he was in a scandal.

638
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,100
It must be uncomfortable to stay here.

639
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:08,068
But please hold out for just a few more days.

640
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:09,309
"Hold out?"

641
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,838
Have you been outside?

642
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,509
This place is wonderful.

643
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,579
And I didn't have any students anyway,

644
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,948
so I was about to shut down.

645
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:18,579
But now I'm here on a break to just chill out.

646
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,489
I'm telling you. It's all about marketing.

647
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,750
First off, you need a new name.

648
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,560
"Champion Choi Na Yeon's Kendo Studio?"

649
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,299
It's such a tacky name.

650
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:36,770
Goodness, what's wrong?

651
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:38,899
- What did you say? - Put it down.

652
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,869
That's considered assault.

653
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:42,610
What did you just say?

654
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,409
You're in trouble. She's going to beat you up.

655
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:47,548
What did you say?

656
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:49,249
You'll be just fine.

657
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,520
What are you saying?

658
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,250
You'll be yourself and stay brave.

659
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:55,850
Cut it out.

660
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:58,060
I know you will.

661
00:50:58,659 --> 00:50:59,690
Are you going to beat me?

662
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:02,560
Even if I do not get to see you again,

663
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,730
you will go on to live as a 31-year-old, a 41-year-old,

664
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:13,000
and as a Gray-haired old woman over time.

665
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,739
If I can keep you safe until then,

666
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:18,810
I will gladly...

667
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:21,080
and happily...

668
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:23,980
disappear.

669
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,100
Let's come back here.

670
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,968
The sunset looks amazing from this place.

671
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:45,139
Let's come back for the sunset.

672
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,770
We can lay down a mat and eat cup noodles...

673
00:51:50,009 --> 00:51:51,239
next to each other.

674
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,440
What do you think?

675
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,469
- Why are you stopping? - I have to close the doors.

676
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:17,639
Where? What...

677
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,449
If we were...

678
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,619
normal...

679
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:35,489
How would it have been, then?

680
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,060
What if we had never met like this?

681
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,869
We would have only remembered each other with so much pain.

682
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,799
But it's a huge relief we can talk to each other...

683
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,110
face-to-face.

684
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:01,850
Let's stay together for a very long time.

685
00:53:55,969 --> 00:53:58,569
Thank you.

686
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,069
Is it good?

687
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:10,819
This is so good.

688
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:12,779
Yes.

689
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,589
- All right. - We spent ordinary days...

690
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,500
until that day came.

691
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,029
Why are you so slow?

692
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:35,270
We all went out and bought a birthday cake...

693
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,139
at a nearby market.

694
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,279
And the news shocked us for a moment.

695
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,349
(Actress Jung Yi Seul Found After Attempted Suicide)

696
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,290
(Her Life Was Not in Danger)

697
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,588
Let's get fruit.

698
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:52,819
And there was...

699
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:56,690
also a piece of pleasant news we found out much later.

700
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,139
(Seoul Neungil University Hospital)

701
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,310
I know what I want for my birthday.

702
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,719
Buy me two of these.

703
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,989
Here.

704
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,830
We put on rings we bought for five dollars at a marketplace...

705
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,469
and walked around that dusty marketplace together...

706
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:41,009
- just like the day we got married. - It looks so good on you.

707
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:43,670
It's pretty.

708
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,250
That was the happiest time I have spent with her...

709
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:51,949
in my life.

710
00:56:11,139 --> 00:56:12,899
Did you hide in this countryside...

711
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,610
to make me work so hard to look for you?

712
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,210
And came that night.

713
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,690
It was just before Young Hwa's 30th birthday,

714
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,119
the late hour just before midnight.

715
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:46,139
What was that? Why did these suddenly blow out?

716
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:24,880
Na Yeon.

717
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,759
Do you remember my words?

718
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,199
You have to focus on yourself for us to win.

719
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:48,199
Don't get hurt.

720
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,679
It's all right. Go out through the back door.

721
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:10,520
You suddenly disappeared into a mountain cabin,

722
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,560
so I almost lost you.

723
00:59:05,779 --> 00:59:08,549
(Moon in the Day)

724
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:12,980
You can never escape from me!

725
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,790
Do you still have no idea...

726
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,690
what will happen...

727
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:19,759
if you stay alive after tonight?

728
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,928
The moon was in the sky.

729
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:23,659
The sun shines so brightly,

730
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,000
so the moon is invisible even if it's there.

731
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:28,230
