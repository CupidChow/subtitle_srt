1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:11,980

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,580

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,380

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,180

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,470

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,080

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,990

8
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,710
I'm afraid I'll regret it again.

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,140
I'm afraid falling in love with you...

10
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,740
will cause tragedy like in our previous lives.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,310
But I can't help it, either.

12
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,520
I came to like you so much...

13
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,510
and I want to live.

14
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,560
I just want to be with you as Kang Yeong Hwa.

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,090
I just want to live with you like this.

16
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,590
Yes.

17
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,330
Let's live.

18
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,890
Let us live.

19
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,450
I will make sure...

20
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,210
to change our fate.

21
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,320
I promise you.

22
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,800
Our ending in this life...

23
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,760
will not be sad.

24
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,720
But to achieve that, no one can get hurt because of me again.

25
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,690
I'll protect them.

26
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,520
Both you and your people.

27
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,710
I'll join you.

28
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,320
Two is better than one.

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,230
I'll no longer...

30
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,300
step back or run away, either.

31
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,750
To do that,

32
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,990
you need a weapon.

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,300
Don't ever take it off from now on.

34
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,820
Right now, this talisman...

35
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,170
is the only weapon that can protect you from So Ri Bu.

36
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,750
I felt bad that I left the talisman.

37
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,150
It felt like leaving you behind.

38
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,740
I made up my mind to end everything,

39
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,630
but I kept looking back several times.

40
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,090
I guess it's because you'd be back like this.

41
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,100
Thank you for stopping me.

42
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,390
And not letting me give up on us.

43
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,080
You were the one who held my hand first.

44
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,780
Thank you...

45
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,130
for not letting go of my hands.

46
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,590
♫  Our everything  ♫

47
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,910
♫  Our everything  ♫

48
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,290

49
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,570

50
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,900
I was always busy getting into the water and saving people.

51
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,030
This is actually what the Han River is for.

52
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,390
Were you praying that desperately, then?

53
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,940
Of course. I thought I was actually dying then.

54
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,120
I prayed to my guardian angel to save me if I had one.

55
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,600
And I ended up losing consciousness.

56
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
By chance,

57
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,070
was it you then, too?

58
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,660
Do you have another guardian angel other than me?

59
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,120
We have already kissed countless times.

60
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,540
Why are you suddenly embarrassed?

61
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,300
I suddenly feel like it's unfair.

62
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,720
Even at times I didn't know,

63
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,390
you've been watching me and saving me.

64
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,230
But I finally decided to be with you.

65
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,390
I told you.

66
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,700
I didn't feel that way from the beginning, either.

67
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:39,280
But I think even those moments existed for the present.

68
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,610
So I could look in the same direction...

69
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,920
and walk with you by your side.

70
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,580
Let's make sure to come back here.

71
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,880
The sunset is really pretty here.

72
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,070
Let's come back to see the sunset again.

73
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,940
We'll sit on a picnic blanket and eat cup noodles

74
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,390
sitting side by side.

75
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,950
What do you think?

76
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,680
Okay. Let's.

77
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,860
You're finally like Kang Yeong Hwa.

78
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,180
But we have things to do for now.

79
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,380
We need to figure out how to get rid of So Ri Bu.

80
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,140
Before that,

81
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,700
there are very important things we need to take care of.

82
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,900
W-Why are you being so stubborn?

83
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,380
You can't leave the hospital yet.

84
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,890
I said Yeong Hwa's acting too strangely.

85
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,940
She hasn't been answering the phone and

86
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,650
that ghost ran out, making a really strange face, too.

87
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,980
Congratulations!

88
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,240
- Gosh. 
 - This is amazing.

89
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,750
When did you prepare all this?

90
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,260
Well, I went to the hospital to see her, but they said she left.

91
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,970
So, I put things together in a hurry.

92
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,080
Hey! Ouch...

93
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,720
Why didn't you answer your phone?

94
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,810
Do you know how much I worried on my way over here?

95
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,290
You should've stopped me when I wanted to do this.

96
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,800
But we should still try to get her approval.

97
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,370
There's no use in trying so hard.

98
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,090
Over my dead body.

99
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,080
My precious Yeong Hwa.

100
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,690
I can never let you have her.

101
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,830
Gosh, don't be like that.

102
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:11,040
You should hear what they have to say first and—

103
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
Are you serious right now?

104
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,350
Whose side are you on?

105
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,850
I think we tried hard enough.

106
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,510
1,500 years ago,

107
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,030
we already had a wedding.

108
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,720
W-What? So what?

109
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,580
Just approve since you were married in your previous lives?

110
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,660
What's more important is that...

111
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,470
Kang Yeong Hwa is in great danger right now.

112
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,460
I've been observing all of my wife's previous lives, but...

113
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,610
she always got killed before...

114
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,480
her 30th birthday.

115
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,440
K-Killed?

116
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,010
What are you talking about right now?

117
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,990
So I'm trying to protect her.

118
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,590
In order to do that,

119
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,170
I need help from people around her.

120
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,140
If you keep doubting me and not let me see her,

121
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,130
she'll be in greater danger.

122
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,720
If that day is her birthday,

123
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,900
we have about a week left. Don't we?

124
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,140
Kang Yeong Hwa. Why don't you tell me?

125
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,350
What's all this nonsense?

126
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,630
It's true, Sis.

127
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,130
There's an evil spirit who's trying to kill me.

128
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,960
The previous accidents and what happened to you recently

129
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,870
were all related to that evil spirit.

130
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,850
That evil spirit...

131
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,180
is inside Seok Cheol Hwan's body.

132
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,420
Pardon?

133
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,710
I don't have time to make you understand everything.

134
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,310
Just trust her and let me be by her side.

135
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:56,410
For your beloved sister, Kang Yeong Hwa.

136
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,520
Are you threatening me that she'd die if I'm against it or what?

137
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,750
It's because you almost died because of me.

138
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,500
The evil spirit has been attacking me using people around me.

139
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,820
I'm telling you this now because all of our safety is at stake.

140
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,360
And, Sis, you're my only family.

141
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,620
I'll make sure no one gets hurt, including Kang Yeong Hwa.

142
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,680
I promise I'll protect everyone as much as I can.

143
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,510
That was why.

144
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,590
I didn't know her life was at stake.

145
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,970
So I always complained.

146
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,980
Sis,

147
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,440
please believe us now.

148
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,990
That way, we can protect you and Mr. Jang, too.

149
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,520
You.

150
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,800
Are you a good drinker?

151
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,470
They say you have to drink with the person to understand his true side.

152
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,400
Why are we suddenly drinking?

153
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,230
You had surgery just a few days ago.

154
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,440
My proxy.

155
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,110
If you win, we'll take a trip to Sokcho as a couple for three days. Deal?

156
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,570
Deal.

157
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,330
Drinking is all about mental strength.

158
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,980
I'll be your proxy, then.

159
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,920
I've never lost a fight.

160
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,570
Let's get started.

161
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,330
What?

162
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,010
I like your spirit.

163
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,940
Shall we get started?

164
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,180
- We should go to Sokcho. 
 - Yes.

165
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,980
Yoon Je.

166
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,160
You can't do that.

167
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,880
- Wow, this is... 
 - Let's not do this.

168
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,060
Seriously, why—

169
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,590
We'll die if we drink this fast.

170
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,970
Are you okay, Han Joon Oh?

171
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,580
To be honest,

172
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,030
I look older than you, at least.

173
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,660
He only calls me "Hyung" when he needs me.

174
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,150
He didn't even tell me his name.

175
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,640
Kim Do Ha.

176
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,110
Was it really that hard to tell me your name?

177
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,420
Come on. That's my cat.

178
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,260
Sis, let's stop now. Everyone's too drunk.

179
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,990
You're a pretty good drinker.

180
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,430
I've always been good at everything.

181
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,780
You said you were from a thousand years ago and stuff.

182
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,670
What country are you from? Goryeo or the Three Kingdoms?

183
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,010
I'm from Seorabol of Silla.

184
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,000
I-I know a bit about Silla!

185
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,150
Silla... What a coincidence.

186
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,140
- Yoon Je! 
 - No, no.

187
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,410
Hey! Don't do that in there. Come out. Come out.

188
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,080
- Mr. Jang. 
 - Where then...

189
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,340
Hurry. No, no, no. This way. This way.

190
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,370
- But where... 
 - You're in my place!

191
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,870
Come over here!

192
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,510
This way, I said.

193
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,200
Why are you doing this? Gosh...

194
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,720
Well, you're the one who wanted my permission.

195
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,810
So let me ask you something.

196
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,700
Why Yeong Hwa?

197
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,000
Out of countless people, why does she have to get tangled up with you?

198
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,020
Because it has to be her.

199
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,840
Kang Yeong Hwa.

200
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,610
She has been my woman my whole life.

201
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,940
She's the only one.

202
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,670
Na Yeon went too far.

203
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,420
She even made a ghost get drunk.

204
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,180
It's been 1,500 years since I got drunk.

205
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,780
This wound...

206
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,110
I think it has gotten darker than before.

207
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,270
I've never been in a human body, so...

208
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,010
I think it's because of the light.

209
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,990
It looks painful.

210
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,340
You know I didn't get it just now.

211
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,250
Don't worry.

212
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,510
It's probably nothing.

213
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,320
Have you ever had regrets?

214
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,550
When I killed So Ri Bu,

215
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,110
you could've made a different decision then.

216
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,770
You did all that...

217
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,110
to save me.

218
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,850
I didn't want you to feel anxious, even for a moment.

219
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,580
That's why I wanted to protect you...

220
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,650
and make you happy.

221
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,320
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,370
For thoughtlessly saying I made the right decision in my previous life.

223
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,620
It took too long for me to apologize, didn't it?

224
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,270
Now is more than enough.

225
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,310
Let's never be apart from now on.

226
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,300
This lifetime is too short to catch up on happiness

227
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,770
we've missed out on.

228
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,530
Yes. Let's do that.

229
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,720
Let's make sure we're always...

230
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,160
together like we are now.

231
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,800
Yeah.

232
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,430
Seriously.

233
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,210
What kind of rude bastard are you?

234
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,910
Hey.

235
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,080
Open the door.

236
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,800
Is he serious right now?

237
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,970
Open the door, I said!

238
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,260
You son of a bitch. Why are you stopping here—

239
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,980
I mean, you should've—

240
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,960
I can't switch bodies in this state.

241
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,830
I need to destroy Kang Yeong Hwa's talisman first.

242
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,630
Whoa!

243
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,560
What brings you here...

244
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,790
We almost missed each other.

245
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,300
Where are you headed to?

246
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,030
I was about to start my 100-day prayer trip.

247
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,390
You should delay it for a moment.

248
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,950
You can leave.

249
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,410
Well, the teapot...

250
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,860
Let me ask you directly.

251
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,880
The evil spirit from my previous life

252
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,180
is trying to kill Kang Yeong Hwa.

253
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,560
I can resolve its deep resentment if it has one,

254
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,950
but how are you supposed to destroy this evil spirit?

255
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,950
Do you...

256
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,440
happen to know his weakness?

257
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,450
His weakness is probably

258
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,330
the reason why he exists.

259
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,510
Just like how a ghost with a deep resentment needs to leave,

260
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:18,530
a ghost that has no reason to stay needs to leave this world.

261
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,040
It's the same with the evil spirits, too.

262
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,320
The solution to the problem usually lies in

263
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,530
the things the ghosts obsess over.

264
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,210
Because they're tied up to their obsessions.

265
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,480
Just like you.

266
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,200
What are you obsessing over?

267
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,450
The reason why I'm tied to this world

268
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,050
isn't because of obsession.

269
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,010
It's because of my foolishness

270
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,910
that believed in deep resentment

271
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,780
the moment she killed me.

272
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,960
A humble lotus seed became a talisman because

273
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,100
of your desperate yearning to protect the one you love.

274
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,090
Sometimes, yearning is...

275
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,210
more powerful than resentment.

276
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,990
 But the ghost who does evil things

277
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,690
 must only have resentment left.

278
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,800

279
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,790
 Observe what he's obsessed with.

280
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,120
 The answer lies between the reason...

281
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,020
 you remained here

282
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,400
 and the evil spirit's obsession.

283
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,180
 Where are you?

284
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,760
 Was your visit successful?

285
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,210
Why does it keep getting darker?

286
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,440
Is it really not painful?

287
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,470
 I'm not sure yet.

288
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,470
 You're safely at home. Right?

289
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,640
 I'll be there soon.

290
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,200
 Okay. Come back soon.

291
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,490
Gosh, does she like that ghost that much?

292
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,450
It's so unbelievable.

293
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,630
Hold on. Is he her ex-husband?

294
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,200
By the way, what about Sokcho, then—

295
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,610
Oh? You're getting a call.

296
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,080
Gosh.

297
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,350
Yes, this is Beginning Entertainment's Jang...

298
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,720
Pardon? The hospital?

299
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,910
Why? Do they want me back?

300
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,820
What do I do?

301
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,180
Well, CEO Han...

302
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,250
- What's going on? 
  - CEO Han is in critical condition.

303
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,690
 We're all on our way to the hospital now.

304
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,070
I'll go and figure out the situation. Please take care of Sis.

305
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,860
Okay. Don't worry. We'll be right there.

306
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,160
Okay.

307
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,550

308
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,100
Excuse me. We got a call from the hospital.

309
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,510
I heard Mr. Han Min Oh is in critical condition.

310
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,100
Not much has happened to him.

311
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,440
Apparently, a nurse called and said he was in critical condition.

312
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,710
Didn't you call someone earlier? I saw it.

313
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,120
I did?

314
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,780
I didn't call anyone.

315
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,930
You heard the patient was in critical condition. Didn't it take you too long?

316
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,520
Of course, it was you. So Ri Bu.

317
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,370
I told you, didn't I?

318
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,570
That everyone around you will be in danger unless you die.

319
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,080
Didn't I tell you, too?

320
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,570
I have this talisman now

321
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,000
and as long as I have this, you can't hurt anyone.

322
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,310
Yes, yes. That damn talisman.

323
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,270
This could've ended sooner if it hadn't been for that.

324
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,000
You knew I've had this all this time, didn't you?

325
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,400
I can't kill you because of the talisman, but I killed other people.

326
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,600
Same with Han Min Oh.

327
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,900
I won't let you lay a finger on him.

328
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,430
You're trying to protect someone who tried to kill you? How foolish of you.

329
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,990
Because I know you used him.

330
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,970
His evil intention was real.

331
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,400
All I did was encourage it just a tiny bit.

332
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,180
Because you provoked what he was most desperate of.

333
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,390
I can understand him.

334
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,780
Because I also...

335
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,560
wanted to protect someone I love

336
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,180
even if it required killing someone once.

337
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,560
You should also understand...

338
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,070
why I have to kill you.

339
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,790
Why do you keep doing this?

340
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,500
You should blame yourself for that.

341
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,700
You kept being born even after I killed you over and over again.

342
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:14,880
Seeing you die painfully without even knowing why was...

343
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,590
such a great joy of mine.

344
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,840
Just die by my hands.

345
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,280
You'll be born again, anyway. What's the big deal?

346
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,820
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

347
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,710
- What's wrong? 
 - We can't, Na Yeon.

348
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,790
What do you mean?

349
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,150
We need to get out of here.

350
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,570
What?

351
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,480
 This is a trap. What do we do?

352
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,570
 Ms. Kang is with Seok Cheol Hwan right now.

353
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,370
 Kang Yeong Hwa.

354
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,750
I'll no longer play the game you created.

355
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,890
I may die, but never by your hands.

356
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,070
My proposal is simple.

357
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,450
If you don't take that talisman off,

358
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,890
Han Min Oh will die.

359
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,730
You should go after me now.

360
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,290
Because I'm the one you want.

361
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,650
 Observe what he's obsessed with.

362
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,390
 The answer lies between the reason

363
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,790
 you remained here

364
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,160
 and his obsession.

365
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,810
You gave Han Min Oh your talisman?

366
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,520
You'll die because of the one who tried to kill you.

367
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,530
I said I'll no longer let anyone get hurt because of me.

368
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,990
How about Do Ha? Not only did he become a lost soul because of you,

369
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,510
he's trying to protect you by giving up leaving this world.

370
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,310
You must've noticed that the wound on his neck has gotten darker.

371
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,550
Do you think it's easy to hold onto a dead body?

372
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:43,100
Do Ha will be in great pain soon.

373
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,130
Locking up your loved one back into such horrible hell...

374
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,560
Is that what you guys call love?

375
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,530
Kang Yeong Hwa.

376
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,320
It's love.

377
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,080
That's the kind of love he taught me.

378
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,970
An evil spirit like you, who's full of resentment and takes revenge, wouldn't know.

379
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:27,520
The yearning to save the one you love no matter how dire the situation is.

380
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,090
 I do not care if it goes on forever.

381
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,080
 As long as I can protect you,

382
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,660
 and as long as I can be with you,

383
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,880
 I will do whatever...

384
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,380
 it takes.

385
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,540
 Saving Han Ri Ta from the karmic cycle...

386
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:02,430
 and letting her celebrate her 31st birthday...

387
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,260
 was what I yearned for.

388
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,470
I'm sorry.

389
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,660
I gave the talisman to CEO Han.

390
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,280
It's okay.

391
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,140
I'll protect you now.

392
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,580
Don't open this door, no matter what.

393
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,330
Han Joon Oh.

394
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,110
I said you cannot stop me.

395
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,960
You cannot stop me, either.

396
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,050
The reason Han Ri Ta's reincarnations had to die before they turned 30.

397
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:06,990
And the reason you grew weak as Kang Yeong Hwa's 30th birthday approached. All of this.

398
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,310
The answer was in why you were obsessing over that age, 30.

399
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,810
Because unless Han Ri Ta died before turning 30,

400
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:23,830
that would've been the day of your destruction.

401
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,770
So what?

402
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,800
How does knowing that change anything?

403
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,370
Everything changes.

404
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,070
Because if I protect Kang Yeong Hwa and she turns 30, you'll be destroyed.

405
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:43,470
And that's starting to happen now.

406
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:56,490
Protecting Kang Yeong Hwa from you was the reason for my existence.

407
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,100
The curse has ended now.

408
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:09,060
You and I are holding a double-edged sword, anyway.

409
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,600
The reason you exist is to protect that girl from me.

410
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,070
If I disappear and you no longer have a reason to exist, you'll disappear, too.

411
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,600
You two will never see each other again.

412
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,540
You weren't my target, to begin with.

413
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,580
 It's Han Joon Oh.

414
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,820
 It's Han Joon Oh!

415
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,930
Na Yeon, let's hurry up and go upstairs.

416
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,690
 Han Joon Oh!

417
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,530
 Wow!

418
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,310
Get in right now!

419
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,010
You'd better not go home.

420
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,370
When he sent the taxus plant or whatever,

421
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,330
I told him your address and the places you frequent.

422
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,690
Why are you helping me, then?

423
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,520
I thought I'd better be on your side for me to survive.

424
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,110
This is the company card CEO Han used to use.

425
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,790
Only he has access to this card. No one can track it.

426
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:59,850
There's no limit. Take this and go somewhere remote.

427
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,520
Why are you doing this—

428
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,490
I'm telling you so I'll be safe.

429
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,470
Thank you.

430
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,490
You just say "Thank you" at times like this.

431
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,970
No need to ask questions.

432
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,530
If you're really helping me, Seok Cheol Hwan will come to you.

433
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:20,250
I should go somewhere safe.

434
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,360
Why is there no evidence for the Han Min Oh case?

435
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,910
I know.

436
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,890
The person who reported didn't see the culprit's face, either.

437
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,570
They saw him head-on. Why can't they remember his face?

438
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,590
Were they tricked by a ghost or something?

439
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,970
- I... 
 - Geez.

440
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,460
...saw him.

441
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,100
I saw the face of the person who did that to CEO Han.

442
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,530
R-Really?

443
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,730
And there's one more person.

444
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,560
You'd find it unbelievable,

445
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,540
but everything I'll tell you from now on is true.

446
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,580
So please lock me up first

447
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,880
and continue the conversation.

448
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,280
Yes. We'll take care of things when we arrive and meet you.

449
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,840
Okay.

450
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,510
What? Did he say not to go home?

451
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,400
Let's do as he says for now.

452
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,560
He says this is the only way to protect all of us.

453
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,760
Isn't that the car we just got a search warrant for?

454
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:39,020
It's 25-Chan. 25-Chan-0614.

455
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,120
 You must've noticed that the wound on his neck has gotten darker.

456
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,080
 Do you think it's easy to hold onto a dead body?

457
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,530
 Do Ha will be in great pain soon.

458
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,330
Eat some. You haven't eaten all day.

459
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,830
You know I won't die even if I don't eat.

460
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,430
Human bodies aren't like that.

461
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:30,650
You should eat well to hang in there. Here.

462
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,820
Don't worry about what my father said.

463
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,830
Okay.

464
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,120
Kang Yeong Hwa.

465
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,420
I didn't know how much you've been suffering.

467
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,280
But I won't give up.

468
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,750
There must be a way.

469
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,370
I'll find a way for you to stay in that body without pain.

470
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,540
I found...

471
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,940
the way to get rid of So Ri Bu.

472
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,930
Really?

473
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:23,150
He wants you to continue to be in pain because of the karma from your previous life.

474
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,350
That's why he keeps killing you...

475
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,580
so you get reincarnated.

476
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,850
If I let you turn 30 this time,

477
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,380
So Ri Bu will be destroyed.

478
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,070
Because he'll no longer have a reason to exist.

479
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,800
If I just make sure to make it to my birthday,

480
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,910
So Ri Bu will disappear for good?

481
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,790
That's right.

482
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,630
25-Chan-0614. I located the wanted vehicle.

483
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,040
No one's in here.

484
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,100
What the hell?

485
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,920
 That day,

486
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,320
 in the taxi while running away from my father,

487
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,880
 Kang Yeong Hwa had the rest of the dream...

488
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,760
 about how we ended up...

489
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,270
 in our previous lives.

490
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,030
I will be right back.

491
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,920
I love you, My Lord.

492
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,720
 As expected...

493
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:22,040
 we were not supposed to be together.

494
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,530
 But even if I go back to the beginning,

495
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:31,200
 I think I will fall in love with you again.

496
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,830
Do not die.

497
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,860
Please do not die.

498
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,390
Live.

499
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,050
 Even in this moment...

500
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:50,960
Please. I beg you, Han Ri Ta.

501
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,900
Live...

502
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,740
 are you trying to save me?

503
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,800
It was true...

504
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,140
that you remained by my side to save me.

505
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,060
It's all a dream...

506
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,130
and it was in the past.

507
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,130
It's okay.

508
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,750
In the past and now,

509
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,710
you're the only reason why I exist.

510
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:27,620
What if we never got to meet each other?

511
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,990
We wouldn't have been able to have this conversation.

512
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,740
We would've only remembered it as a painful farewell.

513
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,730
Even so...

514
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,610
I would've still been by your side.

515
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,240
Always.

516
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:51,940
But it's such a relief that we can talk to each other face-to-face like this.

517
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,690
Let's stay together for a long time from now on.

518
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,860
 You and I are holding a double-edged sword, anyway.

519
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:09,400
 The reason you exist is to protect that girl from me.

520
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,800
 If I disappear and you no longer have a reason to exist, you'll disappear, too.

521
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:21,500
 I cannot bear to tell you the truth.

522
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,690
 Would you be able to forgive me someday?

523
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,080
If so...

524
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:34,600
should we do everything we've wanted to do?

525
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,390
Starting now?

526
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,420
Did you think I couldn't find you because you're hiding in here?

527
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,730
What can I do to you when you're in there?

528
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,840
Have a seat for a moment.

529
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,320
If you call the police, they'll just die, too.

530
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,320
Would that be okay?

531
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,530
I have suffered quite a bit since you called the police.

532
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:35,150
So, are you finding the detention center manageable?

533
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,780
Whenever I close my eyes,

534
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,000
I keep hearing Goo Tae Joo crying.

535
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,120
But I slept well last night for once.

536
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,820
Listen carefully.

537
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,420
Kang Yeong Hwa. Where's she right now?

538
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:02,910
I just dropped her off somewhere. I don't know.

539
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,060
And even if you kill me in here,

540
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:11,140
I don't know anything!

541
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,080
I will kill you after I kill them!

542
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,310
Just hang tight in there.

543
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,480
Until I come back to kill you.

544
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,900
So, how about it? Do you think you can sleep well tonight, too?

545
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:35,460
Now, will you tell me where you dropped those two off?

546
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,130
Are you worried?

547
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,680
No.

548
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,870
Just because. The sun is nice.

549
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,870
I don't think so.

550
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,640
"Can I really finish things well?

551
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,760
Will everything be okay?"

552
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,400
You're worrying thinking that.

553
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,620
You've been reading the whole time since we got here.

554
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,200
So I don't have to see you worrying.

555
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,840
That's not true. I'm reading it because I'm enjoying it.

556
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,090
I think you're lying.

557
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:48,070
I memorized everything I've read.

558
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:50,330
Let me see. What's it about?

559
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,000
- Let me see. 
- Gosh, seriously.

560
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,450
I said I already memorized everything.

561
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,290
Let me see.

562
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,420
They should've kept the door closed, at least.

563
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,820
You scared me.

564
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:31,490
Wow. How did he live somewhere so remote?

565
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:35,390
We struggled to find this place because even the navigation couldn't find it.

566
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,620
In Han Joon Oh's memories, there was an appropriate place

567
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,040
that's not very well known.

568
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,290
Han Joon Oh's memories?

569
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:51,460
I guess he remembered a place CEO Han and Joon Oh used to come sometimes.

570
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,690
Whenever he had to go under the radar because of scandals.

571
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:59,920
I know it's uncomfortable for everyone to stay here.

572
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,050
But we just need to wait a few days. So just hang in there.

573
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,630
What are you talking about? You haven't been outside. Right?

574
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,520
This place is amazing.

575
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,730
And my studio is about to close since I don't have students.

576
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,360
But I get to rest and have fun here.

577
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,510
I'm telling you. That's why marketing matters.

578
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,950
She needs to change the name first.

579
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,610
"Invincible Choi Na Yeon's Kendo Studio."

580
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,170
The name is too tacky.

581
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,210
It's too tacky.

582
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,240
Well, excuse me.

583
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,980
What did you say?

584
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,550
 It's an assault if you hit me with that.

585
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,070
 What did you say?

586
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:42,220
Wow, he's in trouble. He'll get beaten today.

587
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,560
 What did you say just now?

588
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,240
 I'm sure you'll go on just fine.

589
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:50,900
 You'll be cheerful as you've always been.

590
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,900
Gosh, stop it.

591
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,850
 I'm sure you will.

592
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:55,950
 Are you going to hit me?

593
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,540
 Even if I don't ever get to see you again,

594
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:04,710
 if you get to turn 31 and then 41 for the first time...

595
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,010
 If I can make sure you get to have

596
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,520
 lots of gray hair someday,

597
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:18,660
 I will willingly and happily

598
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,050
 vanish.

599
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:32,120
♫  The dream of you makes tears fall down...  ♫

600
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,200
 Let's make sure to come back here.

601
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,850
 The sunset is really pretty here.

602
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:42,850
 Let's come back to see the sunset again.

603
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,940
 We'll sit on a picnic blanket and eat cup noodles

604
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,280
 sitting side by side.

605
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,980
 What do you think?

606
00:51:52,010 --> 00:52:03,950
♫  The warmth we shared became all the seasons  ♫

607
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:09,320
♫  The sound of you breathing, sleeping next to me  ♫

608
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,390
 Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going?

609
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:11,980
 We should close the door.

610
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,570
 - Where are you going? Why? 
 - Okay.

611
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,720
♫  I ever prayed for  ♫

612
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,350
♫  I long for you today once again  ♫

613
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:27,830
 What if we were ordinary?

614
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:32,540
 I wonder how it would've been.

615
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:37,680
♫  All the love we shared then  ♫

616
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,200
 What if we never got to meet each other?

617
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:45,970
 We would've only remembered it as a painful farewell.

618
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:53,250
 But it's such a relief that we can talk to each other face to face like this.

619
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,320
 Let's stay together for a long time from now on.

620
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:05,610
♫  The sound of you breathing, sleeping next to me  ♫

621
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:15,980
♫  was the only thing I ever prayed for  ♫

622
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:26,870
♫  I long for you once again today  ♫

623
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:44,830
♫  The day you first came to me  ♫

624
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:48,260
♫  I still remember clearly  ♫

625
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,440
Thank you.

626
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,960
Thank you.

627
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,460
Is it good?

628
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,550
♫  I won't forget...  ♫

629
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,670
It's so good.

630
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:18,300
♫  I hope that you are like me  ♫

631
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:23,450
 We had very ordinary days until that day.

632
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,680
What took you so long?

633
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,300
♫  I hope that you are like me  ♫

634
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:34,320
 We bought a birthday cake at a nearby grocery store.

635
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,290
 And we encountered shocking news briefly, too.

636
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,270

637
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,370
Let's go get fruit.

638
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,410
 And later...

639
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,750
 we heard a bit of happy news, too.

640
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:06,440
♫  Although I already knew  ♫

641
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,080
I know what I want for my birthday.

642
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,260
Buy this for me. Two of them.

643
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,790
 We got matching rings that cost 5,000 won at a neighborhood market.

644
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,650
♫  You shine so brightly  ♫

645
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:33,200
 Just like the day we got married,

646
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:37,820
 we walked together in the dirt-filled market that day.

647
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:39,870
It's pretty.

648
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,070
 Out of the moments I shared with her in my life,

649
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:49,060
 I was the happiest that day.

650
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:56,780
♫  It's a promise that never will be broken  ♫

651
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,700
You were hiding in the countryside like this and made me look all over for you?

652
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,080
 And that night,

653
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:25,990
 when Kang Yeong Hwa's birthday han't come quite yet.

654
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,250
 It was late at night, before midnight.

655
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,150
What? Why did those turn off?

656
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,540
Sis.

657
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,180
You remember what I said. Right?

658
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,340
You just need to focus on yourself for us to win.

659
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:45,540
Don't get hurt.

660
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:54,870
I'm okay. Get out through the back door.

661
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,530
Since you went into a cabin and disappeared,

662
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:10,710
I almost couldn't find you.

663
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:29,080

664
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:41,350
♫  You and I are different under the same sky  ♫

665
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:45,410
♫  It feels like the world has stopped  ♫

666
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:49,640
♫  Let me embrace you warmly  ♫

667
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:55,590
♫  All of my days are being colored by you  ♫

668
00:58:55,590 --> 00:59:01,790
♫  I will always protect you even when you're out of reach  ♫

669
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:04,490

670
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,830
 You can never run away from me!

671
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:12,110
 By chance, do you still not know...

672
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:16,310
 what would happen if you stay alive tonight?

673
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:17,960
 The moon was up.

674
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,170
 Since the sun is so bright, the moon isn't visible even though it's up there.

675
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,500
 Like you, you mean?

676
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,500
 Thank you for coming back.

677
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,350
 I'll always be with you wherever it might be.
