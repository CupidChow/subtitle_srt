1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:13,230

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,520

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,370

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,180

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,530

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,110

7
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,000

8
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,350
- I'm okay— 
 - Lie down here.

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,040
I think you'd better go to the hospital.

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,940
Since you keep insisting you don't have to,

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,300
I'm making an exception.

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,640
I said I'm okay.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,820
I know what emergency patients are like better than you.

14
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,870
I'll get you some porridge first. Eat that for now.

15
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,300
- You took medicine on an empty stomach— 
 - No, I'm really fine.

16
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,050
I'll call an ambulance.

17
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,230
 Who are you?

18
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,670
 I'm asking who you are.

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,250
 Same with 1,500 years ago and now.

20
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,000
 You make me weak like this.

21
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,920
 I don't know who you are...

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,670
 and why...

23
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,480
 why I'm hesitating.

24
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,650
Here.

25
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,420
I made it for you since I'm worried you'll pass out again.

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,440
So don't say no and eat it.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,240
Why are you doing all this?

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,130
It's a firefighter's duty to save people.

29
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,180
Please don't think of it lightly.

30
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,370
You save people?

31
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,110
You?

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,260
I saved his life several times. Why is he so mean?

33
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,920
 Don't skip meals.

34
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,190
I'll come back if you do.

35
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,430

36
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,690
I'm sorry for wanting to see you so late.

37
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,700
I wanted to hear about Joon Oh's condition in person.

38
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,110
Of course. I understand.

39
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,700
You said I'm the only one who knows he's sick.

40
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,670
Since he's so firm about it,

41
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,600
I kept it a secret from everyone and let him do whatever he wanted,

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,850
ut I wonder if I'm making him worse by doing this.

43
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,830
I can't help but blame myself.

44
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,410
You know, I've witnessed countless accidents...

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,410
 - Gosh. 
 - You saved me.

46
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,040
 Oh, yes. Yes.

47
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,640
and witnessed a lot of unexpected deaths.

48
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,470
Do you know what left the biggest impression?

49
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,200
The sense of loss from everyone

50
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,210
who lost their loved ones.

51
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,940
So I don't think you need to blame yourself and regret it in advance.

52
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,080
Now is the time to do your best to make sure you don't regret it later.

53
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,700
Make sure the rest of the time is filled with love and affection.

54
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,630
Anyway, I'll care for him by his side.

55
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,480
So don't worry so much.

56
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,270
I always feel...

57
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,580
guilty and grateful toward you.

58
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,360
I can't believe I'm hungry in the midst of all this going on.

59
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,680
Gosh, my body must've changed.

60
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,290
 Kang Yeong Hwa...

61
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,360
 resembles Han Ri Ta.

62
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,120
She probably has no memory of her past.

63
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,340
How does she recognize me, then?

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,510
That's probably because Kang Yeong Hwa is Han Ri Ta.

65
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,220
The schedule for this week is out.

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,180
By the way, who's Han Ri Ta?

67
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,670
The person who chained me to this place.

68
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,480
As in your ex-girlfriend?

69
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,530
Forget it.

70
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,570
What's important is

71
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,500
that Han Ri Ta's 19th reincarnation is Kang Yeong Hwa.

72
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,120
So you mean...

73
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,430
she's someone who looks exactly like your ex.

74
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,050
By the way, if it's her 19th reincarnation...

75
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,380
That means...

76
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,920
Your taste must be very consistent.

77
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,630
The resemblance isn't important.

78
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,340
I've been reincarnated 18 times, but not a single person...

79
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,270
remembered me.

80
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:35,470
If you found someone who remembers you correctly for the 19th time,

81
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,460
shouldn't you be happy?

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,560

83
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,520

84
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,940
 I am being told to live...

85
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,030
 only from the person who came to kill me.

86
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,860
How dare he play the victim?

87
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,700
Much better.

88
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,340
I have not fallen asleep in a long time.

89
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,460
 You missed a good opportunity.

90
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,030
That is an incense burner, is it not?

91
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,720
Yes. I wanted to give it to Lord Do Ha.

92
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,090
He has trouble sleeping.

93
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,520
 My Lord.

94
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,930
What is that?

95
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,500
They are iris roots.

96
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,270
I heard putting these in your mouth calms you down.

97
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,520
The servant you hired recently

98
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,050
is pretty clever.

99
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,780
My Lord, I brought you water to wash your face with.

100
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,000
What are you doing?

101
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,490
He is not here.

102
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,590
Did he go somewhere?

103
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,710
 The front line was ambushed by Baekje.

104
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,280
 So he left urgently at dawn.

105
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,250
How could Minister So Ri Bu be this way?

106
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,720
Is this how he greets the great general returning in victory?

107
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,160
I should be glad I returned safely.

108
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,400
Let us go in now.

109
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,620
I am back, Father.

110
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,300
Thankfully, the fortress walls were not penetrated. So the damage was not great.

111
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,200
His Majesty wishes to see you. Go to the palace when the day breaks.

112
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,160
Yes, Father.

113
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,790
Come out now.

114
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,340
Continue.

115
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,750
Someone from Gaya recognized that girl's face?

116
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,100
It has not been confirmed, but she resembles Han Ri Ta, the daughter of the great general of Gaya.

117
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,090
If she is the great general of Gaya's daughter, she is the traitor's daughter.

118
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,020
Then, Do Ha brought in such a girl himself?

119
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,980
- Should I capture her? 
 - No.

120
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,610
Let us keep an eye on her.

121
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,050
That girl might end up...

122
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,700
becoming a trap for Do Ha.

123
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,190
Yes, sir.

124
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,010
You can't be awake because you are worried about me.

125
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,730
Of course, I should worry.

126
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,390
I cannot let someone else kill you before I do.

127
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,780
If I die,

128
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,020
what would...

129
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,060
happen to you?

130
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,410
After you die,

131
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,870
I have no reason to live anymore, either.

132
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,530
If so, I really should...

133
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,930
try my best to live long as you said.

134
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,120
That way, you will have a reason to live, too.

135
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,880
You are so eager to die.

136
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,780
Why are you telling me to live?

137
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,310
Perhaps I secretly want to...

138
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,450
keep on living.

139
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,550
You never know.

140
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:35,570
You and I might find a reason for it as we live.

141
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,810
Give me your hand for a moment.

142
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,520
I am compensating you for the iris roots.

143
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,680
The lotus seeds are so firm that

144
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,400
it does not sprout unless you shave it off. Because of that firmness,

145
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,210
it lasts a thousand years in the ground without rotting.

146
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,590
But for it to blossom,

147
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,740
you have to damage the seed.

148
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,400
Why are you giving these to me?

149
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,750
I am telling you to protect

150
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,350
your strength that lets you last without rotting.

151
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,650
If you hang in there,

152
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,640
you might blossom one day.

153
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,330
Everything in the world rots.

154
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,060
If so,

155
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,520
do you want to live for a thousand years to prove it?

156
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,910
I bet they will blossom.

157
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:08,000
To win the bet, you will have to live a thousand years, too.

158
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,110
I am curious about who will win.

159
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,470
 This stop is Godam Bareun Apartments.

160
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,370
 Next stop is Godam Middle School.

161
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,370
 This stop is Godam Bareun Apartments.

162
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:39,100
 Please hold onto the handles for your safety

163
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,600
 - and try not to use cellphones...  
 - What's wrong with me?

164
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,220
Gosh, you scared me.

165
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,350
Yeong Hwa, what are you doing? Get off.

166
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,650
Oh, yeah!

167
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,820
Why bother coming out to the bus stop? My legs are fine.

168
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,000
You would've gone to the last stop if it wasn't for me. You were completely zonked.

169
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,320
You dreamed about Han Joon Oh again, didn't you?

170
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,590
Well, so it's not Han Joon Oh...

171
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,780
Never mind.

172
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,310
Maybe you love him without realizing it.

173
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,640
Who said you're in love with them if you dream about them?

174
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,250
I mean, he's a celebrity, anyway.

175
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,780
It's not like you'd date him.

176
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,600
Of course, I won't...

177
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,900
Goodness. Be careful, young lady.

178
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,080
Okay. Thank you.

179
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,330
He saved your life.

180
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,080
Thank you!

181
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,900
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I am.

182
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,910
Geez. Why are you looking at him?

183
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,800
He seemed familiar somehow.

184
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,060
Online bookstore? Neither of us buys books.

185
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,330
Recipient Kang Yeong—

186
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,900
I'll prepare for the promotion exam.

187
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,120
I need to study to get promoted.

188
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,070

189
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,950

190
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,700

191
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,380
"They're motivated by one's wishes."

192
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,230
What?

193
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:32,310
Do they mean I dream to fulfill my wishes?

194
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,880
Gosh.

195
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,310
He's struggling in pain. That makes no sense.

196
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,380

What a ridiculous book.

197
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,310
I shouldn't have bought it.

198
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,140

199
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,020
Attorney, why did you want to see me...

200
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,490
I appreciate the thought.

201
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,560
I can't accept this since I'm a government worker.

202
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,370
On the day of the accident at the broadcasting station,

203
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,780
you had a big fight with Mr. Han Joon Oh about this.

204
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,880
 I had completely forgotten...

205
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,570
 that I was even curious about this.

206
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,010
I'm Mr. Han's attorney, too.

207
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,270
I'd like to know what happened that day.

208
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,710
Ms. Kang?

209
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,440
It was just a small misunderstanding.

210
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,060
It's been resolved now. You don't have to worry.

211
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,480
It's been resolved now. You don't have to worry.

212
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,310
What kind of misunderstanding was it...

213
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,000
It was something personal.

214
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,910
I don't think you understand what I'm saying right now—

215
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,960
I'll get going if this is all there is to it.

216
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,580

217
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,330
 If they find out about the shirt,

218
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,400
 Han Joon Oh will probably spend the rest of his days being investigated and die.

219
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,660
 Just one month.

220
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,440
 After a month,

221
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,240
 he'll no longer exist in this world.

222
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,600
 I so want you to live somehow. Enough for me to desperately wish for it in my dream.

223
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,080
 That's how much I feel sad and sorry for you.

224
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,210

225
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,030

226
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,010
 Maybe those kidnappers weren't after the money.

227
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,340
 Were they actually telling the truth?

228
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,930
 I suppose I'll find out when I see them.

229
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,940

230
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,260
H-Hold on, hold on.

231
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,250
What's going on?

232
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,730
The kidnapper who was being treated disappeared.

233
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,680

How did he remove this?

234
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,910
Hey, what were you doing?

235
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,990
Geez, damn it.

236
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,210
Did they look for CCTVs in other areas?

237
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,850
- I'll contact them. 
 - Hurry.

238
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,980
CEO Seok?

239
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,450
I hope you like my present.

240
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,600
Peekaboo.

241
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,470

242
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,690
The suspects who were to testify disappeared.

243
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,090
Looks like someone is removing evidence

244
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,740
as if nothing happened.

245
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,920
It'd become more difficult to find the one who instigated the attack.

246
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,800
By the way, sir...

247
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,970
I...

248
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,450
think I saw CEO Seok.

249
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,750
He got away immediately,

250
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,480
but it was definitely him.

251
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,100
He definitely has enough of a grudge to have done that.

252
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,890
You made it, Mr. Seok.

253
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,220
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

254
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,060
Goodness, I prepared everything.

255
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,910
Oh, right. This.

256
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,190
This right here.

257
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,300
You wanted me to write it like that. Right?

258
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,450

259
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,290

260
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,840
H-He is terminally ill?

261
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,000
Joon Oh is going to die anyway, then.

262
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,510
Gosh, I feel so terrible.

263
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,080
I was just trying to make a living

264
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,140
that I didn't get to care for him.

265
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,950
I'm... I'm such a bastard. Seriously...

266
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,940
The reason I'm telling you this is

267
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,510
because I want you to be more attentive to him.

268
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,170
Since he doesn't want anyone to know he's sick,

269
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,510
I want you to watch him more closely on set, too.

270
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,050
 What's the point of caring for someone who is already dead?

271
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,530
And there's one more thing.

272
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,110
I-Is there more?

273
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,720
I don't feel good about leaving Joon Oh alone

274
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,100
when the suspect hasn't been caught.

275
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,940
Would you be able to commute from his house?

276
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,910
I'll make sure to pay you accordingly.

277
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,450
 You want me to spend 24-7 with a ghost?

278
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,870
Well, I can't do that.

279
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,390
Excuse me.

280
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,100

281
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,320
You're going to Han Joon Oh's house? Now?

282
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,960
The CEO really begged me to.

283
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,190
It's not like I don't know their situation, either.

284
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,350
Anyway, I won't stay there for too long.

285
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,570
What are you doing?

286
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,590
I know. I probably won't fit in, right?

287
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,130
Well, so...

288
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,740
I can be a good bodyguard, too.

289
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,190
You can request an assistant, too.

290
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,480
I'll just accept the minimum wage.

291
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,150
No, I can volunteer, too.

292
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,810
I'm going there for work, Ms. Choi.

293
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,040
Do you know how much the individual fan meeting with Han Joon Oh costs?

294
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,300
This is an opportunity given by God.

295
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,900
It's an opportunity to be attached to Han Joon Oh 24-7 in his house!

296
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,920
Attached, by foot.

297
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,040
It stresses me out just hearing about it.

298
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,640
Why don't you just admit to it?

299
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,260
Your heart fluttered, dreaming about Han Joon Oh, too.

300
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,090
Aren't you kind of happy to go there?

301
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,380
Don't you know I'm a professional?

302
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,350
Gosh, that's enough. Get out. Get out.

303
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,120
Get out. I need to get ready.

304
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,810
Be gone.

305
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,240
Why is she so silly?

306
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,270
 You'd better not touch my Joon Oh.

307
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,520
 You won't get anything for your birthday if you do.

308
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,940
Why is she bringing up my birthday suddenly?

309
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,760

310
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,480
It's more than 20 days away.

311
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,260
What should I ask for this time?

312
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,870
Looking at it now,

313
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,030
it looks kind of similar to the seeds from the dream.

314
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,340
Gosh, Venerable! Venerable...

315
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,300
Were you looking for the talisman?

316
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,170
No.

317
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,080
Why would I look for that?

318
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,630
I'm not afraid of ghosts at all anymore.

319
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,110
This would be more helpful for that woman.

320
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,630
Well...

321
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,680
This is a ghost-repelling charm.

322
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,280
Put it up where the ghost is staying.

323
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,820
By the way, Venerable, could you make me one of those talismans?

324
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,070
Those prayer beads were made with very old lotus seeds.

325
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,500
- Pardon? 
 - I'm saying I didn't make them.

326
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,660
The talisman was...

327
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,160
Well, who made it?

328
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,860
Venerable. Venerable!

329
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,230
 Don't be surprised and knock.

330
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,740
I-I thought you were sleeping because the lights were off in there.

331
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,570
That's why I put the note there, too.

332
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,210
Why...

333
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,750
are you here?

334
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,600
CEO Han requested a 24-hour security service.

335
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,700
He wanted someone to watch you so you don't take a whole bottle of pills again.

336
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,560
Watch me?

337
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,360
You're watching me?

338
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,910
Aren't you grateful?

339
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,380
There are so many people who care about you.

340
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,750
I know, too.

341
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,440
No matter how many people care about you,

342
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,020
the pain you're going through won't diminish.

343
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,270
But try not to be too heartless.

344
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,080
As someone who genuinely cares about you, I'm starting to

345
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,450
feel a little sad.

346
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,700
You genuinely worry about me?

347
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,710
Why are you staring at me like that?

348
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,970
 Due to a migratory anticyclone, the temperature is higher by seven to nine degrees...

349
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:39,970
Let's turn that off.

350
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:44,070
Wow. Isn't it basically summer now?

351
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,150
Wow.

352
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:50,930
 The lotus seeds that have been dormant for over 1,200 years finally sprouted.

353
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:54,530
 These seeds were discovered while excavating the mountain fortress

354
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,120
 built by Silla when it conquered Gaya.

355
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,300
 If they blossom, we get to see the flowers that came back to life in a thousand years.

356
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,780
 Do you want to live for a thousand years to prove it?

357
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,030
 I bet they will blossom.

358
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,950
 To win the bet, you will have to live a thousand years, too.

359
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,900
 I am curious who will win.

360
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,980
 These seeds are being grown in Goan-gun, Gyeongnam...

361
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,620
 I...

362
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,280
 win, then.

363
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,930
 Also, another seed that was discovered with it...

364
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,490
I lose, then.

365
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,300
What?

366
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,150
 What did I just say?

367
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:50,350
I-I said I got hungry.

368
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:55,210
Shall we have dinner if you haven't eaten?

369
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,050
What did I mean I lost?

370
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,580
Can't I separate dreams and reality?

371
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,200
I'm acting like I was excited to come here, like Na Yeon said.

372
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,200
How come you have nothing but water...

373
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,960

374
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,860
Han Joon Oh.

375
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,660
You didn't pass out somewhere again. Right?

376
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,240
Han Joon Oh.

377
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,280
That was close.

378
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:25,370
♫  The bright day has gone  ♫

379
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:29,360
♫  and I'm stuck under the dark sky  ♫

380
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,680
I almost fell.

381
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,390
Why is your house so dangerous?

382
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,370
Go to sleep, then.

383
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,590
♫  I'm conveying my desperate heart  ♫

384
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:51,830
♫  Since I met you again, I couldn't see you even though you were next to me  ♫

385
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:58,600
♫  My season was stolen in all these years  ♫

386
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,710
Does she remember me or...

387
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,640
is it just a coincidence?

388
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:16,010
♫  I still try to smile again  ♫

389
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,020
Unni, Unni, Unni. Be careful. Be careful...

390
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,850
Help me. Help me.

391
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,340
Be careful. Be careful.

392
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,410
Okay.

393
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,420
I can't believe it. You didn't make a mess.

394
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,630
Who are you seeing this morning that you're doing all this?

395
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,490
I need to go retrieve something important.

396
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,150
I slept so well.

397
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,280
I didn't even have a dream.

398
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,610

399
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,010
I thought you had dyslexia.

400
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,630
I suppose you like reading in the morning.

401
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,970
Dyslexic?

402
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,180
How funny.

403
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,110
Why do you have that book?

404
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,080
I saw someone reading it.

405
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,930
I was kind of curious about it.

406
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,400
Why do you have my book—

407
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,890
"An ambitious person dreams about winning a laurel wreath

408
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,370
and a person in love gets infatuated with the person

409
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,800
they desire in their dream."

410
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,300
Kang Yeong Hwa.

411
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,610
Which one are you?

412
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,820
Why are you doing this?

413
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,410
You should've just given me the book.

414
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,150
I'll hear your answer later.

415
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,770
Why are you staring at me?

416
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,900
I'm not staring at you.

417
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,570
I'll go out.

418
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,630
Huh?

419
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,030
W-What do I do...

420
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,180
You changed the passcode.

421
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,840
It feels different to ring the doorbell.

422
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,030
Stop ringing it.

423
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,060
Even though I got you these?

424
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,180
Are you that happy?

425
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,660
What?

426
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,110
Why is she coming in? He said he'll make her leave.

427
00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:00,520
It's your favorite. Chocolate hazelnut caramel verrine.

428
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,020
Why am I hiding? I came here to work.

429
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:09,380
We had this for breakfast whenever we stayed at Sunset Monte.

430
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,240
I went all the way there to get these.

431
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,680
Put them away.

432
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,580
Are you sick?

433
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,820
What's going on?

434
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,570
I'm Kang Yeong Hwa, Mr. Han Joon Oh's bodyguard.

435
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,550
You got fired as a firefighter.

436
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,580
Looks like you work at Joon Oh's house now.

437
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,690
I'm suspended, and I'm doing this temporarily.

438
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,800
And showing up without giving him a notice can't be tolerated.

439
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:49,980
My priority is to make sure Mr. Han is rested under any circumstances.

440
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,000
What are you saying?

441
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,040
You're at a bachelor's house.

442
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,200
You can't be his bodyguard looking like that.

443
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,080
You can leave if you're done talking.

444
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,360
You explain. What situation is this?

445
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,130
I think she already told you.

446
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,740
Is that so?

447
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,550
Then, I'm planning to become very private with you starting now.

448
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,880
Could you agree to do that?

449
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,980
I think she'll leave that way.

450
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,340
If Mr. Han agrees,

451
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,300
- I'll see myself out. 
 - No.

452
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,120
Stay there.

453
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,130
If she doesn't leave now, it means she's not just a bodyguard.

454
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,200
Will that still be okay?

455
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,780
No. I'll leave.

456
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,250
How could you...

457
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,300
I said I never agreed.

458
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,160
You must be really angry at me, Joon Oh.

459
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,830
If you don't leave now,

460
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,580
I might actually get angry.

461
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,300
Even if I leave now, we need to get back together.

462
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,620
I'm kind of desperate.

463
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,320
Can't be as desperate as me.

464
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,960
You know what?

465
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,590
You have been acting like a different person these days.

466
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,250
I'm saying I like it.

467
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,830
You're totally my type.

468
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,830
See you, Joon Oh.

469
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,420
Shit, how dare he in front of another bitch?

470
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,890
Bodyguard, my foot.

471
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,720
Who are you talking about?

472
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,670
Who knows.

473
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,240
Who do you think I'm talking about?

474
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,860
Stay right there.

475
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,410
You could've just talked. Why did you break it?

476
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:40,450
I didn't think she'd leave if I just talked.

477
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,870
What if you got injured?

478
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,270
I know. What if you get injured?

479
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,650
Joon Oh loves this stuff.

480
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,300
What if you got caught breaking this?

481
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,460
What do you mean by that?

482
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,010
What do you mean to get caught?

483
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,730
S-So what I meant was...

484
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,030
You know, Joon Oh...

485
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,360
likes someone else.

486
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,720
Pardon?

487
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,750
Right, Joon Oh?

488
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,080
Gosh, I should get you a mop.

489
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,800
Don't touch. You'll cut your hand.

490
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,690
 Could you agree to do that?

491
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,080
 I think she'll leave that way.

492
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,650
 No.

493
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,860
 Stay there.

494
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:16,330
 You know, Joon Oh likes someone else.

495
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:27,340
Was he talking about me, by chance?

496
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,450
What am I thinking about right now?

497
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,570

498
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,370
The bastard who ran away from the hospital stowed away.

499
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:46,640
Who was in charge of him?

500
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,170
- He's looking for you, sir. 
 - Hey.

501
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:49,900
Goodness, you came, sir.

502
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,990
- Chief 1. 
 - Yes.

503
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,520
Yes...

504
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,730

505
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,280

506
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,330
 I definitely saw him somewhere.

507
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,730
 What is Kang Yeong Hwa, anyway?

508
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:19,550
 If he met someone his type after 1,500 years,

509
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,190
 he could at least try to be friendly with her.

510
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,840
 Why is he so stiff?

511
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
 Gosh, do I have to get involved again?

512
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,930
Ms. Kang, do you like web novels, by chance?

513
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,260
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

514
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,790
Joon Oh was suggested to film a few of them.

515
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:40,620
I was thinking...

516
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,260
maybe he could do a fantasy romance

517
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,790
that involves reincarnations or possession.

518
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,720
I'm not sure.

519
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,870
I like fantasy, but I'm not that into romance.

520
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,880
Oh, you don't like the romance genre?

521
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,270
No.

522
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,830
Like a love story about a man who's completely

523
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,840
devoted to one woman only.

524
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,340
Well...

525
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,660
would it be a historical romance?

526
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,860
How about stuff like...

527
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,560
Someone tries to take revenge on the enemy who killed her parents,

528
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,540
but she ends up falling in love.

529
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,410
Something devastating like that.

530
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,060
Wow.

531
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,100
We must be here.

532
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,970

533
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,350
I forgot to tell you.

534
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,740
There are a lot of archery scenes in the drama.

535
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,330
So, the lead actors agreed to practice archery.

536
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,190
What's wrong?

537
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,280
No, I just...

538
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,760
feel like I've seen this in a dream.

539
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,060
You had a dream about archery? What kind of dream was that?

540
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,190
A sad one.

541
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:31,000
I was in love with my master in it.

542
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,310
It was a dumb dream. Just a dumb dream.

543
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,700
A sad and d-dumb dream?

544
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,620
I'll go ahead and check things out.

545
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,510
What's your relationship with Joon Oh?

546
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:04,070
Don't say you're just a bodyguard, and he's your client.

547
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,660
We help each other out. How's that?

548
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:13,230
You must've heard, but Joon Oh and I get passionate about each other again.

549
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,970
You'll have to get out of the picture soon.

550
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:19,120
I won't allow a female bodyguard.

551
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,330
Wow.

552
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,500
His form is superior.

553
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,730
Joon Oh is coming down with a cold.

554
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,420
Please only focus on the form today.

555
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,400
Gosh, Jeong Yi Seul was trained, at least.

556
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,430
But this is his first time. You can tell when someone's sloppy.

557
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,480
The body double will do everything, anyway.

558
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,280
He just needs to be good at acting.

559
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,670
He's not exactly talented or anything.

560
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:52,230
Gosh! You haven't seen him lately.

561
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,910
He's a completely new person.

562
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:56,020
- No way. 
 - I couldn't believe it, either.

563
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:59,110
Whatever. Let's just go with it, then.

564
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:10,880
Han Joon Oh arrived safely.

565
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,230
I'll be checking out the field first.

566
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,070
Let's talk a bit.

567
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,370
Later.

568
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,130
Go and warm up first.

569
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,880
Do what you need to do.

570
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,900
You kept me by your side to do that, didn't you?

571
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,660
- Did they cast someone else for that reason? 
 - Yes, yes.

572
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,200
- Really? 
 - How impressive.

573
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,130
Wow...

574
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:57,060
Joon Oh! Over here.

575
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,760
When you shoot an arrow...

576
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,010
Okay. Ready...

577
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:06,040
Fire!

578
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,400
What?

579
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,840
Okay, then...

580
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,570
The lead actor. You've been chosen!

581
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,210
- Director, could you hand me the bow? 
 - Yes, yes.

582
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,790
Don't be so nervous.

583
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,020
You can learn if you're bad at it.

584
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,340
The torso and the feet should point in the 2 o'clock direction

585
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,530
and the distance between the feet—

586
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,200
You should move so I can shoot.

587
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,990
It's okay if you're bad at it.

588
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,420
I'll give you a private lesson.

589
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,260
Wow!

590
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,190
What was that?

591
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:20,990
Wow, you're not bad for a first-timer.

592
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,730
He won't need a body double.

593
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:25,430
I told you.

594
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,850
Do you have a moment now?

595
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,790
This is great.

596
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:06,130
I had a question for you, too.

597
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,860
How did you do it?

598
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,430
You said you've never shot an arrow.

599
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,530
It has been a while.

600
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:21,480
- What do you mean by that? 
 - "My Lord."

601
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,550
What?

602
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:27,380
You've been calling me that since the hospital.

603
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,280
Didn't you know since then?

604
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:37,900
Was it...

605
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,780
Was it you back then?

606
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,280
You should be answering me.

607
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,920
You...

608
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,940
see me in your dreams, don't you?

609
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,840
Who said it was you?

610
00:52:55,020 --> 00:53:00,490
I just dream about someone who looks like you.

611
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,370
I'm frustrated, too.

612
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:05,480
You think I want to have those dreams?

613
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,100
Why did you have to look like him?

614
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,300
You're confusing me.

615
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:13,750
 She definitely saw me in her dreams.

616
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,000
 She actually saw me from 1,500 years ago...

617
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,200
 in her dreams.

618
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,310
Who are you visiting?

619
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,080
That lady...

620
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,140
I mean, Ms. Kang Yeong Hwa.

621
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,450
I heard she's a bodyguard here.

622
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:38,010
I'm sorry. She doesn't work here.

623
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,530
She doesn't have an office, either.

624
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:45,090
Would it be possible to meet her?

625
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:48,010
There's something I need to give her.

626
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:51,390
- Just a moment. Please fill this out first. 
 - Okay.

627
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,050

628
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:15,570
 Out of countless reincarnations of Han Ri Ta, only you...

629
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,490
 Who are you?

630
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,520
 You...

631
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,490
 see me, don't you?

632
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,740
 She recognized me.

633
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,530
 - One more time. Like this. 
 - Another one.

634
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,110

635
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:37,210
 The older you got, the more you resembled her.

636
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:40,770
 But you stopped seeing me one day.

637
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,400
 But now...

638
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:47,560
 you see me in your dreams.

639
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,820
 Kang Yeong Hwa,

640
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,140
 you finally remembered me.

641
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,050
Thanks for the ride.

642
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,140
I need to be somewhere, too.

643
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,710
Did something happen between you and Joon Oh?

644
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,350
No.

645
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:21,100
Well, not exactly, but—

646
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:25,050
Let's chat for a moment if you have time.

647
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:29,340
Wait upstairs. I'll park and join you.

648
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,630
Okay.

649
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:50,220

650
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,830
What do I say?

651
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:06,030
How am I supposed to tell him that?

652
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,080
You can get off if you feel uncomfortable.

653
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,640
No. I don't feel uncomfortable at all.

654
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,870
Thank you.

655
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,920
What's the reason you came here?

656
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:43,980
Excuse me?

657
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,870
Would you help me if I told you?

658
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,170
They know each other.

659
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,880
Of course, I will.

660
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,600
So you go back safely to where you came from.

661
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,520
Be gone, evil spirit!

662
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,290
What are you doing right now?

663
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,160
What are you doing?

664
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,800
I don't think this will be enough to help me.

665
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,680
This can't happen. This wasn't supposed to be.

666
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,350
Is it my turn now?

667
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,090
That's enough.

668
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,750
 It didn't work at all.

669
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:42,040
Did you think it was easy to defeat a vengeful spirit?

670
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,560
I should've just met with Ms. Kang and told her a lost soul was with her.

671
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,800
It's all ruined now.

672
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,980
 The charm needed to work for her to believe me. I couldn't do anything.

673
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,210
I didn't make it for no reason. Just wait.

674
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,820
Will you really be okay?

675
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,140
I can manage myself.

676
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,150
Why did you come here, by the way?

677
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,540
Are you here to see CEO Han, too?

678
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:09,800
I came to see you.

679
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,900
Well, the dream I was telling you about...

680
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:21,560
What's wrong with your face?

681
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,120
Han Joon Oh! Are you okay?

682
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,590
Why now...

683
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:30,240
Han Joon Oh! Are you okay?

684
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,730
Gosh.

685
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:34,800
Han Joon Oh. Han Joon Oh.

686
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,790
Han Joon Oh, wake up! Han Joon Oh.

687
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,400
There's no pulse.

688
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,830
My Lord.

689
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:34,190

690
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:37,510
♫  I'll be by your side  ♫

691
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,660
♫  I won't let go of you  ♫

692
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:47,210
♫  I'll protect you while we're drifting apart  ♫

693
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,060
♫  Just stay with me  ♫

694
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,630
♫  Just look at me like that  ♫

695
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:58,740
♫  I remember whenever I close my eyes  ♫

696
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,700

697
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,020
 This is the Republic of Korea.

698
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,050
 Men from Silla aren't allowed.

699
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,680
 The traitor's child is alive.

700
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,790
 Lock her up in the shed and beat her!

701
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:14,930
 Meeting you made me want to achieve something.

702
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,720

703
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,620
 I'd like to see you.

704
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:22,080
 Joon Oh said you saw his true self.

705
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,420
 His true self?

706
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,560
 Would you be able to tell me

707
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,170
 why you did that then?
