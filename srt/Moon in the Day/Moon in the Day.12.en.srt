00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,889
(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,890
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,890
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,890
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

5
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,829
I killed you...

6
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,869
with my two hands.

7
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,469
You went through so much trouble to find out why you died,

8
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,569
and it was me.

9
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,980
You...

10
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,390
already knew?

11
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,319
You knew who killed you?

12
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,389
That I was the one who put you...

13
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,590
in that unfathomable misery?

14
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,000
I still wanted to know...

15
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:38,340
why you did that.

16
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,280
I loved you with all my heart.

17
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,650
Why?

18
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,329
Why did you kill me?

19
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,799
Why did you do that?

20
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,169
Because...

21
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,300
we were never supposed to be together.

22
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,639
I thought...

23
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,780
our painful lives would get better if I just killed your father.

24
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,889
But that was my foolish and wrong idea.

25
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,590
Our fate was sealed in misery...

26
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,629
from the very beginning,

27
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,699
from the moment we were together.

28
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,229
That was why.

29
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:46,870
I wanted...

30
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,509
to end our misery with my hands.

31
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,740
Even in misery,

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
all I needed was you.

33
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,689
That was why I said I would go to the abyss with you.

34
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,860
How can I make my love live in misery?

35
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,370
How is that love?

36
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,969
Look, even now,

37
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,639
you have been living in pain...

38
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,979
for 1,500 years...

39
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,409
because I have loved you.

40
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,150
Do not say that.

41
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,719
Perhaps our curse...

42
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,930
started from our hearts.

43
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,560
Because our hearts fell...

44
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,270
in this wrongful love.

45
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,210
I had no idea...

46
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,340
and fell back in love with you even in this life.

47
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,889
I don't think I can stay with you anymore...

48
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,189
as if I don't know anything...

49
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,430
now that I know the whole truth.

50
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,980
This love...

51
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,879
between you and I was wrong from the beginning?

52
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,990
Don't go.

53
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,000
You would know if you saw your entire past life.

54
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,769
I wanted to live...

55
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,709
for the first time after I fell in love with you.

56
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,110
So how...

57
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,680
How can my feelings be wrong?

58
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,389
You made me live again...

59
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,120
while I lived like I was a dead man.

60
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,000
So, don't go.

61
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,970
Stay with me.

62
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,000
You wanted to relent your resentment and move on to the other side.

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,370
Didn't you have to remain...

64
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,269
in this world for 1,500 years as my poltergeist...

65
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,579
because of your resentment for me, who betrayed and killed you?

66
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,250
Because I once believed everything would be over...

67
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,879
only after I killed you to relieve my resentment.

68
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,850
But that old man was right.

69
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:51,689
The resentment is...

70
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,259
not only about the revenge.

71
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,259
Sometimes, we should carefully look into it.

72
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,240
Perhaps...

73
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,540
what I wanted to do was reaffirm your feelings.

74
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,110
Did you really love me...

75
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,279
in the times we spent together?

76
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,250
What was in your heart...

77
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,959
when you killed me?

78
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,029
But everything is okay now.

79
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,430
If you...

80
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,329
also loved me with all your heart,

81
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:37,399
even if our love was wrong and I would live in misery again,

82
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,009
my heart for you...

83
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,810
would never change.

84
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,550
Hey, Young Hwa!

85
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,518
Can you stop the car, Yoon Je? Let me get out first.

86
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,850
Do you have to do this, Na Yeon?

87
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,328
Be quiet and stay here, Yoon Je. Okay?

88
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,560
Wait, hey.

89
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,000
Let me see you.

90
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,369
Are you sure you're okay?

91
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,370
Why are you here this early?

92
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,609
What do you think?

93
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,480
I ran over this early to see if everything was okay with you.

94
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,078
Nothing happened.

95
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,979
You'll end up passing away...

96
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,609
with such complacent thoughts once that hot bachelor ghost...

97
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,819
- takes all of your energy... - Stop it. Enough.

98
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,350
Aren't you scared?

99
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,470
Seok Chul Hwan.

100
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,680
Why is he here?

101
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,519
What's wrong?

102
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,259
Are you okay?

103
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,870
You need to stay here.

104
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,869
What is it? What's going on?

105
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,100
Go inside right away.

106
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,540
I feel familiar ominousness.

107
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,740
It's great to see you like this, my son.

108
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,909
It's a shame that our reunion lasts only a short while,

109
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,480
but I'm not the hero of the day.

110
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,720
You can stay there, Yoon Je.

111
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,620
Okay.

112
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,888
Young Hwa, let's go inside Jun O's house...

113
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,700
instead of standing around.

114
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,629
He told you to go in and wait.

115
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,070
Something doesn't feel right.

116
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,509
I've never seen him with that look on his face.

117
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,038
After all, he's a ghost. I'm sure he'll be fine.

118
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,480
Let's just go inside.

119
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,740
Let me wait just a little longer.

120
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,600
That's Jung Yi Seul, right?

121
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,440
What's with her? She doesn't look well.

122
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,240
Ms. Jung.

123
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,250
Are you okay?

124
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,049
This is so annoying.

125
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,679
Ms. Yi Seul.

126
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Die,

127
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,899
Young Hwa.

128
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,940
No, Young Hwa!

129
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,120
(Moon in the Day)

130
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,549
She has bleeding in the abdomen.

131
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:46,679
Her vitals are dropping too.

132
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,190
Put her in the operating room right away.

133
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:50,320
- Get the surgeons ready. - Yes, doctor.

134
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,490
Please wait here, guardians.

135
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,129
Oh, no.

136
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,940
No, Na Yeon.

137
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:36,929
Na Yeon.

138
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,610
Na Yeon.

139
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:45,539
Na Yeon.

140
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,110
Na Yeon.

141
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,559
What am I going to do?

142
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,789
It's my fault.

143
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,799
She was hurt because of me. What am I going to do?

144
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,038
(Episode 12)

145
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,168
What's the meaning of this?

146
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,209
("Actress Jung Yi Seul Arrested for Attempted Murder")

147
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,840
Jung Yi Seul was arrested for attempted murder?

148
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,079
Why won't Jun O pick up his phone...

149
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,549
after pestering me to death?

150
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:25,419
Seok Chul Hwan!

151
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,549
Don't be alarmed.

152
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,549
Didn't you put a tail on me to find me?

153
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,559
Han Jun O made me do everything.

154
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,190
So...

155
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,559
So please spare my life.

156
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,600
I won't tell anyone about you.

157
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,100
Goodness, my man.

158
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Why do you think I'll kill you?

159
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,340
You're such a useful human.

160
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:47,769
Sorry?

161
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,109
Continue to stay low like this,

162
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,408
like a frightened mouse.

163
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,809
Then nothing bad will happen to you.

164
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,450
Thank you.

165
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,710
However,

166
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:00,279
make sure you relay this to Han Jun O.

167
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,590
He doesn't have to find me.

168
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,230
I, his father, will come by to see his son.

169
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:18,669
Darn it.

170
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,440
Will I have to do this myself in this life?

171
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,489
The doctors said they'd have to keep an eye on her...

172
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,590
for a few more days.

173
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:43,259
What will you do there anyway?

174
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,029
I can't leave her there alone.

175
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:47,600
I have to stay by her side.

176
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,099
You were there until now.

177
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,870
What if you collapse too?

178
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,610
Mr. Jang will stay there tonight,

179
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,139
so you need to get some rest.

180
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,678
Everything happened because of me!

181
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,980
How can I get any rest?

182
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,879
Na Yeon was hurt because of my curse,

183
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,590
because I had to die before 30.

184
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,190
I should've died.

185
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,470
What will I do if the worst happens to her because of me?

186
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,399
How was that your fault?

187
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,798
It was my fault.

188
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,398
If I'm under this curse...

189
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,340
because of my bad karma from killing you, it's my fault.

190
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,509
Who else is to blame?

191
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:33,879
Everything happened...

192
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,950
to Mr. Han...

193
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,879
and Na Yeon because of me.

194
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,690
It's all my fault!

195
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,490
Seok Chul Hwan must be behind this.

196
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,629
But first, I should find out...

197
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,190
his true identity,

198
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,669
the ominous feeling I felt from him.

199
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,970
That's not what I mean.

200
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,679
How many times do I have to tell you?

201
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,240
Han Min O's slush fund is in a bank account in America!

202
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,279
And yes, I'm his legal representative!

203
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,649
So just approve it!

204
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,779
Darn it.

205
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:54,990
Hey, Jun O.

206
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,700
My attorney is here to see me?

207
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:17,850
Han Jun O?

208
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,590
I'm sorry, Jun O.

209
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,889
I have no excuses to make to you.

210
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,019
You shouldn't apologize to me,

211
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,759
but to Choi Na Yeon, who's on the brink of death because of you.

212
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:33,059
And the world will be...

213
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,500
the judge of your crime, not me.

214
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,539
I came here today...

215
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,870
because I wanted to check something with you.

216
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,950
What is it?

217
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,508
Well, here's the thing.

218
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,450
Jun O wanted to find out something...

219
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,720
that you didn't share in the police statement.

220
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,620
Have you met...

221
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,460
Seok Chul Hwan lately?

222
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,659
The former CEO of Beginning Entertainment?

223
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,529
You have, right?

224
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,369
What does that have to do with this incident?

225
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,039
If Seok Chul Hwan threatened you in any way,

226
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,980
please be honest and tell us.

227
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,809
You stated that you acted with an intention to kill,

228
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,380
and the victim had not regained consciousness.

229
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,480
If this goes wrong,

230
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,950
you will be charged with a serious offense.

231
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:32,619
Wait.

232
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,490
What do you mean...

233
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,900
if he instigated the incident or threatened me?

234
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,528
Why would he do that?

235
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,430
He didn't put you up for this?

236
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,869
That doesn't make any sense.

237
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,369
Why would I try to kill someone because someone told me to?

238
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,940
Well, Jun O.

239
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,109
No matter how monstrous Seok Chul Hwan was,

240
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,519
it seemed like a stretch to think...

241
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,890
that he would try to kill a stranger like Ms. Kang...

242
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,190
by using Ms. Jung.

243
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:12,358
Jun O, is my work done here?

244
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,400
Jung Yi Seul would be safer in there.

245
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,799
And you should stay low for a while too.

246
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,339
Wait.

247
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:21,170
You just confirmed everything.

248
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,308
Seok Chul Hwan didn't make her do that to Kang Young Hwa.

249
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:26,339
If you don't want to follow Han Min O's suit,

250
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,549
tell me right away...

251
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,950
as soon as you find out where Seok Chul Hwan is.

252
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,849
Wait.

253
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:39,759
He said you wouldn't have to find him.

254
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,490
He said you didn't have to find him,

255
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,859
as the father would come by to see his son.

256
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:50,869
What?

257
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,740
At first, I thought he was talking complete nonsense,

258
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,640
but now, I've become curious too.

259
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,180
There is no way Seok Chul Hwan is your father.

260
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,650
Is there a story between you two which I'm unaware of?

261
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,369
(Firefighter Kang Soo Han of Korea, may he rest in peace.)

262
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,539
Dad, are you watching me?

263
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,579
Na Yeon...

264
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,450
was hurt severely because of me.

265
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,190
You also know...

266
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,130
that she has been my only family until this day.

267
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,160
So Dad, please keep her safe in my place.

268
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,369
The miracle I had and my guardian deity...

269
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,609
The guardian deity's bracelet.

270
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,349
(Kang Soo Han)

271
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,119
Yes.

272
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,490
There was one more.

273
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,029
Ta-da! It's a matching bracelet with Daddy.

274
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,000
Even when you get a boyfriend when you get old,

275
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,700
you can't take it off.

276
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,240
It won't fit me when I grow up anyway.

277
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,640
You can change it to a longer string like mine.

278
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,410
Still,

279
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,380
keep this smiley one.

280
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,650
Thank you, Dad.

281
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,269
Who passed away?

282
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,608
Gosh. How could this be?

283
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:45,609
(Korea Fire Service)

284
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,579
My goodness. What are we going to do?

285
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,390
- For goodness' sake. - Salute.

286
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,859
He died at the scene...

287
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,059
by an accident, right?

288
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,630
Yes.

289
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,099
There was a fire at Sungdong Apartment.

290
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,700
He rescued the victim,

291
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,299
but he couldn't get out of it.

292
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,509
When something like this happens,

293
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,709
it still hurts my heart.

294
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,450
You can never get used to it.

295
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,809
It will get worse.

296
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,819
I'm still feeling the same after 20 years.

297
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,990
Young Hwa.

298
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:32,818
Yes.

299
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,289
You should get ready to come back.

300
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:39,829
Of course. I should come back to work.

301
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,470
Hey, come back quickly.

302
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,369
Seung Woo says he misses you so many times a day.

303
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,539
Is that the face of someone who misses me?

304
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,309
Well...

305
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,039
It's because this is the first funeral...

306
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,650
of his colleagues since he was appointed.

307
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,779
Cheer up.

308
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,180
I'm going to go and smoke.

309
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:03,420
- I'll go with you. - Sure.

310
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:09,829
Are you all right?

311
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:14,529
If I were in Mr. Sung's situation,

312
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,240
would I make the decision he made?

313
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,169
I thought I was ready to make a sacrifice...

314
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,309
when I became a firefighter.

315
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,709
But after seeing it myself...

316
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,309
I don't know if I'm confident anymore.

317
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,549
I'm scared...

318
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,960
that I will make a choice to leave a victim to die...

319
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,930
due to my hesitation.

320
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,160
Why did I not...

321
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:21,670
think of it?

322
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,700
All I did was to save my brother.

323
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,470
If she dies,

324
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,480
you can come back.

325
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,950
Someone who knows about Young Hwa's past life.

326
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:39,019
Someone who fooled Min O with lies.

327
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,950
Seok Chul Hwan, he's not even a human.

328
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,849
He's a monster!

329
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,230
Someone who uses Gu Tae Ju and Han Min O...

330
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,359
and who is cold-hearted to kill them without hesitation.

331
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,410
Someone who would wander around the world...

332
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,450
for 1,500 years with resentment.

333
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,549
That is my father,

334
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,349
So Ri Bu.

335
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,930
With that look on your face, I guess you know who I am now.

336
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,289
In fact,

337
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:26,559
I would feel bad if you didn't recognize me.

338
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,838
You were the one...

339
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,839
who stabbed a knife in my heart.

340
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,740
You...

341
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:38,579
You are not Seok Chul Hwan.

342
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:41,380
You are Master's father.

343
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,150
I'm impressed.

344
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,179
You didn't just look like Han Ri Ta.

345
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,720
You have her memories too.

346
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:53,789
It was worth following you for 1,500 years.

347
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,390
What?

348
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:57,490
Didn't Do Ha tell you yet?

349
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,659
I am the one who killed you...

350
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,329
all through the 18 lives you had.

351
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,069
Today,

352
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,680
you'll face your 19th death.

353
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,619
What happened?

354
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,549
How come?

355
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:29,130
This is why.

356
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,329
I got rid of the amulet by using Gu Tae Ju.

357
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:39,700
Was it you who made Tae Ju do such a thing too?

358
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,640
As well as Mr. Han...

359
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,869
and Yi Seul?

360
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,279
Didn't I tell you in the past?

361
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,119
For a thousand times...

362
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,690
or ten thousand times, I will be born again...

363
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,759
and...

364
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,190
find...

365
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,230
you...

366
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
again...

367
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,439
and again.

368
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,240
That I will tear apart all your lives!

369
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:22,578
You won't have it your way in this life.

370
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:25,018
People around you will be dead like always.

371
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,849
Are you going to be okay with that too?

372
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,848
Didn't you know the deaths of your parents...

373
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:32,720
were the disaster caused by your karma?

374
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,759
What?

375
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,930
Foolish girl.

376
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,629
Ruminate over what I meant...

377
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,429
by your tragic fate would repeat...

378
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,170
once you fell in love with Do Ha.

379
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,240
No.

380
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,640
That's not true.

381
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:57,048
Even if the tragedy repeats, it's my fate!

382
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,950
Others didn't do anything wrong!

383
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,990
If you can remember the past life, you already know...

384
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,618
about countless innocent lives...

385
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,289
who died because of you and Do Ha.

386
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,259
So,

387
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,569
even if you stop me, it won't change a thing.

388
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:20,539
Unless you are dead,

389
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,869
the tragedy will repeat...

390
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,609
in some way or other.

391
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,919
Where is Young Hwa?

392
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,489
I sent her home for now.

393
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,789
She looked exhausted.

394
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,960
Right. Also...

395
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,839
Someone left this.

396
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,970
Do you know who Kim Do Ha is?

397
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:59,179
I am supposed to give to this Do Ha,

398
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,779
but I don't even know who he is.

399
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,980
What is this tree?

400
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:09,549
It's a yew tree.

401
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:15,559
That is a present from Lord So to commemorate your victory.

402
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,259
They look like berries.

403
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,369
It's yew berries.

404
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,069
Its fruit is tasty like persimmon, but the seed is deadly poisonous.

405
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,608
People add this poison at the tip of arrows when going to the war.

406
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:34,640
I see.

407
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,679
Then Lord So gave it to you...

408
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,880
hoping you win the next war.

409
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:41,579
Those who want to kill themselves...

410
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,150
also eat these fruits.

411
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,359
My father sent this.

412
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,599
This is...

413
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:04,440
(The Flower Garden of Saro)

414
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,990
Young Hwa, where have you been?

415
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,789
It was So Ri Bu.

416
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,759
The guy, Chul Hwan.

417
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,769
You met him again?

418
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,369
Are you okay? Weren't you hurt?

419
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:37,809
I'm asking you.

420
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,079
The lotus seed amulet you gave me...

421
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,210
protected me this time again.

422
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,349
But what's wrong with your face?

423
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:51,750
It protected you.

424
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,089
What should I do now?

425
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:58,259
What?

426
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,730
I...

427
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,470
You...

428
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,069
What should we do...

429
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,309
from now on?

430
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,369
What are you talking about?

431
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:13,940
He said something to you?

432
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,910
If I stay here, Na Yeon will be in danger.

433
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:21,880
I should leave.

434
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,819
Let's go home first.

435
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:35,799
You'd better eat something.

436
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:37,970
You haven't eaten enough...

437
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,400
while you were in the hospital.

438
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,839
You stay here. I'll get some for you.

439
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,279
Can you just stay next to me?

440
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,819
Then, tell me...

441
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,329
what you talked about...

442
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,130
with my father.

443
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,000
About what makes you worry and what you're afraid of.

444
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,529
I, of all people,

445
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,900
need to know about them.

446
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,210
Are you afraid of the curse?

447
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,720
The continuous death through 1,500 years...

448
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,288
isn't the inevitable fate,

449
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:35,759
but my father has caused it. You know it now.

450
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,630
Then, what makes you afraid?

451
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:40,959
All I need to do is protect you from my father.

452
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,869
What if others get hurt or die during the time?

453
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:46,569
What?

454
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:52,279
That's what I'm afraid of.

455
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:56,279
As I'm with you,

456
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,589
other innocent people can be hurt or die.

457
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:09,930
I told you...

458
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:13,430
what I had on my mind when killing you.

459
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,670
Indeed, the decision I made in my previous life was right.

460
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,308
We shouldn't have been together from the beginning.

461
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:24,309
No,

462
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,140
that's not right. Please.

463
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,609
You're wrong about it.

464
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,619
We finally met...

465
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,250
We should accept it now.

466
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:41,690
All results we can see now is the tragedy.

467
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,529
If all our results were...

468
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,500
a tragedy,

469
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:58,980
I wouldn't have waited for you with the same mind for over 1,500 years.

470
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,880
If you had killed me at first,

471
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,288
Mr. Han and Na Yeon would be fine.

472
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:12,360
Young Hwa,

473
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:14,690
why do you even think about it?

474
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:17,789
Maybe I'm also tired now.

475
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,559
This curse...

476
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,469
and fate too.

477
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,130
I understand...

478
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,570
why you're exhausted now.

479
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:37,840
You'd rather...

480
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:43,650
endure your pain than see others...

481
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,679
around you suffering.

482
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:51,949
But you should...

483
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,989
at least give me a chance.

484
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:02,199
I've come such a long way...

485
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,099
to realize how I feel...

486
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,309
about this.

487
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,139
I won't lose you...

488
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,780
ever again.

489
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,550
I'll protect you...

490
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,489
whatever it takes...

491
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:31,530
with people around.

492
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:36,699
Just wait...

493
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:40,739
a little bit more.

494
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,809
This has at least better nutrients than before,

495
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,139
although it's a delivery food.

496
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,210
I'll soon come back.

497
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,768
Na Yeon recovered her senses.

498
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:44,829
(Yoon Je)

499
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,170
Na Yeon...

500
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,550
Na Yeon.

501
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,550
Na Yeon.

502
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,489
Don't hug me hard. It hurts.

503
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,860
I'm not in the best condition yet.

504
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:16,969
What a relief.

505
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:19,639
I'm relieved now.

506
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:23,169
Apart from the fracture, she is okay,

507
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,039
although we need to check again thoroughly.

508
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,679
And the operation went so well.

509
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,449
I'm so sorry.

510
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,019
I'm sorry.

511
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,920
You've done nothing wrong.

512
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:39,960
You were hurt instead of me.

513
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,889
You'd be much worse...

514
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,828
if you were hurt.

515
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:49,369
You'd be in this hospital for over a year.

516
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,130
Come on.

517
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,409
So don't feel sorry about me but rather thank me.

518
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,908
You can repay my favor by cleaning the toilet...

519
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,480
in our house for good.

520
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,380
For good? You went too far.

521
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,519
You know you two look like real sisters now?

522
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,960
I guess we need to request a gene test.

523
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,130
Blood sisters? We don't look alike.

524
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,030
- I'm prettier, aren't I? - You bet.

525
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,848
People around you will keep dying, as always.

526
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:42,619
You think you can put up with that?

527
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,320
Only stopping me won't change anything.

528
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,429
Unless you die,

529
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,800
the tragedy will continue,

530
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,570
anyway.

531
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,780
I'm sorry, Master.

532
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,949
If someone else gets hurt or dies,

533
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,679
I'll never be able to live with that amount of guilt.

(The Flower Garden of Saro)

537
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,719
Show your manners if you are here.

538
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,719
I knew it was you, Father.

539
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,860
I finally met you, Son.

540
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,469
What is with your attitude before your long-lost father?

541
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,610
Now, I know everything that you have done.

542
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:44,869
How dare you...

543
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,909
tell me to show manners?

544
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,619
Judging by your face,

545
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:56,049
that girl must still be tying you down,

546
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,519
even after 1,500 years.

547
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:02,889
Now,

548
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:07,030
how must I kill that girl in this life?

549
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,900
Tell me your ideas.

550
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:15,239
Let me ask you one thing.

551
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,639
Why do you go so far to stop me?

552
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,750
I have...

553
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,880
already experienced the fiery pit because of you.

554
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,690
Still,

555
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,789
I am your son.

556
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,690
So, why?

557
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,670
Do Ha brought this on himself.

558
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,369
You will now...

559
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,010
be able to rest at your old age.

560
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,409
It seems that you can pass on your position to him.

561
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,750
Has Do Ha started defying me...

562
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,050
because of me,

563
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,389
or because of you?

564
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:08,420
My pet dog that I raised covets a human's place.

565
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,159
I must tighten his leash...

566
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:14,760
and put him...

567
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,300
back to his place. Would you not agree?

568
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:21,139
I am not sure.

569
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:23,639
It has been so long for me.

570
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,650
I was expecting that answer.

571
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,989
It was a mistake to reveal yourself.

572
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:39,420
For you can...

573
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,960
no longer hurt Young Hwa.

574
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,098
Do you know...

575
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:51,670
why you have not been able to notice my existence?

576
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:55,038
Humans can commit murder...

577
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:56,840
with little malice.

578
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,440
That means that I can have that girl...

579
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,610
killed using a human's malice whenever I want.

580
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,420
In the next life,

581
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,579
and in the life after that.

582
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:11,789
I do not have to do it myself.

583
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:15,820
There are millions of people in this world...

584
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,190
who will kill her for me because of malice.

585
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,099
What is the point...

586
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,969
of stopping me?

587
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,510
- You... - Look at yourself.

588
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,279
Have you forgotten that I was also a ghost, just like yourself?

589
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,449
I do not care.

590
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,579
Even if your soul moves to another body,

591
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:45,420
I will make sure to find you and tear you into pieces.

592
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:47,419
Then, how will you stop that girl...

593
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,360
when she has decided to kill herself?

594
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,960
My foolish son...

595
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,599
who cannot even tell your woman's true feelings.

596
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,510
I have slowly and thoroughly driven that girl...

597
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,980
to the edge of the cliff...

598
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,449
so that she will have to take her own life.

599
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,650
You might want to hurry.

600
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:20,320
For I am not the only one running out of time.

601
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:42,339
It's been so long since I came outside.

602
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,710
This feels nice.

603
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,719
Yes. This is exactly what I wanted.

604
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:57,360
What's with that cheesy look?

605
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,159
Remember what you said to me last time?

606
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,530
You told me to be thankful, not sorry.

607
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,300
Yes, I did say that.

608
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:11,409
I'll be thankful to you for the rest of my life,

609
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,309
so don't feel sorry for me, whatever happens.

610
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,050
Even when I wash your clothes wrong and they all become unwearable?

611
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,219
I don't have to feel sorry and just say thank you?

612
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,119
Is that it?

613
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,460
Yes.

614
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,389
We'll never be sorry for each other again.

615
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,659
We'll only be grateful.

616
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:35,500
What? You seem weird today.

617
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,500
I packed a special lunch that you would like.

618
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:43,739
You'll immediately thank me once you see this.

619
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,079
All right.

620
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,280
You'll be surprised.

621
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,150
Hey!

622
00:46:57,989 --> 00:46:58,989
There.

623
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,760
Young Hwa!

624
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:06,360
They look scrumptious.

625
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,860
I'm so touched. Thank you.

626
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,939
Hi, everyone.

627
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,268
- Ms. Kang! - Hey, Young Hwa.

628
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:17,038
- It's Ms. Kang. - You came unannounced.

629
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:18,569
- This is a surprise. - I knew...

630
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:21,479
you'd be hungry by this time.

631
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,839
- It's pizza! - Yes!

632
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,779
- Amazing. - Thanks for the pizza.

633
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,150
- This is delicious. - Right?

634
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,019
Amazing.

635
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:32,289
So good.

636
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,769
(Kang Young Hwa)

637
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,750
Ms. Kang.

638
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,449
What are you doing here? I thought you were eating with us.

639
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:08,920
Hey, Seung Woo. I wanted to tell you something.

640
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,559
- Me? - Yes.

641
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,059
I never gave you the answer to your problem...

642
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:16,059
at the funeral hall last time.

643
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,230
Oh, that's all right.

644
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,300
It felt a lot better that you listened to me.

645
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:27,179
I still want to give you my answer.

646
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:30,110
What is it?

647
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:40,360
That the lives of the people left behind continue, even if I die.

648
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:43,888
When you know that,

649
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:46,329
you'll no longer hesitate at critical moments.

650
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:54,699
Oh, boy.

651
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:01,480
What? Han Jun O...

652
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:04,510
I mean, a ghost.

653
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,380
I heard that Young Hwa was here.

654
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,519
She just left. Why?

655
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,789
She left? Where did she go?

656
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,789
How would I know?

657
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,289
I asked you why. Did something happen to her?

658
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:19,459
Did she seem fine?

659
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,059
Or did she say anything to you?

660
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,469
Oh, right.

661
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:27,900
She told me...

662
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:31,309
to give you this if you came.

663
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,829
I plan to fix our ill fate that got off on the wrong foot.

664
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,570
I sometimes think...

665
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:02,440
that perhaps I shouldn't have desperately asked...

666
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:06,979
for my guardian deity when I dived into the Han River...

667
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,380
to save you.

668
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,780
If I had died back then,

669
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,880
we wouldn't have come this far.

670
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,619
"Ill fate that got off on the wrong foot."

671
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:41,579
That time at the Han River...

672
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:44,179
No.

673
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,230
Only a month ago,

674
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,730
I wished that you and I would live.

675
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,139
Now, I'm back here...

676
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:16,409
to end everything.

677
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,619
But every single moment with you...

678
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:30,389
made me happy.

679
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,369
Why are you reading my book?

680
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,739
So,

681
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:22,380
I don't regret it.

682
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:27,750
I'm not going to.

683
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,880
Come to your senses, Young Hwa.

684
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,690
Don't fall into his trap.

685
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:09,820
It's different this time.

686
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,559
I choose to do this to be responsible for everything.

687
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,570
Do you truly believe it's your choice?

688
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,639
No.

689
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:23,869
You used to be...

690
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,010
someone who held life the dearest.

691
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,079
And 1,500 years ago, Han Ri Ta...

692
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,880
told me to live.

693
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,590
So, how is that your choice?

694
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,219
If I had died...

695
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,659
instead of getting you killed 1,500 years ago,

696
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:48,400
this darn curse wouldn't have gone on for this long.

697
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,230
Though it's late, I must do this.

698
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,570
This is for you and me both.

699
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:58,869
So don't try to change my mind.

700
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,010
If...

701
00:54:01,309 --> 00:54:02,880
you hadn't changed my mind...

702
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,679
I believed that I could kill you at any moment.

703
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,590
But I was wrong.

704
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,030
I could never...

705
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,070
I could never kill you.

706
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:30,570
Of all the misfortunes that I chose,

707
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:36,949
meeting you was...

708
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,050
the luckiest thing that happened to me.

709
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,460
But if you still want to do this,

710
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:53,730
let's make a bet...

711
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:57,670
to see if you're truly okay...

712
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:01,570
leaving me behind.

713
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:09,840
I want...

714
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,010
you...

715
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,519
to leave.

716
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:16,650
That is what I truly want.

717
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,119
If you truly mean it,

718
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:24,530
will you make a bet with me, Master?

719
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,199
If you do not look back as you go,

720
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:39,210
this will be our last moment together.

721
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,469
Are you sure...

722
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,800
you will not regret it?

723
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,440
I think...

724
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,309
I will regret it.

725
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,349
But I cannot...

726
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,050
help it anymore.

727
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:32,530
I'm afraid...

728
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,559
that I'll regret it again.

729
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:40,800
I'm afraid that our tragic past will repeat...

730
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,139
if I fall in love with you again.

731
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,050
But I can't help it.

732
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,079
I've fallen too deeply for you,

733
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,019
and I want to live.

734
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,630
With you,

735
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:09,130
as Kang Young Hwa...

736
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,800
I just want to live with you.

737
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:21,079
Yes.

738
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:25,449
Let's live.

739
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:29,750
We'll live.

740
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,320
I will...

741
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,960
change our destiny.

742
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,960
(Moon in the Day)

743
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:44,659
I promise you.

744
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:46,900
The ending of our current life...

745
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:49,199
will not be tragic.

746
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,199
I must destroy Young Hwa's amulet first.

747
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,839
Even if I die, it won't be by your hands.

748
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,340
How must I eliminate this evil spirit?

749
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,739
The answer to your question will be...

750
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,010
between the reason you stayed here and the evil spirit's obsession.

751
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,219
What difference does it make?

752
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,619
The curse is over now.
