1
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,980
(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,050
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,050
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,050
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

5
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:10,069
Please. Don't do this!

6
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:12,640
All this...

7
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:16,110
started from your previous life.

8
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,449
No. I don't want to die.

9
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,390
Why are you doing this to me?

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,250
Please don't do this.

11
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,470
I have to do it eventually,

12
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,910
but I hesitate even in my imagination.

13
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,490
Master.

14
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,899
Wait. It's Master.

15
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,870
Ri Ta's 19th reincarnation that remembered me,

16
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,639
Kang Young Hwa.

17
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,410
Her 30th birthday is coming soon.

18
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,049
You will definitely die before that.

19
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,090
Watching all your reincarnations and deaths,

20
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:38,060
I was going to make sure...

21
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,600
that I would kill you and send you to paradise.

22
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:07,319
(Moon in the Day)

23
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:11,060
If you don't mind,

24
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,530
may I have your phone number?

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,299
What's wrong with those two?

26
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,130
Are they really catching feelings?

27
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,479
Why don't you go inside now? You must be tired.

28
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,780
Well...

29
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,130
- What? - Come on.

30
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,359
You weren't in any photos because you had a mask on the whole time.

31
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,829
We had enough fun to almost feel tired,

32
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,229
so we need at least one photo to remember it.

33
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,299
Look.

34
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,799
In 1, 2, 3.

35
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,769
It looks good on you. Smile for me.

36
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:02,810
- Gosh. - Just...

37
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:04,710
Come on.

38
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,579
What do you think? It looks good, right?

39
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,319
Do you like them? Do they look okay?

40
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,400
You look great in it.

41
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,400
Kill Kang Young Hwa,

42
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,439
and your brother lives.

43
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,438
Have you ever wondered...

44
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,410
why the evil spirit in your brother is so obsessed with Young Hwa?

45
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,849
It's only been interested in her...

46
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,919
ever since it took your brother's body.

47
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:47,150
- You can't get up so suddenly. - Where's Young Hwa?

48
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:48,619
Where are you going so late?

49
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,988
- To Kang Young Hwa. - Must you go now?

50
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:54,260
I must. To make her come back.

51
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,299
Are you saying...

52
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,570
that the evil spirit has something to do with Ms. Kang?

53
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,929
That evil spirit was created...

54
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:05,640
by Young Hwa when she committed a grave sin in her previous life.

55
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,739
Not because of the grudges of Tae Ju, who recently died?

56
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,678
It's a poltergeist that turned into an evil spirit...

57
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,410
due to its obsession with Young Hwa.

58
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,820
It's been wandering around Young Hwa...

59
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,850
and chose a human that was close to her.

60
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,660
And that happened to be Jun O.

61
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,728
It's a series of unlikely coincidences...

62
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,830
that formed this harsh fate.

63
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,700
I genuinely want to help you.

64
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,439
Are you saying...

65
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:40,340
that killing Ms. Kang will solve everything?

66
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:46,809
An evil spirit naturally disappears when it no longer has a purpose.

67
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,059
Your face looks awkward,

68
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,369
but here's our first photo together.

69
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,168
Try to smile next time.

70
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,070
(Han Jun O)

71
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,580
What? He's leaving me on read?

72
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,919
How is it so difficult to reply?

73
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:27,150
I took this photo for him in the first place.

74
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,059
If...

75
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,200
we were normal,

76
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:42,900
as you once said,

77
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,410
how would it have been?

78
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:55,720
It would have been great...

79
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,390
if we were normal as you said.

80
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,200
They say, "Fate is cruel."

81
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,929
Maybe they were right.

82
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,539
Gosh.

83
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,368
You scared me.

84
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:20,669
What are you giving a monologue like a play?

85
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,580
Whatever.

86
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,379
- Come out. - Okay.

87
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:33,789
Why are you staring?

88
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,889
How come you look worse day by day?

89
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,960
What about my looks?

90
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,629
I guess dating a celebrity doesn't only have upsides.

91
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,529
We're not dating.

92
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,030
Whatever.

93
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,999
I have a feeling that something bad will happen today,

94
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,609
so stay at home and don't go anywhere.

95
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:58,309
And Tell Jun O that you're sick and want to rest at home.

96
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,618
Out of nowhere?

97
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,749
Maybe it's because you kept talking about dreams,

98
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:07,489
but I had that dream for you.

99
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,389
Seriously? A dream about your previous life?

100
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,390
What are you talking about?

101
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,229
It was a sunny morning.

102
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,499
You popped out of the room wearing a silk dress.

103
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,739
Okay.

104
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,840
And you lost a bunch of your teeth.

105
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,379
That has to be a bad omen.

106
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:31,140
Try to stay safe for a while.

107
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,349
It was just a regular nightmare.

108
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,080
You had me there for a second.

109
00:08:40,749 --> 00:08:42,359
- What is this? - What's wrong?

110
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,930
Hey!

111
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,758
See? It's already begun!

112
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,200
- It's that dream. - Stop talking nonsense.

113
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,369
Do you...

114
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,470
have any ideas on how to have fun...

115
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:00,470
doing trivial stuff?

116
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,680
So,

117
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,949
you're actually going on a date with Jun O?

118
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,850
No, it's not a date.

119
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:08,949
I just...

120
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,190
want to give him one normal day for once.

121
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:14,618
I can't seem to have that dream nowadays,

122
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:16,590
and it feels like the only thing I can do for him.

123
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:18,859
What?

124
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:22,499
Never mind. So, do you have any ideas or not?

125
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,570
What's gotten into you? You haven't texted me today.

126
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,940
I'm on my way to your house, so let's eat delicious food...

127
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,909
and watch a movie if we have time.

128
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:42,450
Sorry!

129
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,350
Why did I have to fall on a pile of garbage?

130
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,060
I won't smell, will I?

131
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Hello.

132
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:06,540
I sense a lot of concerns from your face.

133
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,009
Something bad must have happened to you today.

134
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,850
Can I help you?

135
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,450
We just saw extremely bad energy around you.

136
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,090
We'd like to talk to you about spiritual beings.

137
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,619
Are you free right now?

138
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:23,159
What's the matter today?

139
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,290
I'm sorry, but I'm a little busy.

140
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,498
It's not just your energy.

141
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:30,600
You also have a ghost on you.

142
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,670
A very old ghost...

143
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,399
is following you around.

144
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,709
Haven't you heard of karma and curses?

145
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,979
Are you saying that I have bad karma?

146
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:44,978
Let's stop wasting our time...

147
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,550
and go somewhere to talk.

148
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,720
We know a way to stop such karma and curses.

149
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,488
No,

150
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:54,719
I've never done anything to bring bad karma.

151
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,988
Ma'am.

152
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,759
It's an important matter. Surely, you can...

153
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:01,728
- Do us the kindness of cold drinks. - No, why should I...

154
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:05,070
Such good deeds will help you get rid of karma.

155
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,569
You buy yourself a drink and buy us some drinks.

156
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,339
- Let's be kind to one another. - Come with us.

157
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,969
- Goodness. What's wrong with you? - Come on.

158
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,670
You're Kang Young Hwa, the firefighter, right?

159
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,149
You saved me last time.

160
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,950
Don't you remember me?

161
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,460
Sorry about that.

162
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,429
You've gotten so much better...

163
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,029
that I didn't recognize you right away.

164
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,300
I think you gave me your business card that time.

165
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:41,669
But I can't seem to recall your name.

166
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,170
My name is Seok Chul Hwan.

167
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,768
I meant to visit you to thank you sooner,

168
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:47,869
but I've been busy with life.

169
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,940
I'd have to thank you for today.

170
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,050
Earlier,

171
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,579
I was in a fix and couldn't find a way out.

172
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,850
You were in a fix.

173
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,419
I thought you were following them...

174
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,159
because you were intrigued.

175
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:05,590
Not at all!

176
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,028
They were both in my ears...

177
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:09,830
and never gave me a chance to answer.

178
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,070
They talked to me about a ghost that's following me...

179
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,399
and karma.

180
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:19,909
It's absurd, isn't it?

181
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,210
Not all of it.

182
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,249
Because ghosts do exist.

183
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,850
Do you also believe that there are ghosts?

184
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,619
Of course.

185
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,590
Actually,

186
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:38,989
I've seen a ghost.

187
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,800
Really?

188
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,899
Yes.

189
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,999
They're wicked, you know.

190
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,440
They should have gone to the afterlife after death.

191
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,609
I don't know what they're doing in this world.

192
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:58,909
I see.

193
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:04,180
I don't think all ghosts are evil.

194
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,950
Are you suggesting that there are nice ghosts?

195
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,460
Well...

196
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,759
It seems that you're still in the dark.

197
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,569
You only become a ghost if you have grudges in this world.

198
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,139
How can ghosts with grudges be nice?

199
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,139
A grudge...

200
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,409
can also mean a terrible obsession.

201
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,479
Obsession?

202
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,909
So,

203
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,220
if you ever see a ghost in your life,

204
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,749
you must never let it bewitch you.

205
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,859
To get what they want,

206
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:47,729
they bewitch you with believable lies.

207
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,300
Once you come to your senses,

208
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,300
you'll be...

209
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,840
on the edge of a cliff, and...

210
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,070
Did I scare you?

211
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,450
The greatest firefighter is...

212
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,180
scared by such a story?

213
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,580
It's not like you.

214
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,820
You were joking, right?

215
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:22,028
You sounded so convincing...

216
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,430
that I was immersed in it.

217
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:28,070
I never said I was joking.

218
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,680
I scared you again, didn't I?

219
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,850
You startled me.

220
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,430
Why does it feel...

221
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,899
like his words were targeted at Master?

222
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,590
Your hands are as smooth as they were.

223
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,290
You will find out the truth soon, Young Hwa.

224
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:29,259
I mean,

225
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,460
Han Ri Ta.

226
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,898
I have crazy news.

227
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:39,108
A friend of mine is a nurse,

228
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:40,268
and she told me that Han Jun O came...

229
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:42,008
to Seoul Neungil University Hospital for a fatal disease.

230
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,978
- You could be sued for this. - Jun O is dying?

231
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,709
- It's not even credible. - Maybe it's because...

232
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,579
- of the accident at the Han River. - He's still healthy.

233
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,419
- He has three months left? - I saw him not that long ago.

234
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,479
- I feel bad for his life. - You could get sued for this.

235
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,989
(Cancellation of Advertisement Contract)

236
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,629
(Cancellation of Advertisement)

237
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,479
Mr. Han.

238
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,450
You recently went to the cancer ward...

239
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,550
at Seoul Neungil University Hospital, right?

240
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,580
Is my going to the hospital...

241
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,850
a problem?

242
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:28,320
No, not at all.

243
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,489
Except for the fact that it started rumors of Jun O's terminal cancer.

244
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:34,359
You've also cancelled...

245
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,899
all of his remaining schedules.

246
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,430
Is it true...

247
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:41,999
that Jun O only has three months left to live?

248
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
Mr. Han!

249
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:47,139
You need to say something.

250
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:50,478
This issue is connected directly with the future...

251
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,180
of Beginning Entertainment.

252
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:54,909
Not really.

253
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,519
It's a matter of choice from here.

254
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,070
I haven't seen you in a while.

255
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,169
What brings you here?

256
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:22,409
What do you mean?

257
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,209
I came as I thought I had been negligent of your health.

258
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:30,980
(Oxipod)

259
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:35,149
I guess you haven't been taking your medicine.

260
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,820
Taking medicine was actually...

261
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:39,590
bad for my health.

262
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,830
Right. You fainted after taking these pills last time.

263
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,830
We shouldn't put these here.

264
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,639
Thank you for caring about me as my brother,

265
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:56,540
but don't do anything unnecessary.

266
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,719
Is Ms. Kang's reinstatement...

267
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,419
deemed unnecessary for you?

268
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,020
I thought...

269
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,990
we were done discussing that matter.

270
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,830
The longer it takes for her to return,

271
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,560
things may get worse for her.

272
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,530
You don't want to have her beside you...

273
00:18:21,939 --> 00:18:23,340
by standing in her way.

274
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,340
Am I wrong?

275
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,810
Having her beside me...

276
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,310
is for her future.

277
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,820
- How so? - Can't you just leave...

278
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,590
Young Hwa and me?

279
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,359
It'll all be over in a few days.

280
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:48,429
You still...

281
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:52,570
tell me things that are difficult to understand...

282
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,040
whenever it's about her.

283
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,209
Is this obsession?

284
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,379
Jun O, I'm here!

285
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,209
Now that she's here,

286
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,980
let's talk to her about it.

287
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,949
Wait.

288
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,389
What...

289
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,389
What are you two doing?

290
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:24,699
Mr. Han.

291
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,899
- Your face... - It's nothing.

292
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,010
What's going on?

293
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,869
He probably made a mistake.

294
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,080
I brought up your reinstatement.

295
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
My reinstatement?

296
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:44,520
But judging by his condition, I don't think it's time.

297
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,149
If you're okay with it,

298
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,060
we'll discuss this matter after a while.

299
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:52,659
Okay.

300
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:55,500
Will that be all right, Jun O?

301
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,600
I will get going.

302
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,000
What's the matter?

303
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,409
It looks like...

304
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,909
Min O seems strange.

305
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:45,810
You'd better stay away from him.

306
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,550
He seems normal...

307
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:52,990
Why so suddenly?

308
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,619
I don't know exactly.

309
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:57,619
I had a bad feeling.

310
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,358
You just stay away...

311
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,600
Why do you doubt him first?

312
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,429
It's Mr. Han.

313
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:08,669
Is it because of reinstatement?

314
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:11,139
Do you think I will suddenly leave?

315
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,570
Yes.

316
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:16,179
That could be a proper reason.

317
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:20,080
If so, it sounds way more strange.

318
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,949
I promised that I would help you. Why do you feel anxious about it?

319
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,618
He did it because he cared about me.

320
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,260
Does that mean his words are more reliable than mine?

321
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:31,919
No. I mean,

322
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,760
you made a wrong guess before.

323
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:38,399
You cut off the details...

324
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,829
and just told me I was in danger.

325
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,300
I didn't just cut off...

326
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:46,209
You see? You can't tell me any reason this time too.

327
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,639
If I tell you,

328
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,139
do you think you can bear it?

329
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,949
I wouldn't know if you keep it to yourself. Just tell me!

330
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,179
I'm ready to hear your words.

331
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:00,449
You're kidding me.

332
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,859
That's enough.

333
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:09,629
Do you even know what I had on my mind before coming here?

334
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,330
I was thinking of you being worried all the time...

335
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:20,740
That's enough.

336
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:22,780
I'll keep silent.

337
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,480
I need to get going.

338
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:43,699
He's recently been acting like a ghost full of grudges.

339
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,540
Are you already leaving?

340
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:53,909
Yes.

341
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,780
(Medicine)

342
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,448
I'm really okay.

343
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:08,520
Don't mention it.

344
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,189
This will ease my mind.

345
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,659
The scar should die away.

346
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,300
Are you doing all of this...

347
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,510
because you are worried about Jun O?

348
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:32,139
I've heard that you two argued about my return to work.

349
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:36,280
You must've done it all for me.

350
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,250
I apologize to you instead.

351
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,560
There's something I wanted to ask you for a long time.

352
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:47,530
Why do you think he's so obsessed with you?

353
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,000
You once told me it's because of his trauma.

354
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,840
That's what I thought before.

355
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,310
Nonetheless, this is far more than enough.

356
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:05,780
I feel the reason he's so obsessed with you...

357
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,480
might be related to something else.

358
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,490
I think excessive obsession...

359
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,399
also comes from his desperate wish.

360
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,230
Desperate wish?

361
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,199
Because he has so little time left.

362
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:33,138
That's why he's counting on me often,

363
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,570
who frequently stands beside him.

364
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,379
You would often feel disconcerted because of his sudden change,

365
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,780
but please be a little more understanding.

366
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,060
Sometimes, I feel we're not talking about the same Jun O...

367
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,659
we both know.

368
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:15,080
Do you even know what I had on my mind before coming here?

369
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:18,850
I was thinking of you being worried all the time...

370
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,659
Do you even know...

371
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,270
how I feel in my mind?

372
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,469
I love you, master.

373
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,719
I can't live in this fiery fit again...

374
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:58,820
because I'm obsessed...

375
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,189
with you.

376
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:17,409
Thanks for the ride.

377
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,379
I'll see you.

378
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,010
Young Hwa.

379
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,419
The things you told me before.

380
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,090
Those were about you, right?

381
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:30,359
- Sorry? - the story about losing someone...

382
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,929
they loved and people who are left.

383
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,199
It's about people's loss...

384
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:41,169
who are left after losing someone they loved.

385
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,169
So,

386
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:48,169
we don't need to blame ourselves or regret something early.

387
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,980
What matters now is...

388
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:53,310
to try not to have regrets.

389
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,980
I saw the personal data you submitted when starting your work.

390
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:01,949
I have Jun O next to me,

391
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,060
but you must've been very lonely without anyone next to you.

392
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,159
Well, I...

393
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,830
got used to it. So, it's okay.

394
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,629
May I ask...

395
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,139
you a favor...

396
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,540
regarding Jun O?

397
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:25,310
- You brat! - Go away!

398
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,089
You waited long, right? The queue was too long.

399
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,790
That's why I wanted to go with you.

400
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,590
Then, your legs would have hurt you. I wouldn't want that.

401
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,179
I should get this call.

402
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,750
Excuse me.

403
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:05,719
Hello?

404
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:07,820
Right now?

405
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,189
No. Of course!

406
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,459
I'll get going right now. Yes.

407
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:15,459
Gosh.

408
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,000
Na Yeon, I'm very sorry.

409
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:21,030
Jun O wants me...

410
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,240
to come back right now.

411
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,240
Was it Jun O?

412
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:29,780
Darn!

413
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,780
I thought you were talking to some chairman.

414
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,749
Besides, you're much older...

415
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,850
than him, aren't you?

416
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,549
Yes. But that is...

417
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,159
Mr. Jun O actually older than he looks.

418
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:45,959
Mr. Jun O?

419
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,888
There's a situation I can't explain to you.

420
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:50,958
A situation? I can't let this slide.

421
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,029
I will reveal...

422
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,469
- what he is... - Please!

423
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,100
There's a situation. I mean it.

424
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:01,570
What is it, then?

425
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:04,480
I can't see the guy I like...

426
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,080
being mistreated like this.

427
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,050
So, tell me now!

428
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,490
Come to think of it,

429
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:23,300
you will leave...

430
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,730
whenever I dream.

431
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,040
If you suddenly disappear,

432
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,179
I'd feel very sad.

433
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:47,719
Is it a big favor?

434
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:50,760
A breakup trip?

435
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,090
After hearing from you,

436
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,530
I want to spend the time...

437
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,330
I have left with Jun O more meaningfully.

438
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,230
So that I can let him go without any regret...

439
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,199
even if he leaves all of a sudden.

440
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
Well...

441
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:09,980
Okay.

442
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:13,879
As you know, he doesn't like it when it's just the two of us.

443
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,679
Don't mention me to him.

444
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,949
I would appreciate it if you would take him...

445
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,520
to the destination.

446
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,859
To send him off without any regrets.

447
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:41,010
Maybe I need the farewell trip too.

448
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,080
Hey, Young Hwa.

449
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,878
You're in there, right?

450
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:48,050
Come on out.

451
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,580
Hey. Gosh.

452
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,550
This is insane!

453
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,449
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

454
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,429
Is it true that Jun O is possessed?

455
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,989
What? Who told you that?

456
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,260
Just answer me. Is it true?

457
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,230
Where did you hear that kind of nonsense?

458
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,668
There's no ghost these days.

459
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,368
And Jun O of all people? Isn't that ridiculous?

460
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,569
Gosh. Hey. Does it make sense that a top star like Jun O...

461
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,109
goes out with an ordinary person like you, then?

462
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,208
Gosh. When I heard it,

463
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:23,250
it sounded way more credible.

464
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,020
Jun O wasn't in his right mind, indeed.

465
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,449
He is seeing you because he is possessed.

466
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:31,419
- That's not nice to say. - Whatever.

467
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:33,929
What are you going to do?

468
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,889
Do what?

469
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:38,329
It can be an exorcism or talisman.

470
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,668
You have to do something about it.

471
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:43,070
Are you planning to be with someone who's possessed?

472
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:44,899
Do you have any proof?

473
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,609
Why are you talking about ghosts?

474
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,139
How dare you play dumb.

475
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,850
Yoon Je told me everything.

476
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,449
- You knew all about it. - Mr. Jang?

477
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,149
Yes. He's a ghost, so what?

478
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:03,618
Did Jun O cause any harm because he is a ghost?

479
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:05,059
Why do you care?

480
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,928
Of course, he caused harm.

481
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:11,059
He deceived 200,000 fans and good people,

482
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,230
pretending to be Jun O.

483
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:17,169
There must be a dark plan behind seeing you too.

484
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:18,500
No.

485
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,309
Where should I report this to?

486
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,668
What was it?

487
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:24,739
- Na Yeon, please stop. - "Entertainment Weekly?"

488
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,678
Want to Know?

489
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,580
Should I call the police? What should I do?

490
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,879
I need to talk to you.

491
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,250
Let's take a stroll together.

492
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,820
He contacted you again, didn't he?

493
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,059
I will call the broadcast stations first.

494
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,530
- This isn't right. - Come on.

495
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,230
He's going to leave soon anyway.

496
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,570
Please let him enjoy the serenity for the rest of his time.

497
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:49,399
I'll make sure you don't have to worry. Okay?

498
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,269
He's not a person, Young Hwa.

499
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,310
Please!

500
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:56,780
You'll do me a favor, right?

501
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,149
Jun O.

502
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,560
I have something to tell you too.

503
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,730
I thought you left because you were angry.

504
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,800
I was angry back then.

505
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,310
But when I took time to think about it,

506
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:31,439
I think I didn't consider your situation.

507
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:34,179
My situation?

508
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,719
You have lived for 1,500 years.

509
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,619
A decade or two is already a long time.

510
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:46,119
You must have been lonely for a long time without any promise.

511
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,129
Since you are finally able to leave,

512
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,330
I think you can be sharp-tempered.

513
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:56,600
I couldn't think that far before.

514
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,300
I'm sorry.

515
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,369
You're going to accept my apology, right?

516
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,879
So,

517
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:09,079
I have been thinking...

518
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,250
what I can do for you.

519
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,580
You asked me back in the amusement park...

520
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,119
how it'd be if we met normally.

521
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,759
So,

522
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,830
I've decided to be your ordinary moments.

523
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:28,069
Let's go on a trip together.

524
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,270
After you leave,

525
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,380
I think I will feel very empty.

526
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,480
I want to prepare myself for your departure.

527
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,520
What do you say?

528
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,460
Is it a good idea?

529
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,130
Should we do that?

530
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:57,929
I also need time...

531
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,369
to wrap things up for the last time.

532
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:04,869
Are you sure?

533
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,270
You promised me. Okay? It's a promise.

534
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,110
What?

535
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:16,009
You haven't even done this before?

536
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,049
Hook our pinkies together.

537
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,650
Stamp it.

538
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,589
Make a copy like this.

539
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,119
Sign it.

540
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:27,889
Yes.

541
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:29,600
And laminate it.

542
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,298
Maybe it was because of the unresolved feelings.

543
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,330
You can't take it back.

544
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,369
Because I want to...

545
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:38,339
see you...

546
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:41,210
for one or two more days, at least.

547
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,679
I don't need...

548
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:49,580
your dreams anymore.

549
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,380
What? Why suddenly?

550
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,249
You said you need to know how you died to lift your curse.

551
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,960
It will be lifted soon by itself.

552
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,360
Because I'm determined.

553
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,029
Let's get going if we're done.

554
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,270
I'm done.

555
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,400
What?

556
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,150
I'll go by myself. Take her home.

557
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,020
What? Why don't you go together?

558
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,020
What...

559
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:30,588
Did he just leave first?

560
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:32,218
He told me to get you home...

561
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:34,029
because he'd go back by himself.

562
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,199
Did you guys fight?

563
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,500
Not at all.

564
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,469
I made up with him without any problem.

565
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,770
Why does it somehow feel unsettling?

566
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
Right.

567
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:50,839
He told me to give it to you.

568
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,980
As you can't sleep well at night these days.

569
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,980
- Jun O did? - Yes.

570
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,920
It's Mr. Han.

571
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,860
Yes, Mr. Han.

572
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:13,500
Yes. Thankfully, Jun O agreed to go on a trip.

573
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:15,500
Thank you.

574
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:19,440
I'll see you at the place I told you before.

575
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:04,049
Three should be enough.

576
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:23,139
Gosh.

577
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:27,139
Despite what he said, he was worried about me?

578
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:32,880
Well, since he gave it to me because he cared about me,

579
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,850
should I try it?

580
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,338
It's my first time camping.

581
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,880
I tried to pack but I'm not sure if it's enough.

582
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,109
Right. Thank you for what you gave me yesterday.

583
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,150
I took them.

584
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,420
Thanks to you, I feel great today.

585
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:16,319
Is that everything you brought?

586
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,359
Oh, well. Contemporary men need lots of tools, but not you...

587
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,159
since you're from a super long time ago.

588
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,360
Give it to me.

589
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:30,040
Right.

590
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,639
I forgot something. Please wait.

591
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,380
You.

592
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,179
What are you doing here?

593
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:49,149
You don't watch TV these days, do you?

594
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,559
Make it easy to understand.

595
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,060
You'll be like this to the end?

596
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,528
You were brought up much more often than I was...

597
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:55,690
after Tae Ju took his own life.

598
00:39:56,389 --> 00:39:59,259
He wouldn't have died if it hadn't been for you and your brother.

599
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:03,969
But you and your brother's names are completely left out.

600
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:07,009
It can't be a coincidence that only my name pops up endlessly.

601
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,710
Your psychopathic brother has to be behind this.

602
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:12,810
Are you saying Min O did this?

603
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,810
Stop feigning ignorance to the end.

604
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,650
He was a cold-blooded man who'd do anything for you.

605
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,850
Are you going out somewhere...

606
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,119
with that woman in this situation? How carefree.

607
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,459
Have you been hiding to tell me these things?

608
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,000
No, I came to tell you this.

609
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,799
I won't die alone like Tae Ju.

610
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,799
If I fail to rebuild my image,

611
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:41,940
I'll kill everyone,

612
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,509
including you, your brother, and your so-called bodyguard.

613
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,819
That won't happen.

614
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:18,810
It's so weird to go camping for the first time in my life...

615
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,650
with you.

616
00:41:22,009 --> 00:41:24,420
I wonder if people did something like camping in the past.

617
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,560
Will you say something?

618
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,159
Your job in the passenger's seat is to chat with the driver.

619
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,900
Did you use your supernatural power or something?

620
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,839
I saw you turning the lights off too.

621
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,409
Is your specialty in electricity?

622
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,239
We'll just say so.

623
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,049
Anyway, why won't you ask where we're going?

624
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,719
It could be our first and last trip. Don't you want to know?

625
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,819
Come to think of it, it's our first time...

626
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:05,790
going on a trip...

627
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:09,389
and spending time like this.

628
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:16,429
You can look forward to it. Mr. Han recommended the place.

629
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,798
He said he had a special memory with Jun O there.

630
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:20,909
It's apparently really nice.

631
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:24,380
Han Min O told you about this place?

632
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,310
Yes.

633
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,650
Right, then you must know too.

634
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,520
You can read all of Jun O's memories, right?

635
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:33,279
I don't do that recklessly.

636
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,960
It doesn't feel good to go through someone else's memories.

637
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,560
I see.

638
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,730
Then, I'll keep it a secret until we get there.

639
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,270
This is...

640
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,069
our last time anyway,

641
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,710
so let's have fun. Okay?

642
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
Okay.

643
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,449
It's our last time.

644
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,230
Can you raise the volume?

645
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:20,369
Gosh.

646
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,299
That's really cool.

647
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,650
Gosh, my back.

648
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,230
What are you doing?

649
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,469
- Gosh. - Where are we going?

650
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,500
That way, I think.

651
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,139
This bag and...

652
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:02,739
I just need you to take these two.

653
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,580
Hey, where are you going? Jun O!

654
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:12,080
These are so heavy.

655
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:14,690
These are really heavy!

656
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,889
I can't walk anymore.

657
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,630
You shouldn't have packed so much.

658
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,589
Look at me.

659
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:26,130
These are all necessary items to camp in the right vibe.

660
00:44:27,029 --> 00:44:28,029
Give it to me.

661
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,830
Are you going to carry it for me?

662
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:33,509
Here.

663
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:37,110
It won't feel as heavy if you carry it with your shoulder.

664
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,480
You're awful. I drove all the way here too.

665
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,210
You're supposed to carry your own stuff.

666
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,619
You can't leave it to others that easily.

667
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,850
You always say the right things.

668
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:53,460
If you get it, let's hurry up. Quickly.

669
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,529
I will hurry.

670
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:02,730
I'll go. My gosh.

671
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,679
This is way too far.

672
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:17,920
I didn't expect it to be so far.

673
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,888
You don't have to feel bad and keep saying that.

674
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:24,060
It's fine.

675
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:30,299
Anyway, about what you said yesterday.

676
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:34,230
You told me I didn't have to dream.

677
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,799
If I don't dream, how will you lift your curse?

678
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,770
I thought I already answered that question yesterday.

679
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,069
It'll lift itself.

680
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:44,809
If it was going to lift itself,

681
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,350
why did you obsess over me saying it had to be me?

682
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,549
Back then, I didn't know...

683
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:52,750
my attachment...

684
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,219
caused everything.

685
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,029
By attachment, do you mean...

686
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,929
attachment about life itself?

687
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,940
It's about you.

688
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,779
So, stop asking me.

689
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,909
Our curse...

690
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,409
will be over soon.

691
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,210
Why is Min O here?

692
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:49,909
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

693
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:51,980
Let's do this, please.

694
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,809
Mr. Han also wants to spend...

695
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,380
one last good time with you.

696
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:59,080
Let's all have fun together.

697
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:00,290
Over here, Jun O.

698
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:03,589
Thanks for coming this far.

699
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,690
Come on over. I got everything ready.

700
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,759
See? He's trying so hard too.

701
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:11,299
It's okay, right?

702
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:13,730
Let's go.

703
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,360
Mr. Han, come and have some.

704
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:40,929
Coming.

705
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,759
I'm afraid I'll finish everything.

706
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,170
Food tastes so much better when I'm outside.

707
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,298
It always tastes better outside.

708
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,339
Is that so?

709
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:54,610
Jun O, why won't you eat? You love meat.

710
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:01,080
Is it because he's not in good condition?

711
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:06,850
When will we get to return to a great place like this?

712
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:09,089
I did my best to grill these.

713
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:11,020
Do you want a lettuce wrap?

714
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:14,060
I'm fine. Just pretend like I'm not around.

715
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,389
Goodness.

716
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,770
See? You have enough appetite.

717
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:22,830
Try some more. It's good, isn't it?

718
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:59,199
Can we talk for a moment?

719
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,670
I wanted to finish what we were talking about.

720
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:07,710
What do you mean, attachment about me?

721
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,079
I told you not to ask anymore.

722
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,119
Exactly.

723
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,549
Why can't I know?

724
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,290
Because I must...

725
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,759
leave this place.

726
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,369
I thought...

727
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:31,900
I came on this trip to bid you farewell.

728
00:49:33,339 --> 00:49:34,610
But if...

729
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,810
If both you and I feel like...

730
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,179
we want to be with each other a little longer...

731
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:49,150
- If that's the case... - Young Hwa.

732
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,159
I made coffee.

733
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,460
May I speak to Jun O in private?

734
00:49:57,659 --> 00:49:59,600
Yes, of course.

735
00:50:02,529 --> 00:50:03,569
We'll talk later.

736
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:10,610
Have some.

737
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,119
Have it while it's hot.

738
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,699
It's been a while since we came, but it's still great.

739
00:50:33,259 --> 00:50:34,830
I find myself pathetic and foolish...

740
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,968
for finally finding time to spend with my brother...

741
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,770
only after you fell sick.

742
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,739
No matter how busy we were,

743
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,080
we should've come out to chat and get fresh air.

744
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,080
We should've done that.

745
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:56,690
Jun O.

746
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:59,819
Do you know why...

747
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,299
I stayed persistent in this field, even though people called me...

748
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,230
spiteful and cold-hearted?

749
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:12,670
It's because of you.

750
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:16,069
My only brother, Jun O.

751
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,779
I may be your brother,

752
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:26,020
but still, why do you go that far?

753
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,319
Do you remember this place?

754
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,830
We lived here for a while...

755
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,730
at the foot of a mountain after our parents passed.

756
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,900
Mr. Han recommended the place.

757
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,399
He said he had a special memory with Jun O there.

758
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,469
It's apparently really nice.

759
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:48,369
It must've been around there.

760
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:52,079
Kids around the neighborhood would point fingers...

761
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,049
and tease us, saying we had no parents.

762
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:57,480
Don't leave me here alone.

763
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,119
I'm sorry, Jun O.

764
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:03,989
I'll never leave you alone again.

765
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:06,219
I'm sorry.

766
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,330
I'm sorry, Jun O.

767
00:52:13,259 --> 00:52:15,000
That was when I decided on this.

768
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,270
No matter what happened,

769
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,569
and no matter the cost,

770
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:27,040
I was determined to keep my brother safe.

771
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,420
I'm alive on this day thanks to you.

772
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:45,960
How will I survive my days without you?

773
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,230
Your brother, Han Jun O, wouldn't...

774
00:52:50,569 --> 00:52:51,639
no.

775
00:52:54,009 --> 00:52:57,009
I don't want to see you grow weaker...

776
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:00,650
just because I won't be around.

777
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:04,520
So, live well...

778
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,520
for my sake.

779
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,000
You almost sound like my brother.

780
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,739
You once collapsed after taking some medicine, right?

781
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:32,979
I shouldn't keep this here.

782
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,049
(Oxipod)

783
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,860
I'll let you have your body back,

784
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,929
even if Young Hwa is the price I must pay.

785
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:03,239
Now.

786
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:05,909
What will you do now?

787
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:09,480
Will you kill Kang Young Hwa...

788
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:12,049
and get your brother back?

789
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:15,089
Or...

790
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,989
will you let Kang Young Hwa and that evil spirit...

791
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:24,299
take Han Jun O's body...

792
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,130
and continue to live?

793
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,210
Are you telling me...

794
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,579
to kill an innocent person to save my brother?

795
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,949
No, she's not innocent.

796
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:44,520
Don't you remember?

797
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,549
That evil spirit...

798
00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:50,150
was formed because of Kang Young Hwa's karma.

799
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,560
Then, let me share one more thing with you.

800
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,259
Kang Young Hwa...

801
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:04,000
also knows about the evil spirit.

802
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,170
Han Jun O was more abnormal than ever,

803
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:10,069
but think about how Kang Young Hwa treated him.

804
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,710
What do you want?

805
00:55:14,509 --> 00:55:16,750
You know that he's traumatized.

806
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:19,219
Please understand.

807
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,020
Of course,

808
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:24,690
you would often feel disconcerted because of his sudden change,

809
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,730
but please be a little more understanding.

810
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,330
Kang Young Hwa had been helping that evil spirit.

811
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,040
They want to take Jun O's body to remain together.

812
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,969
They are in this together.

813
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,449
What?

814
00:55:54,489 --> 00:55:56,350
When did I fall asleep?

815
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,969
(Recents)

816
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,089
He was tied to this life for 1,500 years under a curse,

817
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,119
but I asked him to stay with me a bit longer.

818
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,860
That was absurd of me.

819
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,080
No.

820
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,650
No, Young Hwa. No.

821
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,190
Mr. Han.

822
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:45,860
I'm sorry.

823
00:57:49,029 --> 00:57:51,040
I need you to help me out one last time...

824
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,710
for my brother, Ms. Kang.

825
00:57:57,509 --> 00:57:58,540
Sorry?

826
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:13,719
Don't feel that this is unfair.

827
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,360
It's all because of your karma from your previous life.

828
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:22,869
What do you mean?

829
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:26,239
Young Hwa!

830
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,509
No.

831
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
No.

832
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,920
(Moon in the Day)

833
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:15,389
What have I done?

834
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,219
No.

835
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,520
If I had known this would happen, I would have been more honest...

836
00:59:20,759 --> 00:59:23,629
and asked him not to leave, to stay by my side.

837
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,159
Wake up, Young Hwa.

838
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:28,069
Who are you? Why did you do that?

839
00:59:28,529 --> 00:59:30,599
Seok Chul Hwan! Everything was a lie?

840
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,299
Do Ha must die in glory.

841
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:39,139
I will make sure I return to you alive.
