(1,500 years ago, War of the Fall of the Great Gaya)

8

Charge!

13
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,690
I command you as your general...

14
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,190
to fight to the death!

15

Keep your pride as soldiers of Gaya!

16
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,310

00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,150
We are running out of time.

19
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,549
Go and capture...

- You must hurry. - Yes, my lord.

23
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,840
Open the gate!

24
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:00,710
Open the gate right now!

25
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,139
It is the Silla troop.

26
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,439
- You must leave. - Mother, please.

27
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,478
Open the door this instant.

28
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,509
- Now! - Open the gate!

29
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,380
- Mother. - Hurry.

30
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,079
- Mother, please. - Hurry.

31
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,289
No, Mother.

32
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,750
Mother!

33
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,289
Mother.

34

Nonsense.

37

She is not here.

38
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,640
Let go of me.

39
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,249
Shut your mouth and come with us!

40
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:43,650
- Do not let them go. - Mother.

41
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,090
Tie her up.

42
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,660
Behold.

43
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,160
Watch closely.

44
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,900
This is...

45
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,869
Gaya's last pride that you have been talking about.

46
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,150
- No! - No!

47
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,260

Those who wish to fight will die.

51
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,739
Those who wish to live...

52
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:14,539
will get our mercy.

53
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,309

55
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,390
And that day,

56
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:44,809
I met you.

57
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,129
Who sent you?

58
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,830
My family that you murdered and my parents...

59
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,330
sent me.

60
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,999
Do you wish to join your parents?

61
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,210
Either an arrow or a sword...

62
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,910
will pierce your heart.

63
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,919
I am in a puddle,

64
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,790
yet you...

65
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,759
keep flowing away.

66
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,619
Go wherever you would like.

67
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,249
I will always...

68
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,259

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,220
Why are you sweating so much? Did you cry or something?

73
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,190
Me?

74
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,989
I didn't cry.

75
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:54,090
- Stop it. I don't remember. - Come here.

76
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,700
You're not running a fever. Look.

77
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,129
And your pupils are normal.

78
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,700
Do you want me to tell you if I'm normal or not?

79
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,069
See? She should get checked up.

80
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,969
That's enough.

81
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,408
She's not the only one with a trauma.

82
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,008
Then, explain to me why she doesn't remember.

83
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,049
She was sweating and screaming too.

84
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,820
Don't be dramatic. I never screamed.

85
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,559
My dad told me...

86
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,159
that it means you slept well if you don't remember your dream.

87
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,170
Should I really see a doctor?

88
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,979
Why can't I remember any of my nightmares?

89
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,019
Forget it. As long as I got a good sleep.

But there's no one in the building.

100
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,488
- What? - Then, how come we don't see him?

101
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:28,759
He's homeless,

102
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,459
- so he usually sleeps over there. - That's right.

103
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,459
He used to collect the boxes that we put out,

104
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,829
but the boxes were still there last night.

105
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,999

190
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,109
I've never seen anything scarier than that.

191
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,449
I was so startled.

192
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,679
That was a poltergeist.

193
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,320
They're vindictive ghosts consumed by where they died.

194
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,619
Sometimes,

195
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,189
they take it out on people.

196
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,530
Dad, tie it into a ribbon.

197
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,270
When you run into her in the future,

198
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,139
remember to ignore her.

199
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,949
That poltergeist is not something you can take on.

200
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,149
(Exit)

201
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,060
What is making you...

202
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,729
still stay here?

203
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,300
(Exit)

204
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,760
He's way too glorious. Am I right?

205
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,189
I wish he'd hold me like that too.

206
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,330
Cut!

207
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:24,229
Jun O, what's the matter?

208
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,398
Hey, kid. What did you have for dinner?

209
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,570
You're so heavy.

210
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:30,599
You're killing my arms, kid.

211
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,340
You're way heavier than before.

212
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:33,639
(Seoul Fire Services)

213
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:37,539
He's crying now.

214
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,350
We have to wrap it up. He's crying.

215
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:45,050
Director, let's just use a body double.

216
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,688
You can capture my face later.

217
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:47,750
- A body double? - Yes.

218
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:49,490
But it's just a four-year-old.

219
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,760
Well, the fire is too hot.

220
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,459
Besides, the situation itself is too dangerous.

221
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:59,229
I already put out the fire,

222
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,770
and all left is made with computer graphics.

223
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:08,339
Then you should try. Why do you push me?

224
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,139
Do you know how hot it is there? Besides, the kid is so heavy.

225
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,938
- You should try this. - Director, stop.

226
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:13,010
I quit.

227
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,619
I've had enough of this!

228
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,250
I'm so sorry.

229
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,090
Gosh!

230
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,358
Jun O has been so busy recently.

231
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,858
So he's not in good condition now.

232
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,359
Even if it is, how can we use stand-in in a public advertisement?

233
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:32,729
I don't sense any sincerity from him.

234
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, that's not true. We are all sincere.

235
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,070
Hey, come on.

236
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,109
What's that?

237
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:44,409
Good job.

238
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:46,409
Coffee trucks?

239
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:47,979
(Han Jun O gives you a good treat!)

240
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,678
I didn't imagine that!

241
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,949
(Jon O's treat is coming.)

242
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:54,590
(He's so handsome, and his personality is so good!)

243
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,060
Hey, what's wrong with you?

244
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,299
That's what I want to tell you. The concept was horrible!

245
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,469
What's this?

246
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,040
The concept is about miracles.

247
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,409
Here. She is the miraculous firefighter, okay?

248
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,438
Okay. Everything is okay. I got you.

249
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,679
But you see this.

250
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:21,849
She is just carrying a dog, but why a kid for me?

251
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,579
My arms hurt so much! The pain was literally killing me.

252
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,820
Hey, that's why I told you not to skip the gym.

253
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,619
You are so weak. You can't even be called a man.

254
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,859
Didn't I tell you I'm not the physical type? No?

255
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,730
A man should use his brain.

256
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,359
Jun O.

257
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,198
Please consider my company's situation.

258
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:45,240
We are even donating talent to make you the honorary firefighter.

259
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,909
What would be the benefit we take?

260
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,608
Don't you know give-and-take? If you give talents,

261
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,310
then we should take something else.

262
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:56,148
I didn't mean "give" but "donate."

263
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,580
It's the same when we pronounce "bu."

264
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,289
I already told you not to look down on me with those things.

265
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,719
Hey.

266
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,990
Why do you think we will have nothing to get?

267
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,559
All these things are to cover your scandals!

268
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,369
Don't do that, then. Leave it as is.

269
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:14,029
Let's unveil it all!

270
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,868
- Yes, I'm dating Yi Seul. - Hey!

271
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:17,500
- I'm dating her! - Be quiet!

272
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,169
- Please. - It hurts, seriously.

273
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:25,280
Mr. Honorary Firefighter, shall we go...

274
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,649
to the filming scene with honor first.

275
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,050
No way.

276
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,149
Today,

277
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,990
I have a date with Yi Seul.

278
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:39,659
- What? - Oh, my!

279
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,300
Yes, honey?

280
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,929
Of course, it has already ended.

281
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,429
Sure! Where are you?

282
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,169
Honey, why are you out here?

283
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,840
Why are you in a rush?

284
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:56,240
You look so gorgeous today!

285
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,480
Get in the car already. Yoon Je is behind us.

286
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,109
Honey. come on! He's coming!

287
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:03,679
Hey, Jun O!

288
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,149
Hey!

289
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:07,449
Hey, Jun O!

290
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:10,020
Where are you going?

291
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:11,819
How could you... Excuse me?

292
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,589
Start the car!

293
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,458
Jun O, please don't go.

294
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:16,899
How can you... Jun O!

295
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,600
It's him. Jun O!

296
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,898
Yes, it's him!

297
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:26,240
He looks so cool!

298
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,810
Honey, you wanted a mint chocolate frappuccino with cream, right?

299
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,449
- Just get in! - It's him.

300
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,118
What's it?

301
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,189
Let's go!

302
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,070
Someone can see us. You should be cautious.

303
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,569
Then, we can reveal our relationship.

304
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,408
We will be like the Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt couple.

305
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:05,039
We can shoot dramas and films together.

306
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,179
Do you even know when they were split up?

307
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,810
Oh, I didn't know that.

308
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,449
Jun O.

309
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,750
What do you think would be the reason I like you?

310
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:17,859
That's surely because of my great physique and handsome face.

311
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:22,189
I like you because you are a star.

312
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,230
Moreover, you are the top among all.

313
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,530
Yes, I admit I'm an amazing top star.

314
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,469
But you know this?

315
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,699
Even the star is just a rock when we see it closely.

316
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:35,039
Yes, I'm a rock, for sure.

317
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,539
I go to the gym every day. Feel how hard my arm is.

318
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,679
It's so hard. It's almost a rock.

319
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,279
Touch it. It's so hard here.

320
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,379
Take that away.

321
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,719
I work out so hard.

322
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,659
One, two, three.

323
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,429
Sir, it's a big problem.

324
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,359
Above all, continue to check...

325
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,159
where Jun O is.

326
00:24:58,699 --> 00:24:59,730
Okay.

327
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,310
We have a problem in today's shooting.

328
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,350
Rearrange the public advertisement schedule.

329
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:14,250
- Gosh. - Here we go again.

330
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:18,649
First, finish what we were doing.

331
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,489
As I reported, we are suing the haters online,

332
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,060
blocking everything possible.

333
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,560
The most urgent matter is...

334
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,929
this photo.

335
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:33,730
The money the paparazzi are asking for is too high.

336
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,739
Time is too short as well.

337
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,199
Attorney Gu, please take care of the contacts with them.

338
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,770
Give all the money they want.

339
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,070
- Chief? - Chief?

340
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,879
Yes, I got it.

341
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,050
The Nation's Boyfriend character of Jun O is the most important thing.

342
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:57,320
If we had failed to make that character for the last three years,

343
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,859
Jun O would've been just a failed idol star.

344
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,300
We should keep the character itself,

345
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,968
not the top star Jun O.

346
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:07,429
(The Nation's Boyfriend Mr. Han, The Nation's Fairy Ms. Jung)

347
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:26,020
Seriously!

348
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,790
Yoon Je,

349
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,689
isn't it so romantic?

350
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,659
It's like you feel so good today. That makes me nervous.

351
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,800
Today is the 300th day anniversary since I've been dating Yi Seul.

352
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,330
I will have a party with her, privately!

353
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,939
- You mean today? - Yes.

354
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,539
What about tomorrow's shooting? Are you crazy?

355
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,810
No, I'm not. Just hold this first.

356
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:52,040
Hold it. We should remember this moment!

357
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,290
What?

358
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,359
What's it?

359
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,060
I've seen you somewhere before.

360
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,300
When no one says hi,

361
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,369
it's proper etiquette to keep silent.

362
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,369
- Don't you know that? - Is it?

363
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,169
It might be the birthday party...

364
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,779
of the YDD group's CEO. We've seen each other then.

365
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,480
I was also invited as you were.

366
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,080
So it's fine?

367
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,149
Oh, it's not the same.

368
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,688
I brought a present.

369
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:34,750
But you just came after receiving money.

370
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,290
What?

371
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,790
I know this well because I've been an idol for a long. You have...

372
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:42,699
no talent for dancing. You should just keep singing.

373
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:45,030
Just seeing you made me embarrassed.

374
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:48,199
- You brat... - Goodness.

375
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,469
You heard it, right? Tae Ju just swore at me.

376
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,609
You went too far. Let's move out.

377
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,010
I didn't. I just gave him a piece of advice.

378
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,149
You'd better take care of your scandals first.

379
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,480
Don't bother Yi Seul.

380
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,250
Yi Seul?

381
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,319
Have you at least seen her before?

382
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,659
Didn't you know?

383
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,030
She and I are shooting the new drama.

384
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:17,899
What do you mean by a drama?

385
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,070
She hasn't told me anything.

386
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,800
It's because that's a historical drama.

387
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,408
Tae Ju is acting surly because he's no longer the Nation's Boyfriend.

388
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:30,080
Think nothing of it.

389
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,949
She hasn't told me anything. Don't you get what it means?

390
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:39,050
Yes. Hiding it means...

391
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,719
she maybe wants to split up with you.

392
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,560
What do you mean by "split up?"

393
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,898
What do you mean?

394
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:50,929
Hey!

395
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,898
How dare she say it?

396
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,599
You think I stay here and do nothing?

397
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,638
If not, do you think her history...

398
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:59,070
of changing her boyfriend for each drama will ever change?

399
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,409
Each drama...

400
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,379
The next drama...

401
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,820
Oh, then...

402
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,990
I should do it.

403
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:18,560
We are here to pay for the photos of you and Yi Seul.

404
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:21,628
But you suddenly tell me you want to take Tae Ju's role.

405
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:23,060
What do you mean, Jun O?

406
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,060
I love Yi Seul!

407
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,570
Do you even know anything about love?

408
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,999
Not everyone shooting a drama together goes on a date.

409
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,139
But she goes.

410
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,770
Would I say this if it weren't this serious?

411
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:36,679
I got what you mean.

412
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,310
Prepare for tomorrow's shooting first.

413
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,010
You saw the continuity we had?

414
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,979
I did everything you told me to do.

415
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,388
Especially the honorary firefighter.

416
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:48,490
I hated that. But I did it all.

417
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,219
I know.

418
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:52,358
I know that you're trying hard.

419
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,290
No, you don't.

420
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:56,158
I don't think you know.

421
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,000
Please sort this Yi Seul thing out.

422
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,070
The main roles are already decided.

423
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:05,240
I'll check on Yi Seul's side, so don't worry...

424
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:08,810
You gladly got your hands dirty when firing Mr. Seok.

425
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,850
I don't know!

426
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,819
I'm just saying if you keep acting like this,

427
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,689
I'll admit that I'm seeing her.

428
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,859
- Jun O, sit down. - No!

429
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:44,480
Mr. Han, don't worry about him too much.

430
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:48,510
He won't act rashly because of Yi Seul.

431
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,819
Should I bring the visitor in?

432
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,790
- Lawyer Ko. - Yes, Mr. Han.

433
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,919
Do you know the whereabouts of Mr. Seok?

434
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,060
Well.

435
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,830
There's no trace of him after he got out of jail.

436
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,030
Should I look into it?

437
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:04,929
No.

438
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,030
That's all I needed to know.

439
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:19,948
(Han Min O)

440
00:31:19,949 --> 00:31:21,949
(CEO Seok Chul Hwan)

441
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,149
Come visit me sometime.

442
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,619
I should repay your kindness.

443
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,359
Take care.

444
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,290
That suit must be authentic.

445
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,399
What? What do you mean?

446
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,230
It's a luxury brand's designer suit.

447
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:41,000
What?

448
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:42,898
It's worn out, but he's still wearing it...

449
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,340
because he's stuck in the past. Goodness.

450
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:50,540
That little dog keeps barking at you.

451
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,010
Come on. It's cute.

452
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,179
Bye!

453
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,250
Mom.

454
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:30,619
Dad?

455
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,419
Dear Moon

456
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,320
Dear bright Moon

457
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:16,060
Where did you go during the day

458
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:23,899
To come back in the night?

459
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,840
Dear Moon

460
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,149
Dear bright Moon

461
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:40,990
Where did you go during the day

462
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:48,929
To come back in the night?

463
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,009
(Celebrating a 300-day anniversary, I love you.)

464
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,040
But...

465
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,879
why did you do that to me?

466
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,089
Like I said, I couldn't find the time to tell you.

467
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:18,559
Are you going to do this on a day like this?

468
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,360
Right. I got it.

469
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,659
In that case,

470
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,659
let me star in that drama, not Tae Ju.

471
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:29,029
What are you talking about?

472
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:31,839
The whole cast already read the script together.

473
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,568
We're about to start filming.

474
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:34,639
Gosh.

475
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,309
But I got my brother.

476
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,509
There's nothing Min O can't do.

477
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,679
I told you it was a historical drama.

478
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,580
You hate the old way of speaking.

479
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,879
A historical drama isn't that different.

480
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,650
I can totally pull it off. Look.

481
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,219
Come here.

482
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,988
Go there. Is our enemy over there?

483
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,028
Then go and capture them all!

484
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:56,799
Bang! So charismatic!

485
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,630
- I'll get going. - Hold on.

486
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:01,969
I apologize.

487
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:03,799
I'm so sorry.

488
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,239
Come on.

489
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,069
I was afraid you would leave me...

490
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:11,810
just like you came to me.

491
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,690
You know what?

492
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,759
You are the first one that I've seen this long.

493
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,690
Really?

494
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:30,860
Just focus on the present, Jun O.

495
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,900
It's our 300-day anniversary today.

496
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,170
Okay.

497
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,770
I love this day.

498
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:46,210
I'm going as fast as I can.

499
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,750
I'm not angry.

500
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:51,879
I'm in front of his place.

501
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,719
We'll drop by the salon and fly ourselves there. Okay.

502
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:57,790
Okay. I got it. We'll hurry.

503
00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:03,960
Jun O, do you know what time it is? How can you be sleeping?

504
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,569
Jun O! Hey!

505
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:10,999
Wake up before it gets ugly.

506
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,670
Do you know how many people are having a nervous breakdown?

507
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,679
What is this?

508
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,750
This is Yi Seul.

509
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,480
I want to break up with you.

510
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,449
Bye!

511
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,719
Darn this woman!

512
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,029
Hey, Jun O. You should wake up.

513
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,330
Hey, Jun O. Wake up!

514
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,900
Jun O, why aren't you waking up? Jun O?

515
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:44,568
(Seoul Neungil University Hospital)

516
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,569
Jun O!

517
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:48,638
- Where is Jun O? - He's getting checked up.

518
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,710
Where's the examination room?

519
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,110
This way.

520
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:54,549
Jun O!

521
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,850
What? Why are you so late?

522
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,949
Do you know...

523
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:04,420
how surprised I was?

524
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,929
I opened my eyes, and I was stuck in this white room.

525
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,900
How's the result?

526
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,699
- Doctor Choi will explain it. - Okay.

527
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,969
How do you feel?

528
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,639
Where does it hurt?

529
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:20,908
Well, my leg hurts so bad.

530
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:22,270
I think it got bruised.

531
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,810
How on earth did you carry me?

532
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,778
How can you say...

533
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:28,880
Let's call it a day.

534
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:31,419
I'll rearrange your schedule.

535
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,548
But the press release has already been sent out.

536
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:37,159
People from the National Fire Agency and reporters are already there.

537
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:40,460
Right. I'm just having a hangover.

538
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,900
Also, Yi Seul said she'd be there today.

539
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,959
What?

540
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,929
This is my 301st day with Yi Seul.

541
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:50,569
She said she had never seen a guy this long before.

542
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,339
Awesome!

543
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,209
I won't cause any more trouble,

544
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,949
and I'll listen to you from now on.

545
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:03,480
So, do me a favor, okay?

546
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,048
- Jun O. - Min O, come on.

547
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:07,520
Listen to me carefully.

548
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,719
Thy brother...

549
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,529
will trust thee.

550
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,900
I think I'm great at historical dramas.

551
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,230
I was good, right?

552
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:21,369
Yes. Good.

553
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,369
Good, he said. I think I'm natural at it.

554
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,810
How did you get here?

555
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:31,380
I couldn't call 911 and let everyone know.

556
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,979
I came straight here after calling Doctor Choi.

557
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,449
Follow the schedule today.

558
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,520
- As for Ye Seul... - She won't come.

559
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:46,589
At first, I thought he hurt himself after reading this.

560
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:50,460
Did Yi Seul write this?

561
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,569
Jun O has no idea, does he?

562
00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:00,008
It's cheap of her to dump him while he's asleep.

563
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:01,040
Listen to me carefully.

564
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:03,679
Jun O shouldn't find out about this...

565
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,278
until the shooting ends today.

566
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:08,849
Of course not. He would make a scene if he sees this.

567
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,279
I don't even want to think about it.

568
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:14,319
(I'm an honorary firefighter of Korea, Han Jun O!)

569
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,089
- A PSA? - Yes.

570
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:18,719
The concept of the ad is a miracle.

571
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,389
Since they are reshooting the ad,

572
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:22,988
they begged the miraculous firefighter...

573
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:24,159
to appear in the ad.

574
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:27,630
- Nice! - I really want to see Jun O!

575
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,940
I'll show them what a miracle is.

576
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,540
Safety.

577
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,520
(Gieun Fire Station)

578
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,150
(Honorary Firefighter)

579
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,460
- Over here. - Please look over here.

580
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,929
Please look to the left.

581
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:04,298
- Please look over here. - Over here!

582
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:06,639
- Please look to the right too. - Jun O!

583
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,969
Ms. Kang, please come up on the stage.

584
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,279
Okay.

585
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:15,480
Excuse me.

586
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:24,989
Are you all right?

587
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:29,159
Thank you.

588
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,669
- Please. - Please take the photos now.

589
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,429
We'll demonstrate the CPR process after this.

590
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,298
- Please look here. - Over here.

591
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:41,238
- Over here, Ms. Kang. - Please look this way.

592
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,869
And over here too.

593
00:40:42,969 --> 00:40:44,039
This way.

594
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,479
Please look forward too.

595
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,479
- Please look this way. - Look to the left.

596
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,079
- The left, please. - Over here.

597
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,679
Please look over here.

598
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,219
Just remember three things.

599
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,159
Dead center, five centimeters, and twice.

600
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,928
You'll press down the center of the chest...

601
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,500
with the heel of your hand, not your palm.

602
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,330
That way, you can press down five centimeters.

603
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,600
Press down twice every second.

604
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,269
Keep your body and arms aligned perpendicularly to the body.

605
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,299
Will you give it a try?

606
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:13,610
Like this?

607
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,319
Do not let your arms bend. Keep them straight...

608
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,549
and rest your weight on your arms.

609
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:32,960
You can press down with the heel of your hand.

610
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:35,529
I think we've done enough.

611
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,799
Let's move on.

612
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:39,969
We'll move on to the next set.

613
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,739
Jun O, you can come after you've learned enough.

614
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,400
Let's go.

615
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,150
Gosh.

616
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:02,190
My legs hurt.

617
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,529
Shall we continue?

618
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:10,758
Your arms kept bending, so...

619
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:12,500
This is driving me crazy.

620
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:14,299
What did you say?

621
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,069
Hey, I need the number for Yi Seul's manager.

622
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:21,369
Because I can't reach her!

623
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:25,009
What? She doesn't have anything on her schedule today.

624
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:26,339
Send it to me now.

625
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,750
Stop talking back and send it to me! Just send it now!

626
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:35,419
- Hey. - Let's hurry.

627
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,618
What now? This one?

628
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:38,158
Press this right here?

629
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,560
The chest? Right here?

630
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:42,789
Let's start the shoot first.

631
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,359
Did you just use one hand?

632
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,500
Just send it to me!

633
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,199
Mr. Han.

634
00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:50,869
Mr. Jang Yoon Je! Didn't you hear what I said?

635
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:53,610
Send me the number now! Yi Seul's...

636
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,839
What?

637
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,540
What was... Hey!

638
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:15,889
You finally have your eyes on me.

639
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,900
This is ridiculous.

640
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:21,968
Give it back.

641
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:23,299
I told you to remember three things.

642
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,900
Dead center, five centimeters, and what?

643
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,710
This is driving me crazy.

644
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,040
I can't believe I'm working with an amateur.

645
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:32,279
What?

646
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,349
They'll edit everything and film me nicely...

647
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,678
even if I do this halfheartedly.

648
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,318
These three things or whatever...

649
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,880
don't end up on camera anyway!

650
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,889
You can't do this halfheartedly in that uniform.

651
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,588
Do you think CPR is a joke?

652
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:46,319
I don't care. I have zero interest in this.

653
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:47,759
Give me my phone.

654
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:51,699
Apologize, Mr. Han.

655
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,630
Apologize for what?

656
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,968
You've compromised the honor of firefighters...

657
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:58,238
and resorted to violence against a civil servant on duty.

658
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,569
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

659
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,610
Apologize to me.

660
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,449
What is this crazy...

661
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,920
"Crazy?"

662
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:15,049
Have you lost your mind?

663
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,089
How dare you lay a hand on Han Jun O...

664
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,830
That was assault! I'll call the police.

665
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,360
Go ahead.

666
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,100
Make sure you do, you jerk.

667
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,330
My phone!

668
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,469
My phone. Give me my phone.

669
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:33,770
Don't ever let me catch you again.

670
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,810
What a ridiculous man. I don't care if he's a star.

671
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:43,949
Who?

672
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,619
Han Jun O? What happened?

673
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,989
Where are you going, Young Hwa?

674
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,488
To wash off my makeup!

675
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,159
I wanted her manager's number. Why won't you send it to me?

676
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:57,198
Your rehearsal begins soon, right? Why are you here?

677
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:58,699
Whatever. I don't care.

678
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,670
First, find out that woman's name. I'll report her to the police.

679
00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:06,239
That woman? Who?

680
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:07,769
That firefighter.

681
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,069
Did you do something again?

682
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,980
What are you talking about?

683
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,008
She twisted my arm.

684
00:45:14,009 --> 00:45:15,480
Do you want to see? Look.

685
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:17,749
What is this?

686
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,920
What happened?

687
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,850
Hey, what happened to your arm?

688
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,258
What did she do to you?

689
00:45:24,259 --> 00:45:25,460
Did she beat you up?

690
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:29,560
No, she didn't exactly beat me up.

691
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:30,830
Where is she?

692
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,029
How dare she do this to an actor who's about to shoot his scene?

693
00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:36,499
- Darn it. - The number!

694
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,670
What about the number?

695
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,139
I'll leave to find Yi Seul, then!

696
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,940
I'm taking this car!

697
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:46,810
Have you heard...

698
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:49,049
of cardiac tumors?

699
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:50,719
Jun O...

700
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,319
has cancer?

701
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:55,650
Yes.

702
00:45:56,489 --> 00:46:00,230
The cancer cells have spread to the inside of the ventricles,

703
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,658
so he can't receive surgery.

704
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:03,960
If it had progressed that much,

705
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,270
it makes no sense that he had no symptoms.

706
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,100
Heart tumors...

707
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:13,940
often progress without symptoms until the conditions worsen.

708
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:17,339
But if he didn't feel any pain thus far,

709
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,080
it was a miracle.

710
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:20,850
Forget it.

711
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,179
I'll have him tested again at another hospital.

712
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,719
It must be hard to believe,

713
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,489
but the tumor has spread a lot.

714
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:36,389
You should be ready to face the worst.

715
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:43,699
Let him spend as much time as he wants with the people he loves.

716
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:47,540
It'll be the best treatment for him.

717
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,049
It's me.

718
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:00,549
Do not ask any questions...

719
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,889
and publicize the rumors surrounding Gu Tae Ju...

720
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,089
by using every media outlet we can utilize.

721
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,229
Don't be like this.

722
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,799
Don't say that.

723
00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:15,600
I'll... I...

724
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,480
Hello?

725
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:28,279
Wait, what's...

726
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:42,790
What?

727
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:54,210
What's going on?

728
00:48:05,779 --> 00:48:06,819
Hey, Jun O!

729
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:48,230
No, Han Jun O.

730
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,159
I'll save you.

731
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:28,420
Young Hwa!

732
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,159
Are you okay, Young Hwa?

733
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:36,388
Please leave it to us.

734
00:51:36,389 --> 00:51:38,230
- Don't let him die. - Please step back.

735
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,399
Hang in there.

736
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,469
We have a male in his twenties with a cardiac arrest.

737
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:43,170
He has no pulse and no breathing.

738
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:46,239
We need you to hurry.

739
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:47,569
Please do not come closer.

740
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,809
- I just called for help. - It was so hard to get you out.

741
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:51,909
Don't die.

742
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,749
I'll forget how rude you were, so just come back!

743
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,908
That's enough. Let's go!

744
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:58,679
No, I promised I'd save him!

745
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:00,449
I promised I wouldn't let him die!

746
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,989
Han Jun O, wake up!

747
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,860
Han Jun O.

748
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:21,569
- Shock. - Jun O.

749
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,639
Jun O!

750
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,940
Defibrillator.

751
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,609
Jun O!

752
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,049
- Please hang in there! - Get ready to shock.

753
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,420
- No, Jun O! - Shock.

754
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:37,690
Come on, Jun O.

755
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,259
My guardian deity or whatever, I need your help.

756
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:43,759
Do something to help Han Jun O.

757
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,299
I really want to see a miracle.

758
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,110
That's enough.

759
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,419
Patient Han Jun O is now declared dead.

760
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,859
No, Jun O!

761
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,659
He passed away...

762
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,290
at 5:29:58pm.

763
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:19,830
See?

764
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:22,730
There is no such thing as a guardian deity.

765
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:29,539
- Young Hwa! - Young Hwa!

766
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,678
- Jun O! - Get her over here.

767
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:32,710
Hurry!

768
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,049
- Young Hwa! - Come here.

769
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,380
- Young Hwa. - Young Hwa.

770
00:53:37,279 --> 00:53:39,420
- Wake up, Young Hwa! - Excuse me.

771
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,239
A body.

772
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,980
I have a body.

773
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,448
Han Jun O, a top star beloved as the nation's boyfriend,

774
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:26,060
died during his shoot today and has shocked many.

775
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:27,859
The police are investigating...

776
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,988
the cause of the accident and his death.

777
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:32,428
His body was immediately taken to a hospital,

778
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,298
where his funeral would be held.

779
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:37,469
The police stated this accident...

780
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,449
(Room 303: Kang Y. Hwa)

781
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,610
(Absolute bed rest)

782
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:42,900
Are you up?

783
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,239
Are you all right?

784
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,909
I was worried you'd die.

785
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,409
Han Jun O?

786
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,190
I missed you.

787
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,159
I missed you to death,

788
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:16,799
Kang Young Hwa.

789
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:06,080
I love you, my lord.

790
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,290
I died...

791
00:58:19,759 --> 00:58:22,029
in the hands of my lover.

792
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,069
(Moon in the Day)

793
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:02,909
I could not be here today...

794
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,839
if it had not been for you.

795
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,008
Thank you for coming back.

796
00:59:08,009 --> 00:59:10,150
Are you that happy to have me back?

797
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:12,479
You should've woken me up when you got up!

798
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,350
Why did you go out and walk around alone?

799
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:16,119
Kang Young Hwa.

800
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,919
What? My gosh!

801
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,429
Stay by my side every single day, just like this.

802
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:27,159
I will kill you.
