1
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,630

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,120

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,370

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,570

5
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,200

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,400

7
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:59,030

8
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,170
I think we are pretty far away from them now.

9
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,000
It would be nice to hold you longer like this,

10
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,400
but I need to figure out their movement momentarily.

11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,300
Stay put right here.

12
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,570
I will be right back.

13
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,680
I love you, My Lord.

14
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,230
 I...

15
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,980
 was killed by my lover.

16
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,710
 And...

17
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,280
 I have not even reached Sanzu River

18
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,360
 nor met the Grim Reaper.

19
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,530
 I became a lost soul...

20
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,640

21
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,350

of the woman who killed me.

22
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,530

23
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,970

24
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,330
 - I did not realize.  
 - Bye.

25
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,480
 That this curse would continue for 1,500 years.

26
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,910

There is only one way to

27
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,130
 stop this endless cycle.

28
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,960
 I must...

29
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,940
 kill her reincarnate...

30
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,170
 and break this curse.

31
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,140
Hold on.

32
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,400
 How could this be?

33
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,070
What happened?

34
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,820
At the ER, you definitely...

35
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,110
 Mr. Han Joon Oh passed away at 17:29:58.

36
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,600
 17:29:58.

37
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,010
Amazing!

38
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,720
I must actually have a guardian angel.

39
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,910
 Guardian angel?

40
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,230
Thank goodness.

41
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,940
It's such a relief.

42
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,990
Thank you for coming back.

43
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,480
I really thought you died.

44
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,380
Thank you.

45
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,110
Thank you so much.

46
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,310
Are you that happy that I came back?

47
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,770
You hugged me first.

48
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,090
You should've just told me. Why did you scare me...

49
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,010
It took a long time...

50
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,690
for me to stand in front of you like this.

51
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,060
A long time?

52
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,890
Are you shooting a historical drama or something?

53
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,820
Why do you talk like that...

54
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,280
Did you hurt your head by chance?

55
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,070
Do not worry about me.

56
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,030
I have never been so alert before.

57
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,090
No.

58
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,610
You don't seem alert at all.

59
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,590
Why...

60
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,620
Give it to me. I guess it was here.

61
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,350
It will not take long.

62
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,340
Mr. Han Joon Oh.

63
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,780
Are you sure you aren't sick?

64
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,660
 Sir, are you...

65
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,400
 feeling ill by chance?

66
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,020
It does feel a bit hot.

67
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,550
Mr. Han Joon Oh.

68
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,810
Mr. Han, wake up.

69
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,860
Mr. Han!

70
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,030

71
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,510
Pardon?

72
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,560

Disappear?

73
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,120
He's not at the morgue?

74
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,830

75
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,560
What are you talking about?

76
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,660

77
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,010
Sir.

78
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,790
What happened?

79
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,470
He's definitely not at the morgue.

80
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,900
Did you confirm with the employees?

81
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,950
I checked with all the employees at the hospital,

82
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,700
but they're all saying the same thing.

83
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,620
They say Joon Oh...

84
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,730
woke up and walked out on his own.

85
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,860
I mean, we definitely...

86
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,500
saw the doctor announcing Joon Oh's death.

87
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,800
But how could he...

88
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,360
Could it really have been a miracle?

89
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,790

90
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,720
 I still have a body.

91
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,640
 Why couldn't I finish the job?

92
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,760
 Hold on.

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,760
 It does feel a bit hot.

94
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,610
 It is no coincidence.

95
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,600
 Something is protecting Kang Yeong Hwa.

96
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,380
Come back, Joon Oh.

97
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,330
Without you...

98
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,380
I'll get fired.

99
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,580
 Hello.

100
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,380
 I'll be working for you starting today.

101
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,700
 I'm Jang Yoon Je.

102
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,880
 I'll make sure your paths are...

103
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,740
 filled with petals.

104
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,690
 What the...

105
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,050
 Call a security guard! Hurry.

106
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,410
 There's a weirdo...

107
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,650
Don't die.

108
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,740
Is it a memory stored in my body?

109
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,150
Open your eyes.

110
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,720
- How useless. 
 - Open your eyes.

111
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,710
 The result of the second exam is the same.

112
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,300
 The tumor is malignant and—

113
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,610
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

114
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,990
He was resurrected miraculously.

115
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,090
It'd be too shocking to learn he'd die again.

116
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,710
You never know when he'll have another heart attack.

117
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,260
The accident at the Han River is related to his condition, too—

118
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,710
What you could do for us...

119
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,640
is to keep his condition a secret

120
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,120
unless the police inquire officially.

121
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,020
That's all.

122
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,550
Do you understand?

123
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,580
 Do you know what people told me all the time as a kid?

124
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,650
 That I don't resemble you at all.

125
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,000
 I've been told that a few times, too.

126
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,790
 You just smiled. Right? Whoa!

127
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,140
 I cried.

128
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,160
 You were the school president and at the top of the class, too.

129
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,880
 How could I resemble someone so ridiculous?

130
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,150
 Why are you suddenly being humble?

131
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,010
 But I'm an heir of a conglomerate

132
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,950
 and I graduated from Harvard three times, maybe.

133
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,210
 And I was a god in the debut project. A god.

134
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,220
 Even someone like you can't beat a god.

135
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,320
 Right. I could never beat you.

136
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,350
 I want to stay in front of the camera.

137
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,410
 So don't tell anyone that I fainted.

138
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,530
 Okay.

139
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,930
 Just until you get the test result

140
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,380
 The moment I get sick and pitiful, I'll no longer be a star. You know, right?

141
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,960
 Even if I die tomorrow, I'll die as a star.

142
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,040
 I'll never...

143
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,560
 go back to being Han Min Oh's pitiful brother.

144
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,960
 So keep your promise. Okay?

145
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,790
I heard Han Joon Oh will say no to

146
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,980
all interviews until he recovers.

147
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,070
What's going on, anyway?

148
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,120
This isn't regarding Han Joon Oh.

149
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,610
I'd like you to help me with something.

150
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,050

151
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,470

152
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,910

153
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,410
You know, too. Right?

154
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,000
The recent rumor about Goo Tae Joo's adultery.

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,540
So, it wasn't just a rumor.

156
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,550
If something happens to Joon Oh—

157
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,000
The production presentation for the drama.

158
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,800
Let's proceed with it as planned.

159
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,630
Geez, seriously.

160
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,160
Why did he have to pass out and make me worry?

161
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,360
Han Joon Oh?

162
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,250
Did he wake up?

163
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,840
Han... Han Joon Oh...

164
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,520
 Han Joon Oh!

165
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,700
 Kang Yeong Hwa.

166
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,120
 Go anywhere you would like.

167
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,120
 This time, I will make sure to...

168
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,520
 kill you.

169
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,580
See? I told you it was Han Joon Oh.

170
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,540
I'm a huge fan.

171
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,630
By the way, did you really die and come back to life?

172
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,860
Well, could I...

173
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,680
Hey, are you crazy?

174
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,330
- Step aside. 
 - His voice! Amazing!

175
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,510
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

176
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,220
From the first floor of the VIP building.

177
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,210
Han Joon Oh needs a security guard urgently.

178
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,480
What are you doing...

179
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,650
You should've woke me up if you woke up.

180
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,370
Why did you walk around on your own?

181
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,280

182
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,370
Top star, Han Joon Oh?

183
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,510
Yes, Mr. Top Star.

184
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,790
You're no longer the nation's boyfriend.

185
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,350
You're a resurrected boyfriend.

186
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,540
Gosh, seriously. What if he actually died?

187
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,570
Joon Oh.

188
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,100
Is it always like this?

189
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,380
Are you joking right now?

190
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,120

191
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,020
Everyone on the first floor is freaking out looking for you...

192
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,300
 Top star, Han Joon Oh.

193
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,000
What are you doing right now?

194
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,890
I'm testing.

195
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,390
Hey, you...

196
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,280
 Mr. Han, do you remember what happened?

197
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,030
 Would you like to say something to your fans and family who are worried?

198
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,370
 - Did he just come here?  
 - Hold on, hold on.

199
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,380
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

200
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,110
Gosh, you can't do this!

201
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,810
Be careful. Back up! Back up!

202
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,680
 It would be bad if I chose the wrong body.

203
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,230
 Top star, Han Joon Oh, huh?

204
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,010
 Joon Oh!

205
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,290
Oppa!

206
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,790
We love you, Oppa!

207
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,460
I missed you, Joon Oh!

208
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,450
 I was crying all day thinking he actually died.

209
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,820
 But I heard he's okay. I was wondering if I could see him.

210
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,890
 So I came here with my friends and we're waiting for him.

211
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,910
 Mr. Han Joon Oh's management agency, Beginning Entertainment, said this...

212
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,170
 Gosh, this is crazy.

213
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,400
 He needs to fully rest.

214
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,250
 He's planning to pause his schedule and rest...

215
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,580
Unni, it looks like he actually came back to life.

216
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,350
By the way,

217
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,380
are you sure you don't have to visit him?

218
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,420
We broke up. That's not necessary.

219
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,790
I would've gone to his funeral if he had died.

220
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,910
But he's alive.

221
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,460
Yes. You're right.

222
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,940
Because he's alive...

223
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,480
- Isn't that Goo Tae Joo? 
 - Hey, why do you...

224
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,120
 By making a swift decision...

225
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,770
...not answer your phone?

226
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,740
What's the point of answering?

227
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,980
You got fired from the drama, too.

228
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,430
How shameless. Doesn't he have any guilt?

229
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,850
Hey, turn up the volume.

230
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,490
 It has sent a shockwave.

231
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,530
 S Group's Park, who supposedly had an affair, said it's not true.

232
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,860
 For spreading false rumors...

233
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,310
It's not true.

234
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,620
She's the one who seduced me!

235
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,250
Too bad you got caught. But an adultery?

236
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,460
How trashy.

237
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,160
- Who did this? Shit... 
 - I know.

238
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,000
The security was so tight...

239
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,950
here, too.

240
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,180
What's this?

241
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,410
Who did this...

242
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,490
CEO Han Min Oh.

243
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,200
He threatened me.

244
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,810
If I don't do this drama with Joon Oh, he said he'd expose everything.

245
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,820
What?

246
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,460
He's a sociopath who only cares about his brother,

247
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,040
but he never went this far.

248
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,040
Joon Oh probably threatened him saying he'd die.

249
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,990
That's why...

250
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,290
you're in this mess, too.

251
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,810
So does that mean his resurrection...

252
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,560
All of that...

253
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,350
- was a lie? 
 - You think he's Jesus?

254
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,600
The firefighter who supposedly saved him must've been bribed, too.

255
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,410
This is crazy...

256
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,050
Those scammer bastards.

257
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,410

258
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,350
By the way, Joon Oh.

259
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,500
Where are we going that you don't want me to answer calls?

260
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,330
- I need to know where we're going— 
 - Kang Yeong Hwa.

261
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,990
Who?

262
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,150
Oh, that firefighter who saved you?

263
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,400
What? Did you fall in love with the one who saved your life?

264
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,770
Because you're angry at Jeong Yi Seul?

265
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,090
I suppose the odds are better with her—

266
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,960
Try blabbering your mouth one more time.

267
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,250
I will make you beg me to spare you.

268
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,640
Joon Oh, I'm driving...

269
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,740
I'm driving...

270
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,900
- What's this? 
 - Come here, come here, come here.

271
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,980
What is it?

272
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,600
Ta-da. Bam-ba-bam-bam-ba-bam.

273
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,380
The firefighter of the month. Fire Engineer, Kang Yeong Hwa.

274
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,810
For being ridiculously brave,

275
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,380
she's being awarded as the firefighter of the month.

276
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,660
Safety first.

277
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,940
Safety first.

278
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,050
Why are you doing this suddenly?

279
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,730
- You said it's your dream to get this award. 
 - Yes.

280
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,560
You made my dream come true. So, I should do the same.

281
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,200
I made your dream come true?

282
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,090
- What are you doing? 
 - My gosh!

283
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,270
I'm so proud of you.

284
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,760
Do you know how much I prayed to bring Joon Oh back?

285
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,810
What's the deal? Are you his fan, too?

286
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,470
Hey, let's just drink.

287
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,290
Okay.

288
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,530
Han Joon Oh?

289
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,650
Huh?

290
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,820
Was it a ghost or what?

291
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,210
No...

292
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,470
 Whatever is protecting you,

293
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,570
 I need to face it one more time, at least.

294
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,220
What was that just now?

295
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,620
What are you doing here?

296
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,850
What's that blood on your hand?

297
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,320
- Did you get injured? 
 - Don't come near me. Don't.

298
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,200
What are you doing right now?

299
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,000
You're the one who suddenly appeared.

300
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,520
 What could that be...

301
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,150
Sir, sir, sir!

302
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,530
I'm sorry. If only he didn't take my phone...

303
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,170
By the way,

304
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,840
Joon Oh is kind of strange.

305
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,830
Where is he?

306
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,120
This way.

307
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,350
What was the thing that was protecting you just now?

308
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,060
 He really is ill.

309
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,510
 He's seriously ill.

310
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,350
Han Joon Oh,

311
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,930
I'm glad you woke up in good health, but...

312
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,050
 I'm Han Joon Oh's family.

313
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,870
 Please answer the phone if you're with him.

314
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,310
What does this mean?

315
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,610
Did you sneak out here?

316
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,840
Give it to me.

317
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,140
Now you are looking at me.

318
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,400
 Yi Seul—!

319
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,200
 Now you're looking at me.

320
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,140
Did you come here to do this?

321
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,340
To take revenge on me?

322
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,200
Hey!

323
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,540
Answer me.

324
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,870
What is that thing that is protecting you?

325
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,900
Wow.

326
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,860
Do you know what firefighters fear the most?

327
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,930
Losing someone right in front of them.

328
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:37,160
That's why I hoped for a guardian angel to exist.

329
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,480
Because I really wanted to save you.

330
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,550
But your question is wrong.

331
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,080
If I really have a guardian angel,

332
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,400
it won't be protecting me,

333
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,350
but the ones whom I'm trying to protect.

334
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,200
Got it?

335
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,020
Kang Yeong Hwa.

336
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,260
Don't call my name. Are you my friend?

337
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,480
I know because I've been through this a few times.

338
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,810
You can't do this to someone who risked their life to save you.

339
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,640
I'll forgive you since I'm thankful you're alive.

340
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,390
Try showing up one more time.

341
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,510
I'll report you for stalking.

342
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,100
Joon Oh.

343
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,250
Are you okay?

344
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,260
What happened to your hand?

345
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,360
 I cannot kill Kang Yeong Hwa like this.

346
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,870
 Because she will block all of my attacks.

347
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,010
 What am I supposed to do?

348
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,030
 How...

349
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,320

350
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,530

351
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,390
It might sound like an excuse,

352
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,640
but it's all true.

353
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,860
So, Han Joon Oh's doing this

354
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,200
because he's in shock?

355
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,250
That's what his doctor says.

356
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,540
He's obsessed with the one who saved his life

357
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,300
because of the strong fear he experienced when he died.

358
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,900
That's probably why he visited you the first time, too.

359
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,790
Is that why he said all that nonsense?

360
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,030
 I'll be on my way soon.

361
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,410
 Make sure to confirm Joon Oh goes home.

362
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,860
I'll buy you a new phone.

363
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,980
And...

364
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,300
I'm sure it won't happen, but

365
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,230
- even if he comes back— 
 - He may not realize it.

366
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,580
What do you mean?

367
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,290
When you're in shock,

368
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,970
you're often the last one to know you're suffering.

369
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,110
Because of what I do,

370
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,120
I'm familiar with psychological traumas.

371
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,410
I should be understanding.

372
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,550
The fans sent a lot of gifts to cheer you up.

373
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,620

374
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,030
 Top star, Han Joon Oh...

375
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,480
Why are you standing there like that?

376
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,810
As if you've never seen it before.

377
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,540
Come here. Let's treat your wound first.

378
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,190
What's wrong, Joon Oh?

379
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,350
Are you unhappy with something again?

380
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,860
Stop being nosy and...

381
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,140
 What... was that...

382
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,840
 that voice?

383
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,980
It's because you keep forcing a deep voice.

384
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,190
 Han Joon Oh.

385
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,440
 What kind of person was he, anyway?

386
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,290
Don't try too hard.

387
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,720
You came back just recently.

388
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,830
I'll take care of everything, anyway.

389
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,260
What can you do...

390
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,870
for me?

391
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,410
Yes. I should've taken better care of you.

392
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,370
Joon Oh.

393
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,800
Do these answer your question?

394
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,680

395
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,350
I know you really wanted to do this.

396
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,840
You have to seize the opportunity when it's in front of you.

397
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,310
Seize it and make it yours.

398
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,870
You might never get the same opportunity again.

399
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,390
The way he talks and looks at you. It's like he's a different person.

400
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,190
Is this normal when someone's in shock?

401
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,340
 It was a major accident.

402
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,120
 He might talk and behave in a totally different way,

403
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,690
but it'd be temporary.

404
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,190
Oh, and don't let him know that.

405
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,430
 It might worsen his condition.

406
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,360

407
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,190
I wonder if he got home safely.

408
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:54,170
He was obviously not normal.

409
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,200
It must be hard being in shock.

410
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:11,980
 Have you read a scary book or watched a scary movie recently?

411
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,950
 What's all this?

412
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,490
 She said someone keeps following her.

413
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,190
 Pardon?

414
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,250

415
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,470
A clownish play like this...

416
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,880
is an opportunity for me?

417
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,340

418
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:16,150

419
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,020
 Talisman?

420
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,240
 What's that?

421
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,030

422
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,680
 What do you think? Do I look pretty?

423
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,130
 Venerable?

424
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,280
 Venerable!

425
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,730
 That was it.

426
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,860
Kang Yeong Hwa...

427
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,610
still has the talisman.

428
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,900
I guess it could be an opportunity...

429
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,570
that might...

430
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,240
never come again.

431
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,050
Is Lord Do Ha still not able to fall asleep?

432
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,660
There were plenty of people like you.

433
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,400
Who sent you here?

434
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,300
My parents and family whom you killed sent me.

435
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,110
So, are you here to take revenge on me, then?

436
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,980
Thinking about my dead family's heartrending scream,

437
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,030
the word "revenge" is not enough.

438
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,250
 My Lord, are you okay?

439
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,600
 I heard a noise.

440
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,580
You will have to shut your mouth first.

441
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,630
It was just a mouse.

442
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,400
You can leave.

443
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,900
 Yes, My Lord.

444
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,310
How is your wound?

445
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,310
Do you think I would give up on this?

446
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,140
You have not come to your senses yet.

447
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,500
Attack me with your wounded arm and get brutally killed or...

448
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,500
survive and...

449
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,310
try again in the future.

450
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,420
There is no use trying to insult me.

451
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,920
You might as well kill me.

452
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,030
Did I not tell you?

453
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,750
Death is too light of a punishment.

454
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,620
Especially an arrogant girl like you

455
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,900
deserves to be punished appropriately.

456
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,400
You made the right decision.

457
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,990

I said we can't!

458
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,120
The production presentation is Joon Oh's comeback interview, too.

459
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,430
- Why are you opposing it— 
 - He's...

460
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,900
not normal.

461
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,920
He strangled me like this and took my phone...

462
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,560
He's too strong

463
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,740
and he sounds too scary.

464
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,860
He's in shock. It's probably temporary.

465
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,550
No, no. It's not like that.

466
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,690
He's not the same person we know of—

467
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,300
Joon Oh.

468
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,080
Hyung.

469
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,670
You're making them think I've gone crazy.

470
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,620
What's wrong with you?

471
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:19,330
Did you just call me "H-Hyung"?

472
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,060
Hey, are you f-finally back?

473
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:26,180
Hey, J-Joon Oh! You're really back... Hey! Wow.

474
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,090
Keep smiling like that so they won't be suspicious of me.

475
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,230
In order to appear like the real Han Joon Oh,

476
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,570
I need your help.

477
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,130
T-The real H-Han Joon Oh?

478
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,680
What?

479
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,650
Well, Mr. Jang. Are you okay?

480
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,490
I'd like you to do me a favor.

481
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,900

It was loved by a lot of viewers.

482
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:08,040
The sequel, "Nakrang, the Romance"... weren't you worried about its popularity and rating?

483
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,400
- Was I worried about the rating? 
 - Yes.

484
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,870
I'd like to say I'm confident rather than worried.

485
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:17,840
Especially since I'm working with Han Joon Oh for the second time,

486
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,140
the chemistry between the lead actors would be stronger.

487
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,270
I see. If there's a scene where your chemistry explodes,

488
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,170
could you tell us a little bit about it?

489
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,500
- Why did you ask me to come here? 
 - When I think about it...

490
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,230
Joon Oh said he needs to talk to you.

491
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:39,400
The scene I'm most excited about is when I meet Tae Woo for the first time.

492
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,840
 - In order to destroy the talisman,  
 - Not knowing their fate...

493
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,600
 I need to keep Kang Yeong Hwa close and look for the opportunity.

494
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,500
I'll ask a question to Mr. Han Joon Oh this time.

495
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,640
You died and came back to life.

496
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,600
It won't be an exaggeration to say everyone's focusing on you.

497
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,540
Your comeback is happening sooner than I expected.

498
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,510
Is there a reason for that?

499
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,600
Before I answer,

500
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,480
I would like to...

501
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,440
thank Firefighter Kang Yeong Hwa, who saved my life.

502
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,790
 Me? Out of the blue?

503
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,400
She's here right now.

504
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,750
I promise...

505
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,570
not to let go of the opportunity you gave me.

506
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:40,930
That no obstacle can stop me.

507
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:45,360
You're the one who allowed me to be here today.

508
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,630
And I can never...

509
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,650
forget that.

510
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,700
 Kang Yeong Hwa.

511
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,020
 You just need to fall for my lies.

512
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,790
 The moment I kill you,

513
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:07,180
 the endless curse will end, too.

514
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,280
Ms. Kang, allow me to interview you.

515
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,520
Please say a word.

516
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,630
Do you have a reason for coming here?

517
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,990
- She'll do the interview another time. 
- I'm sorry. I'll get going.

518
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm sorry. I'll get going.

519
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,120
- Ms. Kang. 
 - How do you feel right now?

520
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,870
 I wasn't hoping for this.

521
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,130
 She is running away?

522
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,850
Allow me to make an announcement.

523
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,580
Due to the disturbance,

524
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,540
we'll resume in a moment.

525
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,060
Where are you going?

526
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,200
T-To the restroom.

527
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,610
We'll get started in 10 minutes once they're ready.

528
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,660
I'll be right back.

529
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,820
Long time no see, Joon Oh.

530
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,420
Is this the first time since we broke up?

531
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,800
 - I'll just go. 
 - Oh, hold on, hold on.

532
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
 I'm sorry.

533
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,890
 I thought you might leave just like...

534
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,140
 when you came to me.

535
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,360
 Here's an announcement.

536
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,300
 The story of Prince Hodong and Princess Nakrang,

537
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,270
 told from the oldest prince's point of view.

538
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,730
 The epic fiction with a beautiful romance.

539
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,010
 It's EAN's ambitious project.

540
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,760
 The production presentation for "Nakrang, the Romance" will start...

541
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,240
Oh, my gosh...

542
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,250
Gosh, seriously...

543
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,470
It must be somewhere here.

544
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,660
Gosh, you scared me!

545
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,590
Do you know how weird you are? Do you find this fun?

546
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,770
How about you? Do you enjoy playing hide and seek?

547
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,370
You think I'm like you?

548
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:12,630
Don't talk about me anywhere from now on.

549
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,500
My job is to save people

550
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,200
and anyone would've saved you in that situation.

551
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,300
- I just happened to be there— 
 - It had to be you.

552
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,700
If it were not for you, I never would have

553
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,620
been able to be here.

554
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,910
 CEO Han was right.

555
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,690
 He looks fine, but he's really ill.

556
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,860
 Because it's hard to overcome your trauma.

557
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,200
Okay, then.

558
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,880
But keep your promise to me.

559
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,770
It was hard to get this opportunity.

560
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:51,110
Don't you blow it and do it well.

561
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,000
Don't be discouraged, no matter what happens.

562
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,740
Are you...

563
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,190
cheering me up right now?

564
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,690
You can leave if you're done being moved.

565
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,150
I should get used to it.

566
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,860
- What do you mean? 
 - You cheering me up.

567
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,580
I want you to cheer me up near me going forward.

568
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,450
It's better not to see a firefighter.

569
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,660
Going forward...

570
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,680
You can quit being a firefighter.

571
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,330
What?

572
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,430
Stay by my side.

573
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,820
So I can see you...

574
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,150
up close like this every day.

575
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,690
 We worked very hard on "Nakrang, the Romance."

576
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,660
 I hope you love it and enjoy it. Thank you.

577
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,640
Leave now, I said.

578
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,600
We need to open for business now.

579
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,970
 This is my first historical drama.

580
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,980
 I'm practicing hard, and I'm studying the character...

581
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,870
Tae Joo, how long will you do this?

582
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,440
How am I supposed to leave now?

583
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,450
The production presentation hasn't ended yet!

584
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,450
 Then, shout out "Fighting," wishing for the drama's success.

585
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,120
- That's my spot. 
  - One, two, three.

586
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,290
 Fighting!

587
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:42,500
It's my spot, you scamming bastard!

588
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,880
Gosh, Unni. They're from a sponsor...

589
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,800
He used to act heartbroken.

590
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,740
How dare he smile?

591
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,220
Wasn't Joon Oh suspicious today?

592
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,900
I know. He was suspiciously...

593
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,510
cool.

594
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,840
"I'll never forget you."

595
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,970
That was so cool.

596
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,930
That's what I mean.

597
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,520
I can't believe he did that to another woman.

598
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,780

599
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,420
Who cares if he has a girlfriend or not?

600
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,350
Yes.

601
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,610
Yes, yes. I did inquire about a lost article.

602
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,780
It's not there?

603
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,550
Did you check around the waiting room, too?

604
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,770
 Where could the talisman be?

605
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,250
 How is she hiding it?

606
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,770
I'm looking for a small temple.

607
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,690
If the young monk around Kang Yeong Hwa's age is alive,

608
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,160
an old monk won't—

609
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,470
You say "Kang Yeong Hwa" whenever you open your mouth.

610
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,280
The stuff in your room is hers, too. Right?

611
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,820
Are you out of your mind?

612
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,950
Do you really want your life to be over?

613
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,600
Why would I care?

614
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,940
It is not even my life. I do not care.

615
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,630
Whose is it, then... W-What are you saying?

616
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,300
No one near Kang Yeong Hwa has died recently.

617
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,670
Again! That Kang Yeong Hwa again?

618
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:27,330
Whoa.

619
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,950
Lost souls' curse is to be shackled. We cannot look for the dead freely.

620
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,940
Lost souls' curse is to be shackled. We cannot look for the dead freely.

621
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,440
The day Han Joon Oh died,

622
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,180
I just happened to find a body to possess.

623
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:43,420
So, you mean...

624
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,320
y-you're not Joon Oh?

625
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,550
Han Joon Oh...

626
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,340
is dead.

627
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:09,500
There's no such thing as p-possession or ghosts in this world.

628
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,390
What if there is?

629
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,540
Hey!

630
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,690
Hey, what's this? What's this?

631
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,090
What? Seriously, what's this? Mom, mom, mom!

632
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,220
Mom!

633
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,400
I am figuring out what I am capable of, too.

634
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,280
Hey, J-Jesus. Buddha.

635
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,870
The king of the netherworld and... wh-what else...

636
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,970
Praying like that never works.

637
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,850
Do you want me to leave?

638
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,280
Yes, yes, yes...

639
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,640
I mean, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

640
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,250
You are so lucky.

641
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,350
Because I am the one who wishes to leave.

642
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,140
Leave? Where to?

643
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,630
Back to where I was.

644
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:58,720
I came back so I could leave.

645
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,900
Find a small temple first.

646
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,370
If you wish for me to leave.

647
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,780
Why are you out here? You should be sleeping.

648
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:30,730
The wind is gently blowing.

649
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,700
We might have a guest.

650
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,620
It's boring at this temple in the mountains.

651
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,380
I'd be grateful if anyone came.

652
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,540
Don't you agree, Venerable?

653
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,980
This bastard is hilarious.

654
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,380
Don't act like you aren't scared.

655
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,550
Hey, you scammer.

656
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,460
You're just a third-rate idol. How dare you steal my role?

657
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,470
I could let this slide if you leave now.

658
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,750
Why are you talking like that?

659
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,150
Gosh, what was it again?

660
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:30,010
Your accomplice's name?

661
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:37,680
Kang. Yeong. Hwa?

662
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,360
Right. I could just ask her in person.

663
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:44,710
What do I do?

664
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,560
I don't know her phone number.

665
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,110
Geez. When did this bastard get here?

666
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:56,000
I do not care what you do.

667
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:02,260
But if you mess with Kang Yeong Hwa,

668
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,580
I will...

669
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,370
kill you.

670
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,900
Bullshit.

671
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,200
You little coward.

672
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,510
You think I am lying?

673
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,990
Do you think I'd get scared by your terrible acting?

674
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,300
Remember.

675
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,750
If you mess with Kang Yeong Hwa,

676
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:29,170
you will not live.

677
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,520
Let's just let this go quietly.

678
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,970
Nothing good will come out of making noises.

679
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,110
Is Mr. Jang not here yet?

680
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,520
Hello.

681
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,210
I'm Team Leader Park, and I will be your bodyguard for 24-7 starting today.

682
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,350
It was CEO Han's order.

683
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,780
I made the request.

684
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,670
Goo Tae Joo might show up again.

685
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,330
So...

686
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,020
that man will be by my side 24-7?

687
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:35,510
Yes. I will be by your side at all times.

688
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:41,400
 Wow. Even a ghost can't handle someone this big.

689
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,570
Thank you for showing up just in time.

690
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,620
Oh, yes.

691
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,250
Joon Oh.

692
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:07,930
I think we need to get a new bodyguard.

693
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,060
I will choose one myself. One I can count on.

694
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:21,200

Firefighter of the month. Fire Engineer Kang Yeong Hwa.

695
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,440
You diligently fulfilled your duty as a firefighter

696
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,390
and you contributed to saving people's lives and property. Therefore, you are awarded.

697
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:30,400
May 10th, 2023.

698
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,140
The Chief of the Fire Department, Choi Oh Geun.

699
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,750

700
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,500
I heard a lot about the miraculous firefighter.

701
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:48,180
You set the example again by saving Mr. Han Joon Oh recently.

702
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,620
I will continue to do my best!

703
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,770
- Safety first. 
 - Safety first.

704
00:52:53,700 --> 00:53:00,230
In return, I'd also like to gift our best firefighter a miracle.

705
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,530
A miracle, sir?

706
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:07,320
"Therefore, Fire Engineer Kang Yeong Hwa of Gieun Fire Station was chosen as

707
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,900
one of the three dispatchers at the Korea Antarctic Research Station.

708
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,300
The Chief of the Fire Department, Choi Oh Geun."

709
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,480
- Applause! 
 - Congratulations.

710
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,200
I was sure I wouldn't get picked. So, I just applied and didn't expect to get it.

711
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,050
Han Joon Oh.

712
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,340
You're a gift to her. You sure are.

713
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:32,590
Thanks to you, Yeong Hwa is going places.

714
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,470
- Thank you, you bastard. 
 - Geez.

715
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,570
Gosh, seriously.

716
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:36,740
Cheers! Cheers, cheers.

717
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,550
Okay, cheers.

718
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,890
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

719
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:47,240
Hey, the meat is burning. Let's eat, too.

720
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,770
No need to thank him.

721
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,730
Here you go.

722
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:53,410
Take it, Yeong Hwa.

723
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,230
One glass at a time.

724
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:58,430
What a rare treat.

725
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,280
Wow, the weather is so nice.

726
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,240
It's okay. Get it together.

727
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,640
Get it together.

728
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,880
Huh?

729
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,540
 Do you want to grab a drink with me?

730
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,240
Sounds good.

731
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,540
It's just a drink.

732
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,290
Cheers!

733
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,800
I'll grab a drink with you.

734
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,170
Nice!

735
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,060
I had a drink, so I'm really leaving.

736
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,350
I should go.

737
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,560
I need to go.

738
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,840
Where are you going?

739
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:03,060
Did you just come out of there?

740
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,430
It is difficult right now. I am pretending to be human.

741
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,440
Of course.

742
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,680
It's hard to pretend to be human. Right?

743
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,660
Wow, this is so crazy.

744
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,900
So, I was wondering...

745
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,840
please be my bodyguard.

746
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,890
Bodyguard...

747
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,070
You mean this?

748
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:30,080
This is the best solution for now.

749
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,480
To have you by my side at all times.

750
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:40,310
You should think about how you could stay away from me.

751
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:43,300
That way, you'd recover.

752
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,950
You are the only one who can help me recover.

753
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:53,660
If you say no, I will lose that chance.

754
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,590
 Antarctica! Antarctica! To Antarctica!

755
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,830
 Cheers!

756
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:02,360
 - We'll send her to Antarctica!  
 - You heard that, right?

757
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,540
I'm leaving soon. Somewhere very far away.

758
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,500
If you don't believe me, ask the fire department.

759
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,720
You can't go.

760
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,960
No matter where that is.

761
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,860
Because I will not let you go.

762
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,900
Do you want to bet if I leave or not?

763
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:28,100
 Do you want to make a bet with me, sir?

764
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:36,570
But if I win, you'll never show up in front of me.

765
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:38,730
I suppose I'll never see you once I leave.

766
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,890
But if I win,

767
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,120
you...

768
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:49,400
have to come to me, no matter what.

769
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:55,960
 If you do not look back until you cross here.

770
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,330
 Will you promise me then?

771
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:01,420
 That you will leave here immediately?

772
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:05,120
 But if I win,

773
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,500
 you have to admit it, too.

774
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,810
 That you actually do not want me to leave.

775
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,880
 But I will win.

776
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:21,560
 I do not think I would lose, either.

777
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:46,750
 Will you really not look back?

778
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,160
 Do not blame me.

779
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:56,210
 You are the one...

780
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,170
 who proposed the bet.

781
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,280
 You are cheating.

782
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,810
 I know I am cheating.

783
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,200
 I won, then.

784
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:01,090
 Do not be upset.

785
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,490
 Men tend not to...

786
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:07,350
 understand my true intentions.

787
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,110
 I never said I didn't understand.

788
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,040
 Do not blame me

789
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,700
 for cheating.

790
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,310
 I only...

791
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,930
 learned that from you.

792
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:26,850

793
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,110

794
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,220
 He was looking for the talisman.

795
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,140
 If something really happens to that lady...

796
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,920
 Ms. Kang is a firefighter.

797
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,490
 - Why did you come here? 
 - To see you.

798
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:57,240
 Someone tried to kill me,

799
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,290
 but Kang Yeong Hwa's side is the safest place.

800
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:04,430
 Han Joon Oh, as long as you disappear...

801
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:07,760
 He was not only targeting Han Joon Oh.

802
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,840
 He was after Kang Yeong Hwa, too.

803
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,140
♫  Promise me the sun  ♫
