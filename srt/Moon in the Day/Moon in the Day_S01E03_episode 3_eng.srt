1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,760

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,050

3
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,380

4
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,660

5
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,240

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,330

7
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,350
 You are cheating.

8
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,920
 I know I am cheating.

9
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:08,020

10
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,890
 I won, then.

11
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,800
 Do not blame me for cheating.

12
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,580
 I only...

13
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,990
 learned that from you.

14
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,380

15
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,340

16
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,420
I need to stop drinking. Seriously.

17
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,640
Why did I make a ridiculous bet like that?

18
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,310
Fine, I'll go to Antarctica.

19
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,530
I missed you, Dad.

20
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,990
I came to brag about something today.

21
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,990
Ta-da!

22
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,800
Look at this.

23
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,210
I told you that I'd achieve all of your dreams for you.

24
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,040
I'm having an interview today.

25
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,060
So I need your help today.

26
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,990
What am I seeing right now?

27
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,320
This is definitely the place.

28
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,100
This is the only place that meets your condition perfectly.

29
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,610
I will find out once I get up there.

30
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,090
Gosh, what's Han Joon Oh doing here...

31
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,810
This is kind of a suspicious coincidence.

32
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,350

33
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,400
 It's him.

34
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,930
 The powerful monk who defeats powerful ghosts—

35
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,180
 You're dead now—

36
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,060
 Well, is he already dead?

37
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,280
Long time no see, sir.

38
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,320
 Huh?

39
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,760
 What's this?

40
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,480
My memories are not so good these days.

41
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,810
Looks like you no longer make talismans.

42
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,010
I think there used to be a lot back there.

43
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,580
I can no longer see very well.

44
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,600
But the inventory is still there. Look around.

45
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,310
Well, then.

46
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,720
 It was not like these.

47
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,990
 You cannot hide it if it was big like these.

48
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,250
A famous shaman, my foot.

49
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,250
He didn't even recognize him. Damn it.

50
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,590
Venerable! Venerable!

51
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,940
Did you just see him? He's the one I saw at the subway station.

52
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,250
The one who used to be attached to the kid.

53
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,720
You know, a long time ago—

54
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
Did you forget?

55
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,770
We can't deal with that lost soul.

56
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,890
He was looking for the talisman.

57
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,900
If something really happens to the lady—

58
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,360
What you see isn't everything, and things exist even if they're invisible.

59
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,120
Pardon?

60
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,980
Everything happens for a reason.

61
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,750
That lady might appear kind now,

62
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,910
but she must've committed a major sin in her previous life

63
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,940
and she's paying for it now.

64
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,160
It's not something humans can stop.

65
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,850

(Crossed out "boyfriend" from "national boyfriend")

66
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,500
Yes, Team Leader.

67
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,040
 Hey, where are you, Yeong Hwa?

68
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,490
I'm on my way to the National Fire Agency for the interview right now.

69
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,990
 The interview got canceled. You don't have to go.

70
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,410
An emergency official notice was sent to our station.

71
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,650
It says, "The miraculous firefighter Kang Yeong Hwa

72
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,520
should join the filming of the public service announcement today."

73
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,260
Pardon?

74
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,850
 Head over there now.

75
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,240
Oh, okay.

76
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,330
Han Joon Oh.

77
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,540
It was suspicious when he showed up at the temple.

78
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,020
He canceled the interview now?

79
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,650
Oppa! Oh my gosh!

80
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,900
Let me take just one photo. Gosh!

81
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,120
I'm a fan!

82
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,170
You hang in there, "Oppa."

83
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,280
Oppa. Oppa.

84
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,600
Please let me take a photo.

85
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,370
 Come to your car immediately.

86
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,130
 Otherwise, I'll go to Kang Yeong Hwa.

87
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,540
 Your accomplice's name?

88
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,960
 Kang. Yeong. Hwa?

89
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,980
They definitely came this way.

90
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,110
Where did they go?

91
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,460
I caught you.

92
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,940
This is the best dashcam footage we got from the area on the day of the accident.

93
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,580
The picture quality of the park CCTV is poor.

94
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,830
So it's hard to identify people with it.

95
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,440
Do we know the details of the accident yet?

96
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,300
Well, it might not have been an accident at this point.

97
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,810
Pardon?

98
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,840
Do you mean someone tried to kill Joon Oh?

99
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,480
Huh?

100
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,580
Han Joon Oh, I know you're in here...

101
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,970
Han Joon Oh.

102
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,220
Han Joon Oh.

103
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,990
Han Joon Oh, wake up. Han Joon Oh!

104
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,090
He has a pulse.

105
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,790
What's this doing here?

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,850
 Where's Joon Oh right now?

107
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,590
 His car isn't in the parking lot.

108
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,940
How about the CCTV?

109
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,960
Did you check?

110
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,620
H-Hold on a sec.

111
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,970
This is Joon Oh's.

112
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,270

113
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,580
Kang Yeong Hwa?

114
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,830
 We've been dispatched for Han Joon Oh's kidnapping. We request assistance.

115
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,960
 Please let us know as soon as you spot the vehicle on CCTVs in the area.

116
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,830
Have you arrived yet?

117
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,050
Shall I get going, too?

118
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,070
Shit...

119
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,100
Where's Joon Oh?

120
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,700
Shit, how am I supposed to know that?

121
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,430
Where is Joon Oh?

122
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,580
Hold on, don't be like that.

123
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,300
- I don't know, I said. 
 - Come on, come on.

124
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,630
The vehicle is on our radar. We'll be able to locate it soon.

125
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,900
Sir! Sir.

126
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,500
This is Kang Yeong Hwa's backpack. I think they went missing together.

127
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,340
Open it.

128
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,290
It was next to Joon Oh's phone.

129
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,530
What's this?

130
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,310
Sir.

131
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,830
Looks like Mr. Han is pretty much with a bodyguard.

132
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,590
 I'm done.

133
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,710
 Gosh, be quiet.

134
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,280
 They're sleeping right now.

135
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,880
 Put it away.

136
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,670
 How pretty.

137
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,710
 Hey. It's right here.

138
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,700
 Did you buy soju?

139
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,160
 - Gosh, soju is— 
 - Let's be quiet. I'm trying to be creative...

140
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,330
Han Joon Oh. Han Joon Oh.

141
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,430
Just pretend to be dead even if you wake up. Okay?

142
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,330
 Not just anyone can do this. Get away.

143
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,800
 Fuck. You're not good at all.

144
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,130
When you kidnap a firefighter, you should've checked what was in my possession.

145
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,100
Shit, why isn't he calling?

146
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,640
Hey, what's up? What's up?

147
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,680
Yo! This is all we need.

148
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,400
I said clean up before you stuff yourselves!

149
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,360
Hey. Where did the woman go?

150
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,250
What?

151
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,120
Hey, where did the woman go?

152
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,730
I told you to watch them.

153
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,700
She was here just now!

154
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,870
Hi.

155
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
What's with you?

156
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,300
I'm good at rescuing people,

157
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,750
but I'm not so good at hurting them.

158
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,830
You're bluffing too much, don't you think?

159
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,820
Get her.

160
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,810
I shouldn't be doing this in uniform.

161
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,380
Hey!

162
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,880
You can't even fight a woman? Fuck!

163
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,800
Hey!

164
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,920
Okay, got it.

165
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,800
They located the car. They had already dispatched a team from a station nearby.

166
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,800
- Okay. 
- It's probably too late.

167
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,420
Geez...

168
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,380
Hey.

169
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,730
Hey, what are you doing here?

170
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,980
- Where's Han Joon Oh? 
 - How am I supposed to know that?

171
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,590
What are you talking about?

172
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,210
I definitely saw his car being taken away.

173
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,230
What are you saying?

174
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,290
You told me to bring my guys and be here by one.

175
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,860
What?

176
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,140
Where's Han Joon Oh, then?

177
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,100
Who kidnapped him?

178
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,520
You're putting on quite a show.

179
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,610
What are you doing? Take them to the station right now.

180
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,940
No, no.

181
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,800
I-I didn't kidnap him.

182
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,760
Go ahead and just kill.

183
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,440
Both of them.

184
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,960
 How about money?

185
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,580
 Hello?

186
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,010
What a rude bastard.

187
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,370
What do we do with her?

188
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,250
- He said to kill them both. 
 - What?

189
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,780
With this much money? It's not going to work.

190
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,670
Just tuck her in somewhere. Let's go.

191
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,200
Hey, hold her.

192
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,920
Hey.

193
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,510
She needs to get beaten up more.

194
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,230
To get our money's worth for the beating we took.

195
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,660
Shit!

196
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,320
What's this?

197
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,410
Where did this come from?

198
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,770
You shouldn't have messed with that woman.

199
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,640
Shit. What the hell?

200
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,540
I thought he was just a celebrity!

201
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,280
Shit.

202
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,280
Try taking one more step.

203
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,970
Don't come.

204
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,430
Don't come here!

205
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,970
Who hired you?

206
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,230
H-He just left money and left.

207
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,490
He looked like a homeless person.

208
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,680
Here's his number...

209
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,910
P-Please spare me.

210
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,060
Please spare me!

211
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,740
Do not worry.

212
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,630
I will not let you...

213
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,450
get killed by someone else in this life.

214
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,550

215
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,200
Captain!

216
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,200
What the...

217
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,600

218
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,050
 Should I say fascinating or impressive?

219
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,970
So, except for that scratch,

220
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,920
you didn't get injured at all. Is that right?

221
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,900
By the way, what happened to Han Joon Oh?

222
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,390
He definitely got kidnapped with me.

223
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,460
Well, Senior.

224
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,290
Mr. Han was found separately somewhere quite far

225
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,440
from the abandoned building you were in.

226
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,850
He's currently hospitalized, as I understand.

227
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,950
Hospitalized?

228
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,490
That's not important right now.

229
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,800
I don't think you should be worrying about him.

230
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,180
- Pardon? 
 - The kidnappers are in critical condition.

231
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,270
We can't just disregard this.

232
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,540
You have to be investigated as a suspect from now on.

233
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,970
Wait...

234
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,590
but I was kidnapped by them, too.

235
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:13,050
I don't remember very clearly right now,

236
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,060
but shouldn't it be considered self-defense?

237
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,850
But with self-defense,

238
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,190
when it exceeds a reasonable degree,

239
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,450
we call it excessive self-defense.

240
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,240
You're perfectly fine, you know.

241
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,510
But the kidnappers are in the hospital right now.

242
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,700
- Well, that's... 
 - You have to come in for investigation for a while.

243
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,690
 Firefighter Kang, who was also found at the scene two days ago

244
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,020
 is being investigated for excessive self-defense...

245
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,600
Don't worry about Ms. Kang.

246
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,300
- I'll make sure to clear up her reputation. 
 - Isn't being alive...

247
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,910
more important than reputation?

248
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,980
- What are you talking about? 
 - Someone tried to kill me.

249
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,270
Twice, even.

250
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,700
Do you remember what happened at the Han River?

251
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,600
 Noona. Noona. Noona.

252
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,400
 Noona.

253
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,760
We should find the one who's trying to have me killed first.

254
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,900
The police are investigating.

255
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,470
- You just recover somewhere safe— 
 - Didn't this incident prove that...

256
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,420
I'm the safest next to Kang Yeong Hwa?

257
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,510
Did you get investigated again?

258
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,600
- Yes. 
 - Give it to me.

259
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,970
Gosh.

260
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,060
Come on.

261
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,950
Give it to me. I'll do it.

262
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,790
Not in that condition.

263
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,890
How about the wound on your neck? Is it okay?

264
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,940
It's better now.

265
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,000
When did this happen, anyway?

266
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,500
You still can't remember?

267
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,810
If I catch them, I'll whack them like this—

268
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,690
What if there's more of this?

269
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
W-What are you talking about? Did you get hurt somewhere else?

270
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
I mean...

271
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,010
what if I do not remember it?

272
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,640
Maybe I did all that, but I just don't remember—

273
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,450
Geez.

274
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,750
How could you beat that many people up and not remember?

275
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,510
I almost killed someone.

276
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,000
Whatever.

277
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,290
I want to take a deep bow for letting you go safely.

278
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,200
How could people be like this?

279
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,900
How could they be suspicious of the victim?

280
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,780

281
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,520

282
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,390

283
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,240

284
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,250
I even made up a story about my first love.

285
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,050
But he did not just go after Han Joon Oh.

286
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,120
Why Kang Yeong Hwa, too?

287
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,400
 Take revenge.

288
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,400
 Kill.

289
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,540
 Kill them all.

290
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,870
 - Just kill.  
 - Stop!

291
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,330
Please, that's enough!

292
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,610
Go away! Go away, I said!

293
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,980
 The netizens are looking forward to it.

294
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,300
 Here's the next story.

295
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,620
 Actor Han Joon Oh, who's been making the fans worry with continuous incidents,

296
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,900
 is delivering good news by starting a new project.

297
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,840
 He did the first table read for a drama, "Nakrang, the Romance."

298
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,370
 "Nakrang, the Romance" is based on the tragic tale of Princess Nakrang and Prince Hodong...

299
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,820
Long time no see.

300
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,240
Do Ha.

301
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,230
 It is a romance genre and it is the first starring role for...

302
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,280
What beautiful hands.

303
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,750
What? Did you have another nightmare?

304
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,260
This is no good. You should skip work today.

305
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,800
What time is it?

306
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,590
The disciplinary committee meeting is today—

307
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,210
Come on. Can't you just skip it?

308
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,740
What are you saying? I can't skip the disciplinary committee meeting—

309
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,650
You're driving me crazy.

310
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,560
I couldn't sleep at all last night because of this.

311
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,730
You'll get into big trouble if you go there.

312
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,640
 Expel! Expel! Expel the violent firefighter!

313
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
 Expel! Expel!

314
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,960
 Assault can't be tolerated. Expel the violent firefighter!

315
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,680
 Expel! Expel!

316
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,870
What are they talking about?

317
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,420
 We can't forgive!

318
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,020
Expel! Expel!

319
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,940
 Expel! Expel!

320
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,650

Expel! Expel!

321
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,650
Let's turn the lights on.

322
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,020
Before we discuss the excessive self-defense case,

323
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,770
we'll first determine the authenticity of the video of

324
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,780
you assaulting the honorary firefighter, Han Joon Oh.

325
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,990
Do you agree?

326
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,720
Yes.

327
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,060
Are you the person in the video, Ms. Kang?

328
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,690
It's different from what actually happened.

329
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,360
There was CPR training that day, and—

330
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,100
Just answer yes or no.

331
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,080
Yes, that is me.

332
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,670
Is it true that you assaulted Mr. Han,

333
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,130
took his phone, and threw it?

334
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,380
- It's not that— 
 - Yes or no.

335
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,150
Yes. It's true.

336
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,820
 Expel! Expel!

337
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,120
 Assault can't be tolerated. Expel the violent firefighter!

338
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,940
 Expel! Expel!

339
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,470
 Everyone...

340
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,580
 Apologize for bringing dishonor to the firefighters...

341
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,290
He's not at home right now.

342
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,070
I know he's in there.

343
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,730
Unconscious, my foot.

344
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,550
I knew it was a lie.

345
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,380
What do you think? Wasn't it edited well?

346
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,390
I made my manager do it.

347
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,260
I made him take a video of you after I dumped you.

348
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,140
But I guess he forgot about it.

349
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,280
He said the firefighter looked familiar and whatnot—

350
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,970
Get out.

351
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:49,250
By the way, I guess your pretty head is just a decoration.

352
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,830
You should ask me.

353
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,110
Why do I have to?

354
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,200
I'm warning you.

355
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,790
I'll release the entire footage if you don't leave my drama.

356
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,730
That'd ruin you.

357
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,410
Ruin?

358
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,860
I have no choice, then.

359
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,840
We need to be ruined together.

360
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,200
What?

361
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,790
"What an idiot. Why don't you understand me?"

362
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,990
 What an idiot. Why don't you understand me?

363
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,780
 Do you think the rehearsal was the only thing I did with Goo Tae Joo...

364
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,350
 Noona.

365
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,550
 What's wrong with you? Don't be like that.

366
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,700
 T-This...

367
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,890
 might be my last time. Okay? So—

368
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,440
 Stop being so clingy.

369
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,200
 You're grossing me out.

370
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,820
"I mean, stop being so clingy and get lost."

371
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,010
"You're grossing me out."

372
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,420

373
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,490

Was Han Joon Oh this powerful?

374
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,180
What happens to her going to Antarctica, then?

375
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,810
It means I'll never get to go.

376
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,080
Aren't you angry, Senior?

377
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,700
It was all self-defense.

378
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,750
I'm angry.

379
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,500
I don't know why things like this keep happening to me. It's so unfair.

380
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,460
Ask Han Joon Oh for help, then. Tell him to speak the truth.

381
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,550
 Fire dispatch. Fire dispatch. An accident in progress.

382
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,100

383
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,580

384
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,140

385
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,170
 I'd appreciate it if you could text me when you can talk.

386
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,050
 I'd like to interview you regarding the rumor on the internet regarding Han Joon Oh.

387
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,780
 Please make sure to call me when you're available.

388
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,780

389
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,980
 Are you really not going to sue Kang Yeong Hwa?

390
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,820
All the racketeers who woke up said it was Mr. Han.

391
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,860
Even if we silence them with money, they might—

392
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,400
Do you believe what those bastards said?

393
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,360
Of course not. There's no way Mr. Han did that, but—

394
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,400
All they want is money.

395
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,420
I told them who they can get the most money out of.

396
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,580
There's no way they'd give up on that themselves.

397
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,900
But wouldn't it be good to make sure?

398
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,980
Since the assault video came out, we might as well keep blaming Ms. Kang—

399
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,350
Well, I just...

400
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,540
You saw the video.

401
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,910
It bothers me that he keeps getting involved with women like that—

402
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,660
What if that's what he wants?

403
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,190
Pardon?

404
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,760
 Ms. Kang Yeong Hwa is a firefighter. It makes no sense to hire her as a security guard.

405
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,290
 Did it make sense for me to take Goo Tae Joo's spot?

406
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,280
 Han Min Oh is always on Han Joon Oh's side.

407
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,330
 That was my understanding.

408
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,930
 I'll do whatever it takes for you.

409
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,110
 But this is different, Joon Oh.

410
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:13,540
 A security guard's job is to protect someone.

411
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,500
 - We can't just force someone. 
 - I think you are mistaken.

412
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,700
 - I am not asking for permission. 
 - Joon Oh.

413
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,300
 Will you still be against it even if it were my last wish?

414
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,230
 I do not have a lot of time left...

415
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,000
 Brother...

416
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,580

417
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,000
Wow, what if...

418
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,880
I get involved in this, too?

419
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,670
 Leave? Where to?

420
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,950
 Back to where I was.

421
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,380
 I came back so I could leave.

422
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,510
Yes, he said he'd leave.

423
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:29,490
I might as well help him and make him leave. Okay.

424
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,560
For now, I should put this shirt in the back...

425
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Excuse me.

426
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,320
Hello. Huh?

427
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,720
Hello.

428
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,360
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

429
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,220
This is Mr. Han Joon Oh's house. Right?

430
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,500
Yes.

431
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,800
It is. W-What's this about?

432
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:05,680
Hey, these are the police officers who are investigating the case.

433
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,950
Hello. My daughter is a fan.

434
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,630
Goodness, I-I surprised you, didn't I?

435
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:24,270
I'll just ask you one thing and be gone.

436
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,520
Officer Moon.

437
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,000
Do you recognize this person?

438
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,160
He was photographed near the racketeers' office.

439
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,590
He showed up again somewhere unexpected.

440
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,230

441
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,880
By the way, can you reach Ms. Kang Yeong Hwa?

442
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,350
I heard she got suspended. I can't reach her.

443
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,600
- Where are you going now? 
  - The phone is powered off. You'll be connected...

444
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,720
- People can't see you, I said. 
  - There will be an additional charge.

445
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,050
I cannot reach Kang Yeong Hwa.

446
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,500
I need to make sure she is okay.

447
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,590
Here. How about this thing?

448
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,700
Get in right now.

449
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,600
Wait...

450
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,720
We need to take care of that first.

451
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,150
Kang Yeong Hwa?

452
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,710
 I'll take care of things. Just let me.

453
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,560
Where's Han Joon Oh?

454
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,280
I thought he was in a coma and in critical condition...

455
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,400
Was it all a lie?

456
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,720
Yes, it was a lie.

457
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,780
But why...

458
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,230
- Why exactly? 
 - Joon Oh doesn't have...

459
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,330
a lot of time left.

460
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,610
What do you mean by that?

461
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,570
After the accident at the Han River,

462
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,080
I first heard that Joon Oh was terminally ill.

463
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,690
If it weren't for you,

464
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,550
I would've lost him without being able to...

465
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,020
prepare to say goodbye.

466
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,450
I wouldn't have known someone was trying to kill him, either.

467
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,850
I heard they call you the miraculous firefighter.

468
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:46,380
Joon Oh miraculously survived every time he almost died.

469
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,260
I'll believe that it wasn't a coincidence...

470
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,200
from now on.

471
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,640
I mean it.

472
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,770
Please let me help you.

473
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,230
I'll exonerate you from the case

474
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:05,030
so you can return to your job as a firefighter.

475
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,440
Instead, please...

476
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,050
please be by Joon Oh's side...

477
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,160
for just a month.

478
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,740
That's all you need to do.

479
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,910
I know I'm being shameless, but I beg you.

480
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,400
 You are the only one who can help me recover.

481
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,900
 If you say no, I will lose that chance.

482
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,320
Han Joon Oh.

483
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,990
Where is he right now?

484
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,520
Excuse me.

485
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,710
I will go inside alone.

486
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,340
Okay.

487
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,700
Thank you for driving me here.

488
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,400
Han Joon Oh.

489
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,370
Han Joon Oh.

490
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,560
Han Joon Oh.

491
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,860
You heard from CEO Han. Right?

492
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,510
Han Joon Oh.

493
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,580
Did I...

494
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,770
win the bet?

495
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,910
Didn't you hear me calling you?

496
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,980
Why didn't you answer? You made me worry.

497
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,870
You didn't answer my call, either.

498
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,700
Why?

499
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,060
Did you want me to worry?

500
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,680
Why would you worry about me?

501
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,220
You shouldn't be worrying about someone right now...

502
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,740
I heard you only have a month left.

503
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,970
Is it true?

504
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,590
I'm certain that's the case.

505
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,000
Is it also true that someone's trying to kill you?

506
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,880
Right.

507
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,930
Couldn't you just live well?

508
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:40,990
If you do this, what happens to me who saved your life?

509
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,770
Don't worry about me.

510
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,980
I can't die.

511
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,570
What?

512
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,920
As long as you're by my side,

513
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,680
I can't leave this place.

514
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,250
Does it mean that I have to be by your side forever?

515
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,390
Because you'll never die even though you're terminally ill?

516
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,000
No.

517
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,870
One month.

518
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,060
I just need one month.

519
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,840
Because anything longer would be impossible.

520
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,240
So...

521
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,920
I want you to help me...

522
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,690
leave safely.

523
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,070
What am I supposed to do?

524
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,090
You just need to stay by my side.

525
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,730
So nothing can interrupt me.

526
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,460
Only for a brief time...

527
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,810
that I have left in this life.

528
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,700
 I know.

529
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,200
 - It'd be just for a month. 
 - Just for a month.

530
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,500
 Will I be able to protect you?

531
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,110
 I have to...

532
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,330
 kill you.

533
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,230
 [Contract for bodyguard position[

534
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:29,140

535
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:34,010

536
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,260
Actually, I thought you'd say no.

537
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,030
I need to reveal the truth about the video to get reinstated

538
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,760
and prove that I'm not guilty of excessive self-defense, either.

539
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,850
Just keep your promise of vindicating me.

540
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:59,180
Everything will be done according to the contract.

541
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,270
You will be compensated, of course.

542
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,800
I can't receive money as it says in the contract.

543
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,460
I'm still a firefighter, even though I was suspended.

544
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,060
No.

545
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,450
I'll find another way to compensate you somehow.

546
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,250
I just need to get reinstated.

547
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,630
That'd be the best compensation.

548
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,700
Gosh, stop looking at me.

549
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,570
I feel awkward enough already.

550
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,100
Put a lot on. It might take hours.

551
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,700
Why? Move. Wouldn't it take three or four hours at most?

552
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,050
Hey, Han Joon Oh's dyslexic.

553
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,780
Did it take eight hours last time?

554
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,810
There's video evidence of that.

555
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,580
 When I...

556
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,710
 When I...

557
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:06,430
 look at your dog-like face,

558
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,690
 it makes me...

559
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,920
 it makes me smile...

560
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,650
Did he say "dog-like face" instead of "rainbow-like face?"

561
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:16,920
Yes.

562
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,620
What a creative interpretation.

563
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,150
Seriously. Isn't he so cute?

564
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,970
His face and body are out of this world,

565
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:27,420
but he's such an idiot but charming.

566
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,110
- Gosh. 
 - I love dogs. I love dogs.

567
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:35,060
So, Han Joon Oh is popular because

568
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,740
he's an idiot?

569
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,610
Say hello.

570
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,210
Say hello.

571
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,120

572
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,570
Don't just look at them. Say hello first—

573
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,750
Where's Kang Yeong Hwa?

574
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,080
She's still in the restroom...

575
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,870
And bodyguards are supposed to wait outside—

576
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,300
There's no reason for me to be here, then.

577
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,050
What? What are you doing? Gosh, okay.

578
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,680
Okay, okay.

579
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,000
By the way, did you have a look at the script even once?

580
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,390
Did you think I'd read this, by chance?

581
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,640
I see him on the news more often these days.

582
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,350
Can he pull off something so challenging?

583
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,370
He has to do it because it's challenging.

584
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,550
Han Joon Oh won't do something that's easy.

585
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,120
You're confident, considering you're here to get back the role he almost lost.

586
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,710
Thanks to that confidence, you got more investment

587
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,270
and signed with a streaming service, too.

588
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,900
Do you want to cancel the contract now?

589
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,620
Yes, Director Kim. He isn't entirely wrong.

590
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,910
I'm the director and am against it.

591
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,170
Why are the higher-ups forcing this?

592
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,590

593
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,690
Geez.

594
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,310
 Director Kim is in a bad mood.

595
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,630
 I don't think the table read will be easy today.

596
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,230
Oh, Yeong Hwa.

597
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,810
Yes.

598
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,370
Mr. Jang is busy with something.

599
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,240
He asked me to film the table reading instead.

600
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,700
I told him that I can't.

601
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,570
What?

602
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:47,110
What are you doing here, then?

603
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,360
To see you.

604
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,300
This is him being charmingly stupid.

605
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,680
You ended up coming.

606
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,940
How brave.

607
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,690
- Why does she look familiar? 
 - Let's leave now.

608
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,510
You can't leave now.

609
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:12,340
So, what time will you let us leave today, Joon Oh?

610
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,480
At 10:00?

611
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,590
11:00?

612
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,420
I'm so sick of it.

613
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:31,790
You said that no obstacle could stop you.

614
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,410
Prove to them who you are.

615
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,680
 I hope you get humiliated.

616
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,170
 You should've listened when I warned you.

617
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,610
 I hope you're ready, Joon Oh.

618
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,720
 Did I fall into the trap...

619
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,400
 that I created?

620
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,550
 (Fighting!)

621
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:16,500
Gosh, he had to end up with a mean director.

622
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,060
Gosh, he's screwed. He's screwed. He's screwed.

623
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,800
Why stand in the way? Move.

624
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,340
Goodness, Director Kim. Hello.

625
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,250
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

626
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,030
Hello, Director Kim.

627
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,370
Yes.

628
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,630
Our drama tells the story of Prince Hodong and Princess Nakrang

629
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,810
from the oldest prince's point of view. It's an epic fiction based on a true story.

630
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:47,370
Mr. Han Joon Oh is playing the protagonist, Prince Hae Woo—

631
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:49,030
Stop.

632
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,110
So, Joon Oh...

633
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:56,410
This is your first historical drama. Aren't you nervous?

634
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,180
Don't feel pressured.

635
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,650
We already practiced with Tae Joo.

636
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,000
You won't be able to catch up, anyway.

637
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,120
The table reading is just for formality. Let's just read today.

638
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,300
Just focus on pronunciation and try to tell the story.

639
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,930
Not overly emotional. Take it easy.

640
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:16,430
Okay, let's go.

641
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,790
The ministers are in the crown prince's palace and

642
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,750
they are prostrating in front of Prince Hodong and Prince Haewoo.

643
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,820
The ministers are raising their voices at Prince Haewoo.

644
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:30,230
 Your Highness, please listen to our plea.

645
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:35,620
Nakrang Kingdom is like our brother, Your Highness.

646
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,990
How could the crown prince volunteer to become a spy?

647
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,160
That is absurd, Your Highness.

648
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,680
That is enough already.

649
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:06,410
Are you telling me I cannot follow the king's order if you do not allow it?

650
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,490
You disobeyed the king's order, and yet...

651
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:15,330
you expect to save yourselves?

652
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,650
Prince Hodong, your line.

653
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,180
Okay.

654
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,720
How could you plot against Princess Nakrang?

655
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,010
How could the nation's crown prince use a trick like that—

656
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,630
Did you say, "a trick"?

657
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:41,190
Tell me, then.

658
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:44,540
How can we destroy Jamyunggo

659
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,630
and how can we take our land back from them?

660
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,570
How could you be so weak...

661
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,100
and become a king of a nation?

662
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,340
Hodong, your line.

663
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,610
You are the crown prince, not me.

664
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,470
- And I'm a child of a concubine. How could I— 
 - The king...

665
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,010
is determined by the heavens.

666
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,400
The people of the nation are the heavens...

667
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,190
and the heavens do not love me,

668
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,440
but you, my brother Hodong.

669
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,570
Believe in me.

670
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,770
I will make sure you become...

671
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,200
the king of this nation.

672
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,500
Good work, Joon Oh.

673
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,210
Yeong Hwa, you did a lot on your first day, too.

674
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,410
Not at all. I didn't do anything.

675
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:10,840
That's enough already.

676
00:52:12,854 --> 00:52:15,080
You did a great job today.

677
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,550
I was worried that you suddenly changed the way you talk.

678
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,060
Hey, Han Joon Oh!

679
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,280
How much did you practice?

680
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,050
Look. The sun is still up after the table read ended.

681
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,270
Did you see people's faces?

682
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,070
What did I do?

683
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,450
I'm sorry.

684
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,210
I-I'm sorry, Joon Oh.

685
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,100
Your clothes are in the car.

686
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,240
Should I bring him his clothes?

687
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,710
Well, would you do that?

688
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:48,270
Thank you, Ms. Kang.

689
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:51,060
Thank you. Yes.

690
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,930
Joon Oh.

691
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,690
When did you practice so much?

692
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,780
I thought you were straight out of the Three Kingdoms Era.

693
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,210
CEO Han, seriously.

694
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,850
You should've told me.

695
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:07,020
I would've cast him from the beginning if I knew he was gifted in historical drama.

696
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,000
Goo Tae Joo caused so much trouble—

697
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,350
We're in your care from now on—

698
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,500
I thought he had dyslexia. I thought he was in shock.

699
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,480
Did he really recover because of me?

700
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,280
What happened earlier? Huh?

701
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,370
What's with the mood?

702
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:55,100
You heard. Joon Oh knocked it out of the park.

703
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,820
How does that make sense? He's known for being a bad actor.

704
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,600
I was shocked, too.

705
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,630
Gosh, something's strange.

706
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,710
There's definitely something going on.

707
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,680
Seriously...

708
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,350
By the way, what are you doing here?

709
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,240
Weren't you in a holding cell?

710
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,910
I was able to prove my alibi.

711
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:20,670
How many times do I have to say I didn't do it?

712
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:24,470
Who cares? You're really done for.

713
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,270
What?

714
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:28,020
Actor Goo Tae Joo is over.

715
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,090
Don't be insecure. You're nowhere near his level.

716
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,480
Hey.

717
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:39,090
Jeong Yi Seul.

718
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,850
Hey!

719
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:54,180
- CEO Seok? 
 - Good to see you, Mr. Goo.

720
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,040
I've been wanting to meet you so badly.

721
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,690
Me?

722
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:04,410
Yes, it has been a while.

723
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:12,030
Everything would have gone back to normal if he weren't around.

724
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,610
Pardon?

725
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,620
Gosh, why won't you let go?

726
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,640
Is Kang Yeong Hwa not back yet?

727
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,910
I haven't seen her since she left.

728
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,130
You haven't found her yet?

729
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,860
What are you doing there?

730
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,840
This is that shirt, isn't it?

731
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,490
You were wearing it when we got kidnapped.

732
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,860
It's not mine.

733
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:26,020
Ask Mr. Jang.

734
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:34,290
Have you heard of close-range spatter?

735
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:37,760
It's a blood spatter pattern from close range.

736
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,520
I saw tons of stuff like this at accident scenes.

737
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,460
But why do you have this on your shirt?

738
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,020
How are you certain?

739
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,560
The DNA test will prove everything.

740
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,870
What are you doing?

741
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,420
 That bracelet.

742
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,920
 Kang Yeong Hwa, why did you do that?

743
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,330
 I told you to never take it off.

744
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:18,610
 The kids make fun of me for wearing a weird necklace.

745
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,860
 I hate it. I don't want it.

746
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,590
 He found it then.

747
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:34,150
 He found a way to make her wear it all the time.

748
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:37,260
 As long as I get rid of it,

749
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,650
 everything will be over.

750
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,980
Han Joon Oh.

751
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,750
As long as you're gone...

752
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,430
As long as you disappear...

753
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,530
Han Joon Oh! Move!

754
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,740
 I said...

755
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:19,760
 I will never let her get killed by someone else.

756
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,925
 Kang Yeong Hwa.

757
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:26,355
 I have to kill you with my own hands.

758
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,350
 It is time to wake up now.

759
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,790
 What?

760
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:40,720
 Did I not die?

761
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,020
Your wound should not be too severe.

762
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,930
I made sure...

763
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,580
 Han Joon Oh?

764
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,920
...to avoid the vital point.

765
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,720
I will kill you no matter what!

766
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,760
 What's all this?

767
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,670
 What situation is this?

768
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:28,390
Kang Yeong Hwa.

769
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,530
Kang Yeong Hwa.

770
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,560
Kang Yeong Hwa, wake up.

771
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,400
Kang Yeong Hwa!

772
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:53,020

773
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:07,760
♫  The bright day has gone  ♫

774
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:14,780
♫  and I'm stuck under the dark sky  ♫

775
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:21,580
♫  Through a lonely flower petal that's blowing in the wind  ♫

776
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:26,800
♫  I'm conveying my desperate heart  ♫

777
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,580
♫  Since I met you again  ♫

778
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:32,380

779
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,600
 You need to know how to shoot an arrow to kill me with one.

780
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,210
 Find out about that girl.

781
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:51,820
 I guess I returned from the dream.

782
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,210
 Goo Tae Joo met with whom?

783
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:57,180
 They don't remember when they are reborn.

784
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,170
 Sir.
