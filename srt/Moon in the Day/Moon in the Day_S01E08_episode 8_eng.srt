1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:10,820

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,510

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,390

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,230

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,530

6
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,110

7
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,050

8
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,700

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,290
 So this is in the year 1701, when Han Ri Ta was reincarnated for the 11th time.

10
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,580
 In other words, it was in the 27th year of King Sukjong's reign.

11
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,880
Listen, Royal Consort Huibin Jang.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,140
You slandered Queen Inhyeon using evil tricks

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,860
and committed a grave sin as the mother of the crown prince.

14
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,310
Therefore, His Majesty ordered you to take this poison and

15
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,440
vanish your evil spirit immediately.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,950
How dare you? Do you think you will survive after doing this?

17
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,000
Bring His Majesty here immediately.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,580
I will see him in person and tell him how unfair this is.

19
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,880
What are you all doing?

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,300
- Hold her and make her follow the king's order. 
 - Let go!

21
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,170
Let go! How dare you?

22
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,250
You wenches!

23
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,130
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

24
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,450
Does it mean in my previous life, I was

25
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,650
Royal Consort Huibin Jang?

26
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,790
 No, but actually...

27
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,790
 I was one of the court ladies who delivered the poison?

28
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,080

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,230
Why are you disappointed?

30
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,420
Not that I'm disappointed...

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,990
Out of my 18 previous lives,

32
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,920
I was never someone who made history. It's kind of boring.

33
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,050
I didn't know you cared...

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,420
so much about your previous lives.

35
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,020
It's normal to have this much curiosity.

36
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,440
Not only that, a witness of history is in front of me.

37
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,080
Since we're on the topic, have you...

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,480
seen Queen Seokdeok in person?

39
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,530
- Who? 
 - Queen Seokdeok and Mi Shil. Don't you know?

40
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,300
Wow, that drama was a masterpiece.

41
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,350
King Jinheung ruled Silla when I was alive.

42
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,790
A lot of TV dramas are inaccurate.

43
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,250
Did you know anyone more famous?

44
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,420
You said you were in this world for 1,500 years.

45
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,190
How come it's all so boring?

46
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,950
Kang Yeong Hwa.

47
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,130
Do you...

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,270
remember what you had for dinner a week ago?

49
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,480
No.

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,940
I can barely remember the dinner last night.

51
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,920
That's how I feel about the past 1,500 years.

52
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,100
They were just mundane days that passed by me.

53
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,570
I don't remember every little thing that happened.

54
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,590

55
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,520
By the way,

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,270
what you said is a bit contradictory.

57
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,240
Contradictory?

58
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,210
You said you don't remember everything about the past.

59
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,530
How do you remember when my parents passed, then?

60
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,140
In your mundane days in the past,

61
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,310
was I a bit special?

62
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,680
Well...

63
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,390
I'm thankful that you'd dream about Han Ri Ta and me.

64
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,820
But I'm not exactly free right now.

65
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,790
Instead of saying silly things, get some sleep

66
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,450
and try to dream a bit.

67
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,550
You think I automatically dream about my past life if I sleep?

68
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,660
And it's still early in the evening.

69
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,550
Just answer my question.

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,720
I'll really ask you one last question, then.

71
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,640
What is it now?

72
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,420
May 5th, 2001. The day before the Children's Day.

73
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,540
Do you remember that day?

74
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,590
I was in second grade, and it was the sports day.

75
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,460
My dad already passed away then.

76
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,010
And Mom had to work that day, so I was left all alone.

77
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,340
I was amazed how you wouldn't stop crying.

78
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,040
You really remember everything.

79
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,820
Why are you smiling?

80
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,650
I just feel...

81
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,400
grateful.

82
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,800
Thinking you were there in every moment of my life

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,510
makes me feel a little less lonely.

84
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,350
Geez.

85
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,290
You freaked out calling me a stalker before.

86
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,590
Thinking about it now,

87
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,740
it feels like you were my old guardian angel.

88
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,240
In modern terms, you're like my Daddy Long Legs

89
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,050
or Genie in the Bottle, maybe?

90
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,810
Is that why?

91
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,610
You strangely feel familiar to me.

92
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,600
Anyway, I satisfied my curiosity. Let's go.

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,650
I'll go home early, go to bed early,

94
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,210
and dream no matter what. So don't worry.

95
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,740
Let's go.

96
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,760
What are you doing? Come.

97
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,820
 Joon Oh.

98
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,970
 Where's Joon Oh?

99
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
 Joon Oh!

100
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,520
 Joon Oh...

101
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,900
 You're Joon Oh, right?

102
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,930
 Brother.

103
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,790
 Help me.

104
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,560
 Joon Oh.

105
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,710
What the heck...

106
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,960
- What's going on? 
 - Well...

107
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,980
Here's the new commercial contract for Han Joon Oh.

108
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,890
I've checked the legality of it.

109
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,420
I'll move forward once you finalize it.

110
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,580
Sir?

111
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:07,120
Pause all of Joon Oh's schedule from now on for now.

112
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,060
Oh, why all of a sudden?

113
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,630
I don't mind paying all the penalties.

114
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,540
So go ahead and do that.

115
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,620
All right.

116
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,120
And CEO Seok Cheol Hwan's phone number.

117
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,250
You have it, right?

118
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,660
 Thinking about it now,

119
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,110
 it feels like you're my old guardian angel.

120
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,600
 Is that why?

121
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,300
 You strangely feel familiar to me.

122
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,900
 It made me feel bad.

123
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,580
 What would it have been like

124
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,640
 if you and Han Ri Ta met at a different time and situation?

125
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,650

126
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,260

127
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,810
W-What's wrong? Did you have a scary dream again?

128
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,620
I unexpectedly slept so well.

129
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,200
What did you say?

130
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,860
I slept too well without having a dream.

131
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,640
I've been dreaming whenever I close my eyes lately.

132
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,300
It's not like I've been dreaming every day.

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,360
I suppose I wasn't supposed to dream last night.

134
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,610
I think people go a bit crazy when they're in love.

135
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,500
What are you saying?

136
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,960
You acted like you'd never see him again, but you're working there again.

137
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,130
What happened between you two exactly?

138
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,350
Unni,

139
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,390
do you believe in past lives by chance?

140
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,470
Why do you ask?

141
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,800
Do you think you and Han Joon Oh have been in love since your past lives?

142
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,480
What?

143
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,170
Well, so what I'm saying is...

144
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,620
They say you sometimes dream about your past lives.

145
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,800
Do you want to hear something funny?

146
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,170
Whenever people experience their past lives,

147
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,610
they all say they were princesses or princes.

148
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,710
How could they all be royals in this tiny country?

149
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,300
I never said I was a princess.

150
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,950
I was the daughter of the great general of Gaya, but—

151
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,440
That's what I mean.

152
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,250
If everyone was a royal or aristocrat,

153
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,400
who did all the farming?

154
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,480
I talked so confidently yesterday. If I told him I didn't dream at all,

155
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,710
I'm sure he'd say something.

156
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,870
Excuse me.

157
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,040
I'm here.

158
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,420
Is he still sleeping?

159
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,470
Looks like you just got out of the shower.

160
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,710
- Get back to it. 
 - Did you have a dream?

161
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,780
I told you to finish taking a shower.

162
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,040
Let's talk over the morning coffee.

163
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,950
What a nice day.

164
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,140
 What's the deal? He looks like he'd kill me if I said I didn't dream.

165
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,560
Tell me now if you're done drinking.

166
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,570
About your dream last night.

167
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,370
I just took a sip.

168
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,450
By the way, can I ask you something?

169
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,380
Do you still have questions left?

170
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,480
This is a question about you.

171
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,690
Why are you in such a rush?

172
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,860
What?

173
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,870
Let's be honest.

174
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,050
Who cares if it's been 1,501 years or 1,500 years and six months?

175
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,990
I'll dream about it, anyway. You can just wait.

176
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,720
Do you want to leave this world so quickly?

177
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,790
I'm doing this for you, not me.

178
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,710
For me?

179
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,670
What do you mean by that?

180
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:57,610
 Kang Yeong Hwa, you have no clue about your own fate.

181
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,400
Because I'm a soul, who's attached to you.

182
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,530
I'm trying to break the curse as soon as possible and leave you alone.

183
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,530
You can't be completely happy about this situation, either.

184
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,820
Well, I'm not, but—

185
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,660
Tell me about your dream if that answers your question.

186
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,050
How much did you see?

187
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,950
Well...

188
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,120
In my dream,

189
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,250
you and Han Ri Ta...

190
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,730
had to run away.

191
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,220
And you got caught...

192
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,970
and you were forced to get married, but...

193
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,900
that's when—

194
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,170
Hey, Han Joon Oh!

195
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,450
H-Hold on, Ms. Jeong.

196
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,330
You can't just barge into someone's property—

197
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,650
Get out of my way.

198
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,010
You happened to be together.

199
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,670
You're making me even angrier.

200
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,980
What's all this fuss so early in the day?

201
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,950
You're the one who caused the fuss.

202
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,040
What's all this?

203
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,310
What do you mean?

204
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,120
Han Joon Oh announced that he's dating Jeong Yi Seul officially,

205
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,930
but he's actually having an affair with a non-celebrity, and this is the evidence.

206
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,900
What are you talking about?

207
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,900
I suppose Fact Catch sent these photos to confirm before publishing the article.

208
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,830
I explained that you're not just anyone but his bodyguard.

209
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,520
But they're saying you live together... or you're pregnant.

210
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,730
They're making up all sorts of stories.

211
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,630
Gosh, nonsense...

212
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,260
I'll go tell them it's not true.

213
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,670
Go ahead, then.

214
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,070
They've been undercover in front of Joon Oh's house for a month to get evidence.

215
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,120
See if they listen to you at all.

216
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,620
Han Joon Oh, why don't you say something?

217
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,200
What will you do about this?

218
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,480
It's best to ignore the false rumors. Don't worry.

219
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,400
These articles will hurt me more than anyone.

220
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,500
People will mock me for letting a nobody steal my man.

221
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,020
Don't you care about how this would hurt me?

222
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,570
Let her out of here now.

223
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,520
I need to talk to Ms. Kang urgently.

224
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,900
Hey, will you keep acting like this?

225
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,800
If you keep this up, I can't just sit still. Got that?

226
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,980
What if you don't sit still?

227
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,020
Your bodyguard.

228
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,330
I need to label her as an evil bitch who stole my man.

229
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,790
You know what I can do.

230
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,080
You're going too far.

231
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,070
Are you threatening us right now?

232
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,010
Yes, I am.

233
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,490
Joon Oh and I have about 300,000 fans altogether.

234
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,820
Try getting attacked by them.

235
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,720
Oh, have you already been attacked?

236
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,340
Remember the crowd in front of the fire station?

237
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,090
It'll be on another level compared to that.

238
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,840
Try guarding yourself.

239
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,520
Hold on.

240
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,930
What? You were acting like a mere spectator.

241
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,900
Can't stand her getting hurt?

242
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,540
Be clear about what you want.

243
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,410
What do you want me to do?

244
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,610
Your hands got so dry.

245
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,080
Cut.

246
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,430
Let's check the photos quickly.

247
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,520
- I look good, right? 
 - Unni.

248
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,820
You look better from this angle.

249
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,510
Try turning your head this way...

250
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,990
I think this would be good.

251
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,380
You heard that, right? You'll have to come closer to me.

252
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,890
So, I get photographed from this angle.

253
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,580
Let's move on to the next pose.

254
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,180
Let's get ready.

255
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,210
Ready, action.

256
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,020
Smile. Otherwise, we'll do another shoot tomorrow.

257
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,050
Is it always like this?

258
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,770
You can say most paparazzi shots are staged.

259
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,800
They usually negotiate this way.

260
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,900
But they agreed to delete your photos. It's a relief.

261
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,090
The people from Fact Catch know

262
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,670
that a love story between two top celebrities

263
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,680
sells better than one that involves Han Joon Oh and a non-celebrity.

264
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,430
They seem satisfied with the final product.

265
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,530
Gosh. She's so unbelievably rude. Arrogant, too.

266
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,230
But she's the biggest actress in Korea.

267
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,060
She seems unparalleled when it comes to looks.

268
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,900
Why does that matter right now?

269
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:29,520
I'm just saying you and Jeong Yi Seul make such a nice-looking couple appearance-wise.

270
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,650
She doesn't compare to a non-celebrity like me.

271
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,170
I don't agree with you.

272
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,300
Do ghosts not have eyes?

273
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,300
In all of Seorabeol and Gaya,

274
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,900
Han Ri Ta's beauty was acknowledged by everyone.

275
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
And...

276
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,610
out of countless reincarnations of hers,

277
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,070
you're the only one who looks the same as her.

278
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,890

279
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,050
 Chief! Chief!

280
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,130
Chief! I found him.

281
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,010
The man from the broadcasting station's CCTV footage.

282
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,290
I looked up the criminal records of everyone around Han Joon Oh, just in case.

283
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,430
It's this man, right?

284
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,970
Right. Seok Cheol Hwan.

285
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,340
Embezzlement, fraud, gambling, and drug trafficking.

286
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,700
Wow, this bastard is a total villain.

287
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,610
- No need to look further. I'll locate him and— 
 - Hold on.

288
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,650
Yes, this is Lieutenant Yoon Hoon Sik...

289
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,680
Who... Who was found dead?

290
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,140

I'll already be dead by the time this letter reaches you.

291
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,470
 Thanks to you, I was sentenced to death by the world.

292
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,160
 It's so unfair.

293
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,290
 I ended up this way all because of Han Joon Oh and Han Min Oh.

294
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,010
Sir, did you see the news?

295
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,310
I'm aware of it.

296
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,920
 See you in hell, Han Min Oh.

297
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,620
You heard how hard I worked today because of Joon Oh. Right?

298
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,190
Mr. Jang already reports to me about Joon Oh's schedule.

299
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,140
What brings you all the way here?

300
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,860
I temporarily silenced Fact Catch.

301
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,190
But we need to take care of the cause to fix the problem.

302
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,950
The cause of the problem?

303
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,630
Kang Yeong Hwa.

304
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,390
Why don't we just fire her immediately?

305
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:05,770
Wouldn't it hurt you a lot once the rumor starts spreading?

306
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,230
Why are you giving this to me all of a sudden?

307
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,380
There's no need to stop this photo from spreading anymore.

308
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,230
What?

309
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,970

310
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,200
 According to the Southern Provincial Police Agency, near...

311
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Instead of worrying about someone else's rumor, worry about your own first.

312
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,700
And if you have extra time,

313
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:49,100
- mourn your ex-boyfriend's death, too. 
  - There is no trace of it being a murder.

314
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,500
Well, sir.

315
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,670
Could I ask you why you're meeting with CEO Seok?

316
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,590
CEO Seok told me...

317
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,440
that he's the only one who could resolve my problem.

318
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,410
Are you talking about the Goo Tae Joo case?

319
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,930
Goo Tae Joo?

320
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,190
Well...

321
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,640
I-I saw it on the news.

322
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,510
H-He apparently committed suicide.

323
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,410
Just keep an eye on the press.

324
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,700
We need to make sure

325
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,050
Joon Oh doesn't get mentioned in Goo Tae Joo's suicide

326
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,030
no matter what.

327
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,400
Okay. Got it.

328
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,840
You almost scared me.

329
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,390
You came to see me so soon.

330
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,700
Stop bullshitting me and just cut to the chase.

331
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,080
Seeing how angry you are,

332
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,790
he must've failed your quiz.

333
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,650
Are you ready to talk to me now?

334
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,200
If it turns out you wasted my trip,

335
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,800
- you'll be in trouble. 
 - Your brother...

336
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,010
is possessed by an evil spirit.

337
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:28,500
He's evil and selfish. A crafty bastard who lived for more than a thousand years.

338
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,100
It should've been more believable than that.

339
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,770
A ghost?

340
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,210
Were you planning to take money from me for exorcism?

341
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,520
Go ahead and tell me, then.

342
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,710
Have you seen any terminally ill person like Han Joon Oh?

343
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,330
You think I went there without knowing that?

344
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,760
I heard he has a month left.

345
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,380
Shouldn't he be struggling to move by now?

346
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,080
He seems more energetic than before to me.

347
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,960
You've been ignoring it this whole time.

348
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,590
Such as his unfamiliar way of speaking and the chill in his eyes.

349
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,070
Because you're so desperate to have him for another day...

350
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,630
Don't you dare make assumptions.

351
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,630
I just thought he was sick, so—

352
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,180
He's sick because of that evil spirit, too.

353
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,770
He can live as long as the evil spirit leaves.

354
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,380
Joon Oh can live?

355
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,380
An evil spirit almost killed me, too.

356
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,940
This mark is the evidence of it.

357
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,360
Are you saying Joon Oh is...

358
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,930
experiencing what you went through?

359
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:31,880
Just as I did, Han Joon Oh must be getting punished by his karma, too.

360
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,330
The evil spirits visit the bodies of the people with the gravest sins.

361
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,620
Think carefully.

362
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,780
Has someone deeply resented him recently?

363
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,200
 Don't think my death is the end.

364
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,030
 I'll curse you two. See you in hell, Han Min Oh.

365
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,560
Seeing your face,

366
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,940
you must have an idea.

367
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,440
You think I'd believe you?

368
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,510
What if you don't?

369
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,620
Do you know how to save your brother?

370
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,400
If you don't destroy the evil spirit in Han Joon Oh,

371
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,110
you'll lose him to the spirit forever.

372
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,230
Without being able to do anything to save him, though, there is a way.

373
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,520
Is that what you want?

374
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,330
 I'll no longer cause trouble and

375
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,580
 listen to everything you say.

376
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,570
 Your brother only counts on you, Older Brother.

377
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,970
 Do me a favor...

378
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,330
 Brother.

379
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,300
It's up to you to decide.

380
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,190
I'm just informing you.

381
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,070
I'm the only one who knows the only way

382
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,540
for Han Joon Oh to live.

383
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,660
You'd better hurry, Han Min Oh.

384
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,450
We don't have a lot of time left, either.

385
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,340

386
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,340
I'll go back to the office.

387
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,290
Thanks for today.

388
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,440
Take care.

389
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,710
I'll get going, too, then.

390
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,700
I think we still need to talk more.

391
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,840
The thing is...

392
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,180
To be honest...

393
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,980
You didn't have a dream.

394
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,330
How did you know?

395
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,360
Because your face is telling me that.

396
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,740
It's hard to wait six months or a year,

397
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,460
but one or two days out of 1,500 years...

398
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,560
I can wait.

399
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,740
Once we conclude Goo Tae Joo committed suicide,

400
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,150
our investigation will be over, too.

401
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:50,290
We came in a hurry to let you know that in advance.

402
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,040
 He didn't seem cruel enough to kill anyone.

403
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,500
 He didn't look like the type to commit suicide, either.

404
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,390
Are you sure it was a suicide?

405
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,950
The suicide note was sent to the police station.

406
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,000
Goo Tae Joo was captured on a post office's CCTV, too.

407
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,500
Looks like he made an extreme decision, feeling down for becoming an attempted murder suspect

408
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,700
from being a top star overnight.

409
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,820
Go on without me.

410
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,150
I'll be waiting outside.

411
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:28,100
How about the man in the photo? The one who showed up in front of the fire station.

412
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,400
- Oh, him? You probably know him, too— 
 - Hey, Officer Moon.

413
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,620
What do you mean by that?

414
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,380
I know him, too?

415
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,940
Well... um...

416
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,150
The thing is...

417
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,870
The thing is since we're investigating it as a suicide,

418
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,380
we no longer need to look for him.

419
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,240
The team that was in charge of the kidnapping also...

420
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,630
Well, actually...

421
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,520
All I can tell you now is

422
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,550
that someone very trustworthy vouched for him.

423
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,760
And he asked me not to tell you, either.

424
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,030
Who's...

425
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,330
that person?

426
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,760
It's your brother.

427
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,010
 Kang Yeong Hwa's death isn't too far off.

428
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,560
 Why did a disturbing thing like this happen now?

429
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,150
Why are you here?

430
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,090
Are you done talking to them already?

431
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,770
Yes. I'm asking you.

432
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,670
Why are you here?

433
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,930
Just because...

434
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,850
I was a bit shocked to hear about Goo Tae Joo.

435
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,230
I feel bad for him, too.

436
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,910
It's too bad he died,

437
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,900
but that's not what's important right now.

438
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,790
I have a bad feeling for some reason.

439
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,810
Don't go anywhere today, and stay by my side.

440
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,500
Of course, you have a bad feeling.

441
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,100
Someone died.

442
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,870
But I have a plan today. I need to run.

443
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,990
What plan?

444
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,100
Is there something else going on, by chance?

445
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,500
- Why are you doing this out of the blue? 
 - It's not out of the blue...

446
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,120
Implausible deaths are always

447
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,280
followed by ominous things.

448
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,500
You could be in danger, too.

449
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,200
Just listen to me.

450
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,860
Why would I be in danger?

451
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,560
What does that have to do with me?

452
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,360
I really have to go.

453
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,740
I'm off tomorrow. We'll have more time then.

454
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,870
I said you can't.

455
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,100
You said...

456
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,020
I'm your...

457
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,860
guardian angel.

458
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,080
- So just listen to me— 
 - Stop being unreasonable.

459
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,070
I have my personal life, too.

460
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,680
I really need to go.

461
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,720
See you the day after tomorrow.

462
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,600
Kang Yeong Hwa.

463
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,020
Hello, CEO Han.

464
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,500
Looks like you're leaving.

465
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,910
See you then.

466
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,040
I wanted to ask you something.

467
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,720
But I'm a bit busy right now.

468
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,820
That's too bad.

469
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,440
I want to hear about it...

470
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,640
right now.

471
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:06,330
 A body possessed by an evil spirit has a unique mark on it.

472
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,910
Just like this one on my chest.

473
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,370
It may not be so visible at first,

474
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,920
but it shows itself when the body is in danger.

475
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,940
We can talk later.

476
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,190
That's fine, but...

477
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,660
I told you to always look tidy.

478
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,970
Small things like that show your true self.

479
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,110
What are you doing?

480
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,490
Why are you overreacting?

481
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,120
Did I do something I'm not supposed to do?

482
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,960
I hate it when people touch me.

483
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,670
You know how he's traumatized.

484
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,720
Please be understanding of it, CEO.

485
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,690
The police officers were here earlier.

486
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,600
He heard about Goo Tae Joo, too.

487
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,520
You understand. Right?

488
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,740
It looks like...

489
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,440
you know Joon Oh better than I do now.

490
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,280
I guess it's because I spent a lot of time with him lately.

491
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,040
We need to talk. Right?

492
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,920
Let's talk outside.

493
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,570
We'll get going, then.

494
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,420
 Come to think of it, he's done that before.

495
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,940
 What are you doing?

496
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,210
Looks like we're going to the fire station.

497
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,870
Meeting your coworkers?

498
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,400
Yes. They suddenly wanted to meet up. I thought I'd just visit them.

499
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,950
You're not coming to the fire station, too. Right?

500
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,610
- Of course, I should come with— 
 - No.

501
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,430
I'm being very generous, letting you come this far.

502
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,780
Just go back in this car.

503
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,380
You seemed flustered earlier.

504
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,370
So I had to improvise to save you.

505
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,030
If you insist as you did earlier,

506
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:48,400
I'll really stop telling you about my dreams.

507
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,000
Call me as soon as you get home.

508
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,770
I'm worried.

509
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,780
He's insisting he'd drive me home.

510
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,990
What am I, a child?

511
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,010
Why don't you apologize to CEO Han when you get home?

512
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,020
You yelled at him when he was worried about you.

513
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,360

514
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,820

515
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,360
I didn't notice it before.

516
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,880
What's that thing that looks like a line?

517
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,610
What? They told me to be punctual.

518
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,200
Was everyone dispatched?

519
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,080
Happy birthday, Senior!

520
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,230
What's going on?

521
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,010
Slowly, slowly, slowly!

522
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,480
You scared me.

523
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,070
I told you not to do stuff like this.

524
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,840
Your birthday is coming up soon.

525
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,160
We can't celebrate then because of our schedule.

526
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,970
We invited you to celebrate in advance.

527
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,020
 Blow it out! Blow it out!

528
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:27,370
 Blow it out! Blow it out!

529
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,610
Thank you.

530
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,100

531
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,050
It's so nice to see all of you.

532
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:41,280
Oh? Who did this to Yeong Hwa's locker? Huh?

533
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,990
What's all this? Seriously.

534
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,890

535
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,210
Just come back.

536
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,050

We prepared everything for you.

537
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:00,440
And this is birthday bribe money, so you come back soon.

538
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,540
Oh, no! You can't give me money.

539
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,030
Gosh, Senior.

540
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,990
We'd be rude to just give you cash.

541
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,250
N-No?

542
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,150
What is it, then?

543
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,400
 You know how he's traumatized.

544
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,400
 Please be understanding of it, CEO.

545
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,360
Put that down.

546
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,000
You came back faster than I thought.

547
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,160
Did the conversation go well?

548
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,960
I said I needed to ask you something.

549
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,770
It's about the person I told you to look for.

550
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,520
I vouched for his character to the police.

551
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,380
You're so proud of it.

552
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,030
Why did you tell the police not to tell me?

553
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,620
Oh, did you already find him and hide him?

554
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,510
You won't know him even if I told you.

555
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,840
I used to know him well.

556
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,480
Looks like he was passing by and got caught on CCTV by chance.

557
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,480
I wanted to tell you myself so you don't get the wrong idea.

558
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,240
By chance?

559
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,230
How am I supposed to believe that?

560
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,270
If I say so, it is so.

561
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,140
Don't you believe me?

562
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,160
And there's good news.

563
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,880
I think I found someone actually suspicious.

564
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,190
Who's that?

565
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,130
Just wait a bit.

566
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,250
I'm looking into it right now...

567
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,960
for Han Joon Oh.

568
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,950
It's getting late.

569
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,880
Good night.

570
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,870
 I got home safely.

571
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,540
 Don't worry for no reason and go to bed.

572
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,000
 I just need one or two days.

573
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,400
 I'll make sure to find out how you died.

574
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,780
 This time,

575
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:54,640
 I won't let you get killed by someone else.

576
00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:00,380
 I'll prevent all the threats that are awaiting you.

577
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,270
What are you doing here?

578
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,130
Someone's getting more and more anxious as time goes by.

579
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,310
I'll dream for him now.

580
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,960
So we can go back to where we want to be as soon as possible.

581
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,400
What are you saying?

582
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,190
I looked into it, and you dream while you're in REM sleep?

583
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,490
Anyway, you dream when you're not in deep sleep.

584
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,510
But you move a lot when you sleep.

585
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,110
So I wanted to get your help.

586
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:36,210
I don't want to. I sleep out here because it's too hot in my room.

587
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,070
Sleep in your room.

588
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,660
Is that so?

589
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,620
If so...

590
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,790
Gosh, what should I do with this?

591
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:49,220
Why did they give this to me as a birthday present?

592
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,410
You said you're depressed. So I was going to go with you tomorrow.

593
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,280
I should go with someone else. Right?

594
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,420

595
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,310
Do you want to sleep, Yeong Hwa?

596
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,120
Let's go to sleep, my baby.

597
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,550
Goodness. Go to sleep, go to sleep.

598
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,680
Do you want me to kick you while you're sleeping?

599
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,830
It's fine. Just turn the lights off.

600
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,810
Okay.

601
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,750

602
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,050
Did I fail last night, too?

603
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,940
But...

604
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,070
why does my chest feel so stuffy?

605
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,110
Gosh, what are you doing? Seriously.

606
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,840
Gosh.

607
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,880
I'm in trouble.

608
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,870
What do I do?

609
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,910
What's with you? Did you have a fight with Han Joon Oh?

610
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:08,740
I'll get to dream about Lord Do Ha again someday. Right?

611
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,670
Gosh, this is really too much.

612
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,690
Why didn't you just invite Han Joon Oh instead?

613
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,170
Are you crazy? I can't go there with him.

614
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,150
Right? That sounds kind of crazy. Right?

615
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,030
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

616
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,840
Oh, yay!

617
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,490
Hello.

618
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,420
Where are you going?

619
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,490
Gosh, hold on. Seriously.

620
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,270
So you really...

621
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,840
want to go to this place with us?

622
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,210
Yeah.

623
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,870
Hey.

624
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:49,040
Why have you been acting like this since yesterday?

625
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,060
I really don't understand it.

626
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,630
What makes you think I'm in danger?

627
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,070
And do you think this is a battlefield?

628
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,420
You're following me to a theme park because it's dangerous?

629
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,300
I know. I think...

630
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:08,460
you're in a bit more danger than Yeong Hwa here...

631
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,200
- Han Joon Oh? 
 - Yes, I think he looks like him.

632
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,130
I think it's him.

633
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,800
I said a cap isn't enough.

634
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,960
Stop being stubborn and go back.

635
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:23,960
I told you. I'll follow you if you go back home.

636
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,730
Do you think I want to go in here?

637
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,600
It's kind of awkward, but it might be...

638
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,160
- a special event for the public. 
 - Hey! Over here!

639
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,790
- Unni. 
 - Over here.

640
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,800
What event?

641
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:43,140
I found a way to go in.

642
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,800
Gosh, why do I—

643
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,990
Go home if you don't want it.

644
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,000
Why don't you go home instead?

645
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,090
I just got here, and I'll never go home until I ride all the rides here.

646
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:57,600
Let me know when you get tired.

647
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,230
I'll let you go home with Mr. Jang.

648
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:13,000
- Do I have to take it this far? 
 - Unni!

649
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,390
- I got us headbands! 
 - Gosh.

650
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:17,940
Look!

651
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,410
Geez. Gosh.

652
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,380
- I want this. 
 - This?

653
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,490
Yes.

654
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,070
I love it.

655
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,090
You know them?

656
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,620
- I know all of them. 
 - You do?

657
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,620
I know them all.

658
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,930
♫  The day you first came to me  ♫

659
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,910
♫  I still remember clearly  ♫

660
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:46,000
♫  When I first experienced you  ♫

661
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,190
You want to...

662
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,280
ride this thing?

663
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,910
Go!

664
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,100
Don't take the mask off. Stay right here. I'll be right back.

665
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,860
I said you can't roam around without me.

666
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,910
Why don't you ride it, too, then?

667
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:06,110
You either ride with me or wait here. Pick one.

668
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,140
Pick one.

669
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:17,120
♫  I hope that you are like me, if you'd say so  ♫

670
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:23,020
♫  Your smile like sunshine, always brightness  ♫

671
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:28,250
♫  You shine so brightly  ♫

672
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:34,150
♫  You make me feel love until the end  ♫

673
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:39,320
♫  You are so precious  ♫

674
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:45,110
♫  Someday we will love each forever  ♫

675
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:50,870
♫  It's a promise that will never be broken  ♫

676
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,950
Wow, that was amazing!

677
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,200
Han Joon Oh.

678
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,230
Are you okay?

679
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,890
Don't you have dates with your girlfriend, Yoon Je?

680
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:24,390
I don't have a girlfriend.

681
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,620
You two.

682
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,350
Since when were you on a first-name basis?

683
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:34,880
You had enough fun. Let's go now.

684
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,980
Are you possessed by ghosts who never had fun?

685
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,830
I don't think we're the ones who got possessed.

686
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,250
Mr. Jang, aren't you ashamed of getting paid after playing like this?

687
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,330
I'm sorry. My apologies.

688
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,890
Wow, seriously.

689
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:59,500
Mr. Jang came here following you. Okay?

690
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,550
Must you ruin other people's moods, too? Why don't you just go home, then?

691
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,680
You said there's nothing dangerous.

692
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,700
They hang, spin, and drop people all day.

693
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,390
How could I leave when it's so dangerous?

694
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,440
This place is filled with dangerous stuff.

695
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,470
It's too dangerous.

696
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:18,950
You come here to enjoy stuff like that.

697
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,120
What's wrong with him?

698
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,190
Well. He feels so strongly about it. Let's just go, Yeong Hwa.

699
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,440
What are you saying?

700
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,920
We're here because Seung Woo got us the tickets.

701
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,960
I can't let his efforts go to waste.

702
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,120
Is he the one who got us the tickets?

703
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,610
I told you before. I think Seung Woo likes you.

704
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,970
Who's Seung Woo?

705
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:48,910
You won't know. He's the No. 1 cutie at Yeong Hwa's fire station.

706
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:52,820
I knew it when he followed Yeong Hwa around, saying, "Senior. Senior."

707
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,110
I can read the air better than anyone—

708
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:57,420
He's just my junior. Got it?

709
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,480
Do all of your juniors get you coffee whenever you're on night duty?

710
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,520
Do you know him, too, Mr. Han?

711
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,190
He's been bothering me for a while.

712
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:15,070
Anyway, I can't stay here any longer.

713
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:19,550
You either stay here or follow me.

714
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,190
I think I should get going now.

715
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,050
Han Joon Oh...

716
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:41,200
- Oppa! Oppa! Oppa! 
 - Hey. Joon Oh!

717
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,900
Hey! Hey!

718
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,180
Quiet! Hey!

719
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,400
Oppa! Oppa!

720
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:39,230
We hit the jackpot. I'm saying Han Joon Oh is here.

721
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,610
It's really that Han Joon Oh.

722
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:45,080
Yes, I said it was Han Joon Oh.

723
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,950
 Why do I have to go through all this?

724
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,080
 That's what I'm saying.

725
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,820
You can't blame me, can you?

726
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,490
I was against it from the beginning.

727
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:59,280
You didn't have to be Han Joon Oh from the beginning, then.

728
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,600
Why did you have to be him out of countless people?

729
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,340
That's...

730
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,090
I don't know if it was fate or coincidence.

731
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,300
Fine. I should blame my fate for getting involved in this.

732
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,360
Let's go.

733
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,760
Gosh, it scared me.

734
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,520
Just come out.

735
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,870
Huh? It's Na Yeon.

736
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:46,270
Mr. Jang sent people toward the exit.

737
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,050
Not everyone can be a celebrity manager.

738
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:55,240
Let's get going now.

739
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,020
- Hold on. 
 - Huh?

740
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:03,860
Where are we? It's so dark and spooky.

741
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,730
This place? It's the Haunted House.

742
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,670
What house?

743
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,750
Haunted House.

744
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,850
What?

745
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:25,820
You can't be scared of ghosts when you're a ghost. Right?

746
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,410
Because I'm a ghost,

747
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:32,420
I understand them better. Have you thought about that?

748
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:37,040
Gosh. You're scaring me. What are you talking about?

749
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,360
Ghosts are...

750
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,990
Where are you going?

751
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,000
Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going?

752
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,350
We should close the door.

753
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,550
- Where are you going? Why? 
 - Okay.

754
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,600

755
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,640
What?

756
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,580
Just because.

757
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,950
It was fun, wasn't it?

758
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:32,130
What if...

759
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:37,270
Like you said once...

760
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,460
what if we were ordinary?

761
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:47,390
I wonder how it would've been.

762
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,250
 I heard from the hospitals in the US.

763
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,600
 They looked at Mr. Han Joon Oh's test results carefully,

764
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,490
 but everyone says he can't be treated.

765
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:21,160
 You should just accept it now.

766
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:28,080
 Mr. Han Joon Oh can't recover.

767
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,700
 I don't care if CEO Seok was telling the truth or not.

768
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:53,990
 If the only way to save you is to believe him...

769
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,900
Is it true that I can save my brother?

770
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,660
If you do as I say, of course.

771
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,010
What am I supposed to do?

772
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,610
Kill Kang Yeong Hwa.

773
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:21,390
Then your brother can live.

774
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,850
Gosh, I'm beat.

775
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,630
You can't go to a theme park twice in a row.

776
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:34,160
I know what you mean.

777
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,110
Look at those two sleeping.

778
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,790
They must be exhausted.

779
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:04,480
♫  Under the pouring moonlight  ♫

780
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:11,070
♫  Your eyes looked back at me  ♫

781
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:17,590
♫  Your eyes are deeper than words  ♫

782
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:24,250
♫  They made me go through so many nights  ♫

783
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:39,910
♫  All of my memories with you touched everything warmly  ♫

784
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,990
A bride's face...

785
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:48,420
cannot look so sad.

786
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:53,300
I cannot look as sad as you.

787
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,340
Are you not nervous at all?

788
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,920
This is our first night together, after all.

789
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:05,860
Just worry about yourself.

790
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:11,910
Grooms tend to get more nervous than brides on the first night.

791
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:15,200
Did you not know that, My Lord?

792
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,220
"Dear husband."

793
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,550
A lot of people will be watching us from now on.

794
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,320
Would you be able to call me that?

795
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,320
When you say something like that,

796
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,630
you are supposed to...

797
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:55,330
say it with a smile like this.

798
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:58,650
Not with such a sad face.

799
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:05,730
♫  It will become a light in my dark heart  ♫

800
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,020
♫  All of our...  ♫

801
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:18,660
♫  All of our love  ♫

802
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:30,380

803
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,480
♫  I'll be by your side  ♫

804
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,700
♫  I won't let go of you  ♫

805
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:45,290
♫  I'll protect you while we're drifting apart  ♫

806
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:48,220
♫  Just stay with me  ♫

807
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:52,150

808
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,190
 I will create mundane memories for you.

809
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:57,380
 Let's go on a trip together.

810
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,250
 Promise.

811
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:01,540
 You mean the evil spirit has something to do with Ms. Kang?

812
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,800
 - You don't have to dream. 
 - What?

813
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,950
 I made up my mind.

814
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,380
 He definitely has an ulterior motive.

815
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,530
 I won't know unless you tell me.

816
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:13,250
 Would you be able to handle it if I did?

817
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,890
 You'll learn the truth someday, Kang Yeong Hwa.

818
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:20,040
 I mean, Han Ri Ta.
