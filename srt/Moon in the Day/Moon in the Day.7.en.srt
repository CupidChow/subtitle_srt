1
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,949
(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,950
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,950
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:51,990
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

5
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:53,351
You were...

6
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,061
my wife.

7
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:14,982
Sorry. I can't take it anymore.

8
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:16,342
Gosh.

9
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:22,521
Turn all of these off.

10
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:24,421
Then, I'll believe you.

11
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:29,061
I knew it.

12
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:31,262
You can't claim to be a 1,500-year-old ghost...

13
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,391
when you can't even do that.

14
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,932
You don't even believe me.

15
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,561
Why did you visit the temple, then?

16
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:41,602
Weren't you looking for the monk who put the talisman on me?

17
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:44,842
And you made me come here...

18
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:48,042
because you suspected who I was.

19
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:54,280
It's just that you've been saying such weird stuff lately,

20
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,681
so I wanted to confirm.

21
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,622
And I'm giving you the confirmation.

22
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,821
The lights only turned off by accident.

23
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:03,161
While all the other kids learned how to ride a bike,

24
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:04,632
you learned after you grew up, right?

25
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:06,592
And in secret.

26
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,961
Because the last memory of you with your father...

27
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,232
who passed away when you were seven...

28
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,472
was riding a bike together.

29
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:15,140
How do you know that?

30
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:17,711
The 5,000 dollars you lent a colleague 2 years ago.

31
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,170
You still haven't gotten it back.

32
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,241
Wait. You never even asked to give it back, did you?

33
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:24,511
While you were financially struggling,

34
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:27,722
you kept writing and deleting the text message.

35
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:30,050
It must also apply to how you can't say anything...

36
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:32,391
to Na Yeon when she uses all of your stuff.

37
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,322
Because you're the type of person...

38
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:39,931
who can't stand bothering others more than suffering a loss.

39
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,461
What are you doing?

40
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:44,361
I'm telling you about the Young Hwa I've been observing.

41
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:47,202
If you still can't believe me,

42
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,900
tell me something that I don't know about you.

43
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:53,171
I can answer all of them.

44
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,081
Jun O, you're...

45
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:01,051
- Are you actually... - Yes.

46
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:04,180
I'm actually your...

47
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,722
Were you my stalker?

48
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,352
Can we talk, Jun O?

49
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,222
I don't know what you've been doing with Ms. Kang so late at night,

50
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:44,062
but we need to talk.

51
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,991
I don't have the energy to spend on you right now.

52
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:48,602
What did you say?

53
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:52,301
Your eccentric behaviours after the accident.

54
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:55,301
I've been letting them slide...

55
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,611
thinking that it's only because you're unwell.

56
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:03,611
Including that abnormal obsession with Ms. Kang.

57
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:07,252
Look at yourself now.

58
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:11,021
You only respond to the name, Young Hwa.

59
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,521
I only asked her hoping that you'd get better.

60
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:19,361
But if it's only making you worse,

61
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,831
I can't let her near you.

62
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,922
Can't you keep thinking...

63
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,521
that it's all...

64
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:54,502
because of my illness?

65
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:58,731
They say it's a fatal illness, not just any kind.

66
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,172
I beg you,

67
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:08,882
Min O.

68
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,502
Wait.

69
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,271
I don't think I can do this.

70
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:41,211
You were the one who asked me to help you dump the body.

71
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,612
What choice did I have?

72
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:44,182
If the court finds out,

73
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:46,181
we're finished.

74
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:48,122
Yes, so I'll help you.

75
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,122
I was the only witness.

76
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,492
You're right.

77
00:05:58,331 --> 00:05:59,591
How did you happen...

78
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,901
to be with Tae Ju at that moment?

79
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:04,932
It was as if...

80
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,771
you were waiting for me to come.

81
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,981
Now. This will be very interesting.

82
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,781
Did you...

83
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:26,351
do that to Tae Ju on purpose?

84
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,161
Do you want one?

85
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,622
(Medicine)

86
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,341
If what Jun O said was true,

87
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:27,012
I wasn't going insane.

88
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:52,612
As Young Hwa's 30th birthday comes near,

89
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,341
my wound is getting darker.

90
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:18,172
(Moon in the Day)

91
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:21,331
What brings you here so early in the morning?

92
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:26,140
Jun O wanted me to bring Ms. Kang.

93
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:27,172
I see.

94
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:30,012
Okay. Wait here.

95
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:31,112
Yes, ma'am.

96
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:34,281
Did you expect me to say that?

97
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:37,880
Forget it. Tell him to keep dating Yi Seul.

98
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:39,192
Don't bother, Na Yeon.

99
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,261
Did he wake you up?

100
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:44,490
I'm sorry,

101
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,831
but tell him that I went to see my father at dawn.

102
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:50,302
I'm not in the mood to talk to him right now.

103
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,230
You're right. Even if it's Jun O,

104
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,740
a player doesn't deserve a chance.

105
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,172
There are manners to keep in a relationship.

106
00:08:57,501 --> 00:08:59,171
- Na Yeon. - What?

107
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,042
Excuse me, Ms. Kang.

108
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:05,552
He wanted me to deliver this message, at least.

109
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:07,551
Don't try to avoid me...

110
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:09,720
by using your late father as an excuse.

111
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,822
You know better than anyone...

112
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:13,491
that you can't run from this forever.

113
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,261
That's what he said.

114
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:19,491
Jun O, that insufferable...

115
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:24,361
Na Yeon, I'll see you later.

116
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:27,601
Wait here, Mr. Jang.

117
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:29,371
Sure.

118
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:38,682
Should I put on some music?

119
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:41,851
- Mr. Jang. - Yes?

120
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:45,952
You said last time that Jun O was into somebody else, right?

121
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,422
Who did you mean at the time?

122
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,532
Did I say that?

123
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:58,231
Well, it's just...

124
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,902
that Jun O's type doesn't really change.

125
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,941
He said that his past girlfriend...

126
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,581
looked exactly like you.

127
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:13,851
Oh, do you mean Han Ri Ta?

128
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,121
Yes, that was the name.

129
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,892
How do you know that?

130
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:24,322
So, you also knew.

131
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:28,662
How long have you known?

132
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:31,631
That Jun O wasn't actually Jun O.

133
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:34,731
Why didn't you tell me when you knew about it?

134
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,912
Would you have believed me had I told you?

135
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:44,711
At least, give him the benefit of the doubt.

136
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:50,221
He's only had eyes for 1 woman for 1,500 years.

137
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,052
Imagine that amount of resentment.

138
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,322
We could have talked in Seoul.

139
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:26,621
Why did you bring me all the way here?

140
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,662
I want to show you something.

141
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,062
These are called yellow water-lilies.

142
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,971
You must be familiar if you've seen them in your dream.

143
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,371
It's because it also represents your family.

144
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:53,011
The flower engraved on the sword.

145
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:54,952
Yes.

146
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,022
You're saying...

147
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:01,052
that the dreams I had...

148
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:03,162
weren't normal dreams.

149
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:06,591
They actually happened?

150
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:08,162
You've been watching...

151
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,461
your past lives in the last 1,500 years.

152
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,032
I had no idea that previous lives...

153
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:16,142
and reincarnations actually existed.

154
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:19,272
But of all the reincarnations, the only one who remembered me...

155
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:22,182
was you.

156
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:26,682
Young Hwa.

157
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:29,751
Hang on.

158
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:33,292
Let me think.

159
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,822
This is not how I wanted to reveal my identity...

160
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,121
for it would be too sudden for you.

161
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:11,761
But...

162
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:16,961
I want to end this eternal loop and move on to the other side.

163
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:20,131
Say what you say is true.

164
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:25,172
Have you any idea...

165
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,341
how much I was traumatized my entire life?

166
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:33,452
And I was only traumatized...

167
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:38,751
so that you could move on.

168
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:41,822
To end our endless loop,

169
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,091
you must get to the end of your dream...

170
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:47,032
and find out the cause of my death.

171
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:55,142
You don't even care how confused I am...

172
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,511
and how much I've suffered.

173
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,081
All you want is to accomplish your goal,

174
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:04,282
isn't it?

175
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,681
What gives you the right to shake my whole life...

176
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:09,481
to solve your problem?

177
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,392
Who cares about your resentment?

178
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:18,392
In the 21st century, countless people die...

179
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,032
due to various accidents, illnesses, and unfathomable things.

180
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:24,401
Not all of them ruin other people's lives...

181
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:26,932
to end their pain like you're doing right now.

182
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:30,572
You must be delusional.

183
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:33,312
I'm Kang Young Hwa, not Han Ri Ta.

184
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:35,741
Just like you're not Han Jun O,

185
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,481
I'm not the woman from 1,500 years ago.

186
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:40,952
You can never...

187
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:44,081
run from the woman from 1,500 years ago.

188
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,692
You see your past life even in your dreams.

189
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:49,091
Do you truly believe that you can run away?

190
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:51,292
You also...

191
00:14:52,231 --> 00:14:54,032
want to see how it ends.

192
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,601
I'll give you a piece of advice.

193
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:02,501
It's been 1,500 years.

194
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:05,312
Why don't you forget about it?

195
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:08,981
Then, I'll try and forget...

196
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:10,711
about this unbelievably unfair destiny.

197
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:14,581
Young Hwa.

198
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:20,590
Also, what you've been doing to me is considered stalking.

199
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:21,591
Do you know that?

200
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,922
How could you do that for 29 years?

201
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:28,932
I hope we never see each other again.

202
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:39,871
Do not look back.

203
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:45,652
From this point on, you only go forward.

204
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:17,912
Get out of here.

205
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:20,782
Now!

206
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:27,652
If you wish to go past me,

207
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:29,922
I will take your life.

208
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,032
We only need the girl.

209
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:33,261
Shoot!

210
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:18,872
Are you okay?

211
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,342
Master.

212
00:17:31,582 --> 00:17:32,592
Master!

213
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:58,311
If you are up,

214
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,652
show some manners.

215
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,791
Where is...

216
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:17,932
the girl?

217
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,641
You killed your own bodyguard...

218
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:24,270
for a maid...

219
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,811
and got injured.

220
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:29,241
How much disappointment do you want to bring to your father?

221
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:30,582
I just asked...

222
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,082
where she was!

223
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,821
I killed her.

224
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,791
You had better hope that is not true.

225
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,731
Have you...

226
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:54,832
actually killed her?

227
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,602
It is for your own sake!

228
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,571
What do you think will happen to you if she is truly...

229
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,172
the daughter of a traitor?

230
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:06,382
I told you to show your manners.

231
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:12,692
I had killed...

232
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:16,990
all those people...

233
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:18,932
only to live my life as your son...

234
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:23,832
when I had no reason to live in the first place.

235
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:35,142
I no longer...

236
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,952
want to live as your son.

237
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:54,162
Do you believe you can take on my soldiers with your injury?

238
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:57,632
If you go out that way,

239
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,471
you are a dead man.

240
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:02,902
It does not...

241
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:08,442
matter anymore.

242
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:14,481
Open the doors for him.

243
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,082
If it was not for me,

244
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:48,682
she would have died by biting her tongue.

245
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,862
She said that she once worked in the Gaya general's house.

246
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:09,642
She is Lady Han.

247
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:16,842
Do Ha, everyone here is...

248
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:19,952
the witness.

249
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,751
She is a traitor who deserves to die.

250
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,592
Do Ha, if you kill...

251
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:32,961
this traitor here,

252
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:36,131
I shall smooth over...

253
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:38,932
your fault that you played with her.

254
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:53,612
If that is your answer,

255
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,221
I have no other choice.

256
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,632
The only people who know about her identity...

257
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:13,702
are us.

258
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:17,842
As a dog I raised does not recognize his master,

259
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:21,211
I must bind him tight...

260
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:25,182
and let him know...

261
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:27,711
what he is.

262
00:22:47,872 --> 00:22:50,842
Instead of having you marry someone who can become your wings,

263
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:56,241
I would rather have her as your wife...

264
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:00,281
and take advantage from it.

265
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,082
For that reason,

266
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:07,551
you even killed all the innocent people?

267
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:10,491
I will choose an auspicious day and hold a grand wedding ceremony...

268
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:13,662
for you two.

269
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:20,902
Getting married to her is the only way...

270
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,672
you can save the girl.

271
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,771
You choose.

272
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:29,241
You kill her...

273
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,241
or accept her as your wife.

274
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,231
I also like...

275
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:57,602
your choice.

276
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,241
Give her the best clothes...

277
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,281
and serve her with all your heart.

278
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:07,311
She is a noblewoman...

279
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,422
who will be the wife of Do Ha.

280
00:24:32,202 --> 00:24:35,711
My lord, I served porridge as you ordered...

281
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:38,781
She has not eaten anything again today?

282
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:40,551
I am sorry.

283
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:48,452
I am going in.

284
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:18,352
I said we should survive,

285
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:22,592
but things are not going as I said. I am very sorry.

286
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,662
Still, if you want to survive,

287
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,402
you should at least eat something.

288
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:37,571
Should I eat whenever you order me to?

289
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:41,811
If you say I should survive,

290
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,342
should I do as you say?

291
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:49,321
What gives you the right?

292
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:55,192
Why should you choose everything about me?

293
00:25:57,862 --> 00:25:58,991
Why do you force me...

294
00:26:00,731 --> 00:26:03,432
to be the reason that you should survive?

295
00:26:06,872 --> 00:26:08,301
Because it is better.

296
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:14,412
Instead of living to kill someone,

297
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:18,142
would it not better to live

298
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:21,381
while waiting for the time you kill me in the end?

299
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:22,412
That is the reason...

300
00:26:24,551 --> 00:26:27,892
I should live following your order?

301
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:33,862
While I see you always obey your father's command...

302
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,432
He will not reveal your identity...

303
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,971
to anyone as long as I follow his command.

304
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:43,041
It is also better for you...

305
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,672
to wait to kill...

306
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,311
your enemy...

307
00:26:50,912 --> 00:26:53,211
instead of being chased as a traitor.

308
00:26:58,082 --> 00:26:59,551
I will leave,

309
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,321
so please have a bite at least.

310
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,382
Young Hwa, we're here.

311
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,751
Young Hwa, we are in front of your house.

312
00:27:39,332 --> 00:27:42,531
You must've been very tired. You had a deep sleep.

313
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:46,372
Thanks for the ride.

314
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:48,471
- I'll see you soon. - Wait.

315
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,571
By the way,

316
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:56,781
what was the agreement with the ghost?

317
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,682
Oh, that...

318
00:27:59,352 --> 00:28:00,582
The ghost?

319
00:28:01,082 --> 00:28:05,321
It is related to my occupation.

320
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:09,662
I hope you had a meaningful conversation.

321
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,491
I'm sure it went well, right?

322
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:21,102
You came back. How was it with Jun O?

323
00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:32,041
Hey, did you clean the trash bin in my room?

324
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:35,111
I think I might have while cleaning my room.

325
00:28:35,112 --> 00:28:36,122
But why?

326
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:43,561
Hey!

327
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:45,692
What are you doing?

328
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:50,162
(Medicine)

329
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:51,531
I found it.

330
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:56,102
I won't have any more dreams about the master or something.

331
00:28:56,642 --> 00:28:59,141
Yet another drunk-driving accident has occurred,

332
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:01,071
killing a 40-year-old man.

333
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:04,681
At that moment, the victim was working as a chauffeur to earn...

334
00:29:04,682 --> 00:29:08,311
his two daughters' academy fees...

335
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:10,550
A week ago, a young worker died...

336
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:13,352
while working on a construction site.

337
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:15,452
He was only 19 years old.

338
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:20,961
The wife, Sang Eun, got help from his husband, Seung Ho...

339
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:29,270
In the 21st century, countless people die...

340
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:32,172
due to various accidents, illnesses, and unfathomable things.

341
00:29:32,672 --> 00:29:34,441
Not all of them ruin other people's lives...

342
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:36,981
to end their pain like you're doing right now.

343
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:42,112
Do you think...

344
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,652
I wanted to be involved in such a fateful destiny?

345
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:57,301
You almost scared me.

346
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:01,431
I didn't expect you to find him this quick.

347
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,471
Oh, yes.

348
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:04,741
It wasn't me.

349
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:06,612
Mr. Seok reached out first...

350
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,671
to resolve a misunderstanding...

351
00:30:08,672 --> 00:30:10,411
with you.

352
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:11,682
You can leave now.

353
00:30:12,182 --> 00:30:14,551
- Yes. - I'll ask him in person.

354
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:21,092
I should've come earlier. But it took me too long.

355
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,560
You haven't met in a long time.

356
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:26,662
How about shaking hands gladly...

357
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:33,432
We can do that next time.

358
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,702
I'll deal with it on my own, so listen to Mr. Han.

359
00:30:35,832 --> 00:30:36,842
Yes, sir.

360
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,211
I'll leave you two alone, then.

361
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:47,751
Sit. Why are you still standing there?

362
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:51,652
I don't know what you said to Lawyer Ko,

363
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,892
but you'll have to tell me the truth.

364
00:30:56,092 --> 00:30:57,892
Are you going to ask if I tried to kill your brother?

365
00:30:59,362 --> 00:31:01,191
I'm not petty enough to instigate murder...

366
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,290
for going to prison because of you.

367
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,161
I don't resent you that much.

368
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,760
If you think you can get past it...

369
00:31:05,761 --> 00:31:08,432
The thoughts that haunt you these days.

370
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:13,142
"He certainly has my brother's appearance."

371
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:16,912
"Why does he seem so unfamiliar?"

372
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:23,352
What are you trying to say?

373
00:31:26,622 --> 00:31:28,422
Let's try that again.

374
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,091
"Why did Jun O become a completely different man..."

375
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:34,791
"after barely surviving?"

376
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,332
"Is this truly one of the symptoms of PTSD?"

377
00:31:40,872 --> 00:31:42,801
I meant those thoughts.

378
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:47,071
And there's Kang Young Hwa.

379
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:50,480
"Why is Jun O suddenly..."

380
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:52,741
"obsessed with that woman?"

381
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:57,221
These are your biggest concerns at the moment.

382
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:01,751
How on earth do you know all that?

383
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:04,362
Do you want to know how?

384
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:06,561
Then, stop doubting me.

385
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:10,402
For I'm the only one who can solve your problems.

386
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:14,231
Give your brother a question.

387
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:16,342
Such as a secret...

388
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:20,241
that only you and the real Jun O know about.

389
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:23,882
If he can't answer you, he's out.

390
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:26,452
That means...

391
00:32:28,352 --> 00:32:29,781
he's not Jun O.

392
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:41,392
How come you're out so soon?

393
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,031
Is the talk already over?

394
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:47,731
But I had to brace myself to let him talk to you.

395
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,402
It went easily because you set it up.

396
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:52,872
- Thanks. - Hold on.

397
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:57,211
Don't tell me you killed him.

398
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,451
Everyone in this line of work knows you two are on bad terms.

399
00:33:02,452 --> 00:33:03,481
Answer me!

400
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,721
There are security cameras everywhere!

401
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:10,820
You're still such a scaredy-cat...

402
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:12,061
when you've actually killed a man.

403
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,801
Don't worry.

404
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:18,831
Neither Jun O...

405
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:21,932
nor Min O are the ones I wish to kill.

406
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,912
The captives of Baekje have escaped?

407
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:30,182
Yes, Lord So.

408
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:32,642
The royal forces must have too much on their plate.

409
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:35,682
Do Ha, go and sweep them.

410
00:33:37,452 --> 00:33:38,781
You are the most competent martial artist

411
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:42,551
in Seorabeol, after all.

412
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:45,061
No, my lord.

413
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:47,961
General Kim is severely injured,

414
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:50,701
and we can take on such a trivial task.

415
00:33:50,702 --> 00:33:51,761
No.

416
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:54,230
This is for Silla.

417
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:56,132
No task is trivial.

418
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:58,672
Get going this instant, Do Ha.

419
00:34:21,162 --> 00:34:22,292
I will be back, sir.

420
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:38,281
I will be back.

421
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,892
Marrying Lord Do Ha? That wicked girl.

422
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:54,462
She is only a maid just like us.

423
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,191
Have you heard?

424
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:58,800
Lord Do Ha almost got killed...

425
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:00,400
trying to save that girl.

426
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:03,702
They were fleeing together, and Lord So captured them.

427
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:06,542
- Yet he went to another war? - Yes.

428
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:07,970
Unbelievable.

429
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:10,110
What if that witch gets him killed?

430
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:12,082
That is what I am saying.

431
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:13,912
He will not die.

432
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:21,721
He will come back in one piece. I promise you.

433
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:39,261
Why are you here?

434
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:50,102
Have you just returned?

435
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:53,272
Can you not see?

436
00:37:58,381 --> 00:37:59,881
You do not seem well.

437
00:38:00,582 --> 00:38:02,352
I am tired. Leave me.

438
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,162
Why is your hand so hot?

439
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:15,991
Do not mind.

440
00:38:16,732 --> 00:38:17,761
Get out...

441
00:38:20,372 --> 00:38:23,602
Are you sure you are not feeling unwell?

442
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,312
It seems like you have a fever.

443
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,691
You do not have to pretend...

444
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:44,921
to worry about me.

445
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,841
Master.

446
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:37,182
Master.

447
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:39,511
Master!

448
00:39:42,151 --> 00:39:43,151
Master!

449
00:39:56,702 --> 00:39:59,232
He overworked himself before we could treat...

450
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:01,071
his arrow wound thoroughly.

451
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:04,071
It seems that he has a fever as the wound festered.

452
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:05,441
The fever is so high...

453
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:08,312
that he may never wake up again.

454
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:18,221
But you still have so much to do...

455
00:40:20,522 --> 00:40:22,091
for your father.

456
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,962
But you are about to die from such a minor injury.

457
00:40:31,202 --> 00:40:34,232
Look after him with devotion.

458
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:38,102
If he fails to wake up,

459
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:40,941
I do not have...

460
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:45,642
a reason...

461
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:49,781
to let you live.

462
00:42:06,962 --> 00:42:08,531
Even if you woke up,

463
00:42:10,502 --> 00:42:13,401
you would get dragged around like a dog by your father.

464
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:17,372
You will do everything as he says...

465
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:19,801
because I have become your shackle.

466
00:42:21,412 --> 00:42:23,511
You would not be alive or dead.

467
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:37,292
It is the right thing to end everything here.

468
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,892
My deep-rooted resentment...

469
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,301
and this unforgivable pity...

470
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:49,332
would all end...

471
00:42:50,272 --> 00:42:51,642
once you are dead.

472
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:56,441
I will end it all here.

473
00:44:04,582 --> 00:44:05,611
Lord Do Ha.

474
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:07,412
You are up.

475
00:44:08,651 --> 00:44:10,381
You were the one who had been by my side...

476
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:13,482
all along.

477
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:14,821
It was not me.

478
00:44:15,022 --> 00:44:17,462
Your new maid stayed...

479
00:44:19,892 --> 00:44:22,691
I mean, your soon-to-be wife stayed by your side.

480
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:26,702
She did not sleep for a moment and took care of you with devotion.

481
00:44:28,171 --> 00:44:29,432
Where is she right now?

482
00:44:52,421 --> 00:44:54,292
You cannot be out here.

483
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:56,892
When did you wake up?

484
00:44:57,401 --> 00:44:58,662
Do you not feel dizzy?

485
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:01,432
You should have called me when you woke up.

486
00:45:01,602 --> 00:45:03,131
- Why did you come... - One at a time.

487
00:45:04,971 --> 00:45:06,441
Ask me one question at a time.

488
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:07,971
I am fine.

489
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:09,712
You almost could not wake up.

490
00:45:11,482 --> 00:45:12,881
You do not know anything.

491
00:45:14,852 --> 00:45:15,881
I do know...

492
00:45:18,022 --> 00:45:19,381
one thing for sure.

493
00:45:22,622 --> 00:45:24,321
That once again, you missed your chance...

494
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:29,591
to kill me.

495
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:36,171
Why did you do that?

496
00:45:38,171 --> 00:45:40,142
You had your chance to take my life.

497
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,881
I wanted to kill you.

498
00:45:47,182 --> 00:45:48,781
I really did.

499
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:52,781
Then why did you stop?

500
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:58,861
Why did I do that?

501
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:03,332
Instead of wanting to kill you,

502
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:08,332
why was I more concerned...

503
00:46:08,872 --> 00:46:10,741
that you would not wake up again?

504
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:16,542
That is...

505
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:21,451
because I still do not deem life as something precious.

506
00:46:21,452 --> 00:46:22,511
No.

507
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,122
That was not the reason.

508
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:28,991
I wanted to ask...

509
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:32,221
what I should do now.

510
00:46:34,131 --> 00:46:36,091
How am I supposed to live from now on...

511
00:46:36,662 --> 00:46:38,432
if I am unable to kill you?

512
00:46:41,372 --> 00:46:44,372
You were the only one who told me to stay alive.

513
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:51,642
You asked me to live, dreaming of the day I would kill you.

514
00:46:53,412 --> 00:46:55,881
I thought you would know the way...

515
00:46:56,952 --> 00:46:59,082
as my enemy who protected me at the risk of your own life.

516
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:10,091
I will think about...

517
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:13,832
how you shall live now.

518
00:47:17,241 --> 00:47:18,971
I will make sure...

519
00:47:22,571 --> 00:47:23,812
I look for the way.

520
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,542
Please promise me one thing.

521
00:47:29,482 --> 00:47:31,522
Do not disappear from before my eyes.

522
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:35,852
I can bear through...

523
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:40,162
these tormenting days because you are there.

524
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:45,531
Even though...

525
00:47:48,002 --> 00:47:49,832
I put you in that torment?

526
00:47:51,142 --> 00:47:53,542
I must be out of my mind.

527
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:57,482
I feel relieved...

528
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:00,111
just to see you here.

529
00:48:16,332 --> 00:48:17,631
I do not know...

530
00:48:20,571 --> 00:48:22,502
what I will do with myself.

531
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:27,971
I also do not know anymore.

532
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:56,171
I had that dream again.

533
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:27,131
What's wrong with me?

534
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,642
It's so silly of me to cry.

535
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:35,111
Everything I said yesterday would become a joke if I did this.

536
00:49:40,182 --> 00:49:41,611
Is your resentment that profound?

537
00:49:42,852 --> 00:49:44,682
It's been 1,500 years.

538
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:46,551
Can't you just play it cool and forget about it?

539
00:49:49,622 --> 00:49:51,292
Was I too harsh?

540
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,671
I apologize for responding too late.

541
00:50:08,312 --> 00:50:11,141
I'd like to meet you and talk at Jun O's place today.

542
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:12,281
Right.

543
00:50:13,682 --> 00:50:15,452
I asked Mr. Han to meet me.

544
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,551
We're having someone?

545
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:20,991
Ms. Kang.

546
00:50:22,892 --> 00:50:24,892
She said she wanted to discuss something with me.

547
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:28,491
I thought it'd be nice to talk over a meal.

548
00:50:31,832 --> 00:50:32,861
That's a surprise.

549
00:50:33,602 --> 00:50:36,732
If I said Ms. Kang of all people was coming over,

550
00:50:36,971 --> 00:50:38,701
I thought you'd be more thrilled.

551
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,611
There is a right time for everything.

552
00:50:41,812 --> 00:50:44,412
And last time we talked,

553
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:48,582
you did not seem too fond of Young Hwa.

554
00:50:49,452 --> 00:50:51,921
Who would do this for you if I did not do it as a brother?

555
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:55,892
You even asked me to do you a favour.

556
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:00,421
I'll get it.

557
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:08,232
You're here.

558
00:51:08,272 --> 00:51:11,171
I'm sorry for the short notice. Thank you for coming.

559
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:14,611
It's all right. I wanted to see you first.

560
00:51:14,812 --> 00:51:15,841
Come on in.

561
00:51:16,372 --> 00:51:18,281
Wait, Mr. Han.

562
00:51:20,082 --> 00:51:22,812
I'd like to talk to you away from Jun O.

563
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:27,281
You want to talk to me alone without Jun O?

564
00:51:33,221 --> 00:51:34,861
What are you doing, Young Hwa?

565
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:36,631
You came to tell him everything.

566
00:51:36,932 --> 00:51:39,901
Don't be shaken because of the dream. Just tell him.

567
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:43,432
I can't continue like this.

568
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:45,841
What do you mean?

569
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:49,542
I can't work as Han Jun O's bodyguard anymore.

570
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:51,481
I signed the contract with you...

571
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:52,981
thinking I could help him...

572
00:51:52,982 --> 00:51:55,081
because he was terminally ill and deeply traumatized.

573
00:51:55,082 --> 00:51:56,482
But he lied about everything.

574
00:51:56,982 --> 00:51:59,721
He pulled all kinds of tricks to pass away to the other side.

575
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:01,421
That was how I ended up getting suspended.

576
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:04,920
Therefore, the contract I signed was not valid from the start.

577
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,821
I want to break off this contract.

578
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,901
Are you not going to say anything?

579
00:52:15,702 --> 00:52:16,702
Right.

580
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,872
Well...

581
00:52:19,901 --> 00:52:21,971
What I'm trying to say is...

582
00:52:25,482 --> 00:52:27,651
Han Jun O is actually dead.

583
00:52:28,352 --> 00:52:30,280
The man you believe to be your brother is...

584
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:32,182
only human on the outside because he's actually a ghost.

585
00:52:32,781 --> 00:52:35,122
How am I going to tell him this?

586
00:52:35,191 --> 00:52:36,191
It's all right.

587
00:52:37,022 --> 00:52:40,191
I need to know everything when it comes to Jun O.

588
00:52:40,932 --> 00:52:42,531
We do not have much time together anyway.

589
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:44,901
There is nothing we need to hide.

590
00:52:46,301 --> 00:52:47,671
Actually...

591
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:53,801
Since he now has an official girlfriend,

592
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:59,042
I didn't think it'd be a good idea to stay here with Jun O.

593
00:52:59,642 --> 00:53:01,051
I wanted to tell you that.

594
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:04,452
Didn't you tell me this before?

595
00:53:05,321 --> 00:53:06,321
Right.

596
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:08,122
I did.

597
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:10,521
I must have forgotten.

598
00:53:10,522 --> 00:53:13,091
I've been out of it.

599
00:53:13,892 --> 00:53:15,131
I'm sorry.

600
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:18,962
My gosh. Goodness.

601
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:22,232
Gosh.

602
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:26,241
What's all this?

603
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:28,241
You didn't make everything, did you?

604
00:53:29,441 --> 00:53:31,611
I've cooked every now and then since when I was younger,

605
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:33,582
after I began to live alone with Jun O.

606
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:36,551
Mr. Han, you're so amazing.

607
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:38,151
I agree. It's amazing.

608
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:41,151
I can't believe you came here again...

609
00:53:43,691 --> 00:53:44,761
just to eat a meal.

610
00:53:45,491 --> 00:53:46,892
Why do you sound so rude?

611
00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:50,062
I decided to invite her today...

612
00:53:50,801 --> 00:53:52,131
and thank her for her hard work.

613
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:53,631
She said it first.

614
00:53:55,002 --> 00:53:56,301
That she never wants to see me anymore.

615
00:53:57,102 --> 00:53:58,142
Did something happen?

616
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:00,171
No, nothing happened.

617
00:54:00,602 --> 00:54:02,011
He must have misunderstood me...

618
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:04,610
when I said I didn't want to see him...

619
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:06,241
looking sick anymore.

620
00:54:11,522 --> 00:54:13,852
May I dig in before the food turns cold?

621
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:15,622
Thank you for the food.

622
00:54:16,091 --> 00:54:19,462
It's almost as if you bought this vongole pasta at a restaurant.

623
00:54:19,562 --> 00:54:22,631
It's a special dish I made just for you, Young Hwa.

624
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,662
Jun O doesn't really like seafood.

625
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:27,531
It began when he was younger,

626
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,872
the day he climbed up a rock to harvest some clams...

627
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:32,372
and fell into the sea.

628
00:54:34,511 --> 00:54:35,571
Do you remember that?

629
00:54:39,482 --> 00:54:40,542
I'm not sure.

630
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:50,452
Just answer your brother when he asks you a question.

631
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:54,562
Sure.

632
00:54:55,991 --> 00:54:57,062
Right?

633
00:54:57,801 --> 00:54:58,901
You remember it too.

634
00:54:59,531 --> 00:55:02,301
You rarely ate clam since that day.

635
00:55:03,502 --> 00:55:06,542
You said the taste of salt water came back to you when you ate it.

636
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,171
Yes, right.

637
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:16,511
Why don't we grab a glass of wine?

638
00:55:17,082 --> 00:55:18,252
Sure, that sounds great.

639
00:55:19,122 --> 00:55:21,651
Jun O, you're a patient, so you can stick to water.

640
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:23,221
As you wish.

641
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:36,070
You seem to enjoy your noodles...

642
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:38,471
when you're sitting before someone you swore never to see again.

643
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:41,571
I also feel very uncomfortable on the inside.

644
00:55:41,712 --> 00:55:43,812
You're very inconsistent.

645
00:55:44,171 --> 00:55:45,712
I thought you played it cool and forgot everything.

646
00:55:48,582 --> 00:55:51,451
I'm sorry for the harsh words I said to you that day.

647
00:55:51,452 --> 00:55:54,151
But there's no need to let him find out this problem between us.

648
00:55:54,591 --> 00:55:56,720
Will you act as if everything is fine when Mr. Han is around?

649
00:55:56,721 --> 00:56:00,122
If you wanted to do that, you shouldn't have come here at all.

650
00:56:00,292 --> 00:56:02,191
Do you think I want to be here?

651
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:05,001
I was trying my hardest to play it cool...

652
00:56:05,002 --> 00:56:06,860
because I felt so bad for Mr. Han...

653
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:09,031
who made a huge feast for his brother's sake.

654
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:11,071
Is it that hard to play along?

655
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,002
I can't help it.

656
00:56:13,142 --> 00:56:16,071
I'm not Han Jun O anyway.

657
00:56:19,812 --> 00:56:21,452
This is your problem.

658
00:56:22,682 --> 00:56:25,522
The reason for your death is the only thing you want to know.

659
00:56:27,082 --> 00:56:29,391
What if Mr. Han found out that his only brother...

660
00:56:29,392 --> 00:56:30,892
had already passed away?

661
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,261
Can you imagine how painful that will be?

662
00:56:36,732 --> 00:56:38,901
I'm not talking about the pain of your own death.

663
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,971
Do you know anything about the pain of those who are left behind?

664
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:43,702
I also...

665
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:45,372
Do you want to say, "It was inevitable," again?

666
00:56:46,042 --> 00:56:47,941
truly feel terrible about it.

667
00:56:49,471 --> 00:56:50,542
I also know...

668
00:56:52,982 --> 00:56:54,452
the huge sense of loss and pain...

669
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,551
felt by the ones...

670
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:03,191
who are left behind...

671
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:04,991
after their loved one's death.

672
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:09,591
When your parents passed away,

673
00:57:11,062 --> 00:57:12,162
I was also there...

674
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:15,531
with you.

675
00:57:23,142 --> 00:57:24,741
I picked a very special bottle.

676
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:27,182
I hope you like it.

677
00:57:27,952 --> 00:57:28,982
Thanks.

678
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,491
What's wrong?

679
00:57:43,232 --> 00:57:45,962
It felt like someone had been following us.

680
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:49,301
- Who? - It must be my imagination.

681
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:01,781
You were wrong.

682
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,721
I was the one who climbed up a rock...

683
00:58:10,191 --> 00:58:11,591
and fell into the sea as a kid.

684
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:15,861
It wasn't you, Jun O.

685
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,212
You didn't have to walk me home.

686
00:58:30,712 --> 00:58:32,482
I only came out because Min O asked.

687
00:58:33,912 --> 00:58:35,912
You also want me to play along...

688
00:58:36,252 --> 00:58:38,122
with that pitiable man.

689
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,122
That is...

690
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:42,752
the least I can do...

691
00:58:44,022 --> 00:58:45,892
while I borrow this body.

692
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:50,732
You know it very well now and leave me no words.

693
00:58:53,602 --> 00:58:54,772
I apologize.

694
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:01,941
For all those thoughtless things I said to you.

695
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:04,441
When you told me to play it cool and forget it?

696
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:08,582
It's not like I've been in your situation.

697
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:11,011
But I played it down as if it was easy.

698
00:59:13,522 --> 00:59:14,622
Actually,

699
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:17,321
my dream went on a bit further,

700
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:19,821
and I felt quite bad.

701
00:59:21,962 --> 00:59:23,031
What if...

702
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:28,502
you and Ri Ta met in a different time and setting?

703
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:30,772
I felt sorry.

704
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:36,441
That's why...

705
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:39,781
I'll keep dreaming.

706
00:59:41,082 --> 00:59:42,151
What?

707
00:59:42,611 --> 00:59:44,381
I became a bit curious...

708
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:48,191
about how things would end between you and Ri Ta.

709
01:00:27,622 --> 01:00:30,361
(Moon in the Day)

710
01:00:30,932 --> 01:00:33,461
You felt like my old guardian deity.

711
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:36,301
Go back and dream some more instead of talking nonsense.

712
01:00:36,772 --> 01:00:39,372
Your brother is possessed by an evil spirit.

713
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,212
Do you think I'll believe you?

714
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:42,940
I have a bad premonition today.

715
01:00:42,941 --> 01:00:44,880
Don't go anywhere and stay by my side today.

716
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:46,812
You won't follow me to the fire station, will you?

717
01:00:47,482 --> 01:00:48,581
No.

718
01:00:48,582 --> 01:00:51,221
There is a unique mark left on a body possessed by an evil spirit.

719
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:54,351
This time,

720
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:56,551
I will not let you die in someone else's hands.
