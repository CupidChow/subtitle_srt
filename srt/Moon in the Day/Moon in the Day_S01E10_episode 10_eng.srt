1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,500

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,500

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,450

4
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,230

5
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,490

6
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,100

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,100

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,040
Joon Oh!

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,070
Han Joon Oh!

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,710
Around where did you part with him again?

11
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,980
Near the cliff over there.

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,040
I thought he went back to the campsite.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
- Where did he go? 
 - Don't worry, CEO Han.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,490
You know I was a firefighter.

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,330
Searching is my specialty. Let's go where he disappeared first.

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,270
Han Joon Oh!

17
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,060
Answer me, Han Joon Oh!

18
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,510
Han Joon Oh!

19
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,260
Kang Yeong Hwa.

20
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,180
Kang Yeong...

21
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,930
No.

22
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,820
No, Kang Yeong Hwa. No.

23
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,470
Han Joon Oh.

24
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,820
Han Joon Oh!

25
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,290
Han Joon Oh.

26
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,020
 Did he leave already, by chance?

27
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,080
 No, he wouldn't have left without telling me.

28
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,830
Around what time did you part with him exactly?

29
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,330
CEO Han.

30
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,860
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,160
I'll have to burden you for the last time...

32
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,510
for my brother, Ms. Kang.

33
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,830
Pardon?

34
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,920
Don't think this is unfair.

35
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,630
This is all because of your karma from your previous life.

36
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,890
What are you talking about?

37
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,130
 Kang Yeong Hwa!

38
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,820
Kang Yeong Hwa...

39
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,630
Kang Yeong Hwa!

40
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,100
Help me!

41
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,210
Help me!

42
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,240
 No...

43
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,340
 Hang on, Kang Yeong Hwa...

44
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,250
 No.

45
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,560
 If I knew this would happen...

46
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,600
 I would've been honest with you earlier.

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,390
 I would've told you not to leave.

48
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,180
 And stay longer by my side.

49
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,420

50
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,810

Okay. Let me see.

51
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,210
- I'm holding tightly. 
 - Gosh.

52
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,410
Fix that there. Hurry.

53
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,950
Let us move this.

54
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,540
I am serious.

55
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,540
 Mother. Father.

56
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,540
 In a few days,

57
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,510
 I will be marrying my enemy.

58
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,300
 He always risks his life to protect me.

59
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,710
 I cannot either kill him

60
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,320
 nor love him.

61
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,770
 Can I go against filial piety like this?

62
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,340
 I heard you have not been coming out of your room.

63
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,580
I said I will figure out...

64
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,320
how you should live...

65
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,300
but I have not given you any answer yet.

66
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,070
 Maybe I already...

67
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,120
know the answer,

68
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,190
but I am disregarding it.

69
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,680
Because I want to...

70
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,970
keep you...

71
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,850
by my side a little longer.

72
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,050
I am sorry.

73
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
I came here just to tell you that.

74
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,740
There you were.

75
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,820
Did you come to see me?

76
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,160
The wedding is right around the corner.

77
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,210
It would be bad if the bride disappeared.

78
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,680
I was just kidding.

79
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,200
You looked so somber.

80
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,480
I was actually about to visit you.

81
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,830
About...

82
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,200
what you told me earlier—

83
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
I do not...

84
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,040
think you need to tell me.

85
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,400
What is this?

86
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,910
This is the last chance.

87
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,200
My father must have put guards on the path to Great Gaya.

88
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,750
So go north.

89
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,980
The people of Gaya moved to the northern seaside.

90
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,550
You should...

91
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,070
start a new life there.

92
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,910
I am sorry my answer was delayed.

93
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,460
How about you, My Lord?

94
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,520
If you let me go like this—

95
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,540
I told you, did I not?

96
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,900
I started desiring life ever since I met you.

97
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,490
Letting you go makes more sense than...

98
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,800
- keeping you shackled to me. 
 - You are lying.

99
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,760
You want to live, but you are letting me go?

100
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,390
Just be honest with me.

101
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,670
Do not say it is for me.

102
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,360
Do not use anyone as an excuse.

103
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,880
Tell me why you said...

104
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,180
you want to keep me by your side.

105
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,650
I...

106
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,600
want you...

107
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,930
to leave.

108
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,620
That is how I truly feel.

109
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,780
Han Ri Ta.

110
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,130
If you really mean that,

111
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,550
will you make a bet with me, My Lord?

112
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,340
If you do not look back

113
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,460
until you cross here...

114
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,670
Will you promise me then?

115
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,550
That you will leave here immediately?

116
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,940
But if I win,

117
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,130
you have to admit it, too.

118
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,770
That you actually do not want me to leave.

119
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,250
But I will win.

120
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,690
I do not think I will lose, either.

121
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,260
Will you...

122
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,070
really not look back?

123
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,390
Do not blame me.

124
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,770
You are the one...

125
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,740
who proposed the bet.

126
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,870
I mean it.

127
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,450
If you do not look back now,

128
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,360
this will be our last time together.

129
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,390
You are cheating.

130
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,230
I know I am cheating.

131
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,730
If you and I...

132
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,130
regardless of our ill-fated relationship,

133
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,440
if we were just ordinary,

134
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,060
what would that have been like?

135
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,160
How nice would it have been...

136
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,620
if we were just ordinary?

137
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,580
If we were,

138
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,610
we would not have had a reason to meet, either.

139
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,990
I won, then.

140
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,070
Do not be upset.

141
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,220
Men tend not to understand my true intentions.

142
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,020
I never said I do not understand.

143
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,560
Are you sure...

144
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,400
you will not regret it?

145
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,050
I think...

146
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,070
I will regret it.

147
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,990
But I no longer...

148
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,070
can help it.

149
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,390

150

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:16,470
cannot help it, either.

153
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:22,650
♫  The sound of you breathing, sleeping next to me  ♫

154
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:33,120
♫  was the only thing I ever prayed for  ♫

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,500
We need to get back now.

161
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,800
Everyone will be looking for the bride and groom.

162
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,140
Since tomorrow is our wedding,

163
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,880
I have to go to the Wolseong Palace and see His Majesty.

164
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,560
So I would like to listen...

165
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,550
to your voice a little longer.

 My Lord.

170
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,200
Come to your senses.

171
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,120
Come up here.

172
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,990
Thank you.

173
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,560
You saved me.

174
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,310
See?

175
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,340
You are my guardian angel.

176
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,410
It was just good luck.

177
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,830
When I was facing death,

178
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,030
I regretted it.

179
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,110
"I can't say goodbye to you like this."

180
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,560
That I didn't get to say that.

181
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,940
I won't tell you to stay forever.

182
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,480
Could you just...

183
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,520
stay by my side a little longer?

184
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,950
 Would I...

185
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,320
 be able to kill you?

186
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,470
Kang Yeong Hwa.

187
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,600
What's wrong with me all of a sudden?

188
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,300
Kang Yeong Hwa.

189
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,850
Wake up.

190
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,170
I'm at the Mt. Geummoon Campsite in Myeongdae Village, Gyeonggi-do.

191
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,610
One of us ended up...

192
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,630
 A woman in her 20s at the Mt. Geummoon Campsite. Right?

193
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,400
 We were already notified, and we're on our way.

194
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,300
You were already notified?

195
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,660
Think of it as a mild concussion.

196
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,800
But since it's an invisible wound,

197
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,700
you should still check back later and be thoroughly examined.

198
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,200
Okay.

199
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,860
See? I told you it's nothing.

200
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,450
Didn't you just hear him?

201
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,220
He said you have to check again later.

202
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,410
Only if I show signs—

203
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,360
You should just listen.

204
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,000
I know my body better than anyone.

205
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,260
You would've died if I showed up a little later.

206
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,150
The incident at the cliff...

207
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,420
Han Min Oh did that. Right?

208
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,750
Did you already know?

209
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,720
He seems to have disappeared. So...

210
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,140
let's get help from the police first.

211
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,950
Hold on.

212
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,830
There's something I want to ask him.

213
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,000
I keep thinking about the last thing...

214
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,920
He said it was all because...

215
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,160
of my karma from my previous life.

216
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,320
I have karma from my previous life?

217
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,150
I don't know what that means, either.

218
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,390
How does he know about my previous life?

219
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,240
Do you know anything, by chance?

220
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,840
How does Han Min Oh...

221
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,550
Stay right here and wait for me.

222
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,470
I need to save Joon Oh.

223
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,680

224
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,830
What's with you?

225
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,490
Why did you do that?

226
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,610
Joon Oh.

227
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,810
You already know that I'm not Han Joon Oh.

228
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,020
Why did you try to kill Kang Yeong Hwa?

229
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,110
How did you know about her karma from her previous life?

230
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,770
I was just trying to save my brother.

231
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,350
Because if she dies,

232
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,280
I will get you back.

233
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,460
What are you talking about?

234
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,810
I heard Kang Yeong Hwa needs to die to save you.

235
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,370
I had no choice.

236
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,940
I had to save my brother.

237
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,670
Han Min Oh.

238
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,750
You're out of your mind.

239
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,820
For the long period of time I've been living,

240
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,090
that hasn't happened even once.

241
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,600
What evidence do you have that you're spewing nonsense like that?

242
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,450
What do you mean, nonsense?

243
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,970
No life gets saved by killing someone.

244
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,880
You just...

245
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,270
almost killed someone.

246
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,250
In order to save your brother's life,

247
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,510
she risked her life so many times.

248
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,690
If...

249
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,310
she had died,

250
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,020
you would've...

251
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,280
lived in hell because of the guilt.

252
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,550
Because that's what you've done.

253
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,450
Do you still not get it?

254
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,670
Your brother Han Joon Oh...

255
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,420
is already dead.

256
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,860
Don't say he's dead.

257
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,490
There's no way.

258
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,250
You saw it yourself.

259
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,380
His cold, dead body after being announced dead.

260
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,710
You committed a grave sin by trying to kill Kang Yeong Hwa,

261
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,440
but I won't punish you.

262
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,800
Because you and your brother seem to have tragic fates, too.

263
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,500
Don't ever...

264
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,980
get near Kang Yeong Hwa.

265
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,220
Do you mean everything he said...

266
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,930
was a lie, then?

267
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,080
What did you just say...

268
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,400
 I...

269
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,520
 would like you to take care of yourself first.

270
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,970
What exactly have I done...

271
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,630
I actually...

272
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,750
want to go home and be alone today.

273
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,360
Would that be okay?

274
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,750
Is it because of Han Min Oh?

275
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,610
I have to die for Han Joon Oh to live?

276
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,870
I don't get it, no matter how much I think about it.

277
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,030
How did he end up thinking that?

278
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,350
Don't think too much about it.

279
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,890
You just need to be by my side for now.

280
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,600
You don't know what danger will approach and when.

281
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,850
You've said this before. Right?

282
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,920
As if you predicted what was going to happen today.

283
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,200
You've been telling me that I'm in danger...

284
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,730
You told me to stay away from CEO Han, too.

285
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,990
Did you already know, by chance?

286
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,980
What's important now is that you're still not safe.

287
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,270
If you trust me, let's go inside for now.

288
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,280
I beg you.

289
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,100
Get some rest for now.

290
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,250
Let me know if you get hungry.

291
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,380
There must be something to eat.

292
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,290
There's something I don't know. Right?

293
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,020
My karma from my previous life that CEO Han mentioned.

294
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,470
Does it have to do with that?

295
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,250
A delusional person who tried to kill you said that.

296
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,150
Don't worry about it.

297
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,770
What's our curse, then?

298
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,740
I disregarded it last time because I felt bad about your lingering feelings.

299
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,480
But thinking about it, it's so strange.

300
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,130
How did your curse end up becoming ours?

301
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,950
You always seemed to be hiding something from me.

302
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,120
I've been ignoring it so far, but not anymore.

303
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,900
What are you hiding from me?

304
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,460
By "we," you mean it has to do with me, too.

305
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,230
Sometimes...

306
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,200
it's better not to know about things.

307
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,160
No.

308
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,570
I need to know.

309
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:36,050
I don't want to be dragged around by karma, a curse, or whatnot without knowing anything.

310
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,960
So...

311
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,480
tell me.

312
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,990
Kang Yeong Hwa.

313
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,180
You...

314
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,150
will die before you turn 30.

315
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,650
What?

316
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,230
It's been repeated in your 18 reincarnations.

317
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,920
That's your curse.

318
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,700

319
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,290
The end of your current life

320
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,440
is approaching very soon.

321
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,110
You couldn't remember me,

322
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,290
but you'll remember your sin soon.

323
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,830
Seok Cheol Hwan!

324
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,660
Was it all a lie?

325
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,900
You said Joon Oh would come back if I killed Kang Yeong Hwa!

326
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,210
Was it all a lie?

327
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,460
Your voice is too loud.

328
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,710
What?

329
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,540
You're the one who couldn't even kill some girl.

330
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,320
How did I know?

331
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,340
Because this horrible mark will disappear only if she dies.

332
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,190
But it's still here.

333
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,600
Have you always been this weak?

334
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,520
I believed you when you were moping around when your useless and obnoxious brother died.

335
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,860
But I ended up wasting my precious time because of you.

336
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,520
Is it true that Joon Oh's already dead, then?

337
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,900
You're crazy for believing me.

338
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,800
A soul that lost its body can't come back. That never happened before.

339
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,270
No more questions. Right?

340
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,860
I don't have a lot of time left, either.

341
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,450
Who are you exactly?

342
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,410
I told you...

343
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,140
about the evil spirit that's been living for over a thousand years.

344
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,630
Why did you use me...

345
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,500
- to do such an awful thing? 
 - Don't worry.

346
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,340
There are plenty of other people

347
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,810
who will kill Kang Yeong Hwa for me.

348
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,010
I need to let Joon Oh know.

349
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,200
I have to tell him...

350
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,000
I have to tell Joon Oh somehow...

351
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,780
 Die?

352
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,600
 Me?

353
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,460
 Out of my 18 previous lives,

354
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,860
 I was never someone who made history.

355
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,020
 Is it because the average lifespan was short back then?

356
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,710
 Strangely, I see a lot of people who died young.

357
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,340
 All of those people...

358
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,510
 died young because of the curse?

359
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,110
Are you okay?

360
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,700
How could I be okay?

361
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,010
I was just told that I'll die when I'm 30.

362
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,950
I can't believe it because it's so absurd.

363
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,710
I'm sure you're confused now, but—

364
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,320
Yes.

365
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,670
Some of them could've died when they were young.

366
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,350
So, did you see it?

367
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,890
Did you really see all of the 18 reincarnations

368
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,140
dying before they turn 30?

369
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,730
I...

370
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,260
saw every single one of your previous deaths.

371
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,780
 That's how I realized...

372
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,820
 that for 1,500 years,

373
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,870
 you continuously died and I...

374
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,800
 stay by your side

375
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,750
 and watch you without being able to stop it.

376
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,960
That's the horrible curse...

377
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,480
we ended up with.

378
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,510
Maybe it won't happen just once.

379
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,110
There are exceptions in everything—

380
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,960
You're the one who asked about the curse after what happened today.

381
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,540
Do you think all of the accidents you almost died in

382
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,550
were just coincidences?

383
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,190
 Move, Han Joon Oh!

384
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,180
Why didn't you tell me sooner, then?

385
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,660
If it was so definite, why didn't you say anything?

386
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,760
Even if I did,

387
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,430
nothing would've changed.

388
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,630
No.

389
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,970
You changed it just now.

390
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,330
You saved me at the cliff earlier.

391
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,500
 Kang Yeong Hwa.

392
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,870
Come to think of it...

393
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,980
you said there's a way to break the curse.

394
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,830
Isn't that why you told me not to have dreams?

395
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,670
How do you do it?

396
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,820
Please tell me.

397
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,120
 I have to...

398
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,320
 kill you to break the curse.

399
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,120
It might not work anymore.

400
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,460
I'm sorry.

401
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,090
There's no way right now.

402
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,950
Why would it suddenly not work...

403
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,020
Han Min Oh...

404
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,100

405
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,430
- Please help me over here! 
 - Okay.

406
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,730
Chest compression. Two, three.

407
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,380
More.

408
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,780
What happened?

409
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,900
Han Min Oh was found at a motel?

410
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,910
- What does that mean? 
 - Well, the thing is...

411
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,600
The owner of the motel called in and said someone passed out.

412
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,310
It's such an old motel that there's no CCTV footage.

413
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,920
But according to the circumstances and evidence,

414
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,600
someone likely attacked him.

415
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,110
- We'll handle this as a violent crime— 
 - Someone...

416
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,820
tried to kill Han Min Oh?

417
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,970
Who could it be?

418
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,490
We're investigating it as quickly as possible. Please wait a bit.

419
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,240
We'll be in touch again, then.

420
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,990

421
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,670
CEO Han was a good person as far as I know.

422
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,800
He wasn't someone who'd get attacked for no reason

423
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,310
and kill someone easily.

424
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,190
No matter what situation he was in,

425
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,480
it's undeniable that he chose to do it.

426
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,710
Him ending up that way...

427
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,560
has to do with my curse, too. Right?

428
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,110
I'm starting to get curious now.

429
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,950
What sin did I commit in my previous life that

430
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,240
the innocent people around me have to be tortured, too?

431
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,180
What kind of person was I in my previous life?

432
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,780
Not the version of me in my dream,

433
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,040
but the real me that you remember.

434
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,620
Han Ri Ta that I remember was...

435
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,370
CEO Han. CEO Han.

436
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,610
What happened to CEO Han Min Oh?

437
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,400
What's your relationship with the patient?

438
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,660
Don't you know I'm his lawyer?

439
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,070
What happened? Did he die?

440
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,520
Please leave. You can't do this here.

441
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,630
Well, I...

442
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,000
It's all his fault.

443
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,200
He...

444
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,340
 Do you mean everything he said...

445
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,780
 was a lie, then?

446
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,150
I need to run away. Run away.

447
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,340
I need to run away.

448
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,500
I'll call Mr. Jang. Have him drive you home immediately.

449
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,370
You can't meet anyone.

450
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,010
Got it?

451
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,080
 "That person."

452
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,190
 "Him."

453
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,700
 Is there someone I haven't noticed?

454
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,510
 If I missed something by chance...

455
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,320
Oh, no. I'm next...

456
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,210
I'm next...

457
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,370
You.

458
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,290
Joon Oh.

459
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,340
Do you know something about Han Min Oh?

460
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,620
What do you mean by that?

461
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,140
Just answer me.

462
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,590
Do you know why Han Min Oh ended up that way?

463
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,030
I don't know anything.

464
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,580
I have nothing to do with it, and I'm innocent!

465
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,060
You've killed someone, haven't you?

466
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,910
Did you put Han Min Oh in that state, too?

467
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,250
There's no way.

468
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,520
I just killed Goo Tae Joo by accident...

469
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,430
Goo Tae Joo was also...

470
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,360
killed, wasn't he?

471
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,480
No, no. I didn't do it.

472
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,890
That man. That man sabotaged me.

473
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,950
- That man? 
 - Yes.

474
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,310
Something was off from the beginning.

475
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,570
There's no way that was a coincidence.

476
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,900
Yes. I see it clearly now.

477
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,070
The one who used me to kill Goo Tae Joo and who did this to Han Min Oh is—

478
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,700
Hold on.

479
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,420
What happened?

480
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,500
What a shame.

481
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,190
I can't believe I missed him.

482
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,730
All of these people are so useless.

483
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,540
I need to change the strategy quickly.

484
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,110
Do Ha.

485
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,120
You can't find out about me yet.

486
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,030
So, how is that girl named Han Ri Ta doing?

487
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,320
She appeared to be staying in her room,

488
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,440
but she has been going out often lately.

489
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,610
Lord Do Ha visits her himself, too.

490
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,960
Tomorrow is the wedding.

491
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,720
Nothing can affect the plan.

492
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,630
Bring that girl to me.

493
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,210
Yes, My Lord.

494
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,670
I wonder how it feels to sacrifice one's life...

495
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,630
for someone else.

496
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:30,780
And how does a woman, who is about to marry the enemy...

497
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,090
who killed her parents, feel?

498
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,560
You can eat now.

499
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,150
You look composed. I wonder if Do Ha...

500
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,260
feels the same.

501
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,330
I am curious.

502
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,350
Do Ha, your enemy who killed your parents,

503
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,160
sacrificed himself for you.

504
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,510
Do you have feelings for your parents' enemy by chance?

505
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,000
To be dutiful as their child, I would have to be insane to do so.

506
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,540
The reason I am here

507
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,690
is to kill the enemy myself.

508
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,020
Please do not be so silly.

509
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,240
A duty as a child?

510
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,200
Do Ha started disobeying me.

511
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,700
Is it because of me?

512
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,940
Or is it because of you?

513
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,060
Disobeying me means he does not mind dying.

514
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,080
I will take revenge for you. Just make sure to get married tomorrow.

515
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,880
After the first night as a married couple,

516
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,840
Do Ha will go to the battlefield.

517
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,370
What do you mean by that?

518
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:57,180
The war with Baekje will be large in scale.

519
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,610
During that war, Do Ha...

520
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,730
must die gloriously.

521
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,730
For me.

522
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,730
For So Ri Bu.

523
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,100
 Even if I married you or not...

524
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,380
 must you end up dying regardless?

525
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,440
 I will make sure to...

526
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,110
 come back to you alive...

527
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,250
 Han Ri Ta.

528
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,240
By chance...

529
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:58,570
if both you and my soldiers fail to kill Do Ha,

530
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,690
I will let him live.

531
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,050
You need to be alive...

532
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,240
so Do Ha...

533
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,730
will not disobey me.

534
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,130
Do you not agree, Daughter-in-law?

535
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:30,510
Thank you so much for showing up in front of me, my daughter-in-law.

536
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,280
Thank you for congratulating us, Father.

537
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,860
These are prayer beads made with lotus seeds.

538
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,980
They will protect you from everything...

539
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,780
evil in this world.

540
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,440
From now on,

541
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,150
you are...

542
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,970
forever...

543
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,470
my one and...

544
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,840
only wife.

545
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,180
Even if death tears us apart.

546
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:22,240
How did someone like CEO Han end up that way...

547
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,840
I'm not sure if this is the right time to give you this,

548
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,770
but could you try opening that?

549
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,520
- This? 
 - Yes.

550
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,620
What's this?

551
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,730
CEO Han said he'd give you that himself.

552
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,760
He asked me to pick it up for him.

553
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,320
But he can't do that now.

554
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,010
So I'm giving it to you instead.

555
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:13,000
 He apparently found a bracelet that looks like the one that broke

556
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,610
 when you saved Joon Oh and ordered it himself.

557
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,090
 How come you have this...

558
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,420
 I found it at the accident scene.

559
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,600
 It looked like yours.

560
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,730
 Do you mean my bracelet has been protecting me?

561
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:52,560
 Most of the time, they protect their owners from

562
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,230
 evil spirits or ghosts.

563
00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:00,980
 They prevent you from seeing or hearing them, too.

564
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:09,190
 I don't know how I ended up with that precious talisman,

565
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,840
 but the objects that contain strong hopes

566
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,310
 end up finding their owners eventually.

567
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,940
 These are prayer beads made with lotus seeds.

568
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,820
 They will protect you from everything...

569
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:33,250
 evil in this world.

570
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,050
 It's the same.

571
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:41,570
 If the lotus seed from 1,500 years ago came to me...

572
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,300
Venerable.

573
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,730
That lady came.

574
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,200
Who came?

575
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,500
No matter what you ask,

576
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,360
I will not be able to offer any solutions.

577
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,330
That thing is...

578
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:26,280
I had a dream.

579
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:33,200
Someone gave this lotus seed to his lover to protect her in the previous life.

580
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,380
His hope traveled 1,500 years and ended up with me.

581
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:41,670
I need to know how that was possible now.

582
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,080
What kind of relationship did we have

583
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,260
in our previous lives that it's still affecting me?

584
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,170
Is there really karma from my previous life that I'm not aware of?

585
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,800
You still only ask questions I can't answer.

586
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,960
I know, too.

587
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,770
I've been seeing his illusions since I was a kid

588
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:04,880
and I have dreams about my previous life.

589
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,420
And this unbelievable curse that will kill me before I turn 30...

590
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,350
There's nothing you can do about it.

591
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:14,090
But I need to know why, at least.

592
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,460
What sin did I commit in my previous life that

593
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:20,590
everyone around me, including myself, needs to be tortured, too?

594
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,720
Do you think the previous life and current life

595
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,450
have nothing to do with each other?

596
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,390
Of course.

597
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,650
Because I'm Kang Yeong Hwa, not that woman in the past.

598
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,930
How about your feelings toward the lost soul?

599
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,270
- Pardon? 
 - Perhaps what's happening to you now

600
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:51,100
might give you a chance to break the eternal cycle of birth.

601
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,460
What do you mean by that?

602
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,230
Your karma is something you have to learn in each life.

603
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:59,320
Therefore, the answer you must find...

604
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,600
is not with me.

605
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,730
Be courageous, face your sin yourself,

606
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,710
and look inside your heart.

607
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:15,030
That's where the answer lies.

608
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:39,670
 There's a third party involved in our curse that I'm unaware of?

609
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,840
 There's no way.

610
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,270
 Even if there is, there's no way I didn't notice.

611
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,510

612
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:03,160
Oh, h-hello. Y-You know me. Right?

613
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,580
I need to do something for work here. Please leave for a second.

614
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,810
You look surprised. It's okay, it's okay.

615
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,810
It's okay.

616
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,480

617
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,970
There's no time. Look quickly.

618
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:19,380
Seok Cheol Hwan, the man you mentioned, came here and met Han Min Oh. Right?

619
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,570
It's true that I arranged the meeting that day,

620
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,140
but I didn't think it'd get this serious.

621
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,020
Look for him, I said.

622
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,550
 You.

623
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,590
 Who are you?

624
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:11,960
 How about your feelings toward the lost soul?

625
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,210
 What's happening to you now

626
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,310
 might give you a chance to

627
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:22,490
 break the eternal cycle of birth.

628
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:29,320
 My feelings toward you.

♫  Out of countless people  ♫

630

637
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,120
 When I was facing death,

638
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,270
 I regretted it.

639
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,090
 I didn't get to say, "I can't say goodbye to you like this."

640
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,020
 It...

641
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,570
 turns out I like you.

 have nothing to do with each other?

646
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:48,000
Ms. Kang Yeong Hwa, you won't fail to recognize me this time. Right?

647
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,990
I run into you often.

648
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,560
Relationships from a previous life rarely get disconnected.

649
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,570
Pardon?

650
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,570
Just like the moment you fell for Do Ha,

651
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:12,060
you and his tragic fate keep repeating itself.

652
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:33,590

 Han Ri Ta, check my wound with your two hands.

659
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,660
 Was it very painful? The moment you died?

660
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,490
 Where's Seok Cheol Hwan right now?

661
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,950
 He's not as easy as you think.

662
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,480
 Do Ha asked for all of this.

663
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,890
 I will protect you.

664
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,910
 I killed you.

665
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,180
 With these two hands.

666
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,430
♫  Like predetermined rules...  ♫
