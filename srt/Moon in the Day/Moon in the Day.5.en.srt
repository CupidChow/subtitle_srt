00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,019
(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,020
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:51,049
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,249
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

5
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,490
Lie down here.

6
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:56,859
Good.

7
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:59,490
Gosh.

8
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,670
My diagnosis is that you should go to the hospital.

9
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,600
But you keep insisting, so I won't go any further from here.

10
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,639
I said I was fine.

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,910
I'm a better judge of emergency patients.

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,910
I'll bring you porridge, so eat that for now.

13
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,148
You took medication on an empty stomach...

14
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,479
I'm seriously okay.

15
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,149
Or I'll call an ambulance.

16
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:42,500
What are you?

17
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:45,970
Who are you?

18
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,240
Even 1,500 years ago and now,

19
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:55,179
you always make me weak.

20
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:59,119
Who on earth are you?

21
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,990
And...

22
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,459
why am I so hesitant?

23
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,139
Here.

24
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,169
I got you a special treat because I'm scared you might faint again.

25
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,669
So enjoy the whole thing.

26
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:25,150
Why do you do this for me?

27
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,078
A firefighter's job is to save people's lives.

28
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,350
Don't make light of my sense of duty.

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,519
"Save people's lives?"

30
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,489
You?

31
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,370
Why is he so cold to someone who saved his life numerous times?

32
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,310
Don't skip any meals.

33
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,380
If you do, I'll come back!

34
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,459
(CEO Han Min O)

35
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,930
I apologize for asking you to meet so late at night.

36
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,699
I thought I should listen to Jun O's conditions in person.

37
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,069
Of course. I understand.

38
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,810
You said I was the only one who knew about Jun O's illness.

39
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,738
Since he was so uncompromising,

40
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,049
I never told anyone and let him do whatever he wanted.

41
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,850
But I wonder if my choices are making his condition worse.

42
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,919
I can't help but blame myself.

43
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:48,530
I've been to countless scenes of accidents.

44
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,469
- Hi. - You saved his life.

45
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,168
- Sure. - Thank you.

46
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:57,639
And I've witnessed many deaths that came without warning.

47
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:00,469
Do you know what I felt the most from them?

48
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,739
Thank you so much.

49
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,479
The loss that the remaining ones feel...

50
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,410
from losing...

51
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,449
their loved ones.

52
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,289
So,

53
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,289
I think it's too soon to blame yourself or regret things.

54
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,459
What's important right now is...

55
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,660
doing your best so that you won't regret it.

56
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,599
You should fill the little time...

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,629
you have left with love and affection.

58
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,910
Anyway, I'll look after him by his side. Don't worry too much.

59
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,539
Young Hwa,

60
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,549
I'm only apologetic and thankful for you.

61
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,559
I can't believe I'm hungry in this situation.

62
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,830
There are certainly some changes in my body.

63
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,510
Young Hwa...

64
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,609
resembles Han Ri Ta.

65
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,150
But she wouldn't have any memories from the past.

66
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,419
So, how does she recognize me?

67
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,460
Wouldn't it be because she is Han Ri Ta?

68
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:32,169
I have your schedule for the week.

69
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,270
By the way, who is Han Ri Ta?

70
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,609
The person who confined me here.

71
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:49,580
Like your ex-girlfriend?

72
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:53,820
Never mind.

73
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,390
The important part is...

74
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,629
that her 19th incarnation is...

75
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:01,929
Young Hwa.

76
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,400
In short,

77
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,470
she's a woman that looks exactly like your ex.

78
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,010
But...

79
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,479
if it's her 19th incarnation, that means...

80
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,179
Your type must be consistent.

81
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,720
The similar looks aren't the issue.

82
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,419
The problem is that none of her 18 incarnations...

83
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,859
have ever remembered me.

84
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,400
If you met the person who remembered you...

85
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,669
after 18 incarnations,

86
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,600
shouldn't you be happy?

87
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:51,549
(Moon in the Day)

88
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,280
(Episode 5)

89
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,150
The person who came to kill me...

90
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,890
is the one who tells me to live.

91
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,929
Why did he act like he felt so miserable?

92
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:05,890
That is better.

93
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,200
It was my first sleep in a long time.

94
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,420
You have missed a golden opportunity.

95
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,118
Is that an incense burner?

96
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,690
Yes. It is for the master.

97
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,029
He has trouble sleeping.

98
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,810
My lord.

99
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,850
What is that?

100
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,589
They are acorus roots.

101
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,988
It is supposed to calm...

102
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,290
your mind and body when you hold it between your lips.

103
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,570
The maid that you have taken in...

104
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,139
is quite clever.

105
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,940
Master, I have brought your washing water.

106
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:02,190
What are you doing?

107
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,960
He is not here.

108
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,600
Has he gone somewhere?

109
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,829
Baekje has attacked out of nowhere,

110
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,340
so he left early in the morning.

111
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,759
I cannot believe Lord So.

112
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,769
He must not turn a cold shoulder to a triumphant general.

113
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,409
I am glad that we are back in one piece.

114
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:28,440
Let us head inside.

115
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,729
I have come back, Father.

116
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,269
We managed to protect the wall, so the damage is small.

117
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,669
His Majesty asked for you,

118
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,239
so enter the palace first thing in the morning.

119
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:06,180
Yes, Father.

120
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:23,700
Come out now.

121
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,869
Continue.

122
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:38,810
One of the Gaya people recognized the girls' face?

123
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,349
They could not be sure, but she looked a lot like Han Ri Ta,

124
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,090
the daughter of Gaya's general.

125
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,489
If it's her, it means she's the daughter of the traitor.

126
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,158
And Do Ha let the daughter of a traitor in?

127
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,060
- Shall I go and arrest her now? - No.

128
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,670
We will give it time.

129
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,239
Perhaps, that girl may become...

130
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,170
a trap for Do Ha.

131
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,070
Yes, my lord.

132
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,029
I doubt that you stayed awake as you were worried about me.

133
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,769
I must worry...

134
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,310
because I cannot let anyone else kill you before me.

135
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,879
When I am dead,

136
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:48,050
what comes next?

137
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:52,119
What happens to you?

138
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,220
After I take your life,

139
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,560
I no longer have a purpose in life.

140
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:01,659
In that case,

141
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,930
I will have to persistently try to stay alive for a long time.

142
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,310
That way,

143
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,239
you will still have a reason to live.

144
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:19,009
Why do you tell me to live...

145
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,779
when you are so keen to die?

146
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,519
Perhaps I still have...

147
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,320
a desire to live in the back of my mind.

148
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:34,659
Who knows?

149
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,600
You and I both may find a reason if we keep on living.

150
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,139
Go ahead...

151
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,869
and open your hand.

152
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,460
I am returning the favour for the acorus roots.

153
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,730
Lotus seeds are extremely hard...

154
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,730
that they won't sprout unless you grind them.

155
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,199
It's due to their hardness...

156
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,908
that they can stay underground...

157
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:20,209
for a thousand years without rotting.

158
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,780
But to blossom,

159
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,780
you will have to cut the seed.

160
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,990
Why do you give me such a thing?

161
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,159
So that you will stay as strong...

162
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,230
as this seed that can endure a thousand years without rotting.

163
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:43,530
Hang in there,

164
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,500
and flowers may bloom one day.

165
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,270
Everything eventually rots in this world.

166
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,639
Then,

167
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,480
how about you live for a thousand years and test it?

168
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,719
I will bet that it will bloom.

169
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,350
If you wish to win the bet,

170
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,560
you will also have to live for a thousand years.

171
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,189
I wonder who will win.

172
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,340
This stop is Bodam Bareun Apartment.

173
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:30,879
The next stop is Bodam Middle School.

174
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,379
This stop is Bodam Bareun Apartment.

175
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,019
For your safety,

176
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,060
make sure to grab the handle as you get on and off...

177
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,490
- and refrain from using your phone. - What is wrong with me?

178
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,329
Oh, my gosh!

179
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,469
Young Hwa, what are you doing? Get off.

180
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,909
Right.

181
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:04,080
You didn't have to meet me at the bus stop. My leg is fine.

182
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,678
You would have gone to the last stop if it weren't for me.

183
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,050
You were completely knocked out.

184
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,389
You dreamed about Jun O again, didn't you?

185
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:16,719
Well, it's not exactly Jun O, but...

186
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,830
- Never mind. - Maybe you secretly fell for him.

187
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,830
Who says that dreaming about him means that I'm into him?

188
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,368
I mean, he's a celebrity, after all.

189
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,540
It's not like you can date him.

190
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,199
Of course, it's not...

191
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,580
Oh, my. You must be careful, Miss.

192
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,280
Right. Thank you.

193
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:46,619
He's a lifesaver. Thank you!

194
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,219
- Are you all right? - Yes. I'm okay.

195
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,330
Goodness. Why are you staring at him?

196
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,689
He seems familiar for some reason.

197
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,569
"Online Bookstore?"

198
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,240
No one in our house is buying a book.

199
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,409
"Recipient, Kang Young..."

200
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,540
I'm going to start studying for my promotion.

201
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,409
I have to study to be promoted.

202
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,819
("Interpretation of Dreams")

203
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,279
("Everything about dreams")

204
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,719
("About Lucid Dreams")

205
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,320
(The content of dreams is about fulfilling one's dream...)

206
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,330
"Motives are a wish."

207
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,730
What?

208
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,199
Then...

209
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,929
my dream is to fulfill my wish?

210
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,399
Gosh.

211
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,769
I'm having a hard time because of this.

212
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,369
What kind of a joke is this?

213
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,780
It's all nonsense.

214
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:46,480
I shouldn't have bought this.

215
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:54,389
What?

216
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:00,030
Why did you want to see me...

217
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:06,300
You don't need to.

218
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,628
I'm a civil servant, so I can't take this.

219
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:10,540
I saw you arguing with Jun O over this...

220
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,869
on the day the accident happened at the broadcasting station.

221
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:19,080
I completely forgot about the fact...

222
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,709
that I wondered where it was.

223
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
I'd like to know what happened...

224
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,219
on that day because I'm his lawyer as well.

225
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:33,859
Young Hwa?

226
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,929
It was just a misunderstanding.

227
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,730
Everything is fine now.

228
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,439
Please, never mind.

229
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,070
What kind of misunderstanding was it?

230
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,070
It was a personal matter.

231
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:51,510
I don't think you got what I meant...

232
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:54,980
If you have nothing more to say, I'll leave now.

233
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,399
If the shirt is revealed,

234
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:17,669
Jun O will be investigated by the police and die...

235
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,540
when he has not much time left.

236
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,810
Just one month.

237
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,550
After a month,

238
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,350
he won't be in this world.

239
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:42,730
I feel so much pity for you that I even dream of my wish...

240
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,129
that you survive no matter what.

241
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:56,139
(The mildest and purest makeup)

242
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,179
(Disin Hospital)

243
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,020
The contractors didn't find the source of money.

244
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,290
Maybe they were telling the truth.

245
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,929
I find out once I meet them.

246
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,399
Gosh!

247
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:23,399
Wait.

248
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,199
What's the matter?

249
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,840
The contractor who was being treated suddenly disappeared.

250
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,010
(Sex: Male, Age: 29, Name: Tony Park)

251
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,709
How did he remove this?

252
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,409
Darn, what were you doing?

253
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,149
Goodness.

254
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,719
Did they check the CCTV on the other side?

255
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,020
- I will contact them first. - Hurry up.

256
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,260
Mr. Seok?

257
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,070
Excuse me.

258
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:03,480
I hope you liked my present.

259
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,080
Peekaboo!

260
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,790
The suspects who can bear witness to the case have all disappeared.

261
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,290
Somebody seems to be pulling strings,

262
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,659
forcing the case to be eliminated.

263
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,969
If this continues, it will be harder to find the one who abetted.

264
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:30,939
Mr. Han, by the way,

265
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,810
it seems that I saw...

266
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,510
Mr. Seok.

267
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:38,709
I missed him right after,

268
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,179
but it was surely him.

269
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,149
It's possible since he also has a hatred relationship.

270
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,030
Welcome, Mr. Seok.

271
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,570
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

272
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:08,169
No, I already have everything prepared.

273
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,980
Wait a second. This one.

274
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:14,209
This. I should write it like this, right?

275
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:16,419
(My Will)

276
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,759
(By the time you get this letter, I'd be already dead.)

277
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,230
(Because of you, I was sentenced to death. How unfair is this?)

278
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:35,899
He was terminally ill?

279
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,070
Then, he was bound...

280
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,070
to die anyway?

281
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:47,510
I feel awful.

282
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,649
I was so busy making a living,

283
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,149
I wasn't that nice to Jun O.

284
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,990
I'm such a bad guy.

285
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,800
Mr. Jang, the reason I'm telling you this is...

286
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:08,500
to ask you to take care of him more than before.

287
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,040
As he doesn't want anyone to know he's badly ill,

288
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:15,409
please check on him more often at the set.

289
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,750
What would be the point of caring for someone who is already dead?

290
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,080
And one more thing.

291
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:22,820
There's more?

292
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,919
It troubles my mind that Jun O stays alone...

293
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,189
when the suspect hasn't been caught yet.

294
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,760
Can you stay at Jun O's...

295
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:34,030
and commute to work from there?

296
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,898
I'll pay you enough for that.

297
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,369
He wants me to stay with a ghost around the clock?

298
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,429
I can't do that.

299
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Wait a second, please.

300
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,070
(Young Hwa)

301
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,219
You are going to Jun O's? Now?

302
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,850
Mr. Han almost begged me for this.

303
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,889
We all know how hard things are now.

304
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,459
Anyway, I won't stay long there.

305
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,859
What are you doing?

306
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:15,230
I won't fit here, right?

307
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,869
Yes, so...

308
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,809
I know how to guard people.

309
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,080
You can officially request manpower.

310
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,010
You can just pay me minimum wage.

311
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,280
Oh, if not, I can work for free.

312
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,948
I go there for work, Director Choi.

313
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:35,889
You know how much his personal fan meeting ticket costs?

314
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,319
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

315
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,658
It's a chance to stay with Jun O...

316
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,029
in the same place so close around the clock!

317
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,260
"So close?" Don't fool around.

318
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,000
Gosh, you make me feel dizzy.

319
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,469
What about admitting it?

320
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:56,240
You once dreamed of him, and your heart fluttered.

321
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,080
That's why you are going now, no?

322
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,280
You don't have any professionalism, do you?

323
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:03,750
Please. Get out. I've had enough.

324
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,790
Get out! I need to get ready. Just go away!

325
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,050
What an idle talk!

326
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,319
Don't ever touch my Jun O!

327
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,590
If you do, you won't be getting anything on your birthday!

328
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:16,060
What's she talking about?

329
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,040
(The birthday trip with Na Yeon)

330
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,369
We still have more than 20 days.

331
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:30,139
What should I ask her to get me this time?

332
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
Come to think of it,

333
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:59,869
it looks similar to the seed I saw in my dream.

334
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,090
Gosh! Chief Monk!

335
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,189
Were you looking for the amulet?

336
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,459
No, sir.

337
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,959
Why would I look for it?

338
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:24,459
I'm no longer afraid of ghosts.

339
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:27,230
If you want to help her, this will be better.

340
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,169
This is...

341
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,668
Isn't this a talisman to expel ghosts?

342
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:36,310
Attach it hard where the spirit stays.

343
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:37,379
By the way, sir.

344
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,609
Could you make me another amulet like last time?

345
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:44,419
It was a rosary made of old lotus seeds.

346
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,649
- Sorry? - It means it wasn't me who made it.

347
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,619
That rosary is...

348
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,699
Then, who made it?

349
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:58,830
Chief Monk?

350
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,280
Don't be scared. Please knock on the door.

351
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,589
All the lights inside were off,

352
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,730
so I thought you were sleeping.

353
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,560
That's why I put up the sticky note.

354
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,600
What are you...

355
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,340
doing here?

356
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,740
Mr. Han asked me to guard you 24 hours a day.

357
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,479
He needed someone to watch you so that you won't have...

358
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,939
the entire bottle of pills again.

359
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,820
Watch me?

360
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:56,689
You are going to watch me?

361
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,560
You must be so grateful.

362
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,530
Because so many people are looking after you.

363
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:06,070
I know.

364
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,030
Even if many people look after you,

365
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:11,570
it won't lessen the pain you'll feel.

366
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:15,510
But still, don't be too cold-hearted.

367
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:19,480
As a person who's truly worried about you,

368
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,649
I start to feel a little upset.

369
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,790
Did you say you genuinely worry about me?

370
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,730
What are you looking at?

371
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:41,769
Due to a migratory anticyclone,

372
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,138
- the temperature will be... - Turn it off, will you?

373
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:47,408
- about 7ºC above the average. - Gosh. It's like summer!

374
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:49,310
- Was it due to the warm weather? - Gosh!

375
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,349
Lotus seeds that had been sleeping for 1,200 years...

376
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,679
finally sprouted.

377
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:56,218
These seeds were discovered...

378
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:58,678
while excavating the mountain fortress...

379
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:01,020
that was built when Silla conquered Gaya.

380
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,218
If they successfully bloom, we can see the flowers...

381
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:05,790
that are reincarnated after 1,000 years.

382
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,590
Then how about you live for a thousand years and test it?

383
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:17,040
I will bet that it will bloom.

384
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,070
If you wish to win the bet,

385
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:22,310
you will also have to live for a thousand years.

386
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,209
I wonder who will win.

387
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,979
These seeds are currently growing...

388
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,648
- I... - in South Gyeongsang Province's...

389
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,079
won the bet.

390
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,849
The other seed that was discovered...

391
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,520
I lost the bet.

392
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:41,889
What?

393
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,230
Why did I say that?

394
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:53,240
I bet you're hungry.

395
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:58,280
If you didn't eat, do you want to grab something?

396
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:10,189
I lose what?

397
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,590
I should distinguish dream from reality!

398
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,559
In this case, I do look like...

399
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,260
I excitedly came here with a fluttering heart.

400
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,409
How come you only have water for food?

401
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,679
(Don't be surprised. Please knock.)

402
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:45,820
Jun O.

403
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,699
Don't tell me you fainted again somewhere.

404
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,300
Jun O.

405
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,510
Gosh. I almost made a mess.

406
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:34,770
I almost fell.

407
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,549
Why is this place so dangerous to live?

408
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,520
Good night, then.

409
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,940
Do you remember who I am? Or...

410
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:10,679
was it a mere coincidence?

411
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:26,259
Hey.

412
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,829
Here. Help me.

413
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,259
Please help me.

414
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,029
- Okay. - Gosh.

415
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,000
There you go.

416
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,210
What's the occasion? You didn't spill anything.

417
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:50,019
- No. - Who are you going to see...

418
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,219
this early after making a fuss?

419
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:53,489
I have to go and take back what's important to me.

420
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,330
I slept like a baby.

421
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,400
I didn't even have a dream.

422
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,089
I thought you had dyslexia.

423
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:31,589
I guess you like to read in the morning.

424
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,159
Dyslexia?

425
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,290
That is funny.

426
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,730
How come you have that book?

427
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,799
Someone was reading it,

428
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,939
so I got curious about what it was about.

429
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,408
Why are you reading someone else's book?

430
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,238
"Overly ambitious people..."

431
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,679
"dream about winning laurels."

432
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,609
"People in love..."

433
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,709
"are absorbed with the ones they love..."

434
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,719
"in their dreams."

435
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,650
Young Hwa.

436
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,589
Which one are you?

437
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,889
What's wrong with you?

438
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:24,609
You should have handed me the book already.

439
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,279
(Interpretation of Dreams)

440
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,250
I will hear your answer later.

441
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:40,929
What are you staring at?

442
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,029
I didn't stare at anything.

443
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,779
I'll get the door.

444
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
What?

445
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:24,339
What?

446
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:28,270
How do I open it?

447
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,679
You've changed the password.

448
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,879
It's fresh to ring the doorbell.

449
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,049
Stop pushing the bell.

450
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:41,920
Look what I brought for you, though.

451
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:44,119
Are you that thrilled?

452
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,698
What?

453
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,170
Why is she coming in? He said he would send her away.

454
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,338
It's my Jun O's favourite...

455
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:03,580
chocolate, hazelnut, caramel, and berries.

456
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,049
Why am I hiding? I'm here to work.

457
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:12,380
Whenever we stayed at the hotel, we had this for breakfast.

458
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:15,389
I went all the way to the hotel to buy it.

459
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
Put it away.

460
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:21,730
Are you feeling sick?

461
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,199
Who are you?

462
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,568
I'm Kang Young Hwa, guarding Jun O.

463
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:35,270
I guess you got a job at Jun O's place...

464
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:38,239
after losing your job as a firefighter.

465
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,850
This is a temporary job I have while I'm suspended.

466
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,779
Also,

467
00:39:44,279 --> 00:39:46,118
you can't barge in here like this...

468
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:48,190
without consent from him beforehand.

469
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,089
In any circumstances,

470
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:52,589
Jun O's stabilization is my top priority.

471
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,060
What are you talking about?

472
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,860
You can't guard him in that outfit...

473
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,270
in the house of a man who lives alone.

474
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,639
If you have nothing more to say, stay out of our business.

475
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,170
You explain it to me.

476
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,770
What is this situation?

477
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,509
You have already heard everything.

478
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:11,210
Is that so?

479
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:18,920
Well, I'm going to get very intimate with you from now.

480
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:20,989
Will you give her an informed consent?

481
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,719
I think that's the only way this woman will leave.

482
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,860
If Mr. Han agrees,

483
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,928
I will leave.

484
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:35,969
No.

485
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:38,500
Stay there.

486
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,610
If she doesn't leave now,

487
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,839
she won't be just an ordinary bodyguard.

488
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,409
Is that all right?

489
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:50,750
No, I'll leave.

490
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,630
How...

491
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,230
I said I never agreed.

492
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,569
Jun O.

493
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,739
You must be very mad at me.

494
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,710
If you don't leave now,

495
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,310
I may really get mad.

496
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:22,080
Even if I leave now,

497
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,449
we have to start over anyway.

498
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:28,549
I'm quite desperate.

499
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:35,429
You can't be as desperate as I am.

500
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,429
You know what?

501
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,670
You seem like a completely different person.

502
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:45,739
That's why I like you even more.

503
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,540
This is totally my type.

504
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:50,110
See you around, Jun O.

505
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:13,569
How dare he do that in front of another woman?

506
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,270
Bodyguard... What a nonsense.

507
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:19,969
Who are you talking about?

508
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
I'm not sure.

509
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:29,279
Who am I talking about?

510
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,920
Stay there.

511
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,790
You could've just talked to her. Why did you break it?

512
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,130
I didn't think she'd leave if I just talked.

513
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,900
What if you get hurt?

514
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,369
What if you get hurt?

515
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,889
This is Jun O's favourite.

516
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:10,420
What if you get caught after breaking it?

517
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,589
What do you mean?

518
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,860
Get caught for doing what?

519
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,029
Right.

520
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,369
Well, what I meant was this.

521
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,139
There is...

522
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,080
someone else Jun O really likes.

523
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,509
What?

524
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,909
Right, Jun O?

525
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:44,559
Goodness, I'll bring a mop.

526
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,230
Don't touch it. You'll cut yourself.

527
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:58,199
Will you give her an informed consent?

528
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:00,869
I think that's the only way this woman will leave.

529
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:02,110
No.

530
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:04,940
Stay there.

531
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:15,290
There is...

532
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,360
someone else Jun O really likes.

533
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:27,770
Was he...

534
00:44:29,029 --> 00:44:30,299
talking about me?

535
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,409
Goodness. What am I thinking?

536
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,920
(Seoul Gieun Police Station)

537
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:48,850
The punk who ran away from the hospital stowed away.

538
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,519
Who was in charge?

539
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,060
- He's looking for you. - Darn you.

540
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,988
Hello, sir. You're here.

541
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:55,190
- Hey. - Yes?

542
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:57,130
Yes.

543
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:05,270
(Wanted, 10,000 dollars Attempted murder suspect)

544
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,880
Goodness.

545
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:14,549
He looks really familiar.

546
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,380
Who in the world is Kang Young Hwa?

547
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,420
If he met a woman who was just his taste after 1,500 years,

548
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,889
he should talk to her in a friendly manner.

549
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,529
Why is he all frozen up?

550
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,400
I should probably get involved again.

551
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,830
Ms. Kang, by any chance,

552
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,170
do you like web novels?

553
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,639
Novels? All of a sudden?

554
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:42,908
Well, Jun O received a few offers as his next project,

555
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:44,040
and among them,

556
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:48,009
there were fantasy romance stories...

557
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,850
that involved reincarnation and spirit possession.

558
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:53,380
I see.

559
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,989
Well, I like fantasy,

560
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:00,429
but romance isn't my thing.

561
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,529
You don't like romance?

562
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,900
No.

563
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:07,630
How about a love story of a man...

564
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,839
who only has his eyes on just one woman?

565
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,179
Well...

566
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:20,810
Do you mean...

567
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,850
like a period romance drama?

568
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:28,150
You know,

569
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:33,089
someone wants to get revenge for their parents' death,

570
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:36,560
but in the end, they end up falling in love.

571
00:46:37,529 --> 00:46:39,659
A story that ends tragically. Something like that?

572
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:41,469
Nice.

573
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,369
I think we're here.

574
00:46:50,509 --> 00:46:52,439
(Traditional Korean Archery)

575
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,449
(Traditional Korean Archery)

576
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:08,230
I forgot to tell you.

577
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,829
There were many archery scenes in the drama,

578
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,230
so the main cast decided to get together and practice.

579
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,600
What's wrong?

580
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:22,170
No, it's nothing.

581
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:25,310
I saw something like that in my dream.

582
00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:28,150
You dreamed of the archery center? What was the dream about?

583
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,350
It was a sad dream.

584
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,920
I was in love with this master.

585
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,989
It was a silly dream.

586
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,960
A silly dream.

587
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,659
A sad, silly dream?

588
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:47,500
I'll leave first to check.

589
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,250
What's going on between you and Jun O?

590
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,020
And I don't want to hear you say a bodyguard and her client.

591
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,658
We're exchanging help. Happy now?

592
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:12,860
As you probably heard,

593
00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:16,029
I need to get back with Jun O in a passionate relationship.

594
00:48:17,299 --> 00:48:19,000
That means you'll leave soon.

595
00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:21,969
I don't keep female bodyguards.

596
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:31,980
Goodness.

597
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:34,610
Look at his posture.

598
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,279
Jun O is feeling under the weather.

599
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:40,179
Please focus on his posture in today's lesson.

600
00:48:40,589 --> 00:48:43,690
Goodness. Yi Seul has had some lessons,

601
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,388
but it's his first time.

602
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,020
He'll stand out if he doesn't learn it properly.

603
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,559
He'll have a stand-in anyway.

604
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,399
All he has to do is act well.

605
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,729
But he isn't a good actor.

606
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,230
Goodness, it's because you haven't seen him yet.

607
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:58,669
- He has changed completely. - I doubt it.

608
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,099
At first, I doubted it too.

609
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,270
Whatever. Let's continue to doubt it.

610
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,989
Mr. Han is here.

611
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,190
I will take a look around the training center.

612
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,339
We need to talk.

613
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:38,710
Later. You should go warm up.

614
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:41,610
Do what you have to do.

615
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,080
Isn't that why...

616
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:46,380
you kept me by your side?

617
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:53,658
That's why the cast changed?

618
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,889
- Yes. - It's true?

619
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,099
- That's awful. - My gosh.

620
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,100
Jun O! Over here.

621
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:04,799
When you set the arrow...

622
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:08,969
Are you ready? Shoot.

623
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,540
- What? - What?

624
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,650
Okay, then.

625
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,650
Next up, our main character. You're up.

626
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,549
- Director Kim, the bow, please. - What?

627
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:22,650
Sure.

628
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:29,860
Don't be too nervous.

629
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,000
If you aren't good, you can always learn.

630
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,408
Set your body and feet to two o'clock.

631
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:43,139
And the spacing between your feet...

632
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,980
- should be shoulder-width... - I need you to move to shoot.

633
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:47,480
It's okay even if you're not good at it.

634
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:49,480
I'll give you private lessons.

635
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,909
- What? - What was that?

636
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:24,920
You aren't so bad for a first-timer.

637
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,179
He won't need a stand-in.

638
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:28,389
I told you so.

639
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,630
- Nice job! - Goodness.

640
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:56,949
Do you have some time now?

641
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,190
Good.

642
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,230
I had questions too.

643
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:16,799
How did you do that?

644
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:19,040
I thought this was your first time.

645
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,770
It had been a while.

646
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:24,540
- What do you mean? - "Master."

647
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:27,749
What?

648
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,810
You called me that from the hospital room.

649
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,179
You knew everything since then, didn't you?

650
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,429
That was...

651
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:44,130
you?

652
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:46,299
I'm waiting for your answer.

653
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:48,369
You are...

654
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,139
seeing me in dreams, aren't you?

655
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,869
I never said it was you.

656
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,110
I'm just seeing...

657
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:03,380
a man who looks like you in my dreams.

658
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,779
This isn't fair to me either.

659
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,150
Do you think I want to have those dreams?

660
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,719
Why do you look like him...

661
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:13,360
and make me confused?

662
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:16,889
She must have seen me in dreams.

663
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,069
She really saw me from 1,500 years ago...

664
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,239
in her dreams.

665
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,310
Who are you visiting today?

666
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:35,850
That saint... I mean, Ms. Kang Young Hwa.

667
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,750
I heard she was a bodyguard here.

668
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:41,850
I'm sorry. She's not employed with our business.

669
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,520
She also doesn't work in the office.

670
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:44,989
I see.

671
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:48,730
Is there a way I can meet her?

672
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:51,429
There is something I must give her.

673
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:54,400
One moment. Please fill out this form first.

674
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:55,670
Sure.

675
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,068
Do you have Ms. Kang's number?

676
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,040
(Hae In)

677
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:17,619
Among many of Han Ri Ta's reincarnations,

678
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:19,689
you were the only one...

679
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,560
Who are you?

680
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,600
You can...

681
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:28,528
see me?

682
00:54:28,529 --> 00:54:29,670
who could see me.

683
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,270
- One more time. - Another one.

684
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,210
(Congressman Yoon)

685
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:39,809
You began to resemble her more as you grew up.

686
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:40,880
- Let's go! - Let's go!

687
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,779
But from a certain moment, you were unable to see me.

688
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,480
And you are...

689
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:50,719
now seeing me in your dreams.

690
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,089
Kang Young Hwa.

691
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:59,299
You have finally remembered me.

692
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,980
Thank you for the ride.

693
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,449
I have something to do too.

694
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,520
Did something happen between you and Jun O?

695
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,819
No.

696
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:22,889
Well,

697
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:25,118
I wouldn't say something happened.

698
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,730
If you have some time, can we talk?

699
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,330
If you go upstairs, I'll park the car and head up.

700
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,170
- All right. - Yes.

701
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,029
What am I going to say?

702
00:56:06,759 --> 00:56:09,299
How am I supposed to share this?

703
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,810
If you feel uncomfortable,

704
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:22,779
feel free to get off.

705
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,679
No, I don't feel uncomfortable.

706
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,119
Thank you.

707
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:45,040
Why are you here?

708
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,500
Sorry?

709
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:52,080
Are you going to help if I tell you?

710
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,710
Oh, you two know each other.

711
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,819
Of course. I'd help you...

712
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,719
return to where you came from.

713
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,920
Begone, evil spirit!

714
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,489
What are you doing?

715
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,330
What are you doing?

716
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:16,500
I don't think...

717
00:57:17,569 --> 00:57:19,569
this is enough to help me.

718
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,869
This wasn't the plan.

719
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:23,869
- This can't be happening. - Is it my turn?

720
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:25,210
Cut it out.

721
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,489
It was useless.

722
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,429
Did you think it'd be easy to get rid of a revengeful spirit?

723
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,528
I should've met with Ms. Kang...

724
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:49,400
and told her she was with a poltergeist.

725
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,170
Everything is over.

726
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,369
She would've believed me if that talisman worked.

727
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,039
I couldn't do a thing.

728
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,279
That talisman wasn't made carelessly, so give it time.

729
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,809
Are you sure you'll be okay?

730
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,080
I'll manage.

731
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,219
Why are we here?

732
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,589
Are you here to see Mr. Han too?

733
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:12,920
I came to see you.

734
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:20,860
Hey, about that dream I mentioned...

735
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,699
Why do you look so unwell?

736
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:28,739
Are you okay, Jun O?

737
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:30,369
Why now?

738
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,440
Hey, Jun O! Are you okay?

739
00:58:36,509 --> 00:58:38,849
Jun O.

740
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,880
Stay with me, Jun O.

741
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:46,560
He has no pulse.

742
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:31,799
Master.

743
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:05,369
(Moon in the Day)

744
01:00:05,699 --> 01:00:07,138
This is the Republic of Korea.

745
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:08,909
A man from Silla isn't allowed.

746
01:00:10,009 --> 01:00:11,709
The traitor's daughter is still alive.

747
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:14,509
Throw her into the shed and flog her!

748
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:17,779
I finally want to pursue something because I have met you.

749
01:00:20,779 --> 01:00:22,619
I want to meet you.

750
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,460
Jun O said Ms. Kang saw his true identity.

751
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,419
His true identity?

752
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,560
Would you be able to tell me...

753
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:32,029
why you did that back then?
