1
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,940

2
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,000

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,200

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,540

5
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:40,410

6
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,120

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,040

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,910
 My feelings for you.

9
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,390
 It...

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,410
 turns out I like you.

11
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:24,748
Ms. Kang Yeong Hwa.

12
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:29,748
You won't fail to recognize me this time. Right?

13
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:34,158
I run into you often.

14
00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:39,448
Relationships from previous life rarely get disconnected.

15
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:42,178
Pardon?

16
00:01:42,178 --> 00:01:46,908
Just like the moment you fell for Do Ha,

17
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:51,208
you and his tragic fate keep repeating itself.

18
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:57,768
You...

19
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,638
Who are you?

20
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:02,098
I told you.

21
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:06,758
The tragic fate will repeat itself because of your feelings.

22
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:08,058
What do you mean by that—

23
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:10,928
Your karma from your previous life.

24
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:17,196
Your karma from your previous life also started because of your feelings.

25
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:25,396
Because the one who started all these curses by killing Do Ha was you, Kang Yeong Hwa.

26
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:28,496
I mean, Han Ri Ta.

27
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:32,926
If you cannot believe me,

28
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:37,016
check the wound on Do Ha's neck.

29
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:41,276
The wound you created with those hands of yours

30
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:47,696
is probably still as visible as it was 1,500 years ago.

31
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,376
It can't be...

32
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,036
No.

33
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:21,116

34
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:27,076

Death?

35
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:30,336
Does this card mean death?

36
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,316
You said it's a friend of yours. Right?

37
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:36,926

38
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:40,846
She's not just a friend.

39
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,336
She's more like family.

40
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:50,806
I think you should warn her firmly to be careful for a while.

41
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:55,656
A great danger is very close to her right now.

42
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:57,706
Is it...

43
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:01,566
Han Joon Oh, who is possessed and causing all this?

44
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:06,926
Ma'am, do you have a charm by chance?

45
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:11,456
A foolproof charm that gets rid of ghosts, perhaps.

46
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:14,866
I can try to look for a solution, but...

47
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:25,936
Gosh, you scared me.

48
00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:27,266
W-What are you doing?

49
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,686
Why did you interrupt at such a crucial moment?

50
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,146
Why didn't you answer your phone, then?

51
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,836
Do you know how much I ran around here looking for you?

52
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:38,866
I said I'll no longer neglect what's going on with Yeong Hwa, either.

53
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,876
I'm telling you.

54
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:44,796
He's not a bad person like you think he is.

55
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:46,876
Of course, he is.

56
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:51,276
Look. Devil. Death. They're all unlucky cards.

57
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:53,916
Do you believe in these silly cards?

58
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:56,546
You don't know how good she is.

59
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,106
Don't be ridiculous. You just threw money away.

60
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:03,556
Let's go right now. Come.

61
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:06,266
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

62
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:09,956
I'm sorry. I'll make sure to come back. I'm sorry.

63
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,660

64
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:22,883
 Is he really Seok Cheol Hwan?

65
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:27,463
 Who are you, exactly?

66
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:32,913
 I never thought there would be...

67
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,183
 a third person.

68
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:38,603
 Because the deaths...

69
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:41,583
 have been reoccurring...

70
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:46,823
 in places by people I didn't expect.

71
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:51,563
 But if someone was behind this...

72
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:58,243
Where's Seok Cheol Hwan right now?

73
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:01,623
Well, he was at a motel on the outskirts of Seoul.

74
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:04,313
But he probably moved somewhere by now.

75
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:08,243
If not, he'd get arrested for attempting to murder Han Min Oh.

76
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:12,943
But why? Will you report it to the police?

77
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:15,373
They'll keep probing about the Goo Tae Joo case, then.

78
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:18,453
I'll check before the police do.

79
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:21,593
So you'd better find out from now on.

80
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:25,343
Find out where Seok Cheol Hwan is and what he's up to.

81
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,743
I know it's a request from you, but that's a bit—

82
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:29,443
I'll give you a day.

83
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:32,573
That's all the time I can give you.

84
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,840

85
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:42,363
H-Hold on. Hold on, Joon Oh.

86
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:50,193
Looks like you'll avenge CEO Han for Seok Cheol Hwan.

87
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:52,513
He's not as easy as you think.

88
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:56,033
He's not even a human. He's a monster. A monster.

89
00:06:56,033 --> 00:07:00,783
So let's not put ourselves at greater risk, please?

90
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:02,253
Greater risk?

91
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:05,333
Didn't you see what happened to CEO Han?

92
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,043
Aren't you scared?

93
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:09,533
What I'm scared of right now...

94
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:13,153
is just one thing.

95
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:20,815
 Watching you dying helplessly

96
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:26,305
 after seeing it for the 18th time in my previous life.

97
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:28,815
Where did she go, anyway?

98
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:37,516
What are you doing right now?

99
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:39,976
Mr. Jang, where's Kang Yeong Hwa? She's not inside.

100
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:41,456
Well, the thing is—

101
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:43,326
Excuse me, Mr. Han Joon Oh.

102
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:45,826
I asked you first. What are you doing right now?

103
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:48,816
I'm looking for Kang Yeong Hwa. Do you know where she is?

104
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:50,736
Do you want to find her?

105
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:54,586
Then, you should talk to me first.

106
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:10,648
 Don't think this is unfair.

107
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:13,809
 This is all because of your karma from your previous life.

108
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,985
 Because the one who started all these curses was you, Kang Yeong Hwa.

109
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:21,440
 I mean, Han Ri Ta.

110
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,689
 The wound you created with those hands of yours

111
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:32,152
 is probably still as visible as it was 1,500 years ago.

112
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,315
Does it mean I ended up killing you?

113
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:44,444
How could that be...

114
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,250
How...

115
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,941
How could that be?

116
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,760

117
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,050

118
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,780
What do these have to do with looking for Kang Yeong Hwa?

119
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,980
What do they have to do with it?

120
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,690

121
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,190

122
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,370
Do you not feel anything after seeing this?

123
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,290
Na Yeon...

124
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,850
I'll say what I need to say.

125
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,230
My sister, Yeong Hwa, had a dream and goals.

126
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,890
As a firefighter and a person,

127
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,170
she was very proud of her life.

128
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,390
But you made everything go wrong for her.

129
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,930
Don't you feel guilty at all?

130
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:43,163
She stormed out of the house as if she was possessed today, too.

131
00:09:43,163 --> 00:09:45,773
Are you not responsible for that at all?

132
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:47,543
She left as if she was possessed?

133
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:52,233
Sure. You've known each other from your previous lives or whatever.

134
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,853
I understand your situation since I heard about it.

135
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:58,753
Isn't that all the more the reason you shouldn't be doing this?

136
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:03,953
You might not be able to make her happy, but you shouldn't make her miserable.

137
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:21,583
 Ms. Kang isn't answering calls from Na Yeon or me. What should we do?

138
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,743
I'll call the police if I have to.

139
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:29,703
Kang Yeong Hwa might be in danger.

140
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:31,513
 Why would she be?

141
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:35,393
I'll look for her, too. So...

142
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:39,203
Never mind.

143
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,963
I think I found her.

144
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,063
I'll call you back.

145
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,453
 This might be why...

146
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:08,152
 I didn't want you to find out

147
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:12,089
 about anything until the end.

148
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:18,493
 Because I don't want you to...

149
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:23,413
 go through the pain I went through.

150
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:54,697
It could've been dangerous.

151
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:57,627
What are you so distracted by?

152
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,310
What? How long were you here?

153
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,707
Why are you so surprised?

154
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:08,797
I've been by your side for 1,500 years.

155
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:12,997
Geez. You're a ghost. Not even a person.

156
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,517
You're finally acting like Kang Yeong Hwa.

157
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:27,427
 Because the one who started all these curses by killing Do Ha was you, Kang Yeong Hwa.

158
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:30,377
 I mean, Han Ri Ta.

159
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:33,417
 If what he said is true...

160
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,487
Are you okay?

161
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:40,257
Let me see.

162
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:46,047
I just lost my footing and got scratched.

163
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:48,287
Don't worry.

164
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:58,057
This is why I told you to stay at home.

165
00:12:58,057 --> 00:13:00,827
I can't relax even for a second because of you.

166
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:05,577
Why are you suddenly freaking out about some scratch?

167
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,497
I fell off a cliff, got into a car accident,

168
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,147
and I've fallen into the Han River, too.

169
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:13,117
You saw it yourself, too.

170
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:17,197
Even if you say something would happen to me, I'm okay with it.

171
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,997
But I'm no longer okay with it.

172
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:25,997
I've been seeing you in danger several times, as you said.

173
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:30,687
But I feel very differently about it now.

174
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,750
So, from now on...

175
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,360
don't get hurt even for a bit.

176
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,850
This...

177
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,740
This damned pain...

178
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,280
I don't have a lot of time left.

179
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,020
I need to finish off Han Ri Ta's

180
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,520
current reincarnation quickly, too.

181
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,670
- Yes, let's talk later. 
 - CEO. CEO.

182
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,630
Oppa.

183
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,110
I'm Jeong Yi Seul.

184
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,660
How could you cancel the contract like this?

185
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,750
I've been making several hundreds of millions for this company.

186
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,670
Since all of your ad campaigns and dramas got canceled,

187
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,140
we owe hundreds of millions in penalties.

188
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,780
The company tried charging you, but I persuaded them to just cancel the contract.

189
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,270
You'd better be thankful.

190
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,060
I know, but if you do this now,

191
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,800
no companies will want me.

192
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,910
If they find out the great Jeong Yi Seul got booted from the agency,

193
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,906
I can't ever come back.

194
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,036
Image is everything in the entertainment industry.

195
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:15,346
But your image is already destroyed.

196
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:19,116
No matter how hard you try, it's hopeless.

197
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:38,556
Why is Jeong Yi Seul, the top celebrity in Korea, crying like this?

198
00:15:38,556 --> 00:15:40,146
What if someone sees you?

199
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:44,746
Why? Will you take a picture of me and post it somewhere or something?

200
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:47,816
I'm already pissed enough.

201
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:50,146
Some random weirdo is picking a fight with me.

202
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:55,206
I might not look like it, but I'm the founder of Beginning Entertainment.

203
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:57,976
A random weirdo is too harsh.

204
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:07,976

205
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:13,846
Nice to meet you, Ms. Jeong Yi Seul.

206
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:18,086
I'm Seok Cheol Hwan, the former CEO of Beginning Entertainment.

207
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,666
I said I'm really okay.

208
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:48,706
Is your heart okay, too?

209
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:52,848
The curse that will kill you before you turn 30.

210
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:56,398
You've been feeling bad because of that.

211
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:04,443
I made the wrong decision.

212
00:17:05,112 --> 00:17:07,846
I should be the only one who suffers

213
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:10,389
the pain from the curse.

214
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:13,768
But ignoring the curse won't make it disappear.

215
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:17,678
I'll figure out the solution. No.

216
00:17:17,678 --> 00:17:23,228
Maybe I already found the solution to break the curse.

217
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:26,530
I found another person who's related to this curse.

218
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,199
Another person?

219
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:34,529
The one who told Han Min Oh about your karma from your previous life.

220
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:42,373
Could it be Seok Cheol Hwan—

221
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:46,283
How do you know that person?

222
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:48,743
I ran into him before I saw you today.

223
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:51,153
You ran into him?

224
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,333
Tell me the details. When? Where?

225
00:17:58,543 --> 00:18:00,913
I rescued him from fire once.

226
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:05,293
I ran into him by chance today. But more importantly...

227
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,793
he knew you.

228
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,733
He knew me?

229
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,573
Do Ha.

230
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:14,803
He called you Do Ha.

231
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,843
He knew I was Han Ri Ta, too.

232
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:19,823
 Seok Cheol Hwan.

233
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:23,483
 Who could he be that...

234
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:25,923
Nothing happened, right?

235
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:28,563
Something...

236
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,383
 If you cannot believe me,

237
00:18:31,383 --> 00:18:35,533
 check the wound on Do Ha's neck.

238
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:39,833
 The wound you created with those hands of yours

239
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:46,223
 is probably still as visible as it was 1,500 years ago.

240
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:55,673
What are you doing?

241
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,563
Hold on.

242
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:23,413
 There really is a wound.

243
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,873
 Just as he said.

244
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:28,523
Kang Yeong Hwa.

245
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:37,303
I think I saw this wound last time.

246
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,263
Did you get...

247
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,473
that wound when you died?

248
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,623
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

249
00:19:48,193 --> 00:19:53,463
Did Seok Cheol Hwan tell you anything else?

250
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:57,193
No. I just ran into him. That's all.

251
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,403
Should we have a meal first?

252
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:05,563
I'm starving because I haven't eaten all day.

253
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:15,533
This is all there is to eat in this house.

254
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:18,233
It's okay. I like cup noodles.

255
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:20,033
Aren't you eating with me?

256
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,493
Take care of yourself first.

257
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:26,033
Although I'm worried that it doesn't look nutritious.

258
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:31,603
What ghost cares about nutrition?

259
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:42,033
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

260
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,503
Because you were smiling.

261
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:48,203
Here.

262
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:53,503
Don't spill it while eating with your wounded hand.

263
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:55,433
Go ahead and eat.

264
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:08,673
Huh? Yeong Hwa is sleeping with whom?

265
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:11,693
No, I'm not saying they're sleeping together.

266
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:16,413
It's getting late. So she'll just sleep over at Joon Oh's place.

267
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:17,813
I know.

268
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:21,193
I even warned him earlier. That ghost-like bastard...

269
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:25,873
I mean, the ghost himself ended up seducing my sister.

270
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:27,283
That's what it means.

271
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:29,063
Yoon Je, start the car.

272
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:31,283
I need to go get her right now.

273
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:32,563
Gosh, seriously.

274
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:36,143
Seriously, why are you doing this?

275
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:39,483
She said she was okay. You heard that, too.

276
00:21:39,483 --> 00:21:42,583
I didn't know she'd be...

277
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:47,493
spending the night with a ghost.

278
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:50,123
I'm really okay.

279
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:52,663
I told Choi Na Yeon through Mr. Jang.

280
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:56,413
That you'd be sleeping at my house tonight.

281
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:59,403
I'm sure she'd get the wrong idea again.

282
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,063
Wrong idea?

283
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:06,783
I really like her and I think of her as family,

284
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,453
but she can be too much sometimes.

285
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,353
She freaked out about it already.

286
00:22:12,353 --> 00:22:14,543
You said you saw her at my place. Right?

287
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,973
Did she yell at you a lot?

288
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:18,273
Well, you know...

289
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:24,253
But it's still a relief.

290
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:30,703
Because you have a lot of people who care about you.

291
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:33,423
So don't worry.

292
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:36,793
You'll go on and live your life without problems.

293
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:44,003
Because I'll protect you.

294
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:00,473
What's wrong?

295
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,283
You know...

296
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:12,533
Was it very painful?

297
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,653
What?

298
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:21,823
At the moment you died.

299
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:25,253
Was it very painful?

300
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,903
The pain was too great...

301
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:43,583
to even measure.

302
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:48,073
So great that even after 1,500 years,

303
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:52,503
I still can't forget it.

304
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,693
What's wrong?

305
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:08,993
I don't know why I'm like this, either.

306
00:24:10,153 --> 00:24:13,063
Do you know you're acting really strangely today?

307
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:17,863
I guess it's because I'm a bit tired.

308
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:20,063
A lot happened today.

309
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:21,993
Yes.

310
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,313
You couldn't sleep all night last night. You must be tired.

311
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:26,973
Go to bed early tonight.

312
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:28,443
Okay.

313
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,713
By the way...

314
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:43,463
I'll watch you all night tonight.

315
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:46,643
So don't worry about anything.

316
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:59,283
 If your pain...

317
00:25:00,143 --> 00:25:03,383
 was really caused by me...

318
00:25:03,383 --> 00:25:08,153
 If that's true, what am I supposed to do?

319
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:44,143

320
00:26:02,903 --> 00:26:08,063
 The answer you must find is not with me.

321
00:26:08,063 --> 00:26:12,040
 Be courageous, face your sin yourself,

322
00:26:12,603 --> 00:26:15,943
 and look inside your heart.

323
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:19,790
 That's where the answer lies.

324
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:25,343
 Yes. I need to find out myself now.

325
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:28,743
 Where did our curses start

326
00:26:28,743 --> 00:26:32,180
 and what our ending will be.

327
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:41,043
My soldiers will also join the battle this time.

328
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:46,663
Even Do Ha will not be able to make it back alive.

329
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:52,953
The arrows and swords from our friendly forces are even scarier.

330
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:57,183
Oh, also, I will let you cut

331
00:26:57,183 --> 00:27:01,243
Do Ha's head off after he dies. That way,

332
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:04,393
things will be fair for you, too.

333
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,803
What do you think?

334
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:13,693
Do you like my wedding present?

335
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,010
A bride's face...

336
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,360
cannot look so sad.

337
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,470
I cannot look as sad as you.

338
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,220
Are you not nervous at all?

339
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,110
This is our first night together, after all.

340
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,870
Just worry about yourself.

341
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:53,870
Grooms tend to get more nervous than brides on the first night.

342
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,700
Do you not know that, My Lord?

343
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,610
"Dear husband."

344
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,860
Many people will be watching us from now on.

345
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,700
Would you be able to address me like that?

346
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,317
♫  ...is embracing us  ♫

347
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:18,230
♫  On these beautiful days  ♫

348
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,950
When you say something like that,

349
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:27,548
♫  You and I are different under the same sky  ♫

350
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:30,582
you are supposed to...

351
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,010
say it with a smile like this.

352
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,250
Not with such a sad face.

353
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,010
♫  Even when you're out of reach  ♫

354
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,000
 Even if I end up in hell,

355
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,640
 as long as you are by my side,

356
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,950
 I am satisfied with that.

357
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,720
 No.

358
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,140
 I will get you out of that hell.

359
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,260
 It is enough that I get to live through hell.

360
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,820
Take care of Do Ha as soon as you leave for the battle.

361
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,590
You had better not make any mistakes.

362
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,910
 Yes, sir.

363
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,990
By the way, can we trust that girl?

364
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,580
Revenge is the most extreme and strongest desire.

365
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,390
Some silly affection will not be able to overcome it.

366
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,850
Do Ha asked for all of this.

367
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,440
So, a dog should not disobey the owner.

368
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,890
I will bring the drink table to my husband myself.

369
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,670
Yes, of course.

370
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,110
Which room will this go to?

371
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:13,570
Sir So Ri Bu said he would have the wedding celebratory drink, too.

372
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,880
Did you check for poison?

373
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,690
The guards are supposed to do it instead.

374
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,720
This will not be enough, then.

375
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,900
Prepare more.

376
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,780
Yes, Ma'am.

377
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,740
This medicine makes you move slowly.

378
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:50,060
It has no color or odor and will start working at dawn.

379
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,460
Put this in his liquor bottle tonight.

380
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,320
We need to do something in advance.

381
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,970
It will not be good...

382
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,610
if he fights too well in the battle.

383
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,150
Who is there?

384
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:14,260
As long as you are alive, Lord Do Ha will not stop

385
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,810
risking his life to save me, kill people,

386
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,040
and end up being killed by you.

387
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,500
You little...

388
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,510
So, you had better die!

389
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,820
Are you not ashamed...

390
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,270
to do this after Do Ha killed your parents?

391
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:42,410
I take responsibility for going against filial piety!

392
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,560
Your feelings...

393
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,560
Your feelings for him...

394
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,550
will end up...

395
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,460
sabotaging you.

396
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,590
I will be born again...

397
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,360
a thousand or ten thousand times...

398
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,340
and I will find you...

399
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,190
over...

400
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,720
and over...

401
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,710
My Lord, the culprit has been caught.

402
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,570
This bitch killed Lord So Ri Bu.

403
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,890
A servant saw it herself while passing by.

404
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,940
Yes. I heard a loud noise, so I went there...

405
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,350
and there was blood everywhere...

406
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,160
You do not need a witness.

407
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,080
Because...

408
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,180
I killed So Ri Bu.

409
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,960
Did you really kill him?

410
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,060
This was the only way...

411
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,790
to save you, My Lord.

412
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,170
I was prepared to die when I did it.

413
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,840
I will be punished accordingly.

414
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,200
You were prepared to die?

415
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,670
I will punish you accordingly.

416
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,270
She is my wife.

417
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,460
Step aside.

418
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,020
I am...

419
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,170
the head...

420
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,510
of this house now.

421
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,390
My Lord.

422
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,650
She is a murderer who killed Lord So Ri Bu.

423
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,690
Do I look like I am asking for your permission?

424
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,780
I will...

425
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,810
kill you the next time.

426
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,640
Herb gatherers used to use this place.

427
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,950
It will keep us safe for a while.

428
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,650
My Lord, what will you do?

429
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,510
How about you?

430
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,820
What were you planning to do?

431
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:31,380
What made you do something so reckless?

432
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,310
He was planning to kill you in this battle

433
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,520
using your soldiers' arrows and swords.

434
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,360
I could not let you die like that.

435
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,600
You were about to enter hell to save me.

436
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,870
You have already done so countless times, and I wanted to save you at least once.

437
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,370
This will be...

438
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,200
over as soon as I get arrested.

439
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,700
You do not have to get tangled up in this.

440
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,020
I have already gotten tangled up.

441
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,090
From the moment I met you...

442
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,170
and fell in love with you.

443
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,680
I was so scared that I nearly went mad.

444
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:36,260
Thinking I might have lost you.

445
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,450
Thinking I might...

446
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,990
regret what happened that night forever.

447
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,490
I am so sorry...

448
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,850
that it ended up this way.

449
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,370
I am sorry that I made you...

450
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,110
do what I was supposed to do.

451
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,620
Everything will be okay.

452
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,610
I will make sure of it.

453
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,260
I promise.

454
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,250
Where is the murderer?

455
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,530
You cannot go any further before you tell us.

456
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,580
I was actually...

457
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,080
going to find you.

458
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,930
My Lord.

459
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:08,540
 Gosh, how could anyone do this?

460
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,600
 How could they kill people like this?

461
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,940
 Whoever did this deserves to die.

462
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,580
 How could this be...

463
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,380
Goodness, goodness.

464
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,850
Did Lord Do Ha really do this?

465
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:32,920
His wife apparently killed his father on the night they wed.

466
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,950
And he killed people so brutally to save a wench like that?

467
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,230
You said you would be back soon.

468
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,660
Why did you come out?

469
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,890
Crowded places are dangerous.

470
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,830
Did you not get hurt at all?

471
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,070
This is nothing.

472
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,450
I got us some food. Let us go.

473
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,770
You cannot.

474
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,510
He cannot tell the royal force.

475
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:52,380
I might as well get caught and get killed.

476
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,390
Go right now. Hurry.

477
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:01,510
- Father! 
 - Yes?

478
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,160
There are strange people there...

479
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,260
Look everywhere.

480
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,550
Quicker. Move quicker.

481
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,620
She is a criminal who killed Lord So Ri Bu.

482
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,790
Quicker. Move quicker.

483
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,100
Go that way.

484
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,490
I think they have gone pretty far away now.

485
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,290
I do not mind holding you longer,

486
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,640
but I need to see where they are headed for a second.

487
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,590
Do not go anywhere and wait here.

488
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:26,610
We cannot be on the run forever.

489
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,000
I do not care...

490
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,910
if it goes on forever.

491
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,310
As long as I can protect you,

492
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,140
and as long as I can be with you,

493
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:44,340
I will do whatever it takes.

494
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,040
I will do anything.

495
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,540
No.

496
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,820
I...

497
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,520
was wrong.

498
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:07,580
I was going to save you from hell.

499
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:12,210
But we walked into an even more hellish place.

500
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:17,330
Living like this is not living at all.

501
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,240
Let us live.

502
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,780
Let us live together.

503
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,250
We can head north.

504
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,770
I have told you before. There is a village where the people of Gaya live.

505
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,220
Let us start over...

506
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,020
start all over...

507
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,380
again there.

508
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,640
I do not think I can.

509
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:06,090
I have reached my rock bottom.

510
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,760
You should...

511
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,830
accompany me...

512
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,650
to my rock bottom, too.

513
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,580
You feel feverish.

514
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,940
This is no good.

515
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,310
We had better kill everyone and leave.

516
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,150
My Lord.

517
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:08,480
They are mostly old soldiers without battle experience.

518
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,630
Do not worry.

519
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,940
I will be right back.

520
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,740
 Now, we must stop...

521
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,080
 this love affair that went wrong.

522
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:55,000
 As long as we are together,

523
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:01,580
 we will never get away from this sin.

524
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:07,950
 I thought I might be able to live like a human.

525
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,770
 But I cannot achieve...

526
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:15,760
 that dream while I am alive.

527
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,410
 Perhaps you might...

528
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:21,720
 be able to...

529
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,610
 free me from this hell.

530
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,700
My Lord.

531
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:42,450
I love you, My Lord.

532
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,580
 I really had killed you.

533
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:42,440
 I was the one who had killed you, Do Ha.

534
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,830
♫  In the fluttering cherry blossom petals  ♫

535
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,560
 I want to...

536
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,980
 know how I died.

537
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,650
 That way, I can leave this world.

538
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:57,250
 The pain was too great...

539
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,860
 to even measure.

540
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:09,525
 I'm the one who put you into a 1,500-year-old pain.

541
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:15,225
 It was really true that my karma caused all this.

542
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:26,700
♫  Tears are falling  ♫

543
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:34,110
♫  The memory of us in love back then  ♫

544
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:41,480
♫  is everything to me, and it's coming back  ♫

545
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:48,210
♫  Your warmth that touched me  ♫

546
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:51,050
 Before I get weak,

547
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:54,545
 I must find a way to protect Kang Yeong Hwa.

548
00:54:54,545 --> 00:55:03,887
♫  The sound of you breathing asleep next to me was my only prayer in life  ♫

549
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,700

550
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:16,750
♫  I long for you today once again  ♫

551
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,930
You're up.

552
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:31,980
Why are you standing there like that?

553
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,360
I'm sorry.

554
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:46,080
What are you talking about suddenly?

555
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,190
I'm sorry.

556
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,000
Han Joon Oh, you punk...

557
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,880
Why won't you answer the phone at this crucial moment?

558
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,480
- Damn it. 
  - The call is not going through...

559
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:19,050
I didn't have to look for Seok Cheol Hwan. He was circling around your house.

560
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,310

561
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,490
 I had told you in the past.

562
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:37,460
 That your feelings for him will sabotage you.

563
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:42,850
 You will get hurt as much as I did.

564
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,160
Did you have a dream?

565
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,540
I had killed you.

566
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,020
With my own hands.

567
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:16,660
You wanted to know the reason you had died so badly.

568
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,980
And it was me.

569
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,840
 - Gosh, you scared me. 
 - Hey, hey.

570
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,470
 You just threw money away.

571
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,980
 Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

572
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,420
 I'm sorry. I'll make sure to come back. I'm sorry.

573
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,720
 I'll come back.

574
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:57,190

575
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:04,690

576
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:09,250
♫  You and I are different under the same sky  ♫

577
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:13,340
♫  It feels like the world has stopped  ♫

578
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,570
♫  Let me embrace you warmly  ♫

579
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:23,450
♫  All of my days are being colored by you  ♫

580
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:32,950
♫  I will always protect you even when you're out of reach  ♫

581
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,650

582
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:40,320
 I can't stay by your side since I learned the truth.

583
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,710
 He said you don't have to look for him since his father will come to see you.

584
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:46,080
 What did you say?

585
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,020
 How should I kill that girl this time around?

586
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,800
 Why?

587
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,800
 It's time to accept it.

588
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,390
 That what's left for us is a tragic ending.

589
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:59,550
 That I will destroy your whole life.

590
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:00,990
 Kang Yeong Hwa. Die.

591
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,910
 No, Yeong Hwa!
