1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:12,060

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,590

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,370

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,220

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,450

6
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,170

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,030

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,740

9
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,620
What?

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,240
Were you looking at me like that the whole time?

11
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,430
I wanted to be the first one to wish you a happy birthday.

12
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,760
Happy birthday...

13
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,390
Kang Yeong Hwa.

14
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,040
Thank you.

15
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,110
This is the best present.

16
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,980
- Really? 
 - Yes.

17
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,660
You probably don't need a present, then. Right?

18
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,660
Of course, I do.

19
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,810
I'll pick a really expensive birthday present.

20
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,560
You'd better be ready.

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,150
Okay.

22
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,440
We'll get to that in a bit.

23
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,330

24
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,250
It's so pretty.

25
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,840
What are you thinking?

26
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,350
That I want the time to pause like this. Something like that.

27
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,420
It's so perfect that I won't mind pausing like this.

28
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,070
There's something left to make it actually perfect.

29
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,580
Right. It has to be past midnight for things to be actually perfect.

30
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,150
Could you promise me just one thing?

31
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,610
I'm sure it won't happen,

32
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,910
but if something dangerous happens,

33
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,270
you'll protect yourself first.

34
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,620
What are you talking about? Only protect myself?

35
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,570
No matter what happens, focus on protecting yourself.

36
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,830
That's how we'll win.

37
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,310
You'll do that. Right?

38
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,770
I'll only focus on surviving. For us.

39
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,730
But I'll focus on you, too.

40
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,640
We need to survive together.

41
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,450
So you should promise me, too.

42
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,940
No matter what happens, you'll look out for yourself.

43
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,790
You'll do that for me.

44
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,210
Okay.

45
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,930
What's wrong? Is something there?

46
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,040
No, it's nothing. Let's go.

47
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800

48
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,800
Thank you, Yoon Je.

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,780
Gosh.

50
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,150
- You're hungry, right? 
 - Totally.

51
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,140
Let's hurry.

52
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,900
It'll pass in the blink of an eye. Don't worry so much.

53
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,840
If Seok Cheol Hwan shows up today,

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,950
you need to leave this place immediately.

55
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,400
What do you mean if? Do you think he'll come here by chance?

56
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,420
Drive calmly, no matter how rushed you are.

57
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,910
You understand, right?

58
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,200
Why are you talking like that?

59
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,090
As if you won't come with us.

60
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,070
Aren't you coming? Don't you want to have a birthday party?

61
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,740
Yes, coming.

62
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,550
Don't worry for no reason and come.

63
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,430

64
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,520

Be careful.

65
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Ta-da.

66
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,160
Wow.

67
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,610
Okay. One, two, one, two, three, four.

68

71
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,610
What?

72
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,540
He doesn't know how to read the room.

73
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,050
Ignore him. Start from "Happy birthday, dear Kang Yeong Hwa" again.

74
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,350
One, two, one, two, three, four.

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,190
Happy birthday.

79
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,660
This is the best birthday of my life.

80
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,070
Thank you so much, everyone.

81
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,400
Let me make a wish.

82
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,980
Let the four of us celebrate together next year, too.

83
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,400
I'll blow out the candles.

84
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,290
What? Why did they go out?

85
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,610

86
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,310
Sis.

87
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,800
Remember what I said. Right?

88
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,910
Only focus on yourself for us to win.

89
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,520
Don't get hurt.

90
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,470
It's okay. Go to the back door.

91
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,150
Since you went into a cabin and disappeared,

92
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,270
I almost couldn't find you.

93
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,390
Go! Go!

94
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,590
Go! Go!

95
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,550
Yoon Je!

96
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,030
Mr. Jang!

97
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,860
Mr. Jang.

98
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,700
Yoon Je.

99
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,490
I should've finished you off a long time ago.

100
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,240
It took me too long.

101
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,150
Get out of the way.

102
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,730
I don't have the time to...

103
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,360
deal with someone like you.

104
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,120
They key! The key!

105
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,610
I don't see the key, Yeong Hwa.

106
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,420
Don't move, and wait here with Mr. Jang.

107
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,300
Kang Yeong Hwa!

108
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,710
Just a little bit. Please.

109
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,030
Yoon Je.

110
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,390
Kang Yeong Hwa!

111
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,030
You can never get away from me!

112
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,990
Na Yeon.

113
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,820
CEO Han.

114
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,810
Where's Ms. Kang right now?

115
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,870
Na Yeon.

116
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,600
Go to the hospital first.

117
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,300
- Yeong Hwa— 
 - I'll go to her.

118
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,620
Make sure to go to the hospital.

119
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,710
CEO Han.

120
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,790
Kang Yeong Hwa.

121
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,560
You shouldn't be running away like this right now.

122
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,060
By chance, do you still not know...

123
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,420
what will happen if you stay alive tonight?

124
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,730
Yes, Kang Yeong Hwa.

125
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,970
Go ahead and disappear.

126
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,790
You'll never see Do Ha again.

127
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,210
CEO Han. CEO Han!

128
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,300
Wake up, CEO Han!

129
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,570
There's nothing to protect you now.

130
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,660
Hurry up and run away.

131
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,030
Go!

132
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,860
Let's stop now...

133
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,080
and see you in our next lives.

134
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,230
Why are you trying so hard to protect her?

135
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,360
You know you'll disappear, too.

136
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,610
W-What's he talking about?

137
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,050
Listen carefully, Kang Yeong Hwa.

138
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,160
I was by your side for 1,500 years

139
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,940
just to...

140
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,200
protect you.

141
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,750
In order for me to do that,

142
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,700
we need to say goodbye.

143
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,310
If I disappear,

144
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,360
Do Ha's reason to exist will disappear, too.

145
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,580
What do you think?

146
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,090
Do you still want to live?

147
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,780
There isn't much time left.

148
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,590
So, if you hang in there for a bit...

149
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,770
No.

150
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,270
No, don't go.

151
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,850
That's not true. Right?

152
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,350
It's okay.

153
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,390
Even without me,

154
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,140
you'll go on just fine.

155
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,430
Because...

156
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,090
you kept your promise to me—

157
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,900
That's enough!

158
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,020
I didn't promise anything.

159
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,720
No.

160
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,940
The reason she keeps reincarnating...

161
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,360
is because my revenge hasn't been completed.

162
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,250
No.

163
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,410
It's because you weren't killed by me.

164
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,340
I should've finished this 1,500 years ago.

165
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,910
I'm finally doing that now.

166
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,470
You're foolish, too.

167
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,950
You ended up...

168
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:04,580
losing her forever, too.

169
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,860
No.

170
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,370
N-No.

171
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,160
What will I do without you?

172
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,280
How am I supposed to be without you?

173
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,890
I'll always be by your side.

174
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,910
♫  When I suddenly looked back  ♫

175
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,000
So don't cry.

176
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,890
♫  I knew it was a dream  ♫

177
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,430
♫  because you smiled at me  ♫

178
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,640
Out of the miserable choices I had...

179
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,140
♫  Tears flow from the dream you embroidered  ♫

180
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,570
...you were the most fortunate thing that happened.

181
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,320
Don't go.

182
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,000
♫  The memory of us in love back then  ♫

183
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,420
 Her tears fell like the rain that day.

184
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:11,450
 I fell asleep for the first time in 1,500 years.

185
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:17,460
 And the moments I encountered you unfolded like a dream.

186
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,110
♫  The warmth we shared became all the seasons  ♫

187
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,170
♫  The sound of you breathing, sleeping next to me  ♫

188
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,890
 You approached me to kill me, but...

189
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,860
 Live.

190
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,940
 Live no matter what.

191
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,860
 I saw the moment that became my only reason to live.

192
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,140
♫  I long for you today once again  ♫

193
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,870
 After seeing your countless deaths,

194
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,050
 the moment I got to meet you as Kang Yeong Hwa for the first time...

195
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,010
♫  It's a kite I should forget  ♫

196
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,270
♫  No matter how many times I tell myself  ♫

197
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,270
 I won't tell you to stay forever.

198
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,530
 Could you just...

199
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,370
 stay by my side a little longer?

200
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,870
 I thought I blamed and resented you,

201
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:22,430
 but there were moments I realized all of that was my longing for you.

202
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:30,210
 Seeing the dreamlike moments in which we were finally together, I realized that...

203
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,920
 I was miserable in my long life at times,

204
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,470
 but because I met you,

205
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,470
 I was finally able to

206
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,110
 be overwhelmingly happy.

207
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,550
♫  Even after this night passes and...  ♫

208
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,440
No, no...

209
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,670
No...

210
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:57,250
♫  I'll dream of you forever, I promise  ♫

211
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:08,210
♫  The love we shared back then  ♫

212
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,580
No, no...

213
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,410
Don't go! No...

214
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,650
Don't go...

215
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:27,670
♫  The warmth we shared became all the seasons  ♫

216
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:33,100
♫  The sound of you breathing, sleeping next to me  ♫

217
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,380
No...

218
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,790
No!

219
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:43,250
♫  was the only thing I ever prayed for  ♫

220
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:54,730
♫  I long for you once again  ♫

221
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,550
The moon was up.

222
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,620
Since the sun is so bright,

223
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,130
the moon isn't visible...

224
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,910
even though it's up there.

225
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,030
You're right.

226
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,970
The moon is always up during the day.

227
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,910
We just don't see it.

228
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:33,210
Just because they're invisible doesn't mean they don't exist.

229
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,330
Just like you, you mean?

230
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,640
Yes. Just like me.

231
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,220
But wouldn't it be too lonely...

232
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,610
if your presence is not recognized?

233
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,350
It's okay.

234
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,340
Because...

235
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,400
there's someone who'll always remember me.

236
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,190
I will...

237
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,570
no longer feel lonely.

238
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,330
Just like the moon in the sky over there,

239
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,600
I'll always be with you.

240
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,530
Whenever...

241
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,380
or wherever...

242
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,320
I love you, Kang Yeong Hwa.

243
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,620
I love you, too.

244
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,560
 I didn't realize it back then.

245
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,370
 His ever so sweet "I love you"

246
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:52,620
 and his bright smile...

247
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,710
 was his farewell.

248
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,600
Are you awake now?

249
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,010
You've been passed out all this time.

250
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,210
Are you okay?

251
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,040
Yes.

252
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,600
How about the rest of them?

253
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,910
Yoon Je and CEO Han...

254
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,560
are at Han Joon Oh's funeral...

255
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,720
 That's how our time together ended.

256
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,010
 And...

257
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,830
 a true miracle that no one...

258
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,010
 expected started happening.

259
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,290
Disappear?

260
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,200
Joon Oh isn't in the morgue?

261
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,840
Again?

262
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,180
Yeong Hwa.

263
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,310
Han Joon Oh disappeared.

264
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,600
 Did he really come back to life?

265
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,670
Yeong Hwa.

266
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,640
Thank you...

267
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,080
for coming back to me...

268
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,040
Thank you so much.

269
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,610
Who are you...

270
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,560
Do you know me?

271
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,800
I'll call you as soon as Joon Oh recovers.

272
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,340
This is so great, CEO Han.

273
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,200
I'm so glad this happened.

274
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,270
This is for the better.

275
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,830
Please get him a new phone.

276
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,180
Okay, I will.

277
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,720
But he doesn't remember at all. Right?

278
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,530
Including what happened recently and Ms. Kang, too?

279
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,100
Yes.

280
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,810
Dr. Choi diagnosed it as memory loss.

281
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,520
Let's wait a bit until he gets his memory back.

282
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,610
Should we be glad about this?

283
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:42,800

284
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,000

285
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,230

286
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,410

287
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,090
CEO Han.

288
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,440
He finished the chemotherapy. Right?

289
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,610
We should keep an eye on it, but he's cancer-free now.

290
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,650
- Thank you for waiting. 
 - Not at all.

291
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,960
It's a miracle he's no longer ill.

292
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,110
I'm so glad he recovered while we were recasting.

293
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,030
I know.

294
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,580
It's Han Joon Oh. Han Joon Oh!

295
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,130
- Mr. Han Joon Oh. 
 - Congratulations on your recovery.

296
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,050
Congratulations.

297
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,450
Mr. Han.

298
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,280
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations on your recovery.

299
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,670
- Congratulations. 
 - Fighting!

300
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,010
Congratulations on beating cancer.

301
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,460
But isn't it too soon to come back like this?

302
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,000
The scandal involving Jeong Yi Seul quieted down.

303
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,890
Could you say something to your fans who are still curious about it?

304
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,910
What's your next plan?

305
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,790
It was difficult for him to come back.

306
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,980
Please try not to be so aggressive.

307
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,940
They say breakups...

308
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,510
make people stronger.

309
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,590
We're all here to cheer for each other today.

310
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,190
Wouldn't it be more beneficial to this gathering to refrain from negative comments?

311
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,400
Wasn't it a perfect casting?

312
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,710
We'll do better. Yes.

313
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,590
I think I screwed it up. What do I do?

314
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,510
Was I okay? Wasn't it awkward? Huh? Huh?

315
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,220
Gosh, it's been too long.

316
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,920
He really is Joon Oh.

317
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,330
Why did you talk with that tone earlier?

318
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,940
I don't know. It just came out like that.

319
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,380
By the way, wasn't I amazing earlier?

320
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:26,770
Did I become a genius at historical drama since I came back to life? Huh? Huh?

321
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,760
I guess he left some traces behind.

322
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,570
Who am I talking to?

323
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,670
Huh? It's nothing. It's nothing.

324
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:39,350
Go get changed first. People are waiting.

325
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,840
By the way, who's Kang Yeong Hwa?

326
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,740
What?

327
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,810
That name comes to mind whenever I wake up.

328
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,310
So, the thing is...

329
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,890
You don't have to worry about her.

330
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,550
Isn't this it?

331
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,490
The memory I lost a year ago?

332
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,800
You've been doing fine so far.

333
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,990
Why do you suddenly want to know?

334
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,120
You need to tell me now.

335
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,480
Look. When I woke up, Goo Tae Joo was dead,

336
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,720
and Attorney Go went to prison because of that.

337
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,690
But CEO Seok was behind all this.

338
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,580
And Kang Yeong Hwa, on top of that.

339
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,830
What does all this mean?

340
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:25,060
Let's say you haven't told me since I was doing chemotherapy.

341
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,590
But you need to tell me now.

342
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,570
Joon Oh,

343
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,000
you don't remember certain things for a reason.

344
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,500
You'll get to know slowly if that's what you want.

345
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,190
Get ready and come out. We'll wait outside.

346
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,400
I mean, whoa...

347
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,330
Thank you.

348
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,230
How come you're free at this hour? I thought there was a party.

349
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,190
I escaped.

350
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,380
Joon Oh brought up Yeong Hwa.

351
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,230
- Does he remember her? 
 - No.

352
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:12,100
He says he keeps thinking of her name.

353
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,210
He suddenly spoke in a historical drama tone, too.

354
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,100
I think it's... How should I say it?

355
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,240
You scared me.

356
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,540
There's no way Han Joon Oh remembers.

357
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,690
So, how's Yeong Hwa doing?

358
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,970
I haven't heard about her at all.

359
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,560
There isn't much to tell you.

360
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,320
Of course.

361
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,940
I'm sure it's hard.

362
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,260
They had such a sad goodbye.

363
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,010
You know, Yeong Hwa...

364
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,630
is doing way too well.

365
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,910
Way better than before.

366
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,510
Pardon?

367
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,100

368
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,160
Let's have dinner together tonight.

369
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,340
What do you like, Yeong Hwa?

370
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:11,040
Well, I just like humble food like pasta and things like that.

371
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,170
Seriously, who parked here?

372
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,810
Don't you know you're not supposed to stop or park within 5 meters of a fire hydrant?

373
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,960
I need to take pictures of people like this and...

374
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,810
- report them. 
 - Hold on, hold on.

375
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,520
This is my car.

376
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,620
Was it yours?

377
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,510
Yes, mine.

378
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,970
I see.

379
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,310
One.

380
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,960
- I'll never! 
 - Two.

381
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:47,530
 Just as Na Yeon said, I've been doing well.

382
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,890
- Dong Joon. 
  - Soon after he left,

383
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,530
 I returned to my job as a firefighter and...

384
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,530
Okay, should we go out? Wait a minute.

385
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,100
 I spent each day more normally than anyone else.

386
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,720
I saw him acting weird.

387
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,590

388
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:11,520
If you do not... Do not allow it...

389
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,740
The king's order... That's what it means...

390
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,200
If you do not... Geez.

391
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,430
Why can't I do it?

392
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,880
If you do not allow...

393
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,100
What's this?

394
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,390

395
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:01,510
Shouldn't you have told me if this happened?

396
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,830
This woman is Kang Yeong Hwa. Right?

397
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,070
The one who hugged me at the funeral.

398
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,100
Who is she exactly that she was doing that...

399
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,220
A year ago,

400
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,400
she worked as your bodyguard.

401
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,850
Bodyguard?

402
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,840
But she's back to work as a firefighter.

403
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,810
She saved you when you were in an accident at the Han River.

404
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,630
 Apologize, Mr. Han Joon Oh.

405
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,590
Is she the one who twisted my arm like this?

406
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,040
She saved your life.

407
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,020
She let you be where you are now, too.

408
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,280
But as I said, she no longer has anything to do with you—

409
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,650
No.

410
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,220
She does if what you said is true.

411
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,580
I was in excruciating pain when I did chemotherapy.

412
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,180
Do you know how much I wanted to give up?

413
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,750
But it felt like someone inside me told me...

414
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,100
not to give up.

415
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,890
That I must live since it took a lot for me to come back to life.

416
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:24,570
I endured something on my own for the first time.

417
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,700
If she's the one who let me come this far,

418
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,310
I'd love to meet her once.

419
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,880
There's something I want to tell her.

420
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,090

421
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,620
Did you...

422
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,570
hang my lantern?

423
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,370
Excuse me.

424
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,530
♫  Under the pouring moonlight  ♫

425
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,580
It was you, wasn't it?

426
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,840
♫  Your eyes looked back  ♫

427
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,090
Long time no see. Have you been well?

428
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:29,780
♫  Your eyes are deeper than words  ♫

429
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,540
Well...

430
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:38,230
How could I have been well? I finally managed to meet you now.

431
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:44,580
There were pictures of us posed like a couple.

432
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:49,690
Did something happen between us?

433
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,230
I'm just your fan.

434
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:57,410
We got close while I worked as your bodyguard.

435
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,510
That's all.

436
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:03,380
But you said you weren't a fan back then.

437
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:08,460
I came because CEO Han told me to meet you once.

438
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,940
I hope that answered your question.

439
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:13,770
Well, then...

440
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,810
Wait, Ms. Kang.

441
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,150
I came to meet you for a reason.

442
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,350
Please let me talk to you.

443
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,380
♫  All of our...  ♫

444
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,430
♫  All of our...  ♫

445
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,570
Well, this drama I'm in...

446
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,470
is a very important opportunity for me.

447
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,260
But I keep talking in a strange tone

448
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,850
and I keep thinking of you here and there.

449
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:53,760
My brother told me that you're the one...

450
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,130
who let me be here.

451
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,890
Is that true?

452
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:05,060
Is that the reason why I'm like that?

453
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:10,540
What would you do if that were true?

454
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,830
If that were true...

455
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,220
I'll be thankful just for today and forget about it all.

456
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,290
I should live a good life so you feel rewarded for saving my life.

457
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:37,260
I was really curious about our history all this time, but

458
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,370
I'll no longer be curious from now on.

459
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:46,930
Because I can't miss out on the present while being trapped in the past.

460
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:58,140
I'll work really hard. So please take a look at me later.

461
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,180
I came here to tell you that.

462
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,140
It might've sounded hurtful to you, but—

463
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,240
Thank you.

464
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,480
I felt like I was lost.

465
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:25,130
It was so hard to pretend like I was okay and doing well,

466
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:34,030
but I really should have done that, I think I know now.

467
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,750
You're right.

468
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,710
Be thankful or whatever, just for today.

469
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,940
Just live well.

470
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,200
I think...

471
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,000
that will be enough for me.

472
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,740
I'll get going, then.

473
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,200
Well, hold on.

474
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,920
Well...

475
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,530
I found this at home.

476
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,040
I don't think I wrote this.

477
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,950
I came to give you this, too.

478
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,070

479
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,820

480
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,150
I'll get going.

481
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,920

482
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:07,610
 Right now, I'm waiting for you to wake up.

483
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,490
 I want you to open your eyes quickly,

484
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,550
 but I also want you to wake up a little later.

485
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:25,780
 I want this moment to go by very slowly.

486
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:30,760
 To be by your side forever,

487
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,860
 I can start everything from the beginning...

488
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,200
 although you won't...

489
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,810
 recognize me for 1,500 years.

490
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,790
 But I couldn't...

491
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:54,580
 put you in hell in which you can die at any moment.

492
00:47:55,620 --> 00:48:01,710
 Because my only reason to live was to protect you.

493
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,710
 Don't give up after losing me.

494
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:11,140
 You'll get to look back sometimes,

495
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,380
 but leave our farewell behind

496
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,910
 and do your best to be devoted to today.

497
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:24,540
 Because you're the most courageous person I know.

498
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,920

499
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,940
 There were a lot of things I wanted to tell you,

500
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,240
 but it looks like you'll wake up soon.

501
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,070
 I'll have to stop writing now.

502
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,800
 I love you...

503
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,700
 time and time again,

504
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,030
 Kang Yeong Hwa.

505
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,600
Thank you.

506
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,950
This really is the best present.

507
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,150
 That wasn't a goodbye.

508
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:33,380
 It was his wish for me to live well

509
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:38,920
 and his promise to keep an eye on me whenever and wherever.

510
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,180
Hey, Kang Yeong Hwa.

511
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,320
It's your birthday. Why did you come home so late?

512
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,780
I'm not late. It's not even 8 :00.

513
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,380
I prepared you a birthday dinner a long time ago.

514
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,730
- Couldn't you be home sooner? 
 - Birthday dinner?

515
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:00,450
It's still her birthday. You can't get mad at her.

516
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,510
She should consider the people waiting for her.

517
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,080
- Is someone else here? 
 - Yes.

518
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,600
Happy birthday, Senior Yeong Hwa!

519
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,330
Happy birthday!

520
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:12,250
Come inside. I'm starving to death.

521
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,070
Hurry up!

522
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,110
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

523
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,650

 "What sin did I commit in my previous life?"

526
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,680
 People say that often.

527
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,660
 But there's no way for us to know what sin we committed in the past.

528
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,080
 Because the karma we create

529
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,790
 is just a question we face in each life.

530
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:49,170
 As long as you have the courage to face your fault...

531
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,070

532
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,040
 and affection toward someone,

533
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:02,710
 I firmly believe we can endure this difficult life.

534
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:09,620

535
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,910
 Thinking of each day as a present

536
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,880
 and giving it all I've got.

537
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:23,110
 That's the best way to return the favor to the one who saved my life.

538
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:39,150
Hello. How does it feel to come back after a long break?

539
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:41,060
 Please tell us!

540
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,650
 - How do you feel? 
 - Please look over here.

541
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:46,890
 Looking good!

542
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,650
 - Congratulations! 
 - Excuse me.

543
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,290
 Look this way.

544
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:54,940
I was gifted with this rare opportunity.

545
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,400
I'll do my best to return the favor to everyone.

546
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,470
I'd be so grateful if you'd keep an eye on me.

547
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,380
 - Thank you. 
 - Congratulations.

548
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,840
 Congratulations.

549
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,440
 Congratulations.

550
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:48,330

551
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:52,230

552
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,450

553
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:56,250

554
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,560
 On the flight to the Antarctica that day,

555
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,200
 he visited me in my dream like a present.

556
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,140
 My regrettable dream from the past

557
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:15,950
 that I've been wanting to turn back visited me after a long time.

558
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:22,160

559
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:28,820
 Thank you to our wonderful Chief Editor kakashiandme!

560
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:34,330
 Thank you to our amazing Chief Segmenter bepina!

561
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:38,140
 I love you, My Lord.

563
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:51,490
 Thank you to all our language moderators and their teams!

564
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:58,560
 And last but not least thank you to all our viewers!

565
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:04,170
 You have no idea how long I've been regretting this moment.

566
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,860
 I will never let you go.

567
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,950
 Even if you do not let me go,

568
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:34,850
 the reality will not change.

569
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,130
 I know.

570
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,580
 This is just a dream.

571
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:47,700
 But I want to change my decision in the past in this way.

572
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:55,450
 So we can be together, at least in my dreams.

573
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:02,380
 Just as we were together for 1,500 years because of your yearning,

574
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:09,900
 I hope my sincere longing reaches you.

575
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,900
 So we can meet...

576
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,280
 in our next lives again.

577
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,310
Looks like they're here for a school trip.

578
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:23,600
I chose the wrong day.

579
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,910
 Check this out!

580
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,900

(Located in Sungkyunkwan)

581
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,800
The moon was up there.

582
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,660
Wow.

583
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,120

Yes.

589

Thank you.

590
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,750
It's dangerous.

591
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,310
There's nothing up there. What are you taking photos of?

592
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,170
- The moon. 
 - The moon?

593
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:47,740
It's daytime. There's no moon.

594
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:51,700
Not there. Over there.

595
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,180
There it is.

596
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,540
