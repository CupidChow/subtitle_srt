1
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,019
(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,020
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,020
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,020
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

5
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,590
Jun O, are you okay?

6
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,990
Not now.

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,230
Jun O! Are you all right?

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Wait.

9
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,370
Jun O. Wake up, Jun O!

10
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,410
Master.

11
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,490
Jun O.

12
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,089
Jun O!

13
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,990
Jun O.

14
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:06,890
What happened?

15
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,869
I'm asking you. What happened?

16
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,199
Stop making a fuss.

17
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,239
Jun O.

18
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,680
I thought something had happened to you.

19
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:28,819
Has the pain gotten worse? How...

20
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,090
I just...

21
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,489
felt dizzy for a second.

22
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,590
Is he telling the truth?

23
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,389
Well,

24
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,729
he leaned on me for a moment, and...

25
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,380
Let me check one thing.

26
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:07,789
You have a pulse.

27
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,960
You should have told me if you were feeling down.

28
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:14,400
This won't do. Let's cancel your appointments first.

29
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,329
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

30
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,539
We'll talk later.

31
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,669
Ms. Kang.

32
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,569
Will you do me a favour?

33
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,079
We're here.

34
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,460
Right.

35
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,460
- Thank you, Mr. Jang. - Sure thing.

36
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,299
Mr. Jang,

37
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:00,069
can I take a sick leave for a few days?

38
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,139
It's just that I don't feel well.

39
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,849
I'll talk to Mr. Han about it.

40
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,079
You will have to talk to Jun O about that.

41
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,850
No, just tell Jun O that...

42
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:16,319
Just tell him that I only need to rest for a few days.

43
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,960
Are you sure you're okay?

44
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,200
Yes.

45
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,399
I'm okay.

46
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,100
That's good, then.

47
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,100
Thank you for understanding.

48
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,669
Sure. Have a good night.

49
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,780
I could have...

50
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,379
lost this body just now.

51
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,919
Not yet.

52
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,419
Never.

53
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,629
I told you to take a seat.

54
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,770
Drink some water.

55
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,309
What's wrong?

56
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:11,350
The water's cold.

57
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,549
You know what?

58
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:14,850
Let's go to a hospital and get a thorough check.

59
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,989
You were so dizzy that you passed out.

60
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:20,249
- That's serious. - I said I was fine.

61
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:23,820
How many times do I have to tell you?

62
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,059
This is not a matter that you can just insist on.

63
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,660
You fainted just now.

64
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,539
That was certainly unexpected.

65
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,939
So was letting Young Hwa know who I really was.

66
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,379
Who you really were?

67
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:50,320
It was definitely Master.

68
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:55,720
How did the man in my dream show up before me?

69
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,140
I was probably seeing things because he resembled Jun O so much.

70
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,580
But it felt so real.

71
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,700
Who are you?

72
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,309
You can...

73
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:49,140
see me.

74
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,020
What happened?

75
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,249
The mirror...

76
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,719
The mirror.

77
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,049
What? What mirror?

78
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:03,460
There's a mirror. Don't you see it?

79
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,640
What is this memory?

80
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:23,609
(Moon in the Day)

81
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,210
(Episode 6)

82
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,270
I have been looking all over for you.

83
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,939
Have you been looking for me?

84
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,479
I plan to have supper with Do Ha, so get a table prepared.

85
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:58,679
Yes, Lord So.

86
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,580
It is safe to eat.

87
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,399
Your hand used to tremble at first.

88
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,229
Your shoulder injury must have gotten better.

89
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,570
So, how did you hurt yourself?

90
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,369
Were you stabbed?

91
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,609
Why will you not answer?

92
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,810
It was nothing, my lord.

93
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,019
A mere maid was stabbed.

94
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,290
Was it really nothing?

95
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,200
Search every nook and cranny.

96
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,460
- Yes! - Yes!

97
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,499
- It is not here. - Not here either.

98
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:29,639
What are you doing?

99
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,470
I heard that our stuff at home started disappearing.

100
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,440
So, I ordered them to investigate...

101
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,749
a new addition to our house.

102
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,930
These were all in the maid's bundle.

103
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
This is clear evidence,

104
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,100
so you must not be able to deny it.

105
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,970
Can I take your silence as a yes?

106
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,479
You will take it as a yes even if I say no, will you not?

107
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,680
You ungrateful girl.

108
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,060
She does not intend on begging for forgiveness.

109
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,830
What shall we do with her, Do Ha?

110
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,600
She stole from my own house,

111
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,369
so I must cut off her hands and sever her feet...

112
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,899
to set an example.

113
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,340
Her sin has yet to be proven.

114
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,850
Someone else could have planted this evidence.

115
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,710
Someone else would do it on purpose?

116
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,749
Then who, and for what purpose?

117
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,320
I took her in.

118
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,158
I will thoroughly investigate it,

119
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,060
you need not worry...

120
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,499
That is right.

121
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,359
You took her in. However,

122
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,840
everything in this house is mine.

123
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,540
I will deal with this my way.

124
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,268
Put this girl in the shed.

125
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:16,180
And until she confesses her sins, do not stop...

126
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:18,850
beating her up!

127
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:20,779
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

128
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,670
That is one tenacious girl.

129
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,139
How come I do not hear a single cry?

130
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,180
May I ask why you are doing this?

131
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,609
Are you doubting your own father?

132
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:58,549
They were all expensive jewellery.

133
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,649
There are not many...

134
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:03,420
who can put their hands to them in this house.

135
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,659
That is strange.

136
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,060
Since when have you worried...

137
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,899
for your servants?

138
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,440
Are you worried that something will happen to the girl?

139
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,009
She is merely a lowly maid.

140
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,580
She did not seem that lowly to me.

141
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,479
Her words and actions...

142
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,249
seemed elegant and proud.

143
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,320
They were enough to make a man fall in love with her.

144
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,529
My lord.

145
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,129
You must have a look at this.

146
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:53,470
(Report the daughter of Gaya's general for 100 sacks of rice.)

147
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:57,379
The traitor's child still lives.

148
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,949
You said that someone knew...

149
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,320
the faces of Gaya's general and his family, right?

150
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,920
Yes, my lord.

151
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,050
Find him and bring him to me tomorrow morning.

152
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,560
I must identify the face...

153
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,129
of that suspicious maid.

154
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,930
Yes, my lord.

155
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,749
How are your bruises?

156
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:48,930
Master?

157
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,430
Are you badly hurt?

158
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,040
This has turned out better for you, has it not?

159
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,580
This is an easy way for you...

160
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,479
to eliminate a sloppy assassin who was arrogant enough...

161
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,379
to declare to you that she would kill you.

162
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:14,149
You said that you would get...

163
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,519
revenge with your own hands.

164
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,359
Do not sound so weak.

165
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,940
Pretend ignorance.

166
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,440
You do not want to get involved.

167
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,340
After I met you,

168
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,379
I wanted to achieve something for once.

169
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,029
Lord Do Ha?

170
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:06,830
Is that girl...

171
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,169
the daughter of Gaya's general?

172
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,509
I will let her go and make sure she never comes back here.

173
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,509
Ignore us.

174
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,710
That is an order and a request.

175
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,519
Please forgive me for my loyalty.

176
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,499
We have no time to lose.

177
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,700
We must go.

178
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,000
Follow this path, and it will lead to the old Great Gaya.

179
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,799
It is dangerous as it is a slope,

180
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,100
but you will not attract any attention.

181
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,600
You did not have to kill him.

182
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,770
Why did you kill him?

183
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,740
Had I not killed him,

184
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,579
the world would have found out who you were.

185
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,609
Then...

186
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:29,719
Then, you will die.

187
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,149
Why do you go so far...

188
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:34,889
to save me?

189
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:37,659
I said after I met you,

190
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:42,560
I wanted to achieve something for once.

191
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,330
Just like what you said one day,

192
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,270
I will...

193
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:53,869
desperately try and survive.

194
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:56,980
What kind of man who wants to live...

195
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,980
kills his own bodyguard...

196
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,249
and helps me escape from prison...

197
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,409
when I am accused of being a traitor's daughter?

198
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,178
Do you even know what will happen if I return?

199
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,520
"Survive."

200
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,419
"I will certainly come to kill you."

201
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,330
That is all you need to say.

202
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,939
If you fail to survive,

203
00:18:23,939 --> 00:18:25,310
I will not let it pass.

204
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,909
I promise to come back.

205
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,619
I will wait for that day.

206
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,990
So, do whatever you can...

207
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:44,260
to survive,

208
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,560
Ri Ta.

209
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:59,409
So, a popular celebrity showed up in your dream...

210
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,840
and told you to leave for the Great Gaya?

211
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,379
Yes.

212
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,419
The dream itself isn't the issue.

213
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,520
But I've seen him in real life.

214
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,790
When I was little, he used to...

215
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:19,559
try and talk to me.

216
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,000
Twenty years ago, that celebrity must have been young as well.

217
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,000
How did you know it was him?

218
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,800
Are you saying that it wasn't real...

219
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,540
when I saw him?

220
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:33,139
If you see another ghost, say,

221
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,840
"This is not real. All this is fake."

222
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,750
Tell yourself that.

223
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:42,080
Accepting the fact that it's fake...

224
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,619
is the first step of the treatment.

225
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:46,449
Do you understand?

226
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:04,469
Chief Monk!

227
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,639
Chief Monk!

228
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,080
Seeing that you came all the way here,

229
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,980
you must have been furious.

230
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,050
Because I almost lost my body.

231
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:21,719
Now that you have a human body,

232
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:24,819
did you get greedy to have this life?

233
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,990
I've seen this trifling life for over 1,000 years.

234
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,859
Why would I be greedy for?

235
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,869
Then what are you waiting for, if not the greed?

236
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:40,040
If the poltergeist is attached to a human,

237
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:43,939
it means the human was its resentment.

238
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,850
You can only leave...

239
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,449
when the resentment disappears.

240
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,149
I will not tell you the details...

241
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:58,290
as you already know about it.

242
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
I am back...

243
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,709
to resolve my resentment and leave.

244
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,010
If I was hesitant to kill the woman,

245
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,389
then something must've gone wrong.

246
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,259
So don't ever bother me.

247
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,959
If you intervene once again,

248
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,100
I won't stop only breaking the pottery.

249
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,899
The resentment is...

250
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,310
not only about the revenge.

251
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,780
Sometimes, we should carefully look into it.

252
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,729
- Why are you so serious? - What?

253
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,030
You told me that the doctor said you are fine.

254
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Na Yeon,

255
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm worried if I go crazy or something.

256
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,439
I will be fine if I take the medicine, right?

257
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,980
Hey, pull yourself together!

258
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,550
Will you be quiet!

259
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,649
Come in!

260
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:36,189
Start!

261
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:47,730
The attack succeeded!

262
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
The attack succeeded!

263
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:53,510
Nice!

264
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,409
Here I go!

265
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,309
Take this!

266
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,750
Director Choi won!

267
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,050
(Young Hwa)

268
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,490
If I weren't hurt, I would've won easily.

269
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:09,189
Seeing the things doesn't matter.

270
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,129
The world drives you crazy anyway. Just ignore it!

271
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:14,490
I got it.

272
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,129
- I don't here you. - Gosh!

273
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:19,699
Okay. Whatever they are, I'll ignore them all!

274
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,269
(Kendo from children to adults)

275
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,300
(Daehan Choi Na Yeon Kendo)

276
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,379
Good bye!

277
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,480
- See you later. - Bye!

278
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,679
Please come again soon!

279
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:39,590
Gosh!

280
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,459
Yes, this is real.

281
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,300
I saw stupid things.

282
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,600
It's time to forget.

283
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,139
(Kendo)

284
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,750
You wanted to go to that temple from early in the morning.

285
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,679
Do you know how many hours we've stayed in the car?

286
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,330
Maybe I worried too much.

287
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,369
You are fine as if nothing happened.

288
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,469
You said "Master."

289
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:35,980
You...

290
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:38,780
You saw me in your dream, right?

291
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,609
It's just a guy...

292
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,919
who looks like you.

293
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,119
Now, since she remembers me...

294
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,929
It is time to resolve my resentment.

295
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:04,240
I knew it. My instincts were right.

296
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,469
I should've known when you said dreams about the master.

297
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,340
But you were the one who told me to ignore those things.

298
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,679
It's okay to dream about a celebrity.

299
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,250
You must like him so much to have a dream about...

300
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,820
Love can't be a crime.

301
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,250
It's not something like that.

302
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:23,589
Let's hold out.

303
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,419
You said the bodyguard job ends less than one month, right?

304
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:28,260
When you no longer see him,

305
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:29,799
your heart for him will also fade away.

306
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,199
So you won't see things any longer.

307
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,369
Drink. Just drink.

308
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,550
Hey!

309
00:25:52,949 --> 00:25:55,619
Who said it was a nightmare?

310
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:10,300
Where is Young Hwa?

311
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,070
She's over there. Don't worry.

312
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:17,479
- Who are you? - Oh, let me introduce myself.

313
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,510
I'm...

314
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,209
Jun O's manager, Jang Yoon Je.

315
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,519
Oh, I see. Jun O's...

316
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,619
(Jang Yoon Je)

317
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,489
Sorry?

318
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,889
Oh, one more.

319
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:33,060
Would you please write your signature here?

320
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,530
(The confidentiality agreement)

321
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,780
There's no more reason to buy the time.

322
00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:01,350
If I miss this opportunity,

323
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:03,990
I may not be able to lift the curse.

324
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,030
It only ends when I kill you.

325
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:19,939
What?

326
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,340
It's Master.

327
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,219
Why do you keep following me?

328
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,229
I should've taken the medicine instead of alcohol.

329
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,830
Let go of my hand.

330
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,030
Oh, I see.

331
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:47,299
You will be in trouble if you keep acting like this.

332
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,340
I could've kicked you toward there.

333
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:53,270
I have quick reflexes, right?

334
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,679
The doctor told me...

335
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,280
that you were a fake.

336
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,119
How can a fake win a real one?

337
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,830
So please leave when I let you.

338
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,659
I'll let you go just for today.

339
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,459
You should take your hands off, then.

340
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,629
I see.

341
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:23,939
Then, goodbye, Master.

342
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,770
You're still here. How could I leave now?

343
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,079
We are here in Korea.

344
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,909
Men from Silla can't stay here.

345
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:35,179
You were a girl from Gaya.

346
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,859
I've drunken too much.

347
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:48,129
If Master doesn't leave, I will.

348
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:54,070
Yes, let's go!

349
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:56,899
Here I go!

350
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:27,730
What?

351
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:31,169
Gosh!

352
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:34,469
Everything is sparkling!

353
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,139
This place is amazing.

354
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,649
I'm on my way to the real world!

355
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:44,020
Wait a second!

356
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,219
How could she...

357
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:54,590
With everyone's boyfriend, Jun O...

358
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,800
I can't even tell anyone what I saw.

359
00:29:58,899 --> 00:29:59,929
Delete it.

360
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:02,229
Because you already signed it,

361
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,039
- you'll have to pay a penalty if... - Be quiet!

362
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,969
I can't hear what they are saying.

363
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,770
- You're so loud... - Be quiet!

364
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,350
Why do you keep following me?

365
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:19,750
Just look at the front.

366
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,490
You may fall.

367
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:24,389
It's none of your business.

368
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,790
You told me to leave for the Great Gaya.

369
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,399
If I leave, will it solve the problem?

370
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:34,429
You know what will happen if you go back.

371
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,340
So even if you tell me to leave, I can't leave light-heartedly.

372
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:46,010
That's why I don't want to have dreams anymore.

373
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,649
What if I really leave, and something happens to the Master?

374
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,929
I mean, what if something happens to Jun O?

375
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't want to send neither Master nor Jun O away.

376
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,600
Don't you know...

377
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,770
what happens next?

378
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:14,240
I assume I left.

379
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,109
You told me to "survive" and handed me the lotus seed.

380
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:20,379
You also told me to come and kill you.

381
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:25,050
I will never see you, Master, in my dream again!

382
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,718
I am never going to dream about you!

383
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,219
I will never dream about...

384
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:04,959
Aren't you going to wake up, Young Hwa?

385
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
What?

386
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:16,739
When did I get back home?

387
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,600
Gosh. You're faking a blackout.

388
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,969
I have so many things to ask you!

389
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,909
Leave when I let you.

390
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,108
You have to let go of me.

391
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:29,850
I will never dream about...

392
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,189
What are these flashbacks?

393
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,060
Are you a vampire or what?

394
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,199
Does it kill you to get some sunlight?

395
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,830
Gosh. Put your clothes in the dressing room.

396
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,469
Gosh. What are these all over your clothes?

397
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:55,570
For goodness' sake!

398
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:58,080
My goodness!

399
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,350
Regret?

400
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,090
This hesitation doesn't mean I still have feelings for you.

401
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,859
It's because I'm curious why I was killed.

402
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,320
Mr. Han, what brought you here this early?

403
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:47,790
What's that suitcase?

404
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:49,730
Young Hwa took a sick leave,

405
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,330
so I ought to be here.

406
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,428
Goodness. You really don't have to.

407
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:56,030
Yoon Je is right.

408
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,369
I told you that I was all right.

409
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,840
I'm not here just because of your health.

410
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:08,250
The suspected abductor ran away.

411
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,719
He fled overseas.

412
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:15,290
- He fled? - Until we find his client,

413
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,190
I'll be by your side,

414
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,529
no matter what you say.

415
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,259
I thought you were going to kick me out.

416
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,929
I am going to.

417
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,839
Jun O.

418
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,068
Doctor Choi said you barely have a chance,

419
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:35,310
but I think otherwise.

420
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,040
I'm looking for chances in the States.

421
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,549
Let's go to the States together once we get a call.

422
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:45,619
Didn't you say this body was terminally ill?

423
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,619
Why is everyone worried about me when I will disappear soon?

424
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,529
How can you say that?

425
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,488
I am stating the facts.

426
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:56,529
Once you're dead,

427
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,400
is it all over?

428
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,310
Do you know what scared me the most...

429
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,790
when I heard you didn't have much time left?

430
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:25,319
I was scared that you'd be gone...

431
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:29,900
before I had a chance to say goodbye.

432
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:34,670
That you'd leave me...

433
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,940
when I have done nothing for you.

434
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,909
That scared me the most.

435
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,619
That's why I'm going to keep trying.

436
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,819
I will do everything I can...

437
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,389
before you leave.

438
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,889
For the sake of me who will be left alone,

439
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:05,299
I will go all in and leave no regrets.

440
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:10,500
Yes. You might be right.

441
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,440
I might need some time,

442
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:18,179
so I am going to try and trust you.

443
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,480
What about this, then?

444
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,420
What is this?

445
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:38,330
It is the person...

446
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,469
who might have ordered him to kill me.

447
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,199
What?

448
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,210
I don't think Jun O knows.

449
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,009
That this guy is Mr. Seok?

450
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,319
So, have you looked into...

451
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,589
Mr. Seok whereabouts?

452
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,888
Well. So far, I have checked...

453
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,959
he went from a homeless shelter to another.

454
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,989
But...

455
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:11,759
I'm sorry.

456
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:23,509
Because he shows up to the shelters irregularly,

457
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,649
it's not easy to locate where he is.

458
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,679
Hire more people.

459
00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:30,020
What if he's not Mr. Seok?

460
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:31,549
Once we get him, I'll ask him...

461
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:33,819
if everything was a coincidence...

462
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:37,389
or if he really did try to kill Jun O.

463
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:48,630
Hello?

464
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,439
This is Lawyer Ko Gyeong Se.

465
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,469
Who am I speaking to?

466
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,940
Why is it so hard for Gyeong Se to pick up his phone?

467
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,369
It upsets me.

468
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:00,610
Mr. Seok?

469
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,009
I want to see you.

470
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,549
We need to talk.

471
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:12,060
(Wanted, 10,000 dollars, Attempted Murder Suspect)

472
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,360
(Ticket number)

473
00:38:15,529 --> 00:38:17,060
(Mail)

474
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,670
(Mail)

475
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,310
Gosh!

476
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,940
Goodness. It was nerve-racking!

477
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,649
Why didn't you send it on my behalf...

478
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,379
since you're helping me anyway?

479
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,718
You have to be on the camera...

480
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:40,388
to prove that you actually sent it, right?

481
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:41,449
I see.

482
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:46,360
Then, I just have to disappear...

483
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,059
through a place where there's no camera.

484
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,560
We can go through the road that I already checked.

485
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,060
I thought...

486
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,739
you were a man only interested in...

487
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,600
money, women, and gambling.

488
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,009
It's just that there's something more intriguing.

489
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,279
- What is it? - You'll know what it is tonight.

490
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:09,579
Gosh, what is it?

491
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,618
(Post Office)

492
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:14,190
Tell me now, will you?

493
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,790
Gosh, a headache.

494
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,759
Why?

495
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,429
What did the team leader say?

496
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,229
He wants me out of the abduction case.

497
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,330
He wants me to get Gu Tae Ju.

498
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,069
I knew this was coming,

499
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,099
so I found something.

500
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,100
What?

501
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,980
What do you say? It's plain to see, right?

502
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,239
The jawlines. They are exactly the same.

503
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:48,449
Right.

504
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:52,790
It's a symptom of trauma, a kind of occupational disease.

505
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:54,588
I got confused with my dream...

506
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:56,659
and mistook Jun O as the master.

507
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:59,429
I'm sure Jun O didn't have a clue about what I was saying.

508
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,670
He probably thought it was the alcohol talking, not me.

509
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,940
We are on a small hill.

510
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:16,509
And you are a tree.

511
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,049
- For a long time, - Let go...

512
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,219
of my hand.

513
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,290
you've been standing here.

514
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,159
Feel the deep and sturdy...

515
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,659
root of yours.

516
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:32,960
You have to let go of me.

517
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,528
Even in the storm...

518
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:35,600
Gosh, come on!

519
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,000
My gosh!

520
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:40,040
But you are not shaken.

521
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,339
Is this a dream or a miracle?

522
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:44,980
How?

523
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:46,710
How did Young Hwa end up...

524
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,408
with Han Jun O?

525
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:49,409
(Jun O Love: No way!)

526
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,350
(Jun O Jun O: Did you see the photos of Jun O and Jung Yi Seul?)

527
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,249
(Group Chat: Han Jun O's Fans)

528
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,250
(His features are clearer than my future.)

529
00:40:56,251 --> 00:40:57,258
(- His nose slayed me. - Is it real this time?)

530
00:40:57,259 --> 00:40:58,259
(What's the agency doing? Why do they let this happen?)

531
00:40:58,259 --> 00:40:59,259
(Jung Yi Seul doesn't know when to stop.)

532
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:01,929
What are they talking about?

533
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:04,359
(My second time with Jun O! Thank you for looking out for me.)

534
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
(Did our relationship also begin in our previous lives?)

535
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:15,639
Na Yeon, I need to go out.

536
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,980
Wait, by any chance,

537
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,080
are you going out to see Han Jun O?

538
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,519
Well, I have something to patch up.

539
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Are you...

540
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,819
going to see him dressed like this?

541
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:31,619
What about it?

542
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:34,189
- Can you look this way? - Good.

543
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,360
- Over here. - Can you look this way?

544
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:37,860
Thank you.

545
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,399
- Thank you. - Look this way.

546
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,429
- Yes, thank you. - Thank you.

547
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:43,639
Over here too.

548
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,299
Can the models move inside?

549
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,110
Hey, you have a good body proportion,

550
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:50,380
so you look nice.

551
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:53,779
Anyway, why am I here in this dress?

552
00:41:57,279 --> 00:41:58,580
Don't be alarmed.

553
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,589
It's Han Jun O!

554
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,460
Han Jun O!

555
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,000
Jun O, please look over here.

556
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,869
- Jun O! - Mr. Han!

557
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,179
Jung Yi Seul just claimed she was dating Han Jun O.

558
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:36,250
- They're dating? - Yes.

559
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:38,690
Go tell him...

560
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,488
to pick only one side.

561
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:41,790
Pick what side?

562
00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:43,500
Go.

563
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:55,869
Ms. Jung.

564
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,940
You uploaded a rather meaningful post today.

565
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,210
Are you two really dating?

566
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,719
I never said we were dating.

567
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,819
Is this true, Mr. Han?

568
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:07,549
Are you two dating?

569
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Mr. Han?

570
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,330
Yes.

571
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,159
We're dating.

572
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,599
Since when?

573
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,068
Did you two meet on the film set?

574
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:21,929
Please ask questions one at a time.

575
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:24,540
Gosh. Why did you bring me here?

576
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:27,069
Darn it.

577
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:30,639
(Han Jun O, Jung Yi Seul, the Couple of the Century)

578
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,838
(- My love, Jun O, you're gone now. - Goodbye, Jun O.)

579
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,210
(Congratulations! I hope you two will always be happy!)

580
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,610
It's all thanks to you, the symbol of scandals.

581
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,279
People are responding quickly. Do you want to see it?

582
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:43,560
You're leaving already?

583
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:46,460
I was scheduled until five o'clock.

584
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:50,130
Isn't the show over?

585
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,900
What?

586
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,830
I thought you weren't mad anymore.

587
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:56,069
You should be mad, not me.

588
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,509
Why should I be mad?

589
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:03,810
Both you and I got what we wanted.

590
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,679
I was freed from rumours related to Gu Tae Ju,

591
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,580
and you got me, whom you wanted so dearly.

592
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,719
I apologize for causing any misunderstandings.

593
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,230
Exactly. What are you talking about?

594
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,790
Stop right there!

595
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:29,500
You weren't in the car. I looked everywhere for you.

596
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:31,569
Where's Mr. Jang?

597
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:34,409
I asked him to give us a moment. I had to talk to you.

598
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,080
Every time I see you... You are dressed very prettily...

599
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:40,850
for a bodyguard.

600
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,710
Don't listen to her.

601
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:44,150
I told you, didn't I?

602
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,380
I don't keep female bodyguards.

603
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,150
That's not for you to decide.

604
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,190
I never put on clothes whenever I'm at Jun O's place.

605
00:44:57,299 --> 00:44:58,860
Is that all right with you?

606
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:02,069
You have no idea what we'll be up to.

607
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:08,610
- We should go. - I was about to.

608
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,679
His schedule is over, so he has to go.

609
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:14,948
(Na Yeon)

610
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:17,250
Yes. So you should go home.

611
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:19,020
I'll be there soon.

612
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:21,750
Bye.

613
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,489
Where are we going?

614
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,690
To get my stuff.

615
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,069
Why are you doing this?

616
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:42,669
I was worried about you,

617
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,509
but I thought it was right for me to leave at this moment.

618
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:55,049
I don't want to cause any misunderstanding,

619
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,420
so let's straighten what happened yesterday.

620
00:45:57,819 --> 00:45:58,860
What misunderstanding?

621
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:03,190
I've been having problems lately.

622
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,270
Like I said, I dreamed of someone who looked like you.

623
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:12,170
On the day you collapsed,

624
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,139
that man appeared before my eyes.

625
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:17,279
That was why I took a sick leave and went to see a doctor.

626
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,779
Did it work?

627
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,549
Of course. I'm taking medicine and receiving treatments.

628
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,589
But I'm not completely well yet.

629
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,830
I must have mistaken you for him when I got drunk yesterday.

630
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,600
But that won't happen again.

631
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,069
Anyway.

632
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,270
I'm sorry for yesterday.

633
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:47,210
I told you everything yesterday.

634
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,310
You're the one who doesn't remember a thing.

635
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:55,080
I probably forgot it because it was forgettable.

636
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:59,350
You can stop minding me and get some rest.

637
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,089
What if you collapse again?

638
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,319
Bye now.

639
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:23,710
What did I forget?

640
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:29,080
Why did you pack up?

641
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,350
There's a new turn with Ms. Jung and all,

642
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:37,790
so I don't think I can escort him around the clock.

643
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,859
I already talked to Jun O and decided to go back...

644
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,429
to the original schedule.

645
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,929
Is there something between you two...

646
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,000
that I am not aware of?

647
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,069
I also felt...

648
00:47:50,299 --> 00:47:51,940
that Jun O had been...

649
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:54,110
overly fixated on you...

650
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,409
lately.

651
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,380
Something happened...

652
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:00,949
on that day too, right?

653
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:05,819
Jun O said you saw his true identity.

654
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,790
What did he mean by that?

655
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:10,520
"His true identity?"

656
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,360
Begone, evil spirit!

657
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,460
Why do you look so unwell?

658
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:22,969
That monk.

659
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,509
Every visitor at Beginning must fill out a guest book, right?

660
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,739
Yes, that's the case.

661
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,949
Why do you suddenly ask about the guest book?

662
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,679
(Visitors)

663
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,218
People from this page to this page...

664
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:40,750
were the visitors who came that day.

665
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,159
There are so many of them. How am I going to find him?

666
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:48,659
Do you not know who you are looking for?

667
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:51,330
Well, it's...

668
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,699
He was this monk.

669
00:48:55,029 --> 00:48:58,270
A monk? It was probably him.

670
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,310
He came by looking for you.

671
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:04,310
- He did? - Yes.

672
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:18,219
Hello, my name is Kang Young Hwa.

673
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,790
You have reached Oksaam Temple.

674
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,460
We are not available right now. Please call us back.

675
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,730
Thank you.

676
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,969
"Oksaam Temple?"

677
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:34,209
(Search for: Oksaam Temple)

678
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,468
(Oksaam Temple)

679
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:38,739
(Oksaam Temple, 861 Mount Gieun, Gieun-Gu, Seoul)

680
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:42,210
This is where Dad rests.

681
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,560
Why did Mr. Seok call me out to a place like this?

682
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,630
Hello?

683
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,569
Yes, what did Mr. Han say?

684
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,639
What? He confirmed the love scandal?

685
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,980
But we spent a fortune trying to cover it up!

686
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,909
Do not take any measures starting now.

687
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:19,520
I'll go back and handle the rest.

688
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,350
I'll call Mr. Han myself.

689
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:23,119
Darn it.

690
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,360
Come on.

691
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,560
My gosh!

692
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:42,810
Darn it.

693
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,080
Hey.

694
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,350
Goodness.

695
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:58,619
Mr. Seok.

696
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,239
How may I help you?

697
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:25,080
Recently, Han Jun O's...

698
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:29,190
I mean, you were the monk in the elevator, right?

699
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,060
Yes, Ms. Kang Young Hwa.

700
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:33,020
We once met on the subway too.

701
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,060
How did you know my name?

702
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:40,060
Well, we've also met a long time ago.

703
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:43,569
By any chance,

704
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,670
were you that little monk who was this tall?

705
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:47,869
This little.

706
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,779
It was as expected.

707
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,150
Your amulet is gone.

708
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,049
The lotus seed?

709
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,718
I did not know...

710
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:07,929
how that precious amulet ended up in my hands,

711
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,060
but items that contain strong wishes...

712
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,230
always end up finding their rightful owners.

713
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,170
Are you saying...

714
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,639
my bracelet had been protecting me?

715
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,948
Most of the time, it protects its owner...

716
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:29,449
from evil energy or spirits.

717
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,690
It can also cover the eyes and ears to see such things.

718
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,790
What about that talisman?

719
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,529
What about that?

720
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,429
You came a long way,

721
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:49,500
but that was all I could tell you at this moment.

722
00:52:50,029 --> 00:52:51,069
Sorry?

723
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,469
Hae In. Our guest is leaving.

724
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,040
Goodness. One second, sir.

725
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:06,150
Since you are still in this world,

726
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,319
I guess there are unresolved feelings left behind.

727
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,560
Please take refuge in the great compassion of Bodhisattva.

728
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,100
Sir, wait.

729
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,069
Now I remember.

730
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,618
That heartbeat.

731
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,989
That isn't my heart.

732
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,659
Then whose heart is it?

733
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:49,360
I'm not alive.

734
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:52,259
I am simply borrowing...

735
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,000
Han Jun O's body.

736
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,940
We need to meet.

737
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,360
Where are you going at this hour?

738
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,798
To see Kang Young Hwa.

739
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:29,299
Things haven't settled down after your love scandal.

740
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:31,169
Do you have to go now?

741
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,400
I have to go now to make her return.

742
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:35,810
All right.

743
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,679
- I'll give you a ride. - I'll manage.

744
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,239
I love you,

745
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,940
Master.

746
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:19,520
Would you be able to tell me...

747
00:55:21,549 --> 00:55:22,949
why you did that back then?

748
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:25,319
Why you had to do that?

749
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:33,330
I'm sorry for calling you out this far.

750
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,029
I thought you called because you remembered everything.

751
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:38,069
That was what I wanted to ask.

752
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:42,169
What did you mean when you said you were borrowing...

753
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,369
Han Jun O's body?

754
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,009
I kept thinking about it, yet still couldn't understand.

755
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,610
And?

756
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,448
You said you weren't alive.

757
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:52,580
You remembered correctly.

758
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:55,389
What do you not understand?

759
00:55:56,989 --> 00:56:00,420
I have no idea which one of these I am supposed to understand.

760
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,730
I was quite troubled too.

761
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:17,210
I am postponing taking your life only for a little.

762
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,110
Because you...

763
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,250
may be the one...

764
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,679
who could give me the answer...

765
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:27,790
to my long-awaited question.

766
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,969
Wait.

767
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:44,069
Did you do this?

768
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:45,369
I told you.

769
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:48,069
I am not human.

770
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,369
Then, what are you?

771
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:52,279
Your poltergeist.

772
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:54,179
What?

773
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,750
I have been stuck in this world for the last 1,500 years.

774
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:00,420
That is why I want your help.

775
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:03,290
What are you...

776
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:05,290
What do you need help with?

777
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,460
I want to know how I died.

778
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,499
I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you're talking about.

779
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,130
You're the only one who can do this, Young Hwa.

780
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:15,869
You were...

781
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,369
my wife.

782
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,159
It's a rosary made with lotus seeds.

783
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,429
It will protect you from all evil things...

784
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,239
of this world.

785
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:07,040
As of now...

786
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:10,880
and forever,

787
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:18,060
you are...

788
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,529
my...

789
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,560
only wife,

790
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:33,839
even if death do us part.

791
01:00:18,279 --> 01:00:20,980
(Moon in the Day)

792
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,048
He looks like your brother on the outside,

793
01:00:24,049 --> 01:00:26,759
but he seems very unfamiliar, does he not?

794
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,659
Make your choice.

795
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:32,460
Either kill this woman...

796
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,830
or take her as your wife.

797
01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:36,529
Must I stay alive...

798
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,040
if you order me to live, Master?

799
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,580
Why did you not just kill me?
