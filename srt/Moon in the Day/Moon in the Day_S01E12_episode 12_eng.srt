1
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,670

2
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,980

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,440

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,540

5
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:38,950

6
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,280

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,190

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,810
I had killed you...

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,800
with my own hands.

10
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,460
You wanted to know the reason you had died so badly.

11
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,530
And it was me.

12
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,940
Did you already know?

13
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,350
That the one who killed you...

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,280
and the one who gave you immeasurable pain was me?

15
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,980
I still wanted to know...

16
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,560
why you did that.

17
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,380
I loved you sincerely.

18
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,080
Why?

19
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,380
Why did you kill me?

20
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,590
Why did you?

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,330
Because we were not supposed to be together from the beginning.

22
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,530
I thought as long as I killed your father,

23
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,530
our hellish lives would improve.

24
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,970
But I was foolishly mistaken.

25
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,790
From the beginning,

26
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,030
from the moment we were together,

27
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,870
we were destined not to be free from hell.

28
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,250
That's why I did it.

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,270
So I could...

30
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,300
end our hell with my own hands.

31
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,660
Even if it was hell,

32
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,320
all I needed was you.

33
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,800
That is why I asked you to accompany me to the rock bottom.

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,790
Letting someone you love live in hell

35
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,380
can't be love.

36
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,990
Just look at us now, too.

37
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,680
Because I loved you,

38
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,240
for 1,500 years, you've been

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,690
living in so much pain.

40
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,400
Do not say such a thing.

41
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,490
Maybe our curse...

42
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,030
was caused by my heart.

43
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,580
My heart that started...

44
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,200
the forbidden love.

45
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,160
Without even knowing that,

46
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,350
I came to like you again in this life.

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,730
Since I learned all the truths,

48
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,490
I can no longer play ignorant and stay by your side.

49
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,140
 You and I were...

50
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,880
 in a forbidden love from the beginning?

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,740
Don't go.

52
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,370
You must know if you witnessed your entire previous life.

53
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,650
As I fell in love with you,

54
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,910
I started having the will to live for the first time.

55
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,000
So how...

56
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,730
how could those feelings be wrong?

57
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,000
I was practically dead already,

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,020
but you made me live.

59
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,940
So don't go.

60
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,690
Stay by my side.

61
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,140
You said you want to resolve your sorrow and leave this world.

62
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,180
Didn't you stay in this world for 1,500 years as a lost soul with me

63
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,060
because you resented that I betrayed you and killed you?

64
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,950
I once thought everything would be over if I killed you and resolved my sorrow.

65
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,620
But that old man was right.

66
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,800
 Deep resentments...

67
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,740
 don't get resolved by just revenge.

68
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,550
 Sometimes, you have to look into it closely.

69
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,950
Maybe...

70
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,630
I wanted to confirm your feelings.

71
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,150
I wanted to know if you truly loved me...

72
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,520
in the moments we spent together...

73
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,980
and what made you kill me.

74
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,150
But it's all okay now.

75
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,260
If your feelings toward me were sincere,

76
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,440
it won't matter, even if it were forbidden love or if we had to live in hell again.

77
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,960
My heart for you...

78
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,970
will never change.

79
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,700
Hey, Kang Yeong Hwa!

80
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,610
Stop the car for a moment. I'll get off.

81
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,970
Na Yeon, do you really have to do this?

82
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,270
You'd better wait here quietly. Okay?

83
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,490
Well, wait...

84
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,310
Let me see. Are you really okay?

85
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,590
Why did you come here first thing in the morning?

86
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,540
What do you mean, why?

87
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,650
I ran over as early as possible to check if you were okay.

88
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,700
- Of course, I am. 
 - Don't be so lax about it.

89
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,800
What if you die by getting your energy sucked out by a pretty-faced bachelor ghost—

90
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,200
No?

91
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,420
 Seok Cheol Hwan.

92
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,760
 What's he doing here?

93
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,190
What's wrong all of a sudden?

94
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,130
Are you okay?

95
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,100
Stay right here.

96
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,860
What's wrong? What happened all of a sudden?

97
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,230
Go inside the house right now.

98
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,700
 It's an ominous feeling I'm familiar with.

99
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,810
It's nice to see you like this, Son.

100
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,580
It's too bad our reunion has to be brief,

101
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,620
but I'm not the main event today.

102
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,430
Just stay there, Yoon Je.

103
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,110
Okay.

104
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,780
Yeong Hwa, let's go inside Han Joon Oh's house instead of being out here.

105
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,950
He told you to wait inside.

106
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,940
I kind of have a bad feeling about this.

107
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,620
I've never seen his face like that before.

108
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,400
But he's a ghost. What could possibly happen? Let's just go inside.

109
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,810
Let's wait just a little longer and go inside.

110
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,560
Isn't that Jeong Yi Seul?

111
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,630
What's wrong with her? She looks strange.

112
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,930
Ms. Jeong Yi Seul.

113
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
Are you okay?

114
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,560
Yi Seul.

115
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,720
Kang Yeong Hwa.

116
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,470
Die.

117
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,950
No, Yeong Hwa!

118
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:40,200

119
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,940
She has abdominal bleeding and her vitals are dropping.

120
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,480
Let's take her to the OR. Prepare for emergency surgery immediately.

121
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,180
Okay, got it.

122
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,650
The guardians can wait here.

123
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,770
What do I do?

124
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,030
What do I do? Sis...

125
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,430
Sis...

126
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,360
Sis.

127
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,230
Sis.

128
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,930
Sis.

129
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,750
What am I going to do?

130
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,840
Because of me...

131
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,800
Because of me, Sis... What do I do?

132
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,950

133
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,110
What's this now?

134
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,030
Jeong Yi Seul was arrested for attempted murder?

135
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,760
Why won't Han Joon Oh answer my calls after torturing me?

136
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,050
Seok Cheol Hwan.

137
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,770
Why are you so surprised?

138
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,800
Didn't you hire someone to look for me?

139
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,150
Han Joon Oh told me to do everything.

140
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,220
So...

141
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,050
So please spare me.

142
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,670
I will never tell anyone about you.

143
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,510
Come on, man.

144
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,690
Why do you think I'd kill you?

145
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,720
You're such a useful person.

146
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,960
Pardon?

147
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,380
Just keep a low profile like a scared mouse like right now.

148
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,250
Nothing will happen to you, then.

149
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,720
T-Thank you.

150
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,290
But...

151
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,370
you'll have to make sure to tell Han Joon Oh.

152
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,260
Say he doesn't have to look for me because

153
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,210
his father will come to see him himself.

154
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,910
Shit. Seriously...

155
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,400
Does it mean I have to step into this life?

156
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,860
The doctor said they needed to keep an eye on her for a few days.

157
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,370
What will you do there exactly?

158
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,290
I can't leave her alone like this.

159
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,860
I need to be by her side.

160
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,530
You've been at the hospital. What if you pass out now?

161
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:53,390
Mr. Jang will be there tonight. You should rest for now.

162
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,940
All of this happened because of me. How am I supposed to rest?

163
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,160
I was cursed to die before I turned 30.

164
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,710
Sis got hurt because of that.

165
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,220
I should've died.

166
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,310
What if something happens to her because of me?

167
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,820
- Why would that be your fault? 
 - It is.

168
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,270
It's my fault if this curse came about from killing you in my previous life.

169
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,730
Who else is there to blame?

170
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,880
CEO Han and Na Yeon...

171
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,940
both ended up that way because of me.

172
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,920
It's all my fault! My fault!

173
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,880
 Seok Cheol Hwan is definitely behind this.

174
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,720
 But I need to confirm.

175
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,410
 I felt something when I saw him.

176
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,770
 What's his true identity?

177
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,660
No, it's not that. How many times did I tell you?

178
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,570
Han Min Oh's slush fund is in a US bank account.

179
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,980
And I'm definitely the proxy.

180
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,630
So approve it first!

181
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,510
Shit.

182
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,830
Oh, J-Joon Oh.

183
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,850
My lawyer requested to see me?

184
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,700
Han Joon Oh?

185
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,830
I'm sorry, Joon Oh.

186
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,530
I'm too embarrassed to see you.

187
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,370
Don't apologize to me.

188
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,580
You should apologize to Choi Na Yeon, who might die because of you.

189
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,870
And the world will make the judgment

190
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,500
for your sin, not me.

191
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,520
I came all the way here...

192
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,950
because I wanted to check something with you.

193
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,270
Check what?

194
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,730
Well, the thing is, Joon Oh wants you to tell him something

195
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,590
you didn't tell the police.

196
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,400
Have you...

197
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,640
met Seok Cheol Hwan recently?

198
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,840
The former CEO of Beginning Entertainment?

199
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,760
You have. Right?

200
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,030
What does that have to do with what happened?

201
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:16,060
You need to tell us honestly if you're being threatened by him.

202
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,950
You said you intended to kill and

203
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,990
the victim is unconscious right now.

204
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:27,630
This might turn into a felonious assault if things go wrong.

205
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,290
Hold on.

206
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:34,720
What do you mean by instigation and threatening?

207
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,480
What does Mr. Seok have to do with it?

208
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,110
Seok Cheol Hwan didn't instigate the murder?

209
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,240
How does that make sense?

210
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,430
That I tried to kill someone because someone told me to?

211
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,690
Well, Joon Oh. I know Seok Cheol Hwan is a monster, but

212
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,910
saying he tried to kill Kang Yeong Hwa using Jeong Yi Seul, with whom she has no connection

213
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,220
sounds too farfetched.

214
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,290
Joon Oh, my job is over now. Right?

215
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,410
Jeong Yi Seul will be safer in there.

216
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,080
You'd better be careful for now, too.

217
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,610
Hold on. Hold on.

218
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,310
Well, you just confirmed.

219
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,320
Seok Cheol Hwan didn't tell Jeong Yi Seul to kill Kang Yeong Hwa.

220
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,160
If you don't want to end up like Han Min Oh,

221
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,020
you'd better tell me as soon as you locate Seok Cheol Hwan.

222
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,320
Well, hold on.

223
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,930
He said you don't have to look for him.

224
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,600
He said you don't have to look for him since the father will come to see the son.

225
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,770
What did you say?

226
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,250
I thought he was just saying nonsense at first,

227
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,320
but I'm curious now.

228
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,640
Seok Cheol Hwan can't be your father.

229
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,840
Do you two have a history I'm not aware of?

230
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,530

231
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,410
 Dad, are you watching?

232
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,350
 Na Yeon got injured a lot because of me.

233
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,980
 You know, too.

234
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,120
 That she's been my only family.

235
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:51,430
 So I want you to protect her for me.

236
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,340
 The miracle I had and my guardian angel...

237
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,590
The guardian angel bracelet.

238
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,570

239
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,010
Yes.

240
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,490
There was another one.

241
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,520
 Ta-da. You and I have matching bracelets.

242
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,890
 You can't take it off even when you grow up and get a boyfriend.

243
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,380
 It won't fit if I grow up, anyway.

244
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,570
 You can switch to a longer string, then.

245
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:13,570
 But make sure to keep this smile bead.

246
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,790
Thank you, Dad.

247
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,320
Who died?

248
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,390
 Goodness, what's going on? My goodness...

249
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,060
Salut.

250
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,660
He passed away at the scene because of an accident. Right?

251
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,320
Yes.

252
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,360
It was a fire at a residential building in Seowoon-dong.

253
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,290
He rescued the person in there,

254
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,640
but he couldn't make it out.

255
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,700
My heart still sinks whenever something like this happens.

256
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,410
How could you get used to it?

257
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,020
It will get even worse.

258
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,960
I'm like that, too, even after having done this job for 20 years.

259
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,750
Kang Yeong Hwa.

260
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,690
Yes.

261
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,280
You should start preparing to come back.

262
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,940
Of course. I need to come back.

263
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,500
Hey, can't you come back sooner?

264
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,440
Do you know how many times Seung Woo says he misses you per day?

265
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,140
Are you sure you missed me?

266
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,220
Oh, right. It's probably because it's his first time attending

267
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,700
a colleague's funeral since he became a firefighter.

268
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,750
Cheer up.

269
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,470
I'll go smoke a cigarette.

270
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,540
- I'll come with you, sir. 
 - Okay.

271
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,970
Are you having a hard time?

272
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,600
If I get into the same situation Team Leader Seong was in,

273
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,410
would I be able to make the same decision he made?

274
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,270
I thought I became a firefighter willing to sacrifice myself,

275
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,990
but maybe I lost confidence after seeing it in person.

276
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,420
What if my hesitation...

277
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,490
ends up costing someone's life?

278
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,940
I'm so afraid of that.

279
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,530
 How come I didn't think of that?

280
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,600
 I was just trying to save my brother.

281
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,380
 Because if she dies,

282
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,500
 I will get you back.

283
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,490
 He knew about Kang Yeong Hwa's previous life,

284
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,120
 but he tricked Han Min Oh with a lie.

285
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,170
 Seok Cheol Hwan is not even a human.

286
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,750
 He's a monster. A monster.

287
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,450
 He used Goo Tae Joo and Han Min Oh.

288
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,220
 He's cold-hearted enough to kill them mercilessly.

289
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,640
 Someone who's likely to be roaming

290
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,490
 in this world for 1,500 years holding resentment.

291
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,350
 My father,

292
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,990
 So Ri Bu.

293
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,200
Your face tells me you finally recognize me.

294
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,360
I would've been disappointed if you didn't.

295
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,520
Because it was you who put a sword in my heart.

296
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,400
You were not...

297
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,310
Seok Cheol Hwan.

298
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,270
You're Lord Do Ha's father, aren't you?

299
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,730
Impressive.

300
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,960
You don't just look the same as Han Ri Ta.

301
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,600
You even have her memories, too.

302
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,240
It was worth chasing you around for 1,500 years.

303
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,610
What did you say?

304
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,960
Has Do Ha not told you yet?

305
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,280
I'm the one who killed all of your reincarnations 18 times.

306
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,700
Because today,

307
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,830
I'll be doing it for the 19th time.

308
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,340
What happened?

309
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,290
How come?

310
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,450
It's because of this.

311
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,190
I definitely got rid of the talisman through Goo Tae Joo.

312
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,010
Was it you who made Goo Tae Joo do that?

313
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,780
Same with CEO Han and Yi Seul, then?

314
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,510
I've told you in the past.

315
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,370
 I will be born again...

316
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,500
 a thousand or ten thousand times...

317
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,720
 and I will...

318
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,890
 find you...

319
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,970
 over...

320
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,840
 and...

321
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,320
 over again.

322
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,200
I said I'll destroy your life every time.

323
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,400
It won't go the way you want this time around.

324
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,790
People around you will keep dying as they always have.

325
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,160
Would you say you're okay with that, too?

326
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,690
Didn't you know your parents died due to a disaster your karma brought?

327
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,900
What?

328
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,890
What a foolish girl.

329
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,460
Remember I said the moment

330
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,130
you fell for Do Ha, you and his tragic fate would keep repeating itself.

331
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,990
No...

332
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,530
That's not possible.

333
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,880
Even if the tragic fate repeats, it's my fate.

334
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,260
The rest of them are innocent!

335
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,830
You must know if you remember your previous life.

336
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:06,200
Countless innocent people who died because of you and Do Ha.

337
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,370
So there's no use trying to stop me.

338
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,350
As long as you stay alive,

339
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,590
the tragedy will repeat itself somehow.

340
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,650
Where's Kang Yeong Hwa?

341
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,350
I sent her home for a little awhile.

342
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,970
She looked very stressed out.

343
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,780
Oh, and...

344
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,250
Someone left this here.

345
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:52,160
Do you know who Kim Do Ha is, by chance?

346
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,480
He told me to give it to Kim Do Ha. But I don't know who that is.

347
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,580
What's this tree for?

348
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,340
Taxus.

349
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,590
 Lord So Ri Bu gave it to you as a reward for the victory.

350
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,090
 They look like berries.

351
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,230
 They are taxus berries.

352
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,980
 The flesh is as sweet as ripe persimmon, but the seed is poisonous.

353
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,930
 You put the poison on the arrowhead before you fight in a war.

354
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:35,330
 He gave it to you so you win the next war as well.

355
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:40,910
 People take these berries to commit suicide as well.

356
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,470
 Father sent this.

357
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,180
Why...

358
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,370

359
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,910
Kang Yeong Hwa, where were you?

360
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,540
It was So Ri Bu.

361
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,660
Seok Cheol Hwan. That man.

362
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,650
Did you see him again?

363
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,550
A-Are you okay? Are you hurt at all?

364
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,600
I asked if you were okay.

365
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,280
The lotus seed talisman you gave me

366
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,120
saved my life once again.

367
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,040
Why do you look so upset, then?

368
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,600
The talisman protected you.

369
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,010
What am I supposed to do now?

370
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,680
What?

371
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,230
Me...

372
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,980
You...

373
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,710
Us...

374
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,790
What are we supposed to do now?

375
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,430
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

376
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,330
Did Father say something to you?

377
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:14,790
Na Yeon will be in danger if I stay here.

378
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,590
I need to go.

379
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,770
Let's go home for now.

380
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,320
You should eat something.

381
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,570
You probably haven't eaten properly since you've been at the hospital.

382
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,870
Stay here. I'll go get you something.

383
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,270
Could you just stay here for now?

384
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,780
Then tell me...

385
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,050
what you talked about with Father now.

386
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,900
What are you worried about, and what are you afraid of?

387
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,890
You don't need to tell others, but you need to tell me.

388
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,140
Are you afraid of the curse?

389
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,600
You found out that you've been dying for 1,500 years

390
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,920
not by coincidence but because my father intended it.

391
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,400
What more are you afraid of?

392
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,680
I just need to protect you from him now.

393
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,530
What if someone else dies or gets hurt in the meantime?

394
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,840
What?

395
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,220
That's what I'm afraid of.

396
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,350
More innocent people dying...

397
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,670
 or getting hurt because I'm with you.

398
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,040
I told you...

399
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,350
what my intention was when I killed you.

400
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,880
I made the right decision in my previous life.

401
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,180
We were never supposed to be together.

402
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,250
That's not true.

403
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,650
That's not true. Okay?

404
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,880
That's not true.

405
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,440
We finally got reunited.

406
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,010
We need to accept it now.

407
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,660
That the only thing that's left for us is a tragic ending.

408
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,170
If our ending...

409
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,380
was only supposed to be tragic,

410
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,990
I wouldn't have waited for you, feeling the same way for 1,500 years.

411
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,770
If you had killed me, to begin with,

412
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,020
CEO Han and Na Yeon would've been safe.

413
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,040
Kang Yeong Hwa,

414
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,860
why would you think that? Huh?

415
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,560
I guess I'm tired now.

416
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,310
I'm tired of this curse...

417
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,420
and fate, too.

418
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,070
I understand why...

419
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,440
you're suffering right now.

420
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,620
I know...

421
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,610
you care more about the pain and suffering

422
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,600
of people around you more than your own.

423
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,870
But you should...

424
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,910
give me a chance, at least.

425
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,060
You don't know how I've been...

426
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,450
taking so many...

427
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,230
detours until I realized this.

428
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,940
I'm not...

429
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,510
going to lose you again.

430
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,520
This time...

431
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,470
I will protect you, no matter what.

432
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,600
Along with people around you.

433
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
Please...

434
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,600
Please wait just a little longer.

435
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,540
 This is probably relatively nutritious

436
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,150
 even though I bought it from a restaurant.

437
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,410
 I'll be back soon.

438
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,970
 Na Yeon is awake.

439
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,970
Sis.

440
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,320
Sis...

441
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,290
Sis.

442
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,720
Gosh, it hurts. Hug me gently.

443
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm still a patient.

444
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,550
I'm so relieved.

445
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,700
I'm so relieved.

446
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,070
They need to do more detailed exams,

447
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,340
but they only detected fractures so far.

448
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,670
The surgery went very well.

449
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,890
I'm sorry, Sis.

450
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,850
I'm sorry.

451
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,420
What are you sorry about?

452
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,880
You got hurt instead of me.

453
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,700
Hey, just be glad it was me.

454
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,910
If you got hurt, you would've been bedridden for another year.

455
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,370
What are you saying?

456
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,620
So don't feel sorry for me and be thankful.

457
00:38:54,620 --> 00:39:00,120
Clean the bathroom for the rest of your life since you're thankful.

458
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,460
The rest of my life is a bit much.

459
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,830
Did you know you really act like biological sisters?

460
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:14,170
Shouldn't you get a DNA test or something?

461
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,990
Biological sisters, my foot. We don't resemble each other.

462
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,220
- I'm a bit prettier. 
 - Yes. Of course.

463
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,780
 People around you will keep dying as they always have.

464
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,660
 Would you say you're okay with that, too?

465
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,770
 There's no use trying to stop me.

466
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,660
 As long as you stay alive,

467
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,630
 the tragedy will repeat itself somehow.

468
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,860
 I'm sorry, My Lord.

469
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,050
 If someone dies or gets hurt again,

470
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,780
 I won't be able to live with the guilt.

471
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,060

472
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,600

473
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,860

474
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,790
Be courteous now that you are here.

475
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,510
It was indeed you, Father.

476
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,840
I finally get to see your face, Son.

477
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,850
What is wrong with your attitude of greeting your father after a long time?

478
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,700
I learned about everything you have been doing.

479
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,080
How dare you...

480
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,110
tell me to be courteous?

481
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,900
Your face tells me...

482
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,600
that the girl still has a shackle on you as she did 1,500 years ago.

483
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,820
Let us see.

484
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,030
In what way should I kill her this time around?

485
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,730
Tell me what you think.

486
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,050
I will ask you just one thing.

487
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,600
Why are you taking things so far with me?

488
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:23,020
I already lived a hellish life because of you.

489
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,290
I am...

490
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,880
still your son.

491
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,720
So, why!

492
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,720
 Do Ha asked for all of this.

493
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:47,480
 You have aged now. You can finally rest.

494
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,610
 You could even pass down your position to him now.

495
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:56,410
 Do Ha started disobeying me.

496
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,860
 Is it because of me?

497
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,580
 Or is it because of you?

498
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,550
 A dog I have been caring for is trying to challenge a human.

499
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,150
 I should tighten the collar more...

500
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:14,250
 and put him back in his place.

501
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,030
I am not sure.

502
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,630
It has been so long for me as well.

503
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,740
Your answer is just as I expected from you.

504
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,140
You made a mistake by revealing yourself.

505
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,020
Because you will...

506
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:40,230
no longer be able to hurt Kang Yeong Hwa.

507
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,700
Do you know why you have not noticed me at all?

508
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,800
Humans need only a tiny bit of evil intentions to commit murders.

509
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,690
I can always use humans' evil intentions to

510
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,510
kill that girl anytime without stepping in.

511
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:05,340
In her next life and the one after as well.

512
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,730
Even if I do not get involved,

513
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:16,100
there are plenty of people with evil intentions to kill her for me.

514
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,620
What would be the point of...

515
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,160
stopping just me?

516
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,020
- You! 
 - Look at yourself now.

517
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,140
Did you forget that I am a ghost, just like you?

518
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,650
I don't care.

519
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,780
Even if your soul moves on to another body,

520
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,600
I will make sure to find you and rip you to shreds.

521
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,770
Then, how will you stop the girl who decided to kill herself?

522
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:48,650
You do not even know...

523
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,830
how your woman feels, my foolish son.

524
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:04,490
I put Han Ri Ta on the edge of the cliff

525
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,450
very slowly and surely...

526
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,200
so she has no choice but to choose death.

527
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,810
You will have to hurry up.

528
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:17,410
I am not the only one who is running out of time.

529
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:38,240
Gosh! I haven't left the hospital in forever.

530
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,690
Gosh. I feel alive.

531
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,020
Yes.

532
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,730
This is what I've wanted.

533
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,300
What's with the greasy grin?

534
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,340
You told me last time...

535
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,570
not to be sorry and be thankful.

536
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:04,500
Yes, I guess I said that.

537
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,760
I'll be thankful to you for the rest of my life.

538
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,410
So you shouldn't feel guilty toward me, no matter what.

539
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:16,180
W-What if I wash your clothes the wrong way and ruin them?

540
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,090
Should I not say "sorry" and just say "thank you"?

541
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,280
Yes.

542
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,620
We'll no longer say "sorry" to each other.

543
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,880
We'll only say "thank you." Just feel thankful.

544
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,530
What? That's kind of weird.

545
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,740
I made you a special lunch you'd like.

546
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,790
You'll automatically say "thank you" once you see it.

547
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,670
Okay.

548
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,180
Be surprised already.

549
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,630
Hey.

550
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,910
Kang Yeong Hwa.

551
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,630
It looks so good.

552
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,790
I'm so touched. Thank you.

553
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,210
Thank you for your service.

554
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,910
- Senior. 
 - What?

555
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,690
Showing up without notice? What a surprise.

556
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,480
I knew you'd be hungry by now.

557
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,440
Pizza! Pizza!

558
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,840
Gosh, thank you so much.

559
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,320
Let me try this, too.

560
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,190

561
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,970

562
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,610
Senior, what are you doing here?

563
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,850
Aren't you going to eat with us?

564
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:05,610
Seung Woo, I wanted to tell you something.

565
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,090
- Me? 
 - Yes.

566
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:12,630
I didn't get to respond to what you said at the funeral.

567
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,880
No, it's okay.

568
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,170
You made me feel supported by just listening to me.

569
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:24,570
But I still want to give you my answer, at least.

570
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,370
What is it?

571
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,160

572
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:37,270
Even if we die, the remaining people's lives continue.

573
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:43,560
You won't hesitate at a crucial moment if you just keep that in mind.

574
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,370
Goodness...

575
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,820
Han Joon Oh.

576
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,900
I mean, Lord Ghost.

577
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,840
I heard Kang Yeong Hwa was here.

578
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,870
She left just now. Why ask?

579
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,170
She left? Where?

580
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:09,590
I wouldn't know, either.

581
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:13,270
Why are you asking? Is something going on with Yeong Hwa?

582
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,580
Was she okay?

583
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,030
Did she say anything, by chance?

584
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:22,690
Oh. Right, right, right.

585
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,280
She did ask me...

586
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,190
to give this to you when you're here.

587
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,760
 I want to fix our fate that started off wrong.

588
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,400
 Maybe the moment I jumped into the Han River to save Han Joon Oh,

589
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:05,390
 I wonder if I shouldn't have begged my guardian angel so desperately.

590
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:08,720
 If I had died then,

591
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,140
 I wouldn't have come this far.

592
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,630
 The fate that started off wrong.

593
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,510
 At the Han River then...

594
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,170
No.

595
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,130
Just a month ago,

596
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:01,400
I desperately wanted you and me to live.

597
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:07,800
♫  Under the pouring moonlight  ♫

598
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:13,460
But I'm back here wanting to finish everything now.

599
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,680
♫  Your eyes are deeper than words  ♫

600
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,870
But every moment I shared with you...

601
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:27,370
made me very happy.

602
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:33,820
♫  All of my memories...  ♫

603
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:37,700
 Why do you have my book?

604
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:44,240
♫  ....touched everything warmly  ♫

605
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,710
♫  It will become a light in my dark heart  ♫

606
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:57,440
♫  and I'm fighting the strong wind  ♫

607
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:03,960
♫  I'll run forever to eternity  ♫

608
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:10,540
♫  toward you and only you  ♫

609
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,340
♫  I want to stay by your side  ♫

610
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,700
So I won't...

611
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:19,460
have any regrets.

612
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,840
I will not have any regrets.

613
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,850
Come to your senses, Kang Yeong Hwa.

614
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,760
Don't fall into his trap.

615
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,930
It's different this time.

616
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:10,860
I decided to take responsibility for everything.

617
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,530
Is that really your decision?

618
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,660
No.

619
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,700
As far as I understand,

620
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,650
you value life more than anyone.

621
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,400
And Han Ri Ta also told me to make sure

622
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,980
to live 1,500 years ago, too.

623
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,620
How could this be your decision, then?

624
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,400
If I had died instead of

625
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,250
killing you 1,500 years ago,

626
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:45,170
this damned curse wouldn't have gone on for 1,500 years.

627
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:48,080
So I need to do this now.

628
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,710
Because this is the best for you and me.

629
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,800
So, please don't try to persuade me.

630
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,640
If only...

631
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,950
you didn't persuade me,

632
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,790
I thought I could've killed you anytime.

633
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,700
But I was wrong.

634
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:15,060
I can never...

635
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,170
I can never kill you.

636
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,650
Because meeting you...

637
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,060
was the most fortunate thing...

638
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,050
out of the miserable choices I had.

639
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,440
But if you still truly mean what you say,

640
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,690
you should make a bet with me.

641
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:54,580
Will you really be okay...

642
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,640
leaving me behind like this?

643
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:04,590
♫  When I turned around suddenly  ♫

644
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,030
 I...

645
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,500
 want you...

646
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,140
 to leave.

647
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,900
 That is how I truly feel.

648
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,360
 If you really mean that,

649
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,460
 will you make a bet with me, Sir?

650
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:27,420
♫  With you in my dream  ♫

651
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,220
 If you do not look back now...

652
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:36,170
 this will be our last time together.

653
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:44,480
♫  The memory of us in love back then  ♫

654
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:51,870
♫  is everything to me, and it's coming back  ♫

655
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:59,670
♫  Your warmth that touched me  ♫

656
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,370
 Are you sure...

657
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,730
 you will not regret it?

658
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:08,980
 I think...

659
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,280
 I will regret it.

660
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,540
 But I no longer...

661
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,030
 can help it.

662
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:29,410
I'm afraid...

663
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,450
I'll regret it again.

664
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,430
I'm afraid falling in love with you...

665
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:42,320
will cause tragedy like in our previous lives.

666
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:49,720
But I can't help it, either.

667
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,080
I came to like you so much...

668
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,980
and I want to live.

669
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:06,070
I just want to be with you as Kang Yeong Hwa.

670
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:12,050
I just want to live with you like this.

671
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,430
Yes.

672
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,160
Let's live.

673
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,810
Let us live.

674
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,240
I will make sure...

675
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,550
to change our fate.

676
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:42,740
♫  Promise me  ♫

677
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:53,280
♫  All the love we shared then means the world to me  ♫

678
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,500
♫  I can never let go of it  ♫

679
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:09,570
♫  The warmth we shared became all the seasons  ♫

680
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:15,930
♫  The sound of you breathing asleep next to me  ♫

681
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:26,150
♫  was my only prayer in life  ♫

682
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:36,140
♫  I long for you once again today  ♫

683
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:39,140

684
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,270
 I promise you...

685
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:46,060
 that our ending will not be tragic this time around.

686
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:51,350
 I need to destroy Kang Yeong Hwa's talisman first.

687
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,680
 I may die, but it'll never be by your hands.

688
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,450
 How are you supposed to destroy this evil spirit?

689
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:00,700
 The answer lies between the reason you remained here

690
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,210
 and his obsession.

691
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,130
 What difference will that make?

692
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:05,850
 The curse ends now.

693
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:08,960
♫  Just look at me like that  ♫
