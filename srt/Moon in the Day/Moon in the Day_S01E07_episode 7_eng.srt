1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:11,580

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,490

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,370

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,170

5
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,440

6
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,110

7
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,200

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,840
Because you...

9
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,000
were my wife.

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,140
Sorry. I just couldn't take it anymore.

11
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,060
Wow.

12
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,860
Try turning all of these off, then.

13
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,130
I'll believe you, then.

14
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,380
See?

15
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,360
You can't do it. But you're saying you're a 1,500-year-old ghost?

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,900
If you didn't believe it,

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,560
why did you go to the temple?

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Didn't you try to find the monk who put the charm on me?

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,120
And you made me come here

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,920
because you were suspicious of my identity.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,520
Since you've been saying many weird things, I just wanted to confirm it. That's all.

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,700
So, I'm confirming it now.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,600
The lights just went out by coincidence.

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,330
Everyone else knew how to ride a bike, but you learned as an adult.

25
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,330
You even did it secretly.

26
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,400
Because your last memory with your late father was when you were seven,

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,720
riding a bike with him.

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,960
How did you know that—

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,540
You lent five million won to your colleague two years ago.

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,570
But you haven't been paid back yet.

31
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,180
You couldn't ask for it back. Right?

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,360
You struggle because you have no money,

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,860
but you keep writing the text and deleting it back and forth.

34
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,810
Choi Na Hyeon always uses your stuff,

35
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,510
but you can't say anything for the same reason.

36
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,160
Because you'd rather suffer than...

37
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,770
having to worry about other people.

38
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,310
What are you doing right now?

39
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,450
I'm talking about Kang Yeong Hwa, whom I've been observing.

40
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,960
If you still can't believe me,

41
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,720
tell me something about you I don't know.

42
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,600
I can answer anything.

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,980
Han Joon Oh, you...

44
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,680
- Were you really— 
 - Yes.

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,500
- I'm really your— 
 - Were you my stalker?

46
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,090
Joon Oh, we need to talk.

47
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,480
I don't know what you've been doing with Ms. Kang at this hour,

48
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,140
but we need to talk.

49
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,310
I have no energy to worry about you right now, sir.

50
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,090
"Sir"?

51
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,510
You've been acting bizarrely since the accident.

52
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,050
I figured it's probably because you're still in pain.

53
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,430
I'm tolerating you saying that to myself.

54
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,530
Even your abnormal obsession over Ms. Kang, too.

55
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,990
Look at yourself now.

56
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,170
You only react to the name "Kang Yeong Hwa."

57
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,530
I asked her for a favor, hoping you'd get better.

58
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,630
But if you're actually getting worse,

59
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,040
I can't let her be by your side anymore.

60
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,720
Just go back to thinking...

61
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,500
it's because I'm in pain.

62
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,230
Could you just think that?

63
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,650
I'm not just ill. I'm terminally ill.

64
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,960
I beg you...

65
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,410
Brother.

66
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,180
Well, I don't think I could.

67
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,150
You're the one who asked me to get rid of the body.

68
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,560
What am I supposed to do, then?

69
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,040
If we go to court with this, our lives will be over.

70
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,100
That's why I said I'd help you.

71
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,320
I'm the only one who saw it.

72
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,260
You're right.

73
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,700
How is it possible that you were with Goo Tae Joo at that hour?

74
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,940
Not only that,

75
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,810
it was like you were waiting for me.

76
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,100
Now is the time. This will be very fun.

77
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,570
Then...

78
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,360
did you do that to Goo Tae Joo on purpose...

79
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,130
Do you want to smoke one?

80
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,790

81
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,180

82
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,310
If everything Han Joon Oh said was right,

83
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,810
that means I'm not crazy.

84
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,530
 As Kang Yeong Hwa's 30th birthday approaches,

85
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,450
 my wound has been getting worse.

86
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,130

87
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,550

What brings you here so early?

88
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,000
Joon Oh told me to bring Ms. Kang with me.

89
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,500
Oh, I see.

90
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,280
- Just a moment, please. 
 - Okay.

91
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,590
Did you think I'd say that?

92
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,720
Tell him to just keep seeing Jeong Yi Seul instead.

93
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,920
No need to listen to him, Unni.

94
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,040
Yeong Hwa, you're up.

95
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,310
I'm sorry, but tell him I left to see my dad early in the morning.

96
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,730
I'm not in the mood to see him right now.

97
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,520
Of course not. I know it's Han Joon Oh, but she doesn't have to tolerate a two-timer.

98
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,410
There are ethics in romantic relationships, too.

99
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,200
- Unni. 
 - What?

100
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,270
Well, Ms. Kang.

101
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,900
He asked me to tell you this.

102
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,380
 Don't try to ditch me by saying you'll be visiting your late father.

103
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,060
 You know better than anyone that you can't just avoid it.

104
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,940
That's what he said.

105
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,560
Han Joon Oh, are you serious right now?

106
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,160
Unni, I'll step out for a second.

107
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,140
Wait for a moment, Mr. Jang.

108
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,880
Okay.

109
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,780
Well, should I play some music?

110
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,610
- Mr. Jang. 
 - Yes?

111
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,880
You once said Han Joon Oh likes someone else.

112
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,210
Who were you talking about?

113
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,470
Did I say that?

114
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,950
Well, the thing is...

115
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,920
Joon Oh's taste is so consistent.

116
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,870
Someone he dated a long time ago

117
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,650
apparently looks exactly like you.

118
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,740
Oh, is it Han Ri Ta, by chance?

119
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,940
Yes, that's the name.

120
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,010
How did you know that, Ms. Kang?

121
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,170
You knew all about it, too.

122
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,750
When did you find out about this?

123
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,280
That Han Joon Oh isn't Han Joon Oh?

124
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,600
You knew all that, so why didn't you tell me?

125
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,500
You wouldn't have believed me even if I told you.

126
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,490
Just hear what he has to say, at least.

127
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,250
If he's been devoted to one woman for 1,500 years,

128
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,830
he must be so resentful.

129
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,590
We could've talked in Seoul, too.

130
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,780
Why did you make me come all the way here?

131
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,630
There's something I want to show you.

132
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,100
They're called yellow pond lilies.

133
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,910
You must be familiar with them if you saw them in your dreams.

134
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,320
Those flowers represent your family, too.

135
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,690
 It's the flower that was engraved on the sword.

136
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,060
Yes.

137
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,410
So...

138
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:00,140
the dreams I've been having aren't just dreams,

139
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,910
but it's something that actually happened?

140
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:08,160
You've been seeing your past life from 1,500 years ago.

141
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,300
Past life, reincarnation, and whatnot.

142
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
I can't believe those things were real.

143
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,050
But out of all the reincarnations, you're the only one...

144
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,000
who remembered me.

145
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,260
Kang Yeong Hwa.

146
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,260
Hold on.

147
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,040
Let me think.

148
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,780
I didn't want to reveal myself this way, either.

149
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,040
Because it'd be too shocking for you.

150
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,670
But now I want to...

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,500
quit this endless cycle and leave this world.

152
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,960
If everything you said is true,

153
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,970
do you know how I've been struggling...

154
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,350
because of psychological trauma my whole life?

155
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,330
But I was traumatized...

156
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,850
just so you could leave this world?

157
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,650
The only way to end this endless cycle

158
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,980
is for you to have the rest of the dreams and find out why I died.

159
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,200
No matter how confused I am

160
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,420
and how much I've been suffering,

161
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,050
you just need to achieve your goal, don't you?

162
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,650
Right?

163
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,520
Is it okay to shake up my life to the core to solve your problem?

164
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,070
Are your unresolved feelings that important?

165
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,930
In the 21st century, all sorts of incidents, accidents, illnesses,

166
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,460
and mysterious causes kill tons of people.

167
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,880
Not all of those people ruin other people's lives to relieve their pain like you.

168
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,220
I think you're mistaken.

169
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,160
I'm not Han Ri Ta. I'm Kang Yeong Hwa.

170
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,150
Just like you're not Han Joon Oh,

171
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm not the woman from 1,500 years ago, either.

172
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,820
You can never escape from the woman from 1,500 years ago.

173
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,160
You see your past life in your dreams.

174
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,080
Do you really think you can run from it?

175
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,730
You're curious about how it ended, too.

176
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,500
Let me give you a piece of advice.

177
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,490
If it's been 1,500 years,

178
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,600
why don't you just move on from it?

179
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,540
I'll move on from my ridiculous fate, too, then.

180
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,040
Kang Yeong Hwa.

181
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,460
And what you've been doing all this time is stalking.

182
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,450
You know that?

183
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,770
It wasn't just for a year or two, but for 29 years.

184
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,720
Let's never see each other again.

185
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,580
 Do not look back.

186
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,400
 Only look ahead from now on.

187
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,420
Leave now.

188
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,250
Hurry!

189
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,410
If you try to pass me, you will have to die.

190
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,090
We just need to catch the woman.

191
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,830
Fire!

192
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,570
Are you okay?

193
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,660
My Lord.

194
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,230
My Lord.

195
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,270
Mind your manners and be courteous if you are awake.

196
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,560
Where is...

197
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,640
the woman?

198
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,030
You killed your bodyguard for a lowly servant girl.

199
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,680
And even suffered an injury.

200
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,340
How much more will you disappoint me?

201
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Where is she?

202
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,690
I asked you, did I not?

203
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,620
She is dead. I killed her.

204
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,580
It better not be true.

205
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,030
Did you...

206
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,000
Did you really kill her?

207
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,400
This is all for you.

208
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,860
If she is really the traitor's daughter,

209
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,020
what did you think would happen to you?

210
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,270
I told you to mind your manners.

211
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,140
I have...

212
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,840
killed countless people only to live as your son.

213
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,830
I never had any reason to live from the beginning.

214
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,460
I no longer...

215
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,730
will live as your son.

216
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,940
Would you be able to handle my army in that condition?

217
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,280
If you leave now,

218
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,990
you will die.

219
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,320
I...

220
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,420
do not care anymore.

221
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,220
Open the door for him.

222
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,900
If it were not for me,

223
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,740
she would have bit her tongue and died already.

224
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,750
She has worked at the residence of the Great General of Gaya.

225
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,760
It is Lady Han Ri Ta, My Lord.

226
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,810
All the people here are...

227
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,010
witnesses, Do Ha.

228
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,990
She is a traitor who deserves to die.

229
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,420
If you...

230
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,790
kill this traitor here and now,

231
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,880
I will generously forgive you for falling for a lowly servant.

232
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,520
If that is your answer,

233
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,100
I have no other choice.

234
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,550
The only people who know she is the traitor...

235
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,960
are us now.

236
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,770
A dog I have been caring for is trying to challenge a human.

237
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,020
I should tighten the collar more...

238
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,620
and put him back in his place.

239
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,640
Instead of making you marry someone who would make you successful,

240
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,130
letting you marry the traitor's daughter who would become my hostage...

241
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,260
would be more fitting, would it not?

242
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,980
Is that the reason why...

243
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,000
you did this to the innocent people?

244
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,890
I will schedule your wedding on an auspicious day

245
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,600
and make sure it is grand.

246
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,260
The only way to save this girl

247
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,350
is to marry her.

248
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,570
Make a decision.

249
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,090
You either kill this girl or...

250
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,100
accept her as your wife.

251
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,610
I am happy with your answer as well.

252
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,720
Give her nice clothes

253
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,020
and treat her kindly.

254
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,080
She is an important person...

255
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,310
who will become Do Ha's wife.

256
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,460
My Lord, I gave her porridge as you told me to, but...

257
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,280
Is she refusing to eat today as well?

258
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,390
My apologies.

259
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,410
 I will come in for a moment.

260
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,380
I suggested that we live.

261
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,410
I am sorry things turned out this way.

262
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,590
But in order to survive,

263
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,360
you will have to eat something.

264
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,460
Do I have to eat if you tell me to?

265
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,570
Do I have to live...

266
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,270
if you tell me to?

267
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,150
What right do you have?

268
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,130
Why do I have to do what you want me to do?

269
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,810
Why do you...

270
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,450
make me the reason for you to live?

271
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,340
Because it is better that way.

272
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,770
Rather than living to kill someone,

273
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,990
living to get killed by you...

274
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,180
must be better.

275
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,150
Is that why...

276
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,900
you want me to live like shackles on your neck?

277
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,490
While watching you do anything for your father?

278
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,070
As long as I listen to what Father says,

279
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,780
he will not tell the world who you are.

280
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,590
Would it not be better for you to be by the enemy's side

281
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,130
and look for the opportunity to kill...

282
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,190
instead of being on the run?

283
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,370
I will see myself out now.

284
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,230
Have at least a bite.

285
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,340
Ms. Kang, we're here.

286
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,640
Ms. Kang, you're home now.

287
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,530
You must've been tired. You were sleeping so soundly.

288
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,640
Thank you for the ride. I'll get going now.

289
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,330
Wait...

290
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,750
By the way, what did you decide

291
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,420
to do with the ghost gentleman?

292
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,840
Oh, the ghost gentleman?

293
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,720
Well, my livelihood depends on it.

294
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,700
I hope you were able to reach an agreement.

295
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,490
The conversation went well, right?

296
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,900
You came. Did the meeting with Han Joon Oh go well?

297
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,320
Unni, did you empty my trash can, by chance?

298
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,790
Did I empty it while cleaning my room?

299
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,840
Why do you ask?

300
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,490
Hey.

301
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,630
What are you doing?

302
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,940
I found it.

303
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,430
I'll no longer dream about Lord Do Ha anymore.

304
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:57,330
 A father in his 40s got killed by a drunk driver once again.

305
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,760
 Before the accident, he was working as a driver

306
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,240
 to afford the academy tuitions for his daughters...

307
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,700
 A week ago, a young worker died at a corporate construction site.

308
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,430
 He was 19 years old...

309
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:18,100
 Sang Eun, the wife, is being supported by her husband, Seung Ho...

310
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,000
 In the 21st century, all sorts of incidents, accidents, illnesses,

311
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,500
 and mysterious causes kill tons of people.

312
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,920
 Not all of those people ruin other people's lives to relieve their pain like you.

313
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:42,630
 Do you think I wanted to be tricked by destiny like this?

314
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,310
You almost surprised me.

315
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,200
I didn't think you'd find him so quickly.

316
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,900
Oh, well... I didn't find him.

317
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,560
Mr. Seok wanted to resolve a misunderstanding with you.

318
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,220
So he reached out to me.

319
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,700
- You can leave now. 
 - Okay.

320
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,620
I'll ask him myself.

321
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,980
I should've come sooner, but it was kind of a long journey.

322
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,360
You haven't seen each other in a while.

323
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,590
Why don't you start with a warm handshake...

324
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,680
We can shake hands later.

325
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,580
I'll manage myself. Do what Mr. Han told you.

326
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,670
Oh, okay.

327
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,270
I'll leave you to it, then.

328
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,280
Have a seat. Why are you standing?

329
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,560
I don't know what you told Attorney Go,

330
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,890
but you'd better be straight with me.

331
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,100
Do you want to know if I tried to kill your brother?

332
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,040
It's not a big deal if I went to jail because of you. I wouldn't try to hire a hitman for that.

333
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,500
If you think you could gloss it over like this—

334
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,550
I know what you've been preoccupied with lately.

335
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:10,090
"He definitely looks like my brother,

336
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,030
but why does he seem so different?" Something like that?

337
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,340
What are you talking about?

338
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,280
Okay. Let's try again.

339
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,880
"Han Joon Oh died and came back to life,

340
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,010
but why is he suddenly acting like a different person?

341
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:36,540
Is this really from psychological trauma?"

342
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,810
Thoughts like that, you know.

343
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,980
And Kang Yeong Hwa.

344
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,670
Why is Han Joon Oh suddenly so obsessed with her?

345
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:54,280
These are the major issues you're facing.

346
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,210
How did you know all of those things—

347
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,550
What? Are you curious?

348
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,720
Then, first, stop being suspicious of me.

349
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,140
I'm the only one who can fix your problems.

350
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,080
Try quizzing your brother once.

351
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:17,440
About a secret only you and the real Han Joon Oh know about.

352
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,190
If he doesn't answer correctly, boom.

353
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,090
That means he's...

354
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,760
not the real Han Joon Oh.

355
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,760

356
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,260
Why did you come out so quickly?

357
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,630
Are you already done talking to him?

358
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,660
Don't you know how difficult it was to arrange this?

359
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,290
You made things go so smoothly. Thank you.

360
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,830
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

361
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,170
You couldn't have killed him, did you?

362
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,230
Everyone in the industry knows you two don't get along.

363
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,360
Answer me.

364
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,690
There are CCTVs everywhere here.

365
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,580
You killed someone yourself.

366
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,020
Yet you're so easily scared.

367
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,240
Don't worry.

368
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,860
Who I'm going to kill is neither Han Joon Oh nor Han Min Oh.

369
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,890
The prisoners from Baekje escaped?

370
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,410
Yes, My Lord.

371
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,030
Looks like the soldiers are struggling.

372
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,650
Do Ha, you should go and clean things up for them.

373
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,780
Your swordsmanship...

374
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,830
is the best in Seorabeol.

375
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,580
It is all right.

376
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,410
Great General is severely injured.

377
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,490
We can take care of a small task like this.

378
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,520
No, no.

379
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,390
This is for Silla. The ranking should not matter.

380
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,560
Get going immediately, Do Ha.

381
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,320
I will be going now.

382
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,190
I will be back.

383
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,090
She is marrying Lord Do Ha? That wicked bitch.

384
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,940
She is just a servant like us.

385
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,530
By the way, did you hear?

386
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,110
Lord Do Ha almost died trying to save her.

387
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:00,180
Lord So Ri Bu caught them trying to run away together.

388
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,610
And he went to another battle?

389
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,850
Gosh, unbelievable.

390
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,950
What if he passes away because of that wicked thing?

391
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,540
I know.

392
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,680
He will not die.

393
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,720
He will come back alive. I am certain of it.

394
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:42,000
♫  Out of countless people  ♫

395
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:50,560
♫  There's one person who's always by my side  ♫

396
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:58,220
♫  The stars in the night sky are like you  ♫

397
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:04,700
♫  You shine my dark heart  ♫

398
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:13,260
♫  I can go anywhere as long as you hold my hand  ♫

399
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:20,740
♫  The warm sunlight is embracing us  ♫

400
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:27,300
♫  On these beautiful days  ♫

401
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:34,400
♫  You and I are different under the same sky  ♫

402
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:39,570
♫  It feels like the world has stopped  ♫

403
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:43,610
♫  Let me embrace you warmly  ♫

404
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:49,610
♫  All of my days are being colored by you  ♫

405
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:58,740
♫  I will always protect you even when you're out of reach  ♫

406
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:08,750
♫  Just thinking about you overwhelms my heart  ♫

407
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,280
Why are you here?

408
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,980
Did you come back just now?

409
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,260
Can you not tell by looking?

410
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,360
You do not look well.

411
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,240
I am tired. Please leave.

412
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,340
Why are your hands so hot?

413
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,690
Do not worry. Go ahead and leave...

414
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:20,460
Are you sick by chance, My Lord?

415
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,180
It seems you have a fever.

416
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,800
You do not have to pretend to worry about me.

417
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,550
My Lord.

418
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,170
My Lord.

419
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,430
My Lord!

420
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,930
My Lord!

421
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,220
His wound from the arrow has not healed

422
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,680
and he overworked himself.

423
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,220
I think he is having a fever because the wound has festered.

424
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:05,400
He may not wake up since the fever is too severe.

425
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,040
You still have a lot of things...

426
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,860
to do for me.

427
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,090
I cannot believe his life is endangered from merely this.

428
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,830
Take good care of Do Ha.

429
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,840
If he cannot wake up,

430
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,890
I will no longer...

431
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,430
have the reason to...

432
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,320
let you live.

433
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:05,140
Even if you wake up,

434
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,080
you will be dragged around like a dog by your father.

435
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,800
Because of me, who became your shackle,

436
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,210
you have to do whatever he tells you to do.

437
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,640
Now, you are neither dead nor alive.

438
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,230
I should be ending this now.

439
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,100
Both of my relentless resentment

440
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,180
and my unforgivable sympathy for you...

441
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:48,290
will end once you are dead.

442
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,470
Let us end this here now.

443
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,440
My Lord, are you awake?

444
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,140
You must have been the one...

445
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,780
- who stayed by my side the whole time. 
 - It was not me.

446
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,510
Oh, the new servant girl was...

447
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,030
Your soon-to-be wife stayed with you.

448
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:24,010
She cared for you without sleeping a wink all night.

449
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,390
Where is she right now?

450
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,340
You should not walk around like this.

451
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,270
When did you wake up?

452
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,570
Are you not dizzy?

453
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,440
You should have called me if you awoke.

454
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,900
- Why are you here— 
 - One at a time.

455
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,900
Ask one thing at a time. I am okay.

456
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,580
You almost did not wake up.

457
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,750
You do not know anything.

458
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,600
I know...

459
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,210
one thing for sure.

460
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,330
That you missed your chance...

461
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,590
to kill me again.

462
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,910
Why did you not?

463
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,160
You could have killed me easily.

464
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,690
I wanted to kill you.

465
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,810
I really wanted to.

466
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,550
So why...

467
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,710
Why did I not? I wonder.

468
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:00,250
Rather than wanting to kill you,

469
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:07,800
why was I more worried that you would never wake up?

470
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,200
That's because...

471
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,200
I do not consider life that valuable yet.

472
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,880
No.

473
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,820
That was not why.

474
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,750
I wanted to ask you...

475
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,150
what I should do now.

476
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,410
I cannot even kill you anymore.

477
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,370
How am I supposed to live now?

478
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:41,440
You are the only one who tells me to survive.

479
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:48,370
You told me to live dreaming of the day I would kill you.

480
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,870
My enemy, who risked his life to protect me,

481
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,970
might know how to go about it.

482
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,900
I will think about...

483
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,700
how you should live.

484
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,680
I will make sure to...

485
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,810
find a way.

486
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,520
Promise me just one thing.

487
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,360
Do not disappear from my sight.

488
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,370
Since I have you,

489
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,120
I can endure this hellish time.

490
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,330
Even though...

491
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,930
I put you in that hell?

492
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:50,460
I must be out of my mind.

493
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:54,390
Just seeing you like this

494
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,990
makes me feel relieved.

495
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,540
I am not sure...

496
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:19,620
what to do with myself.

497
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,850
I do not know anymore.

498
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,080
I dreamed about him again.

499
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,770
What's wrong with me?

500
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,840
Gosh, so silly. Why am I crying?

501
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,880
This makes what I said yesterday meaningless.

502
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,680
 Are your unresolved feelings that important?

503
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:43,350
 If it's been 1,500 years, why don't you just move on from it?

504
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,000
Was I too harsh?

505
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:04,120

I'm sorry for the late response.

506
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,140
 Let's meet at Joon Oh's place and talk today.

507
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,370
Right.

508
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,350
I suggested to CEO Han that we meet.

509
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,770
Someone's coming?

510
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,710
Ms. Kang.

511
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,750
She wanted to discuss something.

512
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,280
I thought it'd be nice to talk over a meal.

513
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,400
How surprising.

514
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,420
I thought you'd be happy to hear that Ms. Kang was coming over.

515
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,570
Everything has its time.

516
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:41,170
And from what I heard last time,

517
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:45,300
you're not that thrilled about her.

518
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,670
Who else is there to grant your wishes but me?

519
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,850
You even begged me.

520
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:57,160
I'll go.

521
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,010
You came.

522
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:08,130
Thanks for accepting the last-minute invitation.

523
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,540
Not at all. I wanted to see you.

524
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,970
Let's go in.

525
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,100
Wait, CEO Han.

526
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:19,970
I want to tell you something without Han Joon Oh around.

527
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:24,220
You want to talk to me privately?

528
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,760
 What are you doing, Kang Yeong Hwa? You came to tell him everything.

529
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,380
 Don't get weak because of the dream. Tell him.

530
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,240
I can't go on like this anymore.

531
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,800
What do you mean by that?

532
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,010
 I can no longer be Han Joon Oh's bodyguard.

533
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,800
 I thought he was terminally ill and was severely traumatized,

534
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,880
 so I signed a contract with you to help him.

535
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,740
 But that was all a lie.

536
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,620
 He was playing all sorts of tricks, trying to leave this world.

537
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,590
 That's why I got suspended, too.

538
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,720
 So, our contract never made sense.

539
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,020
 I'll break the bodyguard contract.

540
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:09,730
Aren't you going to say anything?

541
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,560
Well...

542
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,750
So...

543
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,840
What I wanted to tell you is...

544
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,110
 Han Joon Oh actually died.

545
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,060
 You think he's your brother, but he's just human on the outside.

546
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,540
 He's a ghost.

547
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,030
 How am I supposed to tell him that?

548
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,780
It's okay.

549
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,720
I need to know everything about Joon Oh.

550
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,310
We don't have a lot of time left.

551
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:42,080
I don't care what it's about.

552
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,680
To be honest...

553
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,800
since he officially has a girlfriend,

554
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,300
maybe I shouldn't be living in his house.

555
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,280
That's what I wanted to say.

556
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,440
Didn't you tell me that last time already?

557
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,100
I did, right?

558
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,640
I completely forgot. I'm so out of it right now.

559
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,010
I-I'm sorry.

560
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,170
Whoa! What's all this?

561
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,160
You didn't make all of this yourself. Right?

562
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:30,420
I have often cooked since Joon Oh and I lived together as kids.

563
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,830
You're so impressive, CEO Han.

564
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,870
Impressive indeed.

565
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,070
I can't believe you came back here...

566
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,300
to have a free meal.

567
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,160
What kind of thing is that to say?

568
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,010
I arranged this meeting since Ms. Kang went through so much.

569
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,780
She told me first.

570
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,890
That we should never see each other again.

571
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,490
Did something happen?

572
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,430
Not at all.

573
00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:01,480
I said I didn't ever want to see him sick again. I think he misunderstood.

574
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,320
Right?

575
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,350
Can I start eating before the food gets cold?

576
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,810
Thanks for the meal.

577
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:15,310
Wow, the clam pasta looks like one from a restaurant.

578
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:19,530
I designed the menu just for you.

579
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,230
Joon Oh doesn't like seafood so much.

580
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:26,710
When he was a kid, he climbed a rock to pick up clams

581
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:29,160
and fell into the ocean.

582
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,260
Do you remember?

583
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,150
I'm not sure.

584
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:47,420
Your older brother is asking. Answer properly.

585
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,900
Yes.

586
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,600
I did.

587
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,250
You remember, too.

588
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:59,240
You haven't really eaten clams since then.

589
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,180
You said it reminds you of the taste of the seawater.

590
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,930
Yes, it's true.

591
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,840
How about we have some wine?

592
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,960
Sure. Sounds good.

593
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,850
You should drink water since you're sick.

594
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:19,760
Whatever.

595
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,420
You have no problem eating noodles in front of someone you never wanted to see again.

596
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,390
I also feel really uncomfortable right now. Okay?

597
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,980
You're so inconsistent.

598
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,600
I thought you completely moved on.

599
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:47,070
I'm sorry I was so harsh last time,

600
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:50,220
but he doesn't need to know about our issue.

601
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,430
Please act normal in front of him.

602
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,120
You shouldn't have come here if that's what you wanted.

603
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,620
You think I came here because I wanted to?

604
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,560
I felt bad that he made a whole spread for you.

605
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,590
That's why I'm trying to act as naturally as possible.

606
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,650
Is it that hard to play along?

607
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:12,960
What can I do? I'm not Han Joon Oh, to begin with.

608
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,420
This is the issue right now.

609
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,220
You still only care about why you died.

610
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:27,760
Imagine the CEO finding out his only brother is actually dead.

611
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,110
Can you even imagine that pain?

612
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,460
Do you know the pain of the remaining people,

613
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,480
not just your pain from dying?

614
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,810
- I also— 
 - Will you say you had no choice again?

615
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:45,290
...truly think it's a shame.

616
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:47,570
I know, too.

617
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,380
The ones who lost their loved ones...

618
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:54,540
and were left behind...

619
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:02,240
feel such great loss and pain.

620
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,830
When your parents passed away,

621
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:08,960
I was there...

622
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,430
by your side then, too.

623
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:21,740
I picked this for you.

624
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,030
I hope you like it.

625
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,010
What?

626
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:42,230
It feels like someone keeps following us.

627
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:43,520
Who?

628
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,080
I think I'm mistaken.

629
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,540
You're wrong.

630
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,730
The one who climbed the rock...

631
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,660
and fell into the ocean was me.

632
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,750
Not you, Joon Oh.

633
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:21,700

634
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,500
You didn't have to walk me home.

635
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,680
I'm doing this because Han Min Oh asked.

636
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,740
I know you want me to try to satisfy Han Min Oh since he's upset about me.

637
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:39,760
That's the least I can do

638
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,710
while I'm borrowing this body.

639
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:47,620
You know it well now. I don't need to tell you anymore.

640
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,640
I'll apologize, too.

641
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:58,930
For speaking harshly to you.

642
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:01,220
For telling me to just move on?

643
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:05,160
I didn't even experience it myself,

644
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,790
but I made it sound too easy.

645
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,480
To be honest,

646
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,370
I dreamed about it more.

647
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,550
It made me feel bad.

648
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,400
What would it have been like

649
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,450
if you and Han Ri Ta met at a different time and situation?

650
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:27,650
I felt sad for them.

651
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:33,360
Since we're on the topic...

652
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:36,860
I'll keep having dreams.

653
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,350
What?

654
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,110
I'm a little more curious about...

655
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,910
how you and Han Ri Ta ended up.

656
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,870
♫  Yes, it's you  ♫

657
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:54,430
♫  You're my love  ♫

658
00:59:54,430 --> 01:00:01,840
♫  Whether it's day or night, my heart doesn't change  ♫

659
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:08,980
♫  If I create your image by connecting the stars  ♫

660
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:15,680
♫  I try to touch you with my eyes  ♫

661
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:22,600
♫  Since I love you forever  ♫

662
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:26,270

663
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,270
 You were like my old guardian angel.

664
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:32,560
 Just dream more instead of saying silly things.

665
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,290
 Your brother is possessed by an evil spirit.

666
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:37,530
 You think I'd believe you?

667
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,710
 I have a bad feeling.

668
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:40,660
 Don't go anywhere today and stay with me.

669
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,320
 You're not coming to the fire station, too. Right?

670
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,370
 You can't.

671
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:48,040
 A body possessed by an evil spirit has a unique mark on it.

672
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:53,670
 I won't let you get killed by someone else this time.
