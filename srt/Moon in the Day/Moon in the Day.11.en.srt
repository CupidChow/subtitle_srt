(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,158
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,159
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,159
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

5
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,939
My feelings for you.

6
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:10,980
I'm...

7
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,209
in love with you.

8
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,090
Ms. Kang.

9
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,530
I'm sure you'll recognize me this time.

10
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,170
We meet quite often to consider it a coincidence.

11
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,639
Connections that continue from past lives...

12
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,409
aren't easily cut off.

13
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,409
Excuse me?

14
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,250
Just like...

15
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,018
your tragic destiny repeats...

16
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:54,150
the moment you have feelings for Do Ha.

17
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,790
Who are you?

18
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:04,730
I already told you...

19
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,129
that your tragedy will repeat because of your love.

20
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,939
What do you mean?

21
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,669
Karma from your past life.

22
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:17,879
Karma from your past life...

23
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,039
also began with your love.

24
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,479
Kill Do Ha.

25
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,589
Because you're the one who brought upon...

26
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,120
these curses, Kang Young Hwa.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,460
No, Han Ri Ta.

28
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,289
If you can't believe me,

29
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,430
check the scar on Do Ha's neck.

30
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,539
The scar that you left with your hands...

31
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,839
will still be clearly visible...

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,539
after 1,500 years.

33
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,349
No.

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,289
That can't be.

35
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,259
No.

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,110
(Moon in the Day)

37
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,210
"Death."

38
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,819
Does this card mean death?

39
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,120
You said it was a friend of yours, right?

40
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,960
(Yoon Je)

41
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,129
Not just a friend.

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,860
She's like family.

43
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,569
I recommend...

44
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,370
you tell her...

45
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,569
to be careful for a while.

46
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,409
A tremendous threat is...

47
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,379
near her.

48
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,780
I knew it.

49
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,150
Is Jun O that's possessed causing this?

50
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,089
Ma'am, do you give talismans too?

51
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,419
You know, something that's effective to drive ghosts away.

52
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,759
I can try and find a way.

53
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,370
Hey!

54
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,980
- Oh, my goodness. - What are you doing?

55
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,648
It was a critical moment. What did you do?

56
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,149
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

57
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,818
I've been running all over the place to find you.

58
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,750
I said I would no longer idle around...

59
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,888
about Young Hwa's problem.

60
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,419
I'm telling you that he's...

61
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,730
not the type of bad person that you think he is.

62
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,189
Yes, he is!

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,059
Look. "Devil. Death."

64
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,328
They're all ominous cards.

65
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,970
You believe these pieces of paper?

66
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,540
She's excellent at this.

67
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,110
Don't be stupid. You're throwing your money away.

68
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,648
- Let's go. Come outside. - No.

69
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:08,949
Just come with me.

70
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,920
Sorry. I'll make sure to come back.

71
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,019
I'm sorry!

72
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,930
That man is Seok Chul Hwan?

73
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,399
Who on earth are you?

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,009
I never imagined that there would be...

75
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,310
a third person.

76
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:41,610
Her death...

77
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,480
has repeated...

78
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,319
at a place I never expected...

79
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,649
by a person I never expected.

80
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
But...

81
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,560
if someone has been behind this...

82
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,529
Where is Seok Chul Hwan?

83
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,800
You see, he was...

84
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,540
in a motel in the suburbs,

85
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,670
but he probably moved to somewhere else.

86
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:09,638
Otherwise, he'll be arrested...

87
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,379
as he's the suspect of Min O's murder.

88
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,750
Are you going to call the police?

89
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,449
Then, they'll question us about Gu Tae Ju.

90
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,449
I'm going to see it before the police do.

91
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,290
So, you find out now.

92
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,889
Where he is, and what he's doing.

93
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,829
Even though you're the one asking, but that's...

94
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,930
One day.

95
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,500
That's all I can give you.

96
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,310
Wait, Jun O.

97
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,819
It looks like you're out...

98
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,480
to get revenge on him for trying to kill Mr. Han.

99
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,120
but Chul Hwan is not a man to be underestimated.

100
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:59,160
He's not even a man. He's a monster.

101
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,389
So, let's stay away...

102
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,560
from getting involved in worse things.

103
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,930
"Worse?"

104
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,470
Didn't you see...

105
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,370
what happened to Mr. Han? Doesn't it scare you?

106
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,540
What scares me at this moment is...

107
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:16,310
one thing.

108
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,949
It's watching you die...

109
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,519
without being able to do anything...

110
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,620
just like in the previous 18 lives.

111
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,920
Where has she gone?

112
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,670
What do you think you're doing?

113
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,069
Mr. Jang, where's Young Hwa? She's not at home.

114
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,240
You see...

115
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,899
Excuse me, Mr. Han.

116
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,938
I asked you first. What are you doing at our house?

117
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,310
I'm looking for Young Hwa.

118
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,110
- Do you know where she is? - Do you want to find her?

119
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,579
Then, we need to talk first.

120
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,600
Don't think it's unfair.

121
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,000
This is all because of karma from your past lives.

122
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,299
Because you're the one who brought upon...

123
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,040
these curses, Kang Young Hwa.

124
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,279
No, Han Ri Ta.

125
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:29,279
The scar that you left with your hands...

126
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,378
will still be clearly visible...

127
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,389
after 1,500 years.

128
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,860
So, I ended up...

129
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,360
killing you?

130
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,909
That can't be right.

131
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,539
(National Fire Agency)

132
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,049
(To Mr. Firefighter. Cheer up.)

133
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,820
What does this have to do...

134
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,888
with finding her?

135
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,090
What does it have to do?

136
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,190
(Certificate of Appointment, Kang Young Hwa)

137
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:16,330
Do you feel nothing after seeing this?

138
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:19,629
Na Yeon.

139
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,299
I have to say my piece.

140
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,809
Young Hwa used to have a dream and a goal.

141
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:31,580
As a firefighter and a human,

142
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,379
she was very proud of her life.

143
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,720
Now that you've ruined her life,

144
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,049
don't you feel anything?

145
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,219
Even today, she stormed out of the house...

146
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,759
as if she was possessed.

147
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,629
Did you have nothing to do with that?

148
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,429
"As if she was possessed?"

149
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:55,429
Sure. The tie between you and her that continued from the past life,

150
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,269
I've heard all about it.

151
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,610
Shouldn't you stop doing this if it's been so long?

152
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,539
You might not be able to make her happy,

153
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,879
but you should at least try not to make her unhappy.

154
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,559
Young Hwa isn't...

155
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,259
answering calls from Na Yeon or me. What should we do?

156
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,629
I'll call the police if I can't reach her.

157
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,629
She might be...

158
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,840
in danger.

159
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,809
What danger?

160
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,309
I'll keep looking.

161
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:42,480
Never mind.

162
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,779
I think I found her.

163
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,019
I'll call you again.

164
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,169
I guess...

165
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,039
this was why...

166
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,980
I didn't want you to know until the end.

167
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,389
Because I didn't want you...

168
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,190
to feel the pain that I've been through.

169
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,019
That was dangerous.

170
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,419
What are you thinking?

171
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,100
What?

172
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,860
How long have you been here?

173
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,830
Why are you so surprised?

174
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,639
I've been by your side for 1,500 years.

175
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,009
You're not even a person. You're just a ghost.

176
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,509
Now, you sound like Young Hwa that I know.

177
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,750
Kill Do Ha.

178
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,548
Because you're the one who brought upon...

179
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,759
these curses, Kang Young Hwa. No, Han Ri Ta.

180
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,389
If what he said was true...

181
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,799
Are you okay?

182
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,629
Let me take a look.

183
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,210
I just missed my step and scraped myself.

184
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,210
Don't mind me.

185
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,779
This is why I told you to stay put at home.

186
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,159
I can't relax for a second because of you.

187
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,460
Don't be weird. Stop making a fuss over little scratches.

188
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,299
I've fallen from a cliff,

189
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,500
been in a car accident,

190
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,269
and fallen into the Han River before.

191
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:16,600
You've seen it too.

192
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,039
Worse things could happen to me, and I'd feel fine.

193
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,840
I don't feel fine anymore.

194
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,749
As you said, I've watched you in danger...

195
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,950
multiple times.

196
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,419
But I feel different now.

197
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,659
So, from now on,

198
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,289
don't ever get hurt even slightly.

199
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,860
This darn pain.

200
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,730
I must be running out of time as well.

201
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,970
I must finish off...

202
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:30,570
Ri Ta's new incarnation as soon as possible.

203
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,279
- Okay. He knows. - Sir!

204
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,950
Hey.

205
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,379
Yes, I'll call you back.

206
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,779
I'm Jung Yi Seul.

207
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,990
You can't just cancel our contract.

208
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,559
I've brought this company hundreds of thousands of dollars.

209
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:49,788
All your commercials and TV shows were canceled,

210
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,860
and our company has to pay the money you earned as a penalty.

211
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:54,428
The company wanted to charge you, but I defended you...

212
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,798
to end it by canceling our contract.

213
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,899
You should be thanking me.

214
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,070
Still, if you fire me in these circumstances,

215
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:04,340
what agency will accept me?

216
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,509
If people find out that I've been fired by my agency,

217
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,980
I can never make a comeback.

218
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,149
In show business,

219
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,919
your image is everything.

220
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,289
But your image...

221
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,860
is already done for.

222
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,330
No matter how hard you struggle, it's irretrievable.

223
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,710
Goodness.

224
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,878
What's Jung Yi Seul, the superstar representing Korea,

225
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,179
doing here, crying?

226
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,879
What if people see you?

227
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,379
So what?

228
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,850
Are you going to take a picture and post it online?

229
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,460
I'm already as angry as I can get.

230
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:54,329
I can't deal with a weird guy picking a fight with me.

231
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,229
I may not look like it, but I was the founder...

232
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,860
of Beginning Entertainment.

233
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,899
"A weird guy" is a bit harsh.

234
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:10,769
(Seok Chul Hwan)

235
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,279
Nice to meet you, Ms. Jung.

236
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,549
I'm the former CEO of Beginning Entertainment,

237
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,149
Seok Chul Hwan.

238
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,710
I said I was fine.

239
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,679
Do you feel fine too?

240
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,549
The curse that you'll die before you reach the age of 30.

241
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,860
You've been feeling down because of that.

242
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,099
I was wrong.

243
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,799
I'd rather go through the pain of the curse...

244
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,400
by myself.

245
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:17,839
But avoiding it won't make the curse go away.

246
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,410
I'll find a way. No,

247
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,880
I might have found a way to lift the curse.

248
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,049
I've found another person related to your curse.

249
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,759
Another person?

250
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:34,390
The person...

251
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,589
that told Min O about your past life's karma.

252
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,299
Do you mean...

253
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,400
Seok Chul Hwan?

254
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,170
How do you know him?

255
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,240
I ran into him before I met you today.

256
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,109
You ran into him?

257
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,220
Tell me more. When? Where?

258
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:05,088
I saved him from a fire back in the day,

259
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,559
and I met him by chance today.

260
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,029
But...

261
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,859
he knew who you were.

262
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,700
He did?

263
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
"Do Ha."

264
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,900
He called you Do Ha.

265
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,539
And he knew that I was Han Ri Ta.

266
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,009
Seok Chul Hwan,

267
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,480
who on earth are you?

268
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,009
Nothing happened, right?

269
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,680
Nothing...

270
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,250
If you can't believe me,

271
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,259
check the scar on Do Ha's neck.

272
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,390
The scar that you left with your hands...

273
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,499
will still be clearly visible...

274
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,230
after 1,500 years.

275
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,680
What are you doing?

276
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,480
Wait.

277
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,000
There's really a scar,

278
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,809
like he said.

279
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,640
Young Hwa.

280
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,250
I felt it wasn't the first time I saw the scar.

281
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,319
Was that left...

282
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,289
when you died?

283
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,490
Why do you suddenly ask that?

284
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,460
Chul Hwan said...

285
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,900
something more to you?

286
00:19:57,569 --> 00:20:00,039
No, I just met him. That's all.

287
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,710
Should we eat something first?

288
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,309
I'm so hungry as I haven't eaten anything today.

289
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,490
This is the only thing you can eat in this house.

290
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,630
No problem. I like cup noodles.

291
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,529
You don't eat this with me?

292
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,400
Take care of yourself first,

293
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,930
though I'm worried this doesn't have enough nutrition.

294
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:34,569
How funny a ghost considers the nutrition.

295
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,319
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

296
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,619
It's because you just smiled.

297
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Now,

298
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:56,359
don't spill the noodles with your wounded hands.

299
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,700
Please, eat up.

300
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,380
What did you say? Who will Young Hwa sleep with?

301
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,508
No, I didn't mean they would sleep together.

302
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,249
It's already late tonight.

303
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,279
So she will just take a sleep at Jun O's.

304
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:21,889
That's why.

305
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,819
I already warned it directly, but the ghostly guy...

306
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,719
No, the ghost itself...

307
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,328
hooked my sister. That's what happened now.

308
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,159
Yoon Je, start your car.

309
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,299
I will bring her back right now.

310
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,640
Please! What's wrong with you?

311
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,339
You already remember Young Hwa herself told us it was okay.

312
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,910
I didn't expect her to be with the ghost...

313
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,349
on this bleak night.

314
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,119
Wait. I'm really okay.

315
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,420
I already informed Na Yeon of this through Mr. Jang.

316
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,819
That you will stay in my place tonight.

317
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,529
She will misunderstand for sure.

318
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,490
What do you mean?

319
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,930
I love her so much, like my family member,

320
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,599
but sometimes she goes too far.

321
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,309
It already happened.

322
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,940
You told me you saw her in my place, right?

323
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,939
Did she tell you off heavily?

324
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,140
Just a bit.

325
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:27,380
Nonetheless, it's good for you...

326
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:33,059
as so many people support you.

327
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,230
So don't worry.

328
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,660
You will survive and live your own life safely.

329
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,039
Because I'll protect you.

330
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,920
What's wrong?

331
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:09,490
Was it...

332
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,700
painful?

333
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,299
Sorry?

334
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,809
I mean the moment when you were dying.

335
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,250
Was it painful?

336
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,930
It was extremely painful,

337
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,529
so I can't even describe the moment.

338
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,029
It was painful enough to remember...

339
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,539
even after all the 1,500 years later.

340
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,950
What's wrong?

341
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,990
I don't even know why I act like this.

342
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,990
You know, you're so strange today.

343
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,859
I may be too tired now.

344
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,430
A lot of things happened today.

345
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,240
I see.

346
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,409
You must be so tired as you didn't sleep last night either.

347
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,509
Please sleep early today.

348
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,109
Okay.

349
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,019
One more thing.

350
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,319
I will keep watching over you,

351
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,529
so don't worry.

352
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,230
Okay.

353
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,569
If your pain is...

354
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,980
because of me...

355
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,680
If it really is,

356
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,210
what should I do?

357
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:45,649
(Lawyer Ko)

358
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,879
(I checked through the motel, but he disappeared without a trace.)

359
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,150
(I got a man to find him, so we'll soon know his whereabouts.)

360
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,039
Therefore, I do not have the answer...

361
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,539
you need to find.

362
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,109
Take courage, face your sin,

363
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,220
and look into your heart.

364
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,789
That is where the answer lies.

365
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,089
All right. Now I should check...

366
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,730
where our curse came from...

367
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,230
and what result awaits us.

368
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,009
My men are summoned together this time,

369
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,079
so even though it's the infamous Do Ha,

370
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,750
he won't survive.

371
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,279
Because allies' swords and arrows...

372
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,549
are scarier.

373
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,819
And I will allow you to cut the neck...

374
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,859
of the dead Do Ha.

375
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:04,460
Then,

376
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,200
you will also be satisfied.

377
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,970
How do you feel?

378
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,539
Do you like my present...

379
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:16,839
for your wedding?

380
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,119
Why is my new bride's face...

381
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,259
shaded with worry?

382
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,589
Your face seems more worried...

383
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,460
than mine.

384
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,900
Are you not even nervous?

385
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,900
It is your first marriage night.

386
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,710
You take care of yourself, Master.

387
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,309
On the first marriage night,

388
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,579
the groom is usually more nervous.

389
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,980
You did not know about it.

390
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:01,920
Dear husband.

391
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,890
Many people will see you from now on.

392
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,759
Can you call me like that?

393
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:23,740
When you say such a thing,

394
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,519
you should smile...

395
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,220
like this.

396
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:43,329
Not with the gloomy face.

397
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,470
No matter what kind of fiery pit it is,

398
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:55,710
if you are with me,

399
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,210
I will be okay.

400
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,980
No.

401
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:06,019
I am going to end the fiery pit you are in.

402
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:11,190
Only I deserve to live in the fiery pit.

403
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,359
Get rid of Do Ha as soon as you go to war.

404
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,529
You shall not make any mistake.

405
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,960
- Yes, Lord So. - Yes, Lord So.

406
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,130
Good.

407
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:26,000
But can we trust that girl?

408
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,169
A desire for vengeance is...

409
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,709
one of the most extreme and strongest desires.

410
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,009
A mere loving heart...

411
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,480
cannot beat it.

412
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,980
Do Ha brought everything upon himself.

413
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:45,519
A dog should not have disobeyed his master's order.

414
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:02,170
I will bring the drinks and snacks for my husband myself.

415
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,769
Yes, go ahead.

416
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,809
Which room is that for?

417
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,690
Lord So is also drinking to celebrate the marriage.

418
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,960
Did you taste them for poison?

419
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,759
Well. His guards are supposed to do it, instead.

420
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,759
You do not have enough, then.

421
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,700
Bring some more.

422
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,769
Yes, my lady.

423
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,779
This medicine will hinder his body's mobility.

424
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,619
It is colorless and odorless. The effects will kick in...

425
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,220
at dawn.

426
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:57,329
Put it in the drink...

427
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,400
Do Ha will drink tonight.

428
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,400
We have to take measures in advance.

429
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,970
Do Ha cannot be...

430
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,670
fighting well in the war.

431
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,180
Who is it?

432
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,900
As long as you are alive,

433
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,829
Master will risk his life...

434
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,339
and kill others endlessly to protect me.

435
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,109
In the end, he will be killed by you.

436
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,380
How dare you...

437
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:32,250
No, you will die first!

438
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:39,059
Are you not ashamed to see your parents...

439
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,518
who was butchered by Do Ha, witch?

440
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,089
I will take the responsibility for abandoning the filial piety!

441
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,299
You!

442
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,539
That feeling...

443
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,839
That feeling...

444
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,609
will come back...

445
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,650
to haunt you.

446
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,680
For a thousand times...

447
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:11,519
or ten thousand times, I will be born again...

448
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,460
and...

449
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,889
find...

450
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,559
you...

451
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,670
again...

452
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:29,840
and again.

453
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,639
Lord Do Ha, we have captured the killer.

454
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:28,119
This witch killed Lord So!

455
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,029
A servant was passing nearby...

456
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,829
and saw her at the crime scene herself.

457
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,030
Yes. I heard a loud noise, so I went there.

458
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,269
Blood was everywhere.

459
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,369
There is no need for a witness.

460
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,340
Because I killed Lord So.

461
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,949
Did you really kill him?

462
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,219
This was the only way...

463
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,789
to save you.

464
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,869
I was ready to die when I did it.

465
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,840
So, I will take the punishment.

466
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:30,150
You were ready to die.

467
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,559
I will give you the punishment.

468
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,300
She is my wife.

469
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,429
Make way.

470
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,170
I am...

471
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,469
the head...

472
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,920
of the family now.

473
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:34,650
Lord Do Ha.

474
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,050
She is a murderer who killed Lord So.

475
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,559
Do you think I am asking for your permission?

476
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,179
I will kill you...

477
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,119
with my next move.

478
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:14,679
Herbalists used this place.

479
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,789
You will be safe here for a while.

480
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:25,729
Why did you do that, Master?

481
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,860
What about you?

482
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,170
Why did you do that?

483
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,300
What were you thinking...

484
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,869
when you did something this reckless?

485
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,570
He planned on using the arrows and swords of your ally...

486
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,940
to kill you in the war.

487
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,309
I could not let you die like that.

488
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,980
You walked into that misery just to protect me...

489
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,319
time and time again already.

490
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,920
I also wanted to protect you at least once!

491
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,789
Everything will be over...

492
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:58,159
once they arrest me.

493
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,769
You do not have to be caught up in this matter.

494
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,099
I was already caught up...

495
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,170
the moment I met you...

496
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,909
and fell in love with you.

497
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,699
I was scared to death,

498
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,130
thinking I might have lost you.

499
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,710
Thinking...

500
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,880
I might regret that night for the rest of my life.

501
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,320
I am sorry...

502
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,090
everything came down to this.

503
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,420
I am sorry...

504
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,130
you had to do something that I should have.

505
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,739
Everything will be all right.

506
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:19,679
I will make sure it is all right.

507
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,480
I promise.

508
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,670
Where is the murderer?

509
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,340
You cannot go any further before you tell us where she is.

510
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:25,940
I was...

511
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:28,840
on my way to see you.

512
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,039
Master.

513
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,010
- How can this happen? - Look at all these people.

514
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,518
- My goodness. - How can he kill them like this?

515
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:18,489
- Goodness. - He will be cursed forever.

516
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,960
- How can he do this? - Good grief.

517
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:23,859
Lord Do Ha killed all these men?

518
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,359
- Did he really do this? - My gosh.

519
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,929
He killed every single one of them.

520
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,300
- Goodness. - My gosh.

521
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:32,840
Did Lord Do Ha really do this?

522
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,408
His bride killed his father on the night of his wedding.

523
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:38,468
- My goodness. - And he brutally killed them...

524
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,109
just to save a woman like her!

525
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,610
- My goodness. - Honey!

526
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:47,019
How can this happen?

527
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,969
Why did you come outside?

528
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:09,039
It's too dangerous to be around a crowd.

529
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:11,809
Are you hurt?

530
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:15,110
This is not a big deal.

531
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,309
I found some food. Let us go.

532
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:30,630
(Wanted for Murder)

533
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:42,739
(Wanted for Murder)

534
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:50,848
No.

535
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,409
He cannot tell the royal forces about us.

536
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:55,250
I would rather get arrested and die than have you do this.

537
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,519
Just go. Hurry.

538
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:04,359
Father!

539
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,130
- What is wrong? - I saw the murderers.

540
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,340
Comb through every single corner!

541
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:22,610
Move faster!

542
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,579
She committed high treason and killed Lord So!

543
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:35,920
Faster! Move faster!

544
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,130
No one is here.

545
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,269
Go that way.

546
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,579
They must have gone far by now.

547
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:08,190
I would love to stay here with you in my arms.

548
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:14,800
But I need a moment to see what they are up to.

549
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,400
Stay put and wait here.

550
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:29,880
We cannot stay on the run forever.

551
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:32,110
I do not care...

552
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,250
how long this lasts,

553
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:38,349
as long as I can keep you safe...

554
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,090
and be with you.

555
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,159
I am...

556
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:48,159
willing...

557
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,099
to do everything.

558
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,840
No.

559
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:00,179
I had...

560
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,679
the wrong idea.

561
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,550
I wanted to save you from this misery,

562
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,289
but we both ended up walking into a worse torment.

563
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:20,260
We cannot call this life.

564
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,570
Let us live.

565
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,710
Let us live together.

566
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,379
We can go to the north.

567
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,090
As I mentioned before,

568
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:45,219
there were villages of Gaya people.

569
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:47,119
We can go there...

570
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,329
and start everything...

571
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,429
from the beginning.

572
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,570
I do not think I can do that.

573
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:09,079
This is my abyss.

574
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,059
Then...

575
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:29,500
I shall...

576
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,670
accompany you to the abyss.

577
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,690
You have a high fever.

578
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,559
You cannot go on like this.

579
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:04,969
I better kill everyone before we go on our way.

580
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:06,369
Master.

581
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:12,010
Most of them were older men who had never fought wars.

582
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,710
Do not worry.

583
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,849
I will be back soon.

584
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:45,840
It is belated,

585
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,980
but we must end this wrongful love.

586
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,150
As long as we are together,

587
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:04,489
we will never be freed from this sin.

588
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,199
I thought there would come a day for me to live like a decent man.

589
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,969
But it was a dream...

590
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,909
I could not achieve as long as I lived.

591
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,780
You...

592
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,809
may be able...

593
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,550
to end my misery.

594
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,989
Master.

595
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,969
I love you, Master.

596
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:40,690
I really killed you.

597
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:43,090
I was the one...

598
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,260
who killed you, Do Ha.

599
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,070
I want to know...

600
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:55,300
How I died.

601
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:57,769
That's the only way I can leave this place.

602
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:00,380
The pain was...

603
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,079
just unfathomable.

604
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:10,650
The one who put you in misery for 1,500 years...

605
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:12,750
was me.

606
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:15,360
Everything took place...

607
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:18,329
because of my karma.

608
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,960
I need to find a way...

609
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,429
to keep Young Hwa safe before my power grows weaker.

610
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,780
(Lawyer Ko)

611
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:22,019
You're up.

612
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,900
What's wrong?

613
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,550
I'm sorry.

614
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,949
Why are you suddenly...

615
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:51,320
I'm sorry.

616
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:09,400
Han Jun O, you punk.

617
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:12,170
Why won't you pick up your phone?

618
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,110
Darn it.

619
00:56:14,111 --> 00:56:16,210
The call cannot be connected. You will be redirected to...

620
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,280
There was no need to look for Seok Chul Hwan.

621
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,848
He had been lurking around your home all along.

622
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:23,179
(I found Seok Chul Hwan! No, there was no need to look...)

623
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,219
(Han Jun O)

624
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,599
I already made it clear in the past, didn't I?

625
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,440
Those feelings would end up dragging you down.

626
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:43,300
You will suffer...

627
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:45,670
from the same exact pain I experienced.

628
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,320
Did you have a dream?

629
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:08,599
I killed you...

630
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:13,099
with my two hands.

631
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:19,869
You went through so much trouble to find out why you died,

632
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,840
and it was me.

633
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:37,760
- Hey, wait. - My gosh.

634
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,029
You surprised me.

635
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,300
Wait, you're wasting money.

636
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,030
Come on out.

637
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,598
I'm sorry. I'll come back next time.

638
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,840
I'm sorry. I'll be back!

639
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:39,750
(Moon in the Day)

640
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:42,360
I don't think I can stay with you anymore...

641
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,289
now that I know the whole truth.

642
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,030
He said you didn't have to find him,

643
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,500
as the father would come by to see his son.

644
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,860
What?

645
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,070
How shall I kill that girl in this life?

646
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:54,300
Why did you do that?

647
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,340
Just accept it.

648
00:58:56,869 --> 00:58:59,210
We'll only end up in tragedy.

649
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:02,380
I swore to destroy every life you live!

650
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:04,880
Die, Young Hwa.

651
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,280
No, Young Hwa!
