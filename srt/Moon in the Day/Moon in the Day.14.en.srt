1
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,019
(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,049
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,050
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,050
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

5
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:56,719
(Kang Young Hwa's 30th Birthday!)

6
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,000
Come on.

7
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:39,330
Have you been staring at me?

8
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,569
I wanted to be the first to congratulate you.

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,080
Happy birthday,

10
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,679
Young Hwa.

11
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,250
Thank you.

12
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,390
This is the best present.

13
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,789
- Really? - Yes.

14
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,119
In that case,

15
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,289
I can just skip the present, right?

16
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:08,160
No way.

17
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,269
I'm going to pick something really expensive for my birthday.

18
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,900
You better be ready.

19
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:16,799
Okay.

20
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,639
In a little bit.

21
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,199
(Moon in the Day)

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,470
It's so pretty.

23
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,139
What's on your mind?

24
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:58,949
I was hoping time would stop.

25
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:04,019
This moment is so perfect that I won't mind even if time stops.

26
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,549
We have a little more to go until perfection.

27
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,160
Right.

28
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,190
Things will become perfect only after midnight.

29
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,259
Will you promise me one thing?

30
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,960
Yes?

31
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,840
It probably won't happen,

32
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,840
but when something dangerous happens,

33
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,380
you have to put yourself first.

34
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,650
What are you talking about? "Put yourself first?"

35
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:33,979
No matter what happens,

36
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,250
you have to focus on saving yourself.

37
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,019
That's how we're going to win.

38
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,720
Okay?

39
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,460
I'll focus on saving myself for our sake.

40
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,000
But I'll think of you too.

41
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,930
If we live, we have to live together.

42
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,000
So promise me.

43
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,210
No matter what happens, you also have to focus on surviving...

44
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,109
for me.

45
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Okay.

46
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,960
What's wrong? Did you see something?

47
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,530
What? No, it's nothing. Let's go.

48
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:21,830
Okay.

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,830
(Episode 14)

50
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,710
- We're here. Don't mention it. - Thank you!

51
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,679
- Are you hungry? - Totally.

52
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:37,539
Let's hurry inside and eat.

53
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,150
The day will pass in the blink of an eye. Don't worry.

54
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:49,160
If...

55
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,829
Seok Chul Hwan shows up today,

56
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,629
leave this place immediately.

57
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,929
By if, do you mean...

58
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,700
You think Mr. Seok will be here?

59
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,239
No matter how urgent it is, make sure you drive safely.

60
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,510
Okay?

61
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,910
Why do you say it as if you won't come with us?

62
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,009
Hurry up! We have to throw her a birthday party!

63
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,210
We're coming.

64
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,249
Stop worrying over nothing and come along.

65
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,879
- Ta-Da. - Gosh.

66
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,749
My gosh.

67
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:52,049
All right.

68
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,688
One, two, one, two, three, four.

69
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,819
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

70
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,058
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

71
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,858
Happy birthday, dear Young Hwa

72
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:03,400
Happy birthday... What?

73
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,970
Can't you take a hint?

74
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,070
Ignore him and pick up from "Dear Young Hwa." Okay?

75
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,210
One, two, one, two, three, four.

76
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:15,609
Happy birthday, dear Young Hwa

77
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,350
Happy birthday to you

78
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:25,619
Congratulations!

79
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:28,419
Happy birthday!

80
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:34,559
This is the best birthday of my life.

81
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,160
Thank you, everyone.

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,700
Let me make a wish.

83
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,510
I wish the four of us...

84
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,939
can come together next year and spend this day.

85
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:57,679
Let me blow out the candles.

86
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,299
What was that? Why did these suddenly blow out?

87
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,650
(Kim Sung Hak)

88
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:53,510
Na Yeon.

89
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,390
Do you remember my words?

90
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,859
You have to focus on yourself for us to win.

91
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,859
Don't get hurt.

92
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,270
It's all right. Go out through the back door.

93
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,190
You suddenly disappeared into a mountain cabin,

94
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,259
so I almost lost you.

95
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,550
Go. Hurry up and go.

96
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,889
Yoon Je!

97
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,320
Mr. Jang!

98
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:18,989
Mr. Jang.

99
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,100
Move him.

100
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,470
I should have ended this ages ago.

101
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,269
This was belated.

102
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,749
Move aside.

103
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,749
I have...

104
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,619
no time to deal with someone like you.

105
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,430
- The key. - It's not there?

106
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,529
He doesn't have the key, Young Hwa.

107
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,600
Stay here with Mr. Jang.

108
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,570
Young Hwa!

109
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,960
Stand up. Let's go.

110
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:41,170
Yoon Je.

111
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,710
Kang Young Hwa!

112
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,989
You can never escape from me!

113
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:42,200
Na Yeon.

114
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,129
Mr. Han.

115
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:45,970
Where's Young Hwa?

116
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,989
Na Yeon.

117
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,989
Make sure you take him to a hospital.

118
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,629
- But Young Hwa... - I'll go.

119
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,399
Take him to a hospital.

120
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:20,629
Mr. Han!

121
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,269
Kang Young Hwa.

122
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,379
This isn't the time for you to run away like this.

123
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,350
Do you still have no idea...

124
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:34,850
what will happen...

125
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,519
if you stay alive after tonight?

126
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,820
Yes, Kang Young Hwa.

127
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,129
Feel free to disappear as you wish,

128
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,729
for you'll never see Do Ha again.

129
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,869
Mr. Han!

130
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:29,139
Hang in there, Mr. Han!

131
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,739
You no longer have any protection.

132
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,790
Run away. Quickly.

133
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:53,960
Go!

134
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:17,720
That's enough.

135
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,590
I'll see you in your next life.

136
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,999
Why do you try so hard to protect her?

137
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,269
You know you'll also disappear.

138
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,239
What is he talking about?

139
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,139
Listen to me, Young Hwa.

140
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,180
I stayed by your side for the last 1,500 years...

141
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,220
just...

142
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,190
to keep you safe.

143
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,989
To do that,

144
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,639
we must go our separate ways.

145
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,310
Once I disappear,

146
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:52,249
Do Ha no longer has a reason to exist.

147
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,879
What do you think?

148
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,019
Do you still wish to live?

149
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,590
It's almost time.

150
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:05,729
I just need to hold out a little longer.

151
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,830
No. No, don't go.

152
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,800
No, right?

153
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,750
It's all right.

154
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,459
You will live a good life...

155
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,129
even without me.

156
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,030
You...

157
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,070
always kept that promise very well.

158
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,639
Cut it out!

159
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:53,369
What promise?

160
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,679
No, please.

161
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,230
She continues to reincarnate...

162
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,369
because my revenge is still not over.

163
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,510
No.

164
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,409
It was because you did not die in my hands.

165
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,379
I should have done this 1,500 years ago.

166
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,859
I'm finally ending it.

167
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:55,540
You are also such a fool.

168
00:18:57,699 --> 00:18:59,109
In the end,

169
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,550
you also lost her forever.

170
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,340
No.

171
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,250
What would I do without you?

172
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,909
What would I do by myself?

173
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,889
I will always be by your side.

174
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,830
So, do not cry.

175
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,909
Of all the misfortunes that I chose,

176
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,619
you were the luckiest thing that happened to me.

177
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:57,459
Don't leave me.

178
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,699
On the day...

179
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,830
when Young Hwa's tears ran down like rain,

180
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,600
for the 1st time in 1,500 years,

181
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,040
I fell asleep.

182
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,679
And...

183
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,080
I saw the time I met you as if I were in a dream.

184
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,929
I saw the moment you who came to kill me...

185
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,030
Stay alive.

186
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,429
Whatever it takes.

187
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,770
became the only reason for me to live.

188
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:49,909
The moment I met you...

189
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,280
as Kang Young Hwa after seeing so many deaths of you.

190
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,429
I won't ask you to stay with me forever.

191
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,859
Can you just...

192
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,869
stay with me a little longer?

193
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,869
The moments I realized that what I believed as grudge...

194
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,409
was in fact, my longing for you.

195
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,408
And by seeing the dream-like moments...

196
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:31,050
that we finally got to spend together, I realized this.

197
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,889
My long life was unfortunate sometimes,

198
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,359
but by meeting you,

199
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,659
I was...

200
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,030
finally...

201
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,399
filled with happiness.

202
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:53,240
No.

203
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:55,609
No.

204
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:14,459
You can't go.

205
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:15,760
You can't leave me.

206
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,830
You can't leave.

207
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,439
No.

208
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,290
No.

209
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:09,649
The moon is up.

210
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,689
Because the sun is so bright,

211
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,290
the moon cannot be seen...

212
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,260
even though it is up there.

213
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,060
Right.

214
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:27,600
The moon is also up during the day, of course.

215
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,639
It's just invisible.

216
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,469
Being invisible...

217
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,580
does not mean it does not exist.

218
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,439
Just like you?

219
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:43,750
Yes. Just like me.

220
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,719
But...

221
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,290
wouldn't you be so lonely...

222
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,530
when no one knows you are here together?

223
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,230
It is okay.

224
00:24:58,459 --> 00:24:59,570
Because...

225
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,240
there is someone who will always remember me.

226
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,609
Now,

227
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,609
I will not be lonely.

228
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,379
Just like the moon up there,

229
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,719
I will always be with you.

230
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:24,959
Whenever.

231
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,490
Wherever.

232
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,270
I love you, Young Hwa.

233
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,770
I love you too.

234
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,250
I didn't realize back then...

235
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:52,179
that his especially warm confession of love...

236
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,250
and the bright smile...

237
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,719
were his goodbye.

238
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:42,639
Are you awake? You were unconscious the whole time.

239
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,070
Are you all right?

240
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
Yes.

241
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,510
What about the others?

242
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:54,080
Yoon Je and Mr. Han...

243
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,949
are busy with Jun O's funeral.

244
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,770
Just like that, our time came to an end.

245
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,310
And then,

246
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:23,840
a true miracle...

247
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,980
no one expected has begun.

248
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,530
What do you mean? He disappeared?

249
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,270
Jun O isn't in the mortuary?

250
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,300
Again?

251
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,179
What?

252
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:12,260
Young Hwa.

253
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,629
Jun O...

254
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
came back alive.

255
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,659
Did you really come back alive?

256
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:49,929
Young Hwa.

257
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:21,030
Thank you for coming back.

258
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,159
Thank you so much.

259
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,649
Who are you?

260
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,850
Do you know me?

261
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:57,129
As soon as Jun O becomes all right,

262
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,800
I will contact you.

263
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,340
This is great, Mr. Han.

264
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,240
I'm so relieved.

265
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,629
Here, sir.

266
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:41,040
It might be for the best.

267
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:44,780
Get me a new phone, please.

268
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,480
Yes, I will.

269
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:50,780
But he still doesn't remember anything, right?

270
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,119
Like all the incidents until now and Young Hwa.

271
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,689
No, he doesn't.

272
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,530
Dr. Choi diagnosed him with memory loss,

273
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:05,629
so let's wait a bit more until his memory returns.

274
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:09,639
Should I say this is a good thing?

275
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,669
(The purest and the softest basic skin care)

276
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:05,619
("Nakrang: The Romance," Premières in August)

277
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,260
(1 year later)

278
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,030
(The halted story begins again.)

279
00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:14,169
("Nakrang: The Romance")

280
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:20,070
(Han Jun O, let's go.)

281
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,209
Mr. Han.

282
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,209
He's done with anticancer therapy too?

283
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,020
We should look closer,

284
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,619
but the doctor said it was cured clearly.

285
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,918
Thanks for waiting.

286
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,389
Don't mention it.

287
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,659
I'm just glad that filming the drama wasn't cancelled.

288
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,888
What a relief he recovered from it...

289
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:41,790
while we got the new main female character.

290
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
That's what I mean.

291
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,569
- Please clear out of the way. - It's Jun O.

292
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,840
- Jun O! - Congratulations on your recovery.

293
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,239
- Congratulations. - We're so glad you feel fine now.

294
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,510
- Jun O! - Please let us through.

295
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,839
That way.

296
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,849
- Be careful. - Thank you.

297
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,909
Let's go, Jun O!

298
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,980
Congratulations on your recovery from the cancer.

299
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:07,618
I'm worried if you push yourself too hard.

300
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:10,118
The scandal with Yi Seul was also simply faded.

301
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:12,789
Could you say something to your fans who are still wondering?

302
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,459
What's your future plan?

303
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,958
He came back here after a long fight.

304
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:20,128
Please, don't push him so hard.

305
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:21,199
People say...

306
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,409
disappointment in love makes one stronger.

307
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:33,679
We're here today to cheer each other.

308
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:39,119
I believe words of blessing will be more helpful than cursing, right?

309
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:41,290
What's he talking about?

310
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:42,959
He must be joking.

311
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,230
This is the so-called perfect casting!

312
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,740
We are getting through.

313
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:05,679
All messed up! What should I do?

314
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,480
Was I okay? Didn't I look like stupid?

315
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,219
It's because I haven't been to such a place for a while.

316
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,190
He's undoubtedly the Jun O I know.

317
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,960
What was your way of speaking just before?

318
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,059
I have no clue. I just said it.

319
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,159
I was so charismatic, right?

320
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
I guess my acting skills got better...

321
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:28,100
due to the suffering from the cancer!

322
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,900
Right?

323
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,710
It might be the trace he left on him.

324
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:36,009
Who I'm talking to?

325
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,339
Sorry? No, it's nothing.

326
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,509
Change your clothes. People are waiting.

327
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,119
Anyway, who is Young Hwa?

328
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:50,290
- Sorry? - I recall the name...

329
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,719
whenever I wake up.

330
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,428
That is...

331
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,929
She's not important to you.

332
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,069
This is about the memory...

333
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,500
I lost a year ago, right?

334
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,969
You've gone through well until now.

335
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,178
Why are you wondering about it now?

336
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:11,880
At least you should tell me now.

337
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,009
Hear me out. After I opened my eyes,

338
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,749
Tae Ju was dead.

339
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,849
And people say Lawyer Ko is in jail because of that.

340
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,480
But Mr. Seok ordered all of these.

341
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:20,989
And there's Young Hwa.

342
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,589
So what is going on?

343
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,889
Let's say we had no time because of my anticancer treatment.

344
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,460
But you should tell me now.

345
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:34,929
Jun O.

346
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:39,069
There's a proper reason when you can't remember something.

347
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,610
If you do want to know, you will figure it out.

348
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,650
Come out when you're ready. We will wait outside.

349
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,580
How you...

350
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,290
Goodness.

351
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,489
Thank you.

352
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,790
What brought you in this time? You said there was a party.

353
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,429
I ran out of it.

354
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,360
Because Jun O brought up the topic of Young Hwa.

355
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,798
He remembers her?

356
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:11,799
No.

357
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,569
He says the name just hovers.

358
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,580
Sometimes, he speaks as if he were in a historical drama.

359
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,980
All of this...

360
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:25,419
You scared me!

361
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,790
He can't remember her.

362
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:30,690
So,

363
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:33,630
how's it going with Young Hwa?

364
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,429
I haven't heard anything about her for ages.

365
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,500
Nothing much.

366
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,670
I see.

367
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,799
It must be very tough for her.

368
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,239
She suffered from the sad farewell.

369
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,009
Speaking of her,

370
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,449
she's doing so well.

371
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,909
Even better than before.

372
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Sorry?

373
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:04,560
Let's have dinner together too.

374
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,529
What do you like, Young Hwa?

375
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,199
I'm a humble woman.

376
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:13,900
Pasta will do enough.

377
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,009
Who dared to park this darn car here?

378
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,138
Parking is not allowed within 5m of the firefighting facility.

379
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:25,710
You don't know this, you fool?

380
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,479
These stupid idiots should be...

381
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,650
I should take a photo and report this.

382
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,020
It's my car.

383
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,520
- It was yours? - Yes, it's mine.

384
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,360
I see.

385
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,159
One.

386
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,060
- Sorry! - Two.

387
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,568
As Na Yeon said,

388
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:50,339
I was doing well.

389
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,540
- He's inside. - Yes.

390
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,540
- Dong Jun. - A while after he left,

391
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:57,909
I got back to working as a firefighter.

392
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:00,350
- It's okay now. - Let's see.

393
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:01,710
Wait a second.

394
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,850
I spent every day...

395
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,889
- as normal as possible. - You were like that last year.

396
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,719
("The Shining Hello")

397
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:15,360
"As you guys are opposed to it,"

398
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:17,359
"I should not follow the king's command?"

399
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,500
"That is what it means?"

400
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,469
"As you guys..." My goodness.

401
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:27,639
Why is it so hard?

402
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,949
"As you guys..."

403
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,159
What's this?

404
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,139
("Interpretation of Dreams")

405
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,610
You don't say anything even after seeing these?

406
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,880
This woman is Young Hwa, right?

407
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:10,380
The woman who hugged me at the funeral.

408
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:13,080
Why did she...

409
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:20,330
One year ago,

410
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,900
she worked as your bodyguard.

411
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,569
My bodyguard?

412
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:28,799
She's back working as a firefighter now.

413
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,799
She saved you when you had the accident...

414
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,909
at the Han River.

415
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:38,540
Apologize, Jun O.

416
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,150
Oh, the woman...

417
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,719
who folded my arm like this?

418
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,989
She saved your life.

419
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,020
You're here now, thanks to her.

420
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:53,659
I see.

421
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,860
But like I told you before,

422
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,359
she means nothing to do now.

423
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,429
That's not true.

424
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,299
If that's the case, she means something to me.

425
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,569
I felt like I was dying of pain when receiving the anticancer treatment.

426
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,610
Do you know how desperately I wanted to give up?

427
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,310
But every time I felt that way,

428
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:12,909
I felt as if the voice inside me told this to me.

429
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,179
"Don't give up."

430
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:18,980
"How desperately you've been through this all."

431
00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:20,790
"You must survive."

432
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:25,690
A guy like me held on until the last moment...

433
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,630
for the first time in my life.

434
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,460
If she was the one who helped me come this far,

435
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,330
I want to meet her once.

436
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,900
Because I want to tell her something.

437
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:20,110
(Mr. Han Min O)

438
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,770
Did you...

439
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,639
put up a lotus lantern for me?

440
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,719
Excuse me.

441
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,739
You're the one, aren't you?

442
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:29,779
It's been a while. How have you been?

443
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:34,889
Well,

444
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:39,219
what do you think?

445
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,529
It took so long for us to meet.

446
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,799
I mean,

447
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:48,369
we looked like a couple in that photo.

448
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,270
Was there something...

449
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,000
between us?

450
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:56,310
I was just one of your fans.

451
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,449
And we grew closer as I worked as your bodyguard.

452
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,880
That's all.

453
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,449
But you said that you weren't a fan at the time.

454
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,389
I only came as Mr. Han suggested that I meet you.

455
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:14,889
I hope I answered your question.

456
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:17,699
Well, then.

457
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,860
Ms. Kang.

458
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,540
At least...

459
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,239
I have a reason to talk to you.

460
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,440
So hear me out.

461
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,190
The new drama is...

462
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:43,860
an extremely...

463
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,190
important opportunity for me.

464
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:49,359
But I speak in a strange way out of nowhere...

465
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,900
or suddenly think about you.

466
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,230
My brother says...

467
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,900
that you're the one...

468
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:00,270
who helped me survive.

469
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,009
Is that true?

470
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:08,210
Is that why I'm doing those things?

471
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:11,480
What will you do...

472
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,619
if it's true?

473
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,860
If it is...

474
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:24,900
Today will be the last day that I thank you,

475
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,529
and I'll forget about it.

476
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:31,599
I'd have to live well...

477
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,670
for the person who saved me to think it was worth it.

478
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,440
I've been wondering...

479
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,150
what the story was between us,

480
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:43,449
but I won't wonder about it anymore.

481
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,920
I can't miss the present...

482
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,920
by being haunted by the past.

483
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,258
I'm going to try really hard,

484
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:01,130
so please watch me next time.

485
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,699
So...

486
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:05,239
I came to tell you that.

487
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:14,480
It may be upsetting to hear, but...

488
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,279
Thanks.

489
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,750
It felt like I was lost.

490
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:26,089
I had such a hard time trying to pretend...

491
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,989
that everything was fine in my life.

492
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,400
Now, I realize that I should have stopped pretending...

493
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,069
long ago.

494
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,069
And you're right.

495
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,710
You don't have to thank me anymore after today.

496
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,980
Just live your life.

497
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,179
I think...

498
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,150
that will be good enough for me.

499
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,659
I'll be going, then.

500
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,259
Wait.

501
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,259
You see,

502
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:08,569
I found this at home.

503
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,069
It didn't seem like my handwriting.

504
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,869
I also came to give you this.

505
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:28,089
(To Young Hwa)

506
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:34,860
(To Young Hwa)

507
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,469
Bye.

508
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,949
(To Young Hwa)

509
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:07,730
I'm...

510
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,599
waiting for you to wake up.

511
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,900
(To Young Hwa. I'm waiting for you to wake up.)

512
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,500
Though I can't wait until you open your eyes,

513
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,469
I also want you to take longer to wake up.

514
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:24,779
I want...

515
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,610
this moment to pass very slowly.

516
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,920
As long as I can be by your side forever,

517
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:38,920
even if you don't recognize me for another 1,500 years,

518
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,389
I'd go back...

519
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:47,830
to the very beginning and repeat all of this.

520
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:51,540
But I couldn't...

521
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,210
let you be stuck in a fiery pit where I don't know...

522
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,509
when you'll be killed.

523
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,409
Because the sole purpose of my life...

524
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:04,719
was to protect you.

525
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:09,719
You must move on from the moment when you lost me.

526
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,790
Sometimes, you'll look back.

527
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,400
But leave our memories behind...

528
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,830
and keep living your day to the fullest.

529
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:23,630
You are...

530
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,440
the bravest person that I know of.

531
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:30,909
(Young Hwa's 30th birthday)

532
00:48:36,279 --> 00:48:38,179
I have so many things to say to you,

533
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,319
but I'm afraid I have to stop...

534
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:44,889
as it seems like you'll wake up soon.

535
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,860
I love you,

536
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,069
and I love you,

537
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,940
Young Hwa.

538
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:16,719
Thanks.

539
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,960
This is the best present ever.

540
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:30,799
That was no farewell.

541
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:35,969
It was his wish to see me keep living on...

542
00:49:37,509 --> 00:49:39,909
and his solemn promise to watch over me...

543
00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:41,779
wherever I was.

544
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:48,589
Hey, Young Hwa!

545
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:51,289
It's your birthday. Why are you home so late?

546
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,929
I'm not late. It's not even eight o'clock yet.

547
00:49:57,259 --> 00:49:59,130
I cooked your birthday meal hours ago.

548
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,629
Don't come home so late next time.

549
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,630
My birthday meal?

550
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:04,299
Don't get mad at her on her birthday, though.

551
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,969
What about the people who have been waiting for her?

552
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:09,139
- Is there someone else? - Yes.

553
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,678
Happy birthday, Young Hwa!

554
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:13,139
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

555
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:15,679
Come on up. We're starving.

556
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,980
Hurry!

557
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:21,889
Let's get ready to eat.

558
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,860
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

559
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:27,859
- Happy birthday, dear Young Hwa - Happy birthday, dear Young Hwa

560
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,388
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

561
00:50:29,389 --> 00:50:31,529
"What have I done in my past life?"

562
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,469
We often say that.

563
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,270
But there's no way to find out what sins we've committed...

564
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,569
in our past lives.

565
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:42,039
Come on.

566
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,909
The karma in our lives...

567
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:46,540
are just questions that we face as we live on.

568
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:47,909
Enjoy your food.

569
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,048
As long as you have the courage to face your fault head-on...

570
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,750
(From Han Jun O, your Honorary Firefighter)

571
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:58,889
and a warm heart for others,

572
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:02,989
I have no doubt that you can...

573
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,529
get across this life.

574
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,270
(Wish Lantern Festival)

575
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:13,670
(Until the day I see you again)

576
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:17,810
Living today to the best of my abilities...

577
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,509
as if it were a gift.

578
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:24,420
That's the best way to repay the kindness...

579
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:26,080
to the person who saved you.

580
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:36,589
("Nakrang: The Romance")

581
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,099
Hi, what's your thought on making a comeback?

582
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,269
Tell us!

583
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,270
- Look here, please. - Say a few words.

584
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:46,939
- How does it feel to return? - Please say something.

585
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,339
Please look into the camera.

586
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:50,880
- Hello. - It's nice to see you.

587
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,479
- Let's start. - What a great day.

588
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,509
All right.

589
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:58,480
This opportunity was like a gift and hard to get.

590
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,319
I will do my best to entertain you.

591
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:05,289
I'd like you to wish me good luck.

592
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,419
(The Revived Boyfriend, Han Jun O, returns!)

593
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,428
Thank you.

594
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:08,489
Congratulations.

595
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,459
Congratulations!

596
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,899
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

597
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,929
We'll take a quick photo.

598
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:49,798
(Kang Young Hwa rules!)

599
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:52,298
(- Have a safe trip! - Make sure to put our photos up.)

600
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:53,499
(Right. Don't forget to put up our photos.)

601
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,238
(Good luck in the Antarctic and come back safely.)

602
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,439
(Go, Young Hwa!)

603
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,239
(The Miraculous Firefighter does it, after all. Congrats!)

604
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:05,049
On the flight to the Antarctic,

605
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:08,889
he came to me in my dreams like a present.

606
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,259
The dream from my past...

607
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:15,889
that I wanted to turn back and regretted for so long...

608
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,730
had come to me after so long.

609
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,389
I love you, Master.

610
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:03,810
You have no idea...

611
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:07,179
how much I regretted this moment.

612
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,949
I'll never let go now.

613
00:54:30,529 --> 00:54:32,069
Even if you hold on,

614
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,909
it doesn't change your reality.

615
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,110
I know...

616
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:43,850
that this is only a dream.

617
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,850
But still, even though it's a dream,

618
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,520
I want to change my past decision.

619
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,730
So that we can be together...

620
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:58,529
at least in my dream.

621
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,889
Just like how we were together...

622
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,460
for 1,500 years because of your wish,

623
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:10,869
I hope my earnest wish...

624
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,469
reaches you.

625
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:15,969
So that we can be together...

626
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,250
again in the next life.

627
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,440
They must be on a school trip.

628
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,779
I chose the wrong day.

629
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:28,909
It's so pretty.

630
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:32,949
- Let's go. - Check it out.

631
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:41,330
(Myeongnyundang)

632
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,330
Wait.

633
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:51,869
The moon is up.

634
00:57:58,909 --> 00:57:59,909
Cool.

635
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,080
Are you okay?

636
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,920
Yes.

637
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,290
Thank you.

638
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,619
You could have gotten hurt.

639
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,319
What are you trying to take a picture of in the sky?

640
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:49,429
- The moon. - The moon?

641
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:51,659
But it's the middle of the day.

642
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,730
It's not that way. It's over there.

643
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:57,330
Oh, I see it.

644
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,009
It's beautiful.

645
00:59:22,089 --> 00:59:25,699
(Thank you for watching Moon in the Day.)

646
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,759
