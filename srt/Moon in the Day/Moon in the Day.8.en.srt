1
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,078
(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,079
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,089
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,120
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

5
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,529
(Year 27 of King Sukjong's Reign)

6
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,490
So,

7
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:03,929
this was the year 1701, Han Ri Ta's 11th reincarnation.

8
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:07,469
In other words, the Year 27 of King Sukjong's reign.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,169
There are the words for Royal Noble Consort Huibin Jang.

10
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,640
You have used your wicked magic...

11
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,910
to slander Queen Inhyeon...

12
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:17,948
and committed an unforgivable sin as the mother of the Crown Prince.

13
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:19,009
This is an order...

14
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,379
from His Majesty to rid all of your wicked traces...

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,050
by taking this poison.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,550
You brat.

17
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,119
Do you dare to live after treating me like this?

18
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:31,759
Bring His Majesty here now.

19
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:33,989
I shall see him face to face...

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,699
and protest against this injustice!

21
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,928
What are you doing?

22
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:40,568
Bind the sinner immediately and carry out His Majesty's order.

23
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,270
Let go of me!

24
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:45,209
Let go of me, you brats!

25
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:53,750
Wait.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,850
Does this mean I was Royal Noble Consort Huibin Jang...

27
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:58,789
in my past life?

28
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:04,020
Wait, not her,

29
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,830
but one of the court ladies who delivered the poison?

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,929
Darn it.

31
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:13,530
Why are you disappointed?

32
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,340
I wasn't exactly disappointed.

33
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:20,138
I had lived 18 different lives.

34
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,909
So it was kind of boring...

35
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,579
that I never lived as a renowned historical figure.

36
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,380
Young Hwa,

37
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,280
I didn't know you were that serious about your past lives.

38
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,449
I'm entitled to such curiosity as a human.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,560
On top of that, the living witness of history is standing before me.

40
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,690
While we're on the subject,

41
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,160
by any chance,

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,400
have you ever seen Queen Seondeok in real life?

43
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,738
Who?

44
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,310
Queen Seondeok and Mishil. Don't you know them?

45
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,478
That was a wonderful drama.

46
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,008
When I was alive,

47
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,079
it was the time of King Jinheung's reign.

48
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:03,049
Also, the stories on TV aren't usually accurate.

49
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,750
Was there anyone a little more famous?

50
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,518
You said you've been in this world for 1,500 years.

51
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,160
Don't be so boring.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,989
Young Hwa.

53
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,329
Do you remember...

54
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,139
what you had for dinner a week ago?

55
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,370
No.

56
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,739
I can barely remember what I had yesterday.

57
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,549
That's what 1,500 years mean to me.

58
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,720
They were ordinary days that slipped by me.

59
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,519
I don't remember every detail of those years.

60
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,668
(800, Literature)

61
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,739
You know,

62
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,710
what you just said was inconsistent.

63
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,440
"Inconsistent?"

64
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,019
You said you do not remember every detail of those years.

65
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,019
So, how do you remember...

66
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,549
the day my parents passed?

67
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,258
Was I a little special in your ordinary days...

68
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,229
that slipped by you?

69
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:24,100
Well.

70
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:29,669
I'm thankful that you're willing to dream about Ri Ta and me,

71
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,309
but I don't have much time right now.

72
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,710
Go back to sleep...

73
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:39,150
and dream some more instead of talking nonsense.

74
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:44,549
Do you think I dream of my past life whenever I fall asleep?

75
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,919
And it's not even early evening yet.

76
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,619
Just answer my question.

77
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,830
Then, let me ask you one last question.

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,429
What is it now?

79
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:00,629
The day before Children's Day on May 5, 2001.

80
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,600
Do you remember that day?

81
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,539
It was the Sports Day at school when I was in elementary school.

82
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:10,039
My dad had passed away already,

83
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,478
and my mom was out working.

84
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,350
I was there all alone.

85
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,650
I thought,

86
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,189
"That little girl is crying quite relentlessly."

87
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,890
You really remember everything.

88
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
What's with the chuckle?

89
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:33,100
I was just...

90
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:35,539
a bit thankful.

91
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:41,309
I felt a little less lonely to think...

92
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,710
you were always there with me.

93
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,650
Goodness.

94
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,350
You were mad at me and even called me a stalker before.

95
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,090
Well, you know, I thought about it,

96
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,520
and you felt like my old guardian deity.

97
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,929
To put it in modern terms, someone like Daddy Long Legs...

98
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,929
or Genie of the Lamp.

99
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,229
Maybe that's why...

100
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:10,600
you seem very familiar to me.

101
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,640
Well, anyway. You answered all my questions. Let's go.

102
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,678
I'll get off work early, go to sleep early,

103
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:24,220
and do my best to dream. Don't worry about it.

104
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,419
Let's go.

105
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,660
What are you doing? Come on.

106
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,109
Jun O.

107
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:55,820
Where are you, Jun O?

108
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,049
Jun O!

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Jun O.

110
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:12,129
Jun O, is that you?

111
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,510
Min O.

112
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,909
Help me.

113
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,910
Jun O.

114
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:26,749
Jun O...

115
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,669
- How may I help you? - Well...

116
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:52,339
This is the contract...

117
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,340
for Mr. Jun O's new advertisement.

118
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,679
I looked over the legal matters.

119
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,379
We'll go ahead with this after your approval.

120
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:03,919
Mr. Han?

121
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,549
Halt every single gig...

122
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,760
he had planned for the future.

123
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,058
All of a sudden? Why?

124
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,960
I'll pay as much compensation as I must.

125
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,799
So do it.

126
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:19,400
Okay.

127
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,369
By the way, you have...

128
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,340
Mr. Seok Chul Hwan's number, right?

129
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:39,420
Well, you know, I thought about it,

130
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:42,090
and you felt like my old guardian deity.

131
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,889
Maybe that's why...

132
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,259
you seem very familiar to me.

133
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,129
I felt quite bad.

134
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,139
What if...

135
00:08:56,739 --> 00:09:00,540
you and Ri Ta met in a different time and setting?

136
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,720
(Moon in the Day)

137
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,229
(Episode 8)

138
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,659
What's wrong? Did you have another nightmare?

139
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,129
I had such a good night's sleep.

140
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:28,800
What?

141
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,039
I slept so well that I didn't even dream.

142
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,580
I recently dreamt so well whenever I closed my eyes.

143
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,950
It wasn't like I had that dream every day.

144
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,249
I guess yesterday wasn't the dream night.

145
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,190
It seems like people go a little crazy when they're in love.

146
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:51,689
What are you saying?

147
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,089
You talked as if you'd never see him again,

148
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,590
but you went back to work at his place.

149
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,229
What happened between you two?

150
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Na Yeon.

151
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,569
By any chance, do you believe in past life?

152
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,639
Why?

153
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,339
Do you think your love...

154
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,279
with Jun O began in your previous lives?

155
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,050
What?

156
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,180
Well, what I'm trying to say is this.

157
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,550
People say we sometimes dream of our past lives.

158
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,090
Do you want to hear a funny story?

159
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,190
When people have these past life experiences,

160
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,229
they all claim to have been a princess or a prince.

161
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:30,898
How can this tiny country be filled with the royal family?

162
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,599
I never said I was the princess, but a daughter...

163
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,729
- of the Great Gaya's general. - Exactly.

164
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,639
If everyone was the royal family and the noble,

165
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,670
who on earth farmed for food?

166
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,180
Yesterday, I was so sure that I'd dream.

167
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,590
If I told him I didn't dream at all,

168
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,659
he'd definitely have a go at me.

169
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,970
Excuse me.

170
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,180
I'm here.

171
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,350
Is he still asleep?

172
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,389
Right.

173
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,690
You must've taken a shower.

174
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,759
- Please continue. - Did you have a dream?

175
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,729
You should finish showering.

176
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,930
Let's talk over a cup of morning coffee.

177
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,070
The weather's so nice.

178
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,320
What's he doing? He's looking at me with eyes that say...

179
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,060
he'll end my life if I say I didn't have any dreams.

180
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,430
If you had enough coffee, tell me...

181
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:08,759
about the dream you had today.

182
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,129
I had just one sip.

183
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,310
Hey, may I ask you a question?

184
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,539
Do you still have more questions?

185
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,310
This is about you.

186
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:25,979
Why are you in such a rush?

187
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:28,009
What?

188
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,350
I mean, think about it.

189
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,619
Well, 1,501 years isn't too far off from 1,500 years and 6 months.

190
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,759
I'd have the dream anyway, so you could just relax and wait.

191
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,759
Do you wish to leave this world that quickly?

192
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,060
That's not because of me. It's you.

193
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,029
Because of me?

194
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:48,540
What do you mean?

195
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,479
Young Hwa, you have no idea...

196
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,509
what fate holds for you.

197
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,379
I'm your poltergeist.

198
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,320
I'm saying I want to undo this curse as soon as I can...

199
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:08,560
and leave your side.

200
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,119
I'm sure this situation...

201
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,658
isn't too favorable for you.

202
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,659
Well, that's true.

203
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,970
If that answer is good enough,

204
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,430
tell me about your dream.

205
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,970
How far did you get?

206
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,009
Well.

207
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,139
In my dream,

208
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:35,149
you and Ri Ta...

209
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,350
ended up running away.

210
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,149
Then, you two were caught.

211
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,930
After that, you two were forced to marry.

212
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,300
That was when...

213
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,300
- Hey, Jun O! - Ms. Jung.

214
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,638
Ms. Jung, please. One second.

215
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,509
- You can't just barge in here... - Move aside.

216
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,609
You two are here together,

217
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,279
which makes me even angrier.

218
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,179
Why are you so dramatic this early?

219
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,889
You were the one who caused this drama.

220
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,759
What's all this?

221
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,190
What do you think?

222
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,330
Han Jun O, who officially announced his relationship with Jung Yi Seul,

223
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:26,599
was seen having an affair with A, a woman who's a nobody.

224
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,869
Those photos prove that claim.

225
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:31,769
What are you talking about?

226
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,608
"Fact Catch" sent...

227
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:35,979
those photos to confirm before they released an article.

228
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,180
I told them that you were his bodyguard,

229
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,080
not just a random woman.

230
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:45,090
But they continued to say all kinds of things like...

231
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,749
how you two were living together, and you were pregnant.

232
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,960
That's nonsense.

233
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,289
I'll go tell them this isn't true.

234
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,290
Go ahead and try.

235
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,960
They hid in front of his house for a month to get this evidence.

236
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,029
Do you think they'll care about what you have to say?

237
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:02,139
Jun O, you tell me.

238
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,840
What are you going to do?

239
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,069
It's best to just ignore false rumors.

240
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,139
You don't have to mind it.

241
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,249
I'm the one who suffers the most once this article gets released.

242
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,079
People will go on and on...

243
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,619
about how I lost my man to some nobody.

244
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,149
What about the damage this will cause me?

245
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,460
You should let her go.

246
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,529
Young Hwa and I have something to discuss.

247
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,129
Hey, will you continue to behave like this?

248
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,368
If you continue to do this,

249
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:33,800
I won't just sit on my hands, okay?

250
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,670
Then?

251
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,239
I'll make sure...

252
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:41,940
your bodyguard is branded...

253
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,440
as the worst witch of the century who stole a man who was taken.

254
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:46,649
You know that I can do it.

255
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,820
You're way over the line.

256
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,420
Are you threatening him?

257
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,190
That's correct.

258
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,889
If you add up Jun O's fans and my fans, it's about 300,000.

259
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,899
Try getting attacked by them.

260
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,999
Wait, you've been through this.

261
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,269
Do you remember the people who came to the fire station?

262
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,739
This time, it'll be on a whole another level.

263
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,909
You can try to protect yourself.

264
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,540
Wait.

265
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,249
What?

266
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,889
You couldn't care less about my problem.

267
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,690
But you can't stand to see her get hurt, can you?

268
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,029
Be straight with me...

269
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,729
and tell me what you want.

270
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:36,460
What do I have to do?

271
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,700
Your hands are a bit rigid.

272
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,040
This is nice.

273
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,409
Cut.

274
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:53,550
We'll check the photos.

275
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,019
Do I look good?

276
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,550
Wait, Yi Seul.

277
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:02,790
This side looks better on screen.

278
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,430
You should probably turn your head this way.

279
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,559
You heard her. Come closer, Jun O.

280
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,859
I need to show this side.

281
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,569
- We'll do the second pose now. - Yes.

282
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,609
Please get ready.

283
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,340
Ready.

284
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Action.

285
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,980
Smile. If you don't, we'll do this again tomorrow.

286
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,990
Is this how things are usually done?

287
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,790
Most paparazzi shots are staged.

288
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,560
This is how we usually negotiate.

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,128
It was a huge relief...

290
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,270
that we negotiated to delete your pictures.

291
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,600
"Fact Catch" also knows...

292
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,139
the story of a star couple sells much better...

293
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,679
than Jun O's love story with a nameless woman.

294
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,480
The photos must look great too.

295
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,290
She is...

296
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,188
absolutely impolite...

297
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:12,260
and arrogant.

298
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,399
She's still the most popular actress in Korea.

299
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:19,869
There was nothing to complain about when it came to her looks.

300
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,100
Why is that important right now?

301
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,509
I'm saying...

302
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,780
you and she make a perfect couple by your looks.

303
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:36,649
An ordinary woman A, namely, me, has nothing on her.

304
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,090
That's not what I think.

305
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,830
Don't ghosts have eyes?

306
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,359
Han Ri Ta was...

307
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,270
a beauty everyone knew about...

308
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:54,699
in all of Seorabeol and Gaya.

309
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,139
And you are...

310
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,969
the only one who has the same face...

311
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,040
among many of her reincarnations.

312
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:14,949
(Seoul Gieun Police Station)

313
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,229
Captain! I found him.

314
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,330
The man found in the CCTV footage of the TV station's parking garage.

315
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,259
I looked up the criminal records of every single person...

316
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,428
Han Jun O was acquainted with.

317
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:26,569
He's the man, right?

318
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,039
I see. Seok Chul Hwan.

319
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,070
Embezzlement, fraud, gambling, illegal drug use...

320
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:34,809
Man, he's a wicked one.

321
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,809
We don't need to look any further. I'll find his location and...

322
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,810
One second.

323
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:39,750
You've reached Inspector Yoon...

324
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,219
The dead body of who?

325
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,949
I'm probably dead...

326
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,659
by the time you're reading this letter.

327
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,689
I was sentenced to death because of you.

328
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,859
It's so unfair.

329
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,230
It's all because of Jun O...

330
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,169
and Min O.

331
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,070
Mr. Han, did you watch the news?

332
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:10,340
I already know.

333
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,820
Let's meet in the fiery pit, Min O.

334
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,439
You heard that I toiled away because of Jun O, right?

335
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:44,209
Mr. Jang is already reporting Jun O's schedule.

336
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,249
What brought you here, Yi Seul?

337
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,679
The "Fact Catch" incident was just temporarily covered.

338
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,590
To fix the incident,

339
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,719
we should find the cause of the incident, shouldn't we?

340
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,520
The cause?

341
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,230
I mean Young Hwa.

342
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:03,500
We should fire her from the bodyguard team.

343
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,770
If the scandal is spread,

344
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:08,869
your company will also be affected.

345
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,020
Why do you give this to me?

346
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,619
Because there's no reason I should keep this from spreading.

347
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:30,490
What the...

348
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:34,129
(Actor Gu Tae Ju's body was found near a river.)

349
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,128
(Actor Gu Tae Ju's body was found near a river.)

350
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,269
According to the Nambu Police Station...

351
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,168
I think you better take care of yourself first...

352
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,938
if you have enough time.

353
00:21:42,939 --> 00:21:44,540
A resident reported to the police.

354
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:46,908
- The police say... - If you still have enough time...

355
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:48,979
- after that, lament for your ex. - he was already dead...

356
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,878
- In the body... - That will help you.

357
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:53,050
The police said they haven't found...

358
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,179
(Pagaju, Gieun Sports Complex)

359
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,889
Mr. Han,

360
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,619
may I ask...

361
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,659
why you are headed to meet Mr. Seok?

362
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,330
Mr. Seok said...

363
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,659
he was the only one who could solve my problem.

364
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,530
You mean the things related to Tae Ju?

365
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,570
Tae Ju?

366
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,240
I mean...

367
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:20,469
I saw it on the news.

368
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,240
They said he killed himself.

369
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:25,209
You better take care of the media.

370
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,149
You should do whatever you can...

371
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,480
to prevent Jun O's name from being mentioned...

372
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,449
related to Tae Ju.

373
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,260
Yes, sir.

374
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,659
You almost scared me.

375
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:45,429
I didn't expect you to come this quick.

376
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,669
Cut the crap.

377
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,600
Let's cut to the chase.

378
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,310
Seeing that you're angry at me...

379
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,679
I guess he got your question wrong.

380
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,619
Are you ready to talk with me now?

381
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:14,459
If you brought me here for nothing,

382
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,799
I won't let you get away with this.

383
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,000
Your brother is...

384
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,030
possessed by an evil spirit.

385
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:26,770
It's an evil...

386
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,368
and very selfish being...

387
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:31,439
who has lived over 1,000 years.

388
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:36,419
It should've been better.

389
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:38,179
An evil spirit?

390
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,389
Were you trying to get money...

391
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,490
for an exorcism or what?

392
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:46,929
Then, you tell me.

393
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,730
What kind of a terminal patient can be like Jun O?

394
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,340
You thought I didn't have any information when approaching you?

395
00:23:58,399 --> 00:23:59,969
I heard there was only one month left for him.

396
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,040
By now, he should not be able to move, no?

397
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,149
For me, he seems more vigorous than before.

398
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,159
You pretended not to know.

399
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,600
I mean his strange tone and cold eyes.

400
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,000
Because you were so desperate to see him even for one more day...

401
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:34,909
Don't assume stupidly.

402
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,708
I just thought he was sick...

403
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,810
His sickness is also because of the evil spirit.

404
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,679
If the spirit leaves him, your brother can survive.

405
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,290
He can survive?

406
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,859
Yes.

407
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:12,310
I know it because I have the same experience as your brother.

408
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,850
This trace is the evidence.

409
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,350
Do you mean all the things you experienced...

410
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,830
are happening exactly the same to Jun O?

411
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:31,358
As I did, Jun O may be...

412
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,730
paying for what he did.

413
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,100
The evil spirit...

414
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,169
finds the person with the biggest sin.

415
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,750
Think carefully.

416
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:49,679
Didn't any of his actions earn the enmity of others?

417
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,949
Don't think my death will solve the problem.

418
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:55,989
I'll curse you all.

419
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,959
Let's meet in the fiery pit, Min O.

420
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,659
Looking at your face,

421
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,600
I guess you got something.

422
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,830
Do you think I will believe your words?

423
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,600
If not,

424
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,540
can you save your brother?

425
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,549
If the spirit in his body is not removed,

426
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,949
you will lose your brother to it forever.

427
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,850
Without doing anything...

428
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,090
when there's a way to save him.

429
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:29,560
That's what you want?

430
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:35,428
I won't cause any trouble,

431
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:38,359
and I'll listen to what you say.

432
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:39,830
Your brother...

433
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,500
only counts on you.

434
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,010
I beg you,

435
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:56,649
Min O.

436
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,750
It's up to you.

437
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,159
I just let you know.

438
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,959
I'm the only one...

439
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,500
who knows how to save him.

440
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,649
You better hurry, Min O.

441
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,379
There's not much time left for us.

442
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:48,369
I will go back to the company.

443
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:49,600
You worked hard today.

444
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,600
- See you. - Yes.

445
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,580
Then, I will leave too.

446
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,510
I think there's still something you need to do.

447
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,189
That's...

448
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,290
I mean...

449
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,060
You didn't have a dream.

450
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:20,070
How did you know that?

451
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:22,230
Your face says it.

452
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,609
It's hard to wait for over 6 months or 1 year.

453
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,139
But I'll wait 1 or 2 days...

454
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,510
as I've already waited...

455
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,649
for over 1,500 years.

456
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,759
If Tae Ju's case is confirmed as a suicide,

457
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,800
the investigation will be ended too.

458
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,070
I came in a hurry, thinking it'd be better to tell you early.

459
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:56,840
There wasn't a murderous look in his eyes.

460
00:28:58,899 --> 00:28:59,939
Gosh.

461
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,480
He wasn't a person who could commit suicide.

462
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,050
Are you sure it was a suicide?

463
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,449
We received his will.

464
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,949
We got his CCTV footage from the post office.

465
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:15,888
It seems he got pessimistic and committed suicide...

466
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:19,159
after being a murder suspect from the top star.

467
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,229
Take your time for the talk.

468
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,030
- Okay. - I will wait outside.

469
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,369
What about the man in the picture?

470
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:32,070
The man appeared at the fire station.

471
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:34,368
Oh, the guy? I guess you also know...

472
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:35,409
Constable Moon.

473
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,980
What do you mean?

474
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:40,080
The guy I know?

475
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,449
That's...

476
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,249
- I mean... - He meant...

477
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,989
We're already investigating it as suicide,

478
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,789
so we don't have to keep looking.

479
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,959
The team that's in charge of the abduction also...

480
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,600
In fact,

481
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,629
the only thing I can tell you at the moment is...

482
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:05,399
that a very credible source vouched for him.

483
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:08,510
The person asked us to keep it a secret from you,

484
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,810
- so... - Who...

485
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
is that person?

486
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,689
Your brother.

487
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,500
Why did such a doubtful incident happen...

488
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,010
when Young Hwa's death is near?

489
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,719
What are you doing here?

490
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,689
Have they left?

491
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,790
Yes. I asked you. Why are you here?

492
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,929
I was just...

493
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:05,629
shocked to hear what happened to Tae Ju.

494
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,070
And I felt bad.

495
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,840
I'm sorry that he's dead,

496
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,540
but that's not important right now.

497
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,139
I don't...

498
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,340
feel good about this.

499
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:20,780
Don't go anywhere and stay by my side today.

500
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,480
Of course, it doesn't feel good.

501
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:27,850
A man died.

502
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,658
But I have plans today.

503
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:31,689
I have to leave early.

504
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,990
What plans?

505
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,330
Is there something else that I don't know about?

506
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:39,429
- What's wrong all of a sudden? - It's not sudden.

507
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:45,070
When someone suspiciously dies,

508
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,109
unfortunate things follow.

509
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:50,679
It may put you in danger.

510
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:52,639
Listen to me.

511
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,179
Why would it put me in danger?

512
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,679
It has nothing to do with me.

513
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,790
I have to go now.

514
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,790
It's my day off tomorrow, so see you the day after tomorrow.

515
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,030
You can't go.

516
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:16,399
You said...

517
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:21,270
that I was your guardian deity.

518
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,409
- So, just listen to me... - Stop being unreasonable.

519
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,909
I have a life, you know.

520
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,619
I actually have to go.

521
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,820
I'll see you in two days.

522
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:34,889
Young Hwa.

523
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,260
Hi, Mr. Han.

524
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,730
You must be on your way out.

525
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,330
You may go.

526
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,139
I was going to ask you a question.

527
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,240
But I'm a little busy right now.

528
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,810
Too bad.

529
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:01,449
I'd like to know what it's about...

530
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,619
right now.

531
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:09,119
When an evil spirit enters you, it leaves a unique mark.

532
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,060
Just like the one on my chest.

533
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:14,689
You may not be able to see it clearly at first,

534
00:33:15,389 --> 00:33:17,800
but it shows itself when the body is in danger.

535
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,070
We'll talk later.

536
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,280
We can talk later,

537
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,820
but tidy yourself.

538
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:38,850
I told you to be careful.

539
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,050
These little details are...

540
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:43,859
what show who you really are.

541
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,260
What was that?

542
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,629
Why so sensitive?

543
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:58,070
Was that unexpected from your brother?

544
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,679
I hate when people put their hands on my body.

545
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,949
You know how he's traumatized by it.

546
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,679
Please understand.

547
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:16,159
The police officers stopped by earlier.

548
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:18,690
He just heard about Tae Ju as well.

549
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,860
You understand, right?

550
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,929
It sounds like...

551
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:27,869
you know him better than I do now.

552
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:33,139
I guess it's because I've been spending some time with him lately.

553
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,380
We had something to talk about.

554
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,250
Let's talk outside.

555
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,619
Goodbye, Mr. Han.

556
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,270
Come to think of it, he did the same last time.

557
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:07,940
What were you trying to do?

558
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,650
It looks like you're on your way to the fire station.

559
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,290
Are you meeting your colleagues?

560
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,689
Yes. They suddenly wanted to gather,

561
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,560
so I meant to go and catch up.

562
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,060
You're not trying to follow me to the fire station, are you?

563
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:35,069
- Of course, I have to go... - No.

564
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,969
I was generous enough by letting you follow me here.

565
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,940
Take this taxi and go back home.

566
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,408
You seemed taken aback earlier,

567
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,139
so I just helped you get out of it.

568
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,079
If you act unreasonably like earlier,

569
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,480
I'll quit. I won't care about the dream.

570
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,319
Call me as soon as you get home.

571
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,830
I'll be worried.

572
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,730
You insisted on coming with me and everything.

573
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:09,969
It's not like I'm a child.

574
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,110
You should apologize to Mr. Han as soon as you get home.

575
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:19,279
You embarrassed him by yelling when he was just worried about you.

576
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,350
(Break Room)

577
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,819
(I am Han Jun O.)

578
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,230
But he didn't have it before.

579
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:44,770
What were those lines?

580
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,520
What? They told me to get here on time.

581
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,250
Did they all move out?

582
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,059
- Surprise! - Surprise!

583
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,298
- What? - Happy birthday!

584
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:13,130
Slowly.

585
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,170
You scared me.

586
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:17,198
I told you this was unnecessary.

587
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:19,069
Your birthday is coming up.

588
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,009
We can't gather because of our schedules,

589
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,178
so we asked you to come for your birthday party.

590
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:27,009
- Cry. - Cry.

591
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,880
- Cry. - Cry.

592
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,650
Thanks, everyone.

593
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:37,089
(You're forever our firefighter.)

594
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,460
It's so good to see you all.

595
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,460
What? Who did this to her locker?

596
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:52,600
What is all this?

597
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,908
(Kang Young Hwa)

598
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:57,379
You can always come back.

599
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,339
We've prepared everything for you.

600
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,179
And this is...

601
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:03,750
a bribe to move up your return.

602
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,789
What? No. I can't accept money.

603
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,189
Come on.

604
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,460
We wouldn't give you cash. We're not that cold-hearted.

605
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,190
It's not cash?

606
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,330
What is it, then?

607
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,670
You know how he's traumatized by it.

608
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:30,279
Please understand.

609
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:46,259
Put that down.

610
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,969
You came back sooner than I thought.

611
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
How did the talk go?

612
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,009
I said I had a question for you.

613
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:04,710
The person I asked you to find last time.

614
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,710
I vouched for him in front of the police.

615
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,449
If you were going to open up so confidently,

616
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:17,060
why did you tell the police to keep it a secret?

617
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:21,630
Or have you been hiding him when you had already found him?

618
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,630
You wouldn't know him, even if I told you.

619
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,969
We used to be close in the past.

620
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,469
He must have been in security footage by accident.

621
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,339
I didn't want to mislead you,

622
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,980
so I meant to tell you in person.

623
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,610
By accident?

624
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,350
How should I believe you?

625
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:50,389
Because I say so.

626
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,290
Don't you trust your brother?

627
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,330
And I have good news.

628
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,710
I think I found the right one to suspect.

629
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:09,270
Who would that be?

630
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,480
Give me some time.

631
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,279
I'm looking into it...

632
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,190
for you.

633
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,219
It's late.

634
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,920
Good night.

635
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,999
(Kang Young Hwa)

636
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,270
I got home safely.

637
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:42,540
Don't worry and go to bed.

638
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,610
It'll only be a couple of days.

639
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,480
I promise I'll find out...

640
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:49,509
how you died.

641
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,920
This time,

642
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,690
I won't let anyone kill you.

643
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,389
I will stop every threat...

644
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:03,400
that comes your way.

645
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,739
What are you doing here?

646
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:15,139
Someone's getting more anxious as time passes,

647
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,509
so I'm going to have the dream.

648
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,880
That way, we can both return to where we want to be.

649
00:41:22,009 --> 00:41:23,279
What are you talking about?

650
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,420
I looked it up, and you have dreams...

651
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,690
Was it called REM sleep?

652
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:31,420
Anyway, you have dreams in light sleep.

653
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,259
And you toss and turn in bed.

654
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,690
So I'll get help from you.

655
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,499
No!

656
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,199
I sleep in the living room because my room is too hot.

657
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:41,299
Sleep in your room.

658
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:43,069
Is that right?

659
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,199
Then,

660
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:49,868
what should I do about this?

661
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:53,139
They had to give me this as a birthday gift.

662
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,709
I was planning to ask you...

663
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,619
to come with me tomorrow since you said you were depressed.

664
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,250
I should probably go with someone else.

665
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,489
(Theme Park Ticket)

666
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,159
Should we go to bed, Young Hwa?

667
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,730
Go to bed, baby.

668
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:10,559
There you go. Sleep tight.

669
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,529
Do you want me to kick you while you sleep?

670
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,229
No. Just turn off the lights.

671
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,670
Okay.

672
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,089
I failed again?

673
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,989
But...

674
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,969
what is this pressure on my chest?

675
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:53,569
Gosh. What is this?

676
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,239
Come on.

677
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:57,909
This is bad.

678
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,850
What do I do?

679
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,850
Why the long face? Did you fight with Jun O?

680
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:12,818
Maybe I'll never be able to dream about my master.

681
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:15,659
Don't be gross.

682
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,230
Why didn't you ask Jun O to go with you?

683
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:20,770
Are you crazy? I can't bring him there.

684
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,798
Right? It was crazy talk.

685
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:26,040
- Yes. Fine. - Let's go.

686
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:27,170
Okay.

687
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:30,540
Good morning.

688
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,850
Where are you going?

689
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,448
(Ticket Booth)

690
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,650
Stop.

691
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,319
Gosh.

692
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,420
So, you seriously...

693
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:46,389
want to come with us...

694
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:48,429
- to that place? - Yes.

695
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,360
What?

696
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,600
What's gotten into you since last night?

697
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,169
It's just that I don't get it.

698
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,729
How am I in danger?

699
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,770
And...

700
00:43:58,339 --> 00:43:59,900
this isn't a battlefield.

701
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,310
You're going to follow me to a theme park for being too risky?

702
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:03,979
She's right.

703
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,638
I believe that you'll be...

704
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:11,580
in bigger danger here than Young Hwa.

705
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,619
- Han Jun O? - Yes.

706
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:15,989
- I think he resembles him. - Maybe it is him.

707
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,619
I told you that a hat wouldn't be enough.

708
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,960
Stop being stubborn and go.

709
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:24,599
I told you...

710
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,900
that I'd come with you if you went back home.

711
00:44:28,029 --> 00:44:29,869
Does it look like I want to go in there?

712
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:34,210
It is kind of awkward, but...

713
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,879
I guess it could be a surprise...

714
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,309
- for the public. - Here!

715
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,949
- Na Yeon! What surprise? - Here.

716
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,219
I found a way to go inside.

717
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:50,790
It's so...

718
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,019
If you don't like it, go home.

719
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,730
You go home.

720
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:56,428
I just got here,

721
00:44:56,429 --> 00:45:00,130
and I'm never going home until I try all the rides here.

722
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,500
Tell me if you're tired.

723
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,170
I'll be glad to send you home with Mr. Jang.

724
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,580
Gosh.

725
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:14,849
Do I have to go this far?

726
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,980
Na Yeon!

727
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,290
I got hairbands!

728
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,449
- Did you? - Yes!

729
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:23,989
- Gosh. - Which one do you want?

730
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:25,359
I want this one.

731
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,360
- This one? - Yes.

732
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,560
Try it on.

733
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,199
- Let's keep going. - How about a roller coaster ride?

734
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,199
I'd like that.

735
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,198
I can't...

736
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,669
- I know where everything is. - Do you?

737
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,739
Yes, I know this place like the back of my hand.

738
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,969
Great.

739
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:51,020
You want to...

740
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,380
ride that thing?

741
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,420
Go!

742
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,589
Never take off your mask.

743
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:03,189
And don't go anywhere. I'll be back soon.

744
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,000
You can't go around without me.

745
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,069
Then, come with me.

746
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,069
Either take the ride with me or wait here.

747
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,239
Pick.

748
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,580
Goodness.

749
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,029
It's so high!

750
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,520
No way!

751
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:13,770
Jun O.

752
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,400
Are you feeling okay?

753
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,380
Yoon Je, don't you go on dates with your girlfriend?

754
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,250
I don't have a girlfriend.

755
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:29,650
Guys,

756
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:33,380
when did you get so close, being on a first-name basis?

757
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,960
You've had enough fun. It's about time we go.

758
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:40,859
It's like you're possessed by a ghost...

759
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,889
that resents not having enough fun.

760
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:46,860
I don't think she's the one who's possessed.

761
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:50,869
Mr. Jang.

762
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:53,739
Aren't you embarrassed to get paid for hanging out?

763
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,110
I'm sorry. I apologize.

764
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,008
That was...

765
00:48:00,009 --> 00:48:02,650
He's only here because of you.

766
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,880
Do you have to ruin other people's moods too?

767
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:07,589
I said you were always welcome to leave.

768
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,449
But you said none of the things here were dangerous.

769
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,360
They hang, spin, and drop the person all day here.

770
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:14,460
How am I supposed to leave when it's so dangerous?

771
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,799
The whole place is a threat.

772
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:19,600
It's way too risky.

773
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,000
This is where you come to enjoy that.

774
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:23,940
So weird.

775
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,199
Goodness.

776
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,269
He must have a reason to be so careful. Let's just go.

777
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,380
What?

778
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:34,250
Seung Woo got me these rare tickets.

779
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:36,610
I can't ignore the person's sincerity.

780
00:48:37,009 --> 00:48:38,150
Oh, my gosh!

781
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:41,689
Was he the one who gave you these tickets?

782
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,218
Didn't I tell you that Seung Woo...

783
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:46,420
seemed to be into you?

784
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:48,389
- Who's Seung Woo? - Well,

785
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,500
it's the cutest boy at her fire station.

786
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,468
I knew it when he followed you...

787
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,968
and called you Ms. Kang.

788
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,270
I can be very quick-witted...

789
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,669
He's merely a junior colleague of mine.

790
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:04,310
A mere colleague buys you coffee on every night duty?

791
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,380
Does Jun O know about him as well?

792
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:13,219
He's been bothering me this whole time.

793
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:15,920
Anyway,

794
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:18,659
I can't stay here any longer,

795
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,318
so you can stay...

796
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,529
or follow me outside.

797
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:27,060
I think I have to go.

798
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:29,830
No.

799
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,710
Han Jun O.

800
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,049
- Girls. - Jun O!

801
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,350
Hey!

802
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:50,759
- Jun O! - Stop, girls!

803
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,580
Oh, my gosh.

804
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,630
There he is! Jun O!

805
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:38,040
- Jun O! - Jun O!

806
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:39,869
- Jun O! - Jun O!

807
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:42,969
I'm telling you. Jun O is here.

808
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,940
Yes, that Han Jun O!

809
00:50:45,739 --> 00:50:48,650
Exactly. It was Jun O.

810
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,949
What a nuisance.

811
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:55,219
Look who's talking.

812
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,888
Don't tell me you're blaming me.

813
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,860
I asked you not to come here in the first place.

814
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:03,258
Well, you didn't have to be Jun O in the first place.

815
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:05,698
Why did you have to pick Han Jun O, of all those people?

816
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:06,699
That's...

817
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,940
I don't know. Perhaps it's fate or coincidence.

818
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,279
Sure. I blame my fate for getting involved in this mess.

819
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:20,880
Let's go.

820
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,190
Oh, my.

821
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,630
That startled me.

822
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,730
Don't pop out.

823
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:44,799
Wait. It's Na Yeon.

824
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,610
Mr. Jang led the people to the exit.

825
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,040
A celebrity's manager certainly does his job well.

826
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,049
We should get out of here now.

827
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,290
Wait.

828
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,460
What is this place...

829
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,360
that's so dark and dreary?

830
00:52:07,889 --> 00:52:08,889
This place?

831
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:10,830
It's a haunted house. A house of ghosts.

832
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:13,429
A house of what?

833
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:14,770
Ghosts.

834
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:25,310
What?

835
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,810
Is a ghost afraid of ghosts?

836
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:32,020
Has it ever occurred to you...

837
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:35,949
that a ghost might know about ghosts better?

838
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:37,489
What...

839
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,089
Stop scaring me.

840
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,589
Ghosts...

841
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,900
No!

842
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:52,968
- Where's the exit? - Run!

843
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,139
- Oh, my gosh! - Run!

844
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,880
- Why are you stopping? - I have to close the doors.

845
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,610
Where? What...

846
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,679
(Exit)

847
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,170
What?

848
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:26,770
Nothing.

849
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:30,069
It was fun, though, right?

850
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:35,279
By any chance,

851
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:40,250
as you once said,

852
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:43,290
if we were normal...

853
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,389
How would it have been, then?

854
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:10,610
I got calls from the hospitals in the US.

855
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,650
They thoroughly examined Mr. Han Jun O's test results,

856
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:19,259
and they all said it was incurable.

857
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:24,199
It's best to accept it now.

858
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:30,869
Mr. Han cannot be cured.

859
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,719
I don't care whether Mr. Seok is telling the truth or not...

860
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,929
if trusting him is...

861
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:56,830
the only way I can save you, Jun O.

862
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:09,040
Is it true that you can cure my brother?

863
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:12,440
Of course. Only if you follow my instructions.

864
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,080
What would you have me do?

865
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,350
Kill Kang Young Hwa.

866
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,489
Then, your brother lives.

867
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,860
Man, I'm drained.

868
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,299
I could never go to another theme park.

869
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,199
Tell me about it.

870
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:41,110
Even those two went out like a light.

871
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,670
It must have been truly exhausting.

872
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:48,339
A new bride...

873
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,409
should not look like that.

874
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,639
It is not worse...

875
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,380
than how you look.

876
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,850
Are you not nervous?

877
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,049
It is our wedding night, after all.

878
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,560
You must worry about yourself.

879
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,230
On a wedding night,

880
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,529
the groom is normally more nervous than the bride.

881
00:57:16,029 --> 00:57:17,900
You have no clue, Master.

882
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,339
"Husband."

883
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,540
Many people will have their eyes on you from now on.

884
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,409
Do you think you can call me that?

885
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:42,389
When you say such a thing,

886
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:51,839
you are supposed to...

887
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,369
smile like this.

888
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,610
Not while looking so sorrowful.

889
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,130
(Moon in the Day)

890
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,170
I'll be your ordinary moments.

891
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:01,310
Go on a trip with me.

892
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:02,409
Promise.

893
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:05,179
Are you saying that the evil spirit has to do with Ms. Kang?

894
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:07,809
- You don't have to dream. - What?

895
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,650
Because I've decided firmly.

896
00:59:10,049 --> 00:59:12,420
I bet he has an evil underlying motive.

897
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,589
I won't be able to know unless you tell me.

898
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,089
If I do tell you, can you handle it?

899
00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:20,959
You will find out the truth one day, Young Hwa.

900
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,889
No, Ri Ta.
