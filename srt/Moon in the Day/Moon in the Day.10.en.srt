1
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,979
(Moon in the Day)

2
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,980
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:50,989
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,020
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

5
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,450
Jun O!

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,319
Jun O!

7
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,690
Where did you part ways with him?

8
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,060
Near that cliff over there.

9
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:06,069
I thought he went back to the tent.

10
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,140
- Where has he gone? - Don't worry, Mr. Han.

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,169
I used to be a firefighter, you know.

12
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,838
Searching people is my specialty,

13
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,380
so let's check out where he went missing.

14
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,380
Jun O!

15
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,220
Answer me, Jun O!

16
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,690
Jun O!

17
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,000
Jun O!

18
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,520
Young Hwa.

19
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,289
No.

20
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,859
No, Young Hwa.

21
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,199
Jun O!

22
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,829
Jun O!

23
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,539
Jun O!

24
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,009
Could he have left already?

25
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,180
No. He couldn't have left without telling me.

26
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,829
What was the exact time you parted ways with him?

27
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,539
Mr. Han?

28
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,109
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,250
I'll have to ask you for one last favor...

30
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,919
for the sake of my brother.

31
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,460
Excuse me?

32
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,169
Don't think it's unfair.

33
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,509
This is all because of karma from your past life.

34
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,180
What are you talking about?

35
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,389
Young Hwa!

36
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:28,640
Young Hwa.

37
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,869
Young Hwa!

38
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,109
Help!

39
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:36,340
Help!

40
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,450
No.

41
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,789
Hold on, Young Hwa.

42
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,460
Don't fall.

43
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:56,299
Had I known this would happen,

44
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,270
I would have told you my honest thoughts.

45
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:00,999
I would have asked you...

46
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,299
to stay by my side.

47
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,309
(Moon in the Day)

48
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,679
Come on. Here we are.

49
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:16,319
- I am holding on to it. - Goodness.

50
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,548
- That is not balanced. - Come here.

51
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:20,549
- Get that out of here. - Okay.

52
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,359
Really?

53
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,789
Mother. Father.

54
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,600
In a few days,

55
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,669
I will get married to my enemy.

56
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,270
He risks his life every time to protect me,

57
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,609
and I can neither kill him...

58
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,539
nor give my heart to him.

59
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,879
Am I allowed to break the moral laws like this?

60
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,359
They told me that you never left your room.

61
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,600
You said that you would tell me...

62
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:09,169
how to live your life,

63
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,309
yet you have not given me any answers.

64
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,320
Perhaps,

65
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,150
you already have your answer...

66
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,330
but are looking away.

67
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,729
It is my greed...

68
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:41,439
to keep you...

69
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,970
by my side for a little longer.

70
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,280
I apologize.

71
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,850
I simply came here to tell you that.

72
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,030
There you were.

73
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,169
Have you looked for me?

74
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,400
The wedding is near,

75
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,109
and I cannot have the bride go missing.

76
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,650
That was a joke...

77
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,119
to make you smile.

78
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,320
I was about to come to you.

79
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,060
About...

80
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,228
what you said to me earlier...

81
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:48,330
We do not...

82
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,129
have to talk about that.

83
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,409
What is this?

84
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,050
This is your last chance.

85
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,778
My father must have put his men...

86
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,489
on the road to Great Gaya.

87
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,450
So, go north.

88
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,960
People of Gaya have moved to the northern coast,

89
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:19,960
so...

90
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:23,129
start a new life there.

91
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,200
I apologize...

92
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,269
for my belated answer.

93
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,909
Then, what about you?

94
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,379
If you let me leave like this...

95
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,810
I have already told you...

96
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:41,580
that I finally wanted to live...

97
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,050
after I met you.

98
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,460
I would rather let you go...

99
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,789
than make you my shackles.

100
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,859
Liar.

101
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,759
It makes no sense that you would let me go when you want to live.

102
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,470
Be honest with me.

103
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,269
Do not say that you are doing this for me,

104
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,470
or blame anyone else.

105
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:09,879
Tell me your sincere wish...

106
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:13,080
that you want to keep me by your side.

107
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,119
I...

108
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,999
want you...

109
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,399
to leave.

110
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,470
That is my sincere wish.

111
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:46,979
Ri Ta.

112
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,050
If that is what you sincerely wish,

113
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,460
would you like to make a bet with me, Master?

114
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,269
If you do not turn around...

115
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,340
until you cross this...

116
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,350
Then, will you promise...

117
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,379
that you will promptly leave this place?

118
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,920
But if I win,

119
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,119
you must admit it.

120
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,729
That you actually do not want me to leave.

121
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,229
I will win, though.

122
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,700
I do not plan on losing either.

123
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,430
Will you...

124
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,029
never look back?

125
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,170
Do not blame me.

126
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,540
You are the one...

127
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,040
who started this bet.

128
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:35,820
I mean it.

129
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,460
If you do not turn around,

130
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,359
this will be our last.

131
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,220
This is cheating.

132
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,190
I know that it is.

133
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,700
If you and I were normal...

134
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,800
and had nothing to do with this ill-fated relationship,

135
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,810
how would it have been?

136
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,009
If we could have been normal,

137
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,550
I would have wanted nothing more than that.

138
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,779
If so,

139
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,389
we would not have met.

140
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,999
So, I have won.

141
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,129
Do not think it is unfair.

142
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,239
Men usually do not know their own feelings.

143
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,869
Who says that I do not?

144
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,779
Are you sure...

145
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,450
you will not regret this?

146
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,220
I believe...

147
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,190
that I will.

148
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:59,229
But I cannot...

149
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,739
help myself anymore.

150
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,509
I cannot...

151
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,649
help myself either.

152
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:50,019
Dear Moon, dear bright Moon

153
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:57,920
Where did you go during the day

154
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:05,899
To come back in the night?

155
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,710
Why have you stopped?

156
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,810
We must go now.

157
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:22,779
They will all look for the bride and groom.

158
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,090
Our wedding is tomorrow, so today,

159
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,859
I must visit His Majesty in the palace.

160
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,529
So, I would like to keep listening...

161
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,529
to your voice for now.

162
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:52,080
Dear Moon, dear bright Moon

163
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:58,180
Where did you go during the day

164
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,489
Young Hwa.

165
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,960
Master.

166
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,899
Focus.

167
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,270
Come up.

168
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,290
Thanks.

169
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:43,629
You saved my life.

170
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:46,600
See?

171
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:49,270
You are my guardian deity.

172
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,310
I merely got lucky.

173
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,020
When I was about to die,

174
00:18:06,949 --> 00:18:08,050
I regretted...

175
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,760
not having told you that I couldn't...

176
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,590
leave you yet.

177
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,159
I won't ask you to stay with me forever.

178
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,570
Can you just...

179
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,669
stay with me a little longer?

180
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,209
Will I be able to...

181
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,419
kill you?

182
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,629
Young Hwa.

183
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:50,659
What's wrong with me?

184
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:54,270
Young Hwa, wake up.

185
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,099
I'm at the campsite on Geummun Mountain...

186
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,070
in Myungdae Village, Gyeonggi Province.

187
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:02,480
The woman I was with...

188
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:07,179
A woman in her 20s on Geummun Mountain, right?

189
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,379
We already received a call and sent help.

190
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,250
You already got a call?

191
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,980
It's a light concussion.

192
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,849
But the injury is not visible on the outside,

193
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,379
so I recommend you...

194
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,179
come back for a thorough check-up after you leave.

195
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,750
Thank you.

196
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,928
You see? This is nothing.

197
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,159
Didn't you hear him?

198
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,030
He said you should visit him again.

199
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,398
He meant only when I have a symptom.

200
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,570
You better listen to me.

201
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,138
I can take care of myself.

202
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,169
If I were a little late, you would've been dead!

203
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,149
It was Min O...

204
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,619
who pushed you off the cliff, right?

205
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:20,719
You knew?

206
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,959
Since we don't know his whereabouts,

207
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,260
let's get help from the police first.

208
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,030
Wait.

209
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,899
I want to ask Mr. Han something.

210
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,939
What he said at the end troubled my mind.

211
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,240
All the incidents are...

212
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,250
because of what I did in my past life.

213
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,149
"Because of what I did in my past life."

214
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,219
I don't even get what it means.

215
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,359
How did Mr. Han know about my past life?

216
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,060
Do you know anything about it?

217
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,760
How would Min O know about...

218
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,480
Stay here. Don't go anywhere else.

219
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,290
I must save Jun O.

220
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:29,719
What are you?

221
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:31,919
Why did you do that?

222
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:33,659
Jun O.

223
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,899
You already know I'm not Jun O.

224
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,330
Why did you try to kill Young Hwa?

225
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:42,070
And how did you know about her past life?

226
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:45,669
All I did was to save my brother.

227
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:49,409
If she dies,

228
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:53,280
you can come back.

229
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:55,080
What on earth are you talking about?

230
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,879
I heard she should die so that you can survive.

231
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,189
I had no choice.

232
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,060
To save my brother...

233
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Min O...

234
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,100
You're crazy.

235
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,800
The whole time I've lived...

236
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:15,740
that has never happened.

237
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,909
Based on what ground are you talking nonsense?

238
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,770
"Nonsense?"

239
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,009
There's no life created by killing others.

240
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,209
You just...

241
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,609
almost killed a person.

242
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:31,349
You tried to kill Young Hwa,

243
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,550
who tried her best to save your brother!

244
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,020
If she...

245
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:41,230
were dead,

246
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:44,800
you would never overcome...

247
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,270
the feeling of heavy guilt.

248
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,469
That's what you did!

249
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,580
Don't you see through it?

250
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,679
Your brother Jun O is...

251
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,550
already dead.

252
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,689
Don't say that!

253
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,429
He can't be dead.

254
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,689
You saw it too.

255
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,359
You saw your brother's dead body after he was pronounced dead.

256
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,639
Your guilt to kill her is heavy,

257
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:34,350
but I won't punish you.

258
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,290
Because you and your brother's destiny is...

259
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,649
already hapless.

260
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,760
Never...

261
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,959
approach her again.

262
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,270
Then, all he said was...

263
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,939
a lie?

264
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,010
What did you just say?

265
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:35,679
I hope...

266
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,510
you'd take care...

267
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,510
of yourself first.

268
00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:54,889
What have I done?

269
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,659
Honestly,

270
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:07,629
I want to stay alone at home tonight.

271
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,469
Can I?

272
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:12,840
Is it because of Min O?

273
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,580
Should I die for you to survive?

274
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:21,379
I can never get what it means.

275
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,080
I have no idea how he came to think of it.

276
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,790
Don't keep thinking about it.

277
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,820
All you need to do now is to stay next to me.

278
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:33,658
You don't know what danger may come to you again.

279
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,830
You said the same thing before.

280
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,600
As if you expected what'd come later.

281
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,340
You kept repeating that I was in danger.

282
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,740
You also said I should stay away from Mr. Han.

283
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,010
Did you perhaps know about it already?

284
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,219
What matters now is...

285
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,159
the fact that you aren't safe yet.

286
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,959
If you believe me, let's go in now.

287
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:10,500
Please.

288
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,040
Take some rest.

289
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,310
Let me know...

290
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,570
if you're hungry just in case.

291
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,780
There may be something to eat here.

292
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,350
There's something I don't know, right?

293
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,580
Is this related...

294
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:31,919
to what Mr. Han said...

295
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,520
about my past life?

296
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:46,000
It's just what a lunatic full of paranoia said.

297
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,530
Ignore it.

298
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,770
Then what about our curse?

299
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:54,669
At that time,

300
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,780
I just let it slide because what you said about it bothered me.

301
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,649
Come to think of it, it's so strange.

302
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,119
How did your curse become our curse?

303
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,060
I've always felt you were hiding something.

304
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,090
I've just ignored it, but not anymore.

305
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,770
What are you hiding?

306
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,040
"We" means I'm also related to it.

307
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,600
Sometimes,

308
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:29,070
it's better not to know.

309
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,280
No,

310
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:33,480
I need to know it.

311
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,080
I don't want to be dragged down by words...

312
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:40,089
like the past or curses.

313
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,250
So,

314
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:43,820
please tell me.

315
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,100
Young Hwa,

316
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,609
you'll be dead...

317
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,149
before 30.

318
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,179
What?

319
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,189
It's your curse...

320
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,919
repeating in your last 18 lives.

321
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,840
Your life this time...

322
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,480
will come to an end soon.

323
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,290
Although you don't remember me,

324
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:52,320
you'll remember your sin soon.

325
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,510
Seok Chul Hwan!

326
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,750
Was it all a lie?

327
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,320
That Jun O will be back once Young Hwa is dead!

328
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,389
Was that a lie?

329
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,000
Your voice is too loud.

330
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:31,659
What?

331
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:34,530
Who is the one who couldn't even kill that woman?

332
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,600
How do I know?

333
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,270
This awful mark disappears only after she dies.

334
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,310
But it's still there.

335
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,480
Is this all you got?

336
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:55,589
I trusted you, useless, pathetic loser,

337
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,219
when you were going crazy over your dead brother,

338
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,990
but you wasted my precious time.

339
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,329
Is it true that Jun O is already dead, then?

340
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,570
Gosh. You were crazy to believe he wasn't dead.

341
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:12,269
How can a soul come back after losing its body?

342
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,770
That has never happened before.

343
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:21,350
You're done with the questions, right?

344
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,020
I don't have much time, either.

345
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:41,330
Who are you?

346
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:42,939
I already told you...

347
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:46,270
about the evil spirit that has lived over 1,000 years.

348
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,639
Why did you use me...

349
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,550
to do this?

350
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:55,709
Don't worry.

351
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,949
It didn't have to be you.

352
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,090
There are plenty of people who will kill Young Hwa.

353
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,250
I should tell Jun O about it.

354
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,139
I have to tell...

355
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,908
Jun O by any means.

356
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:56,639
(My Brother)

357
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,550
I am...

358
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:04,919
going to die?

359
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,658
I had lived 18 different lives.

360
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:13,659
But I never lived as a renowned historical figure.

361
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,089
(Young daughter of an aristocrat, hunter, garment seller, servant...)

362
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,800
I see a lot of them died young...

363
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,669
maybe because the average life span was short back in the day.

364
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,639
Did they all die young...

365
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:29,369
because of the curse?

366
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,619
Are you all right?

367
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,219
How can I be all right?

368
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,030
I just heard I will die when I turn 30.

369
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,699
It's so ridiculous that it hasn't sunken in yet.

370
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,729
I know you're confused now, but...

371
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,770
Right.

372
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,810
A few could have died when they were young.

373
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,240
Did you see it, then?

374
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,948
Did you see all of the past 18 lives...

375
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:09,750
dying before they turn 30?

376
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,149
I...

377
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,429
witnessed all of your past life's death.

378
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,929
That's how I realized...

379
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,540
that you are repeating deaths...

380
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,069
for 1,500 years, and I...

381
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,279
stay by your side...

382
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:41,679
to helpless watch you die.

383
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,080
That is...

384
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,489
the dreadful curse we share.

385
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:53,589
It might be at least one time when it isn't the case.

386
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:57,560
There are always exceptions.

387
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,900
You asked me about the curse after what happened today.

388
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,299
You had many moments where you almost died.

389
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,770
Do you think they were coincidental?

390
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,250
Jun O, move away!

391
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,259
What didn't you tell me about it earlier, then?

392
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,589
If you were so sure,

393
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,729
why did you keep your mouth shut?

394
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,799
Even if I tell you,

395
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,199
nothing will be changed.

396
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:36,500
No.

397
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:39,469
You changed it earlier.

398
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:42,069
You saved me at the cliff.

399
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
Young Hwa.

400
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:58,659
Come to think of it,

401
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,690
you said there's a way to lift the curse.

402
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,029
Isn't that why you told me not to have dreams?

403
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:07,670
What is the way?

404
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,969
Tell me.

405
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:14,339
I have to...

406
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,279
kill you to lift the curse.

407
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,250
I think it might be useless already.

408
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,020
I am sorry.

409
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,319
There is no way as of now.

410
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:32,060
How did it become useless?

411
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,239
Min O is...

412
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,468
(Emergency Medical Center)

413
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:50,509
(Emergency Medical Center)

414
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:53,408
- Help me here. - Okay.

415
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:54,479
Unbutton him.

416
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,980
Switch now. Two, three!

417
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:57,819
Are you writing it down?

418
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:04,460
What happened?

419
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:07,089
What do you mean...

420
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:08,959
Min O was found in a motel?

421
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,399
- Well, actually... - The motel owner called the police,

422
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,130
saying a man was down.

423
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,399
It's a shabby old motel,

424
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,399
so it doesn't have security cameras.

425
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,670
But based on the circumstance and evidence found on the scene,

426
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,969
we assume someone attacked him.

427
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,779
- It'll be a violent crime case... - Someone...

428
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,880
tried to kill Han Min O?

429
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:30,980
Who on earth...

430
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,889
We're investigating it fast, so I ask for your patience.

431
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:36,719
I'll contact you again. Yes.

432
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,989
(Intensive Care Unit)

433
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,860
Mr. Han I knew had been a good guy.

434
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,699
He isn't someone who would be attacked for no reason.

435
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,900
Or someone who would kill another easily.

436
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,069
No matter what kind of an unspeakable story he had,

437
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:56,210
we cannot deny that he made a choice himself.

438
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,310
Mr. Han's incident.

439
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:01,580
That has to do with my curse too, right?

440
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,250
Now I'm curious.

441
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,960
What kind of karma I had in my past life...

442
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:16,259
that innocent people around me have to suffer like this?

443
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,769
From what you've seen,

444
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,839
what kind of person was I in my past life?

445
00:38:25,299 --> 00:38:26,909
Not the one I saw in my dream.

446
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,179
I'm talking about the real me that you remember.

447
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,719
I remember Ri Ta was...

448
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,219
Gosh. Goodness!

449
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,658
What happened to Han Min O?

450
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,428
What's your relationship with the patient?

451
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:50,330
Don't you know I'm his lawyer?

452
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:52,129
What happened? Is he dead?

453
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,568
Please get out. You can't do this here.

454
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:54,569
Come on.

455
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:00,710
That person did all this. That person.

456
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,639
Then, all he said was...

457
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,279
a lie?

458
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,779
I have to run away.

459
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,150
I have to go.

460
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:14,818
I will call Mr. Jang,

461
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,350
so take his car and go straight home.

462
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:19,089
You cannot meet anyone. Do you get it?

463
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,130
That person...

464
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,170
He...

465
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,639
Is there a person I am not aware of?

466
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:39,509
What if I missed something?

467
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,080
I'll get in trouble. He's coming.

468
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:49,589
You.

469
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:51,420
Jun O.

470
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,259
Do you know something about Min O?

471
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,929
What do you mean?

472
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,000
Just answer me.

473
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:04,638
Do you know what happened to Min O?

474
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,039
I don't know anything.

475
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,339
I am completely unrelated and not at fault!

476
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:15,150
You've killed someone before.

477
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,580
Did you do that...

478
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,150
to Min O?

479
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:25,520
No, I just killed Gu Tae Ju by mistake...

480
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,130
Gu Tae Ju was...

481
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,830
also killed.

482
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,568
No, I didn't do it.

483
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:38,739
It was that man. He pushed me into this trap!

484
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,040
"That man?"

485
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,408
Yes, I knew something was weird from the beginning.

486
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:43,810
It couldn't have been a coincidence.

487
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,279
Yes, everything is clear now.

488
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,080
The one who used me to kill Gu Tae Ju...

489
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,178
and did that to Han Min O was...

490
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:54,250
Wait.

491
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,389
- Goodness. - What was that?

492
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,609
Man, that was so close.

493
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,150
I can't believe I missed him.

494
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,989
These humans are all useless.

495
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,619
I need to change my plan.

496
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,489
Do Ha.

497
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,230
You cannot find out about me at this point.

498
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,110
So? What is Han Ri Ta up to?

499
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,309
It seemed like she shut herself up in the room,

500
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,480
but she had been going out often for a few days.

501
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,580
At times, Lord Do Ha goes out to look for her himself.

502
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,750
Tomorrow is their wedding.

503
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:03,790
I will not allow anything to change.

504
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,330
Go get her.

505
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:08,690
Yes, my lord.

506
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:22,670
What does it feel like to lay down one's life...

507
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,610
for another?

508
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,218
And how does a woman feel...

509
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:33,619
when she is about to marry...

510
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,089
a man who killed her parents?

511
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:42,730
These are all safe to eat.

512
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,199
You seem rather composed, but does Do Ha...

513
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:48,400
also feel calm?

514
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:51,469
I am curious.

515
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,369
Do Ha was your enemy, who took your parents' lives,

516
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,940
yet he offered his life to you.

517
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,420
Did you end up giving your heart to the man who killed your parents?

518
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,989
I am not crazy enough to neglect my duty as their daughter.

519
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,389
The only reason I am staying here is...

520
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,060
to punish my enemy with my own hands.

521
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:18,130
Do not say such nonsense.

522
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,299
Your duty as their daughter?

523
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,869
Do you think Do Ha began to defy me...

524
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:29,869
because of me...

525
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,909
or you?

526
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:37,949
If he dares to defy me, it means he is willing to die.

527
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,859
I will get your revenge,

528
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,920
so just make sure you marry him in peace tomorrow.

529
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,730
Do Ha will fight in a war the day after...

530
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,500
your consummation of marriage.

531
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:55,199
What do you mean?

532
00:43:56,429 --> 00:43:59,799
The upcoming battle with Baekje will be a rather big one.

533
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,739
In that war,

534
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,409
Do Ha must die in glory...

535
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:10,880
for me,

536
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,790
So Ri Bu!

537
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:31,239
It does not matter if I marry you or not.

538
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,339
Is death the only thing that awaits you, Master?

539
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,560
I will make sure...

540
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:01,799
I return to you alive.

541
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:04,739
Ri Ta.

542
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,420
If...

543
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,429
both you and my men fail to kill Do Ha,

544
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,299
I will let him live.

545
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,069
As long as you are alive,

546
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,270
Do Ha...

547
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,739
will not be able to defy me.

548
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:20,110
Do you not think so, my daughter-in-law?

549
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,920
Thank you...

550
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,489
for coming into my life, my daughter-in-law.

551
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,230
Thank you for celebrating, Father.

552
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,969
It's a rosary made with lotus seeds.

553
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,940
It will protect you from all evil things...

554
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:24,810
of this world.

555
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:32,679
As of now...

556
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,520
and forever,

557
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:43,460
you are...

558
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,960
my...

559
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,139
only wife,

560
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:59,179
even if death do us part.

561
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:25,069
How can this happen to someone like Mr. Han?

562
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,610
I am not sure...

563
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,880
if this is the right time for me to give this to you.

564
00:48:38,779 --> 00:48:40,790
But please open the glove compartment.

565
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:44,759
- This? - Yes.

566
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:53,900
What is this?

567
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:56,529
Mr. Han said it was for you.

568
00:48:56,869 --> 00:48:59,900
He asked me to pick it up.

569
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:01,869
But...

570
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,380
he can't give it to you now.

571
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,250
That was why I mentioned it instead.

572
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,818
He tried to find a bracelet just like the one you had,

573
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:16,190
the one that broke when you saved Jun O.

574
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,560
He looked for one himself and ordered it too.

575
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:30,869
How did you get this?

576
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:33,199
It was on the ground on the scene of the accident.

577
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,739
It looked like it belonged to you.

578
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,619
Are you saying my bracelet had been protecting me?

579
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:56,629
Most of the time, it protects its owner...

580
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,199
from evil energy or spirits.

581
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,040
It can also cover the eyes and ears to see such things.

582
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,738
I did not know...

583
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:12,040
how that precious amulet ended up in my hands,

584
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,150
but items that contain strong wishes...

585
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,489
always end up finding their rightful owners.

586
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:27,730
It's a rosary made with lotus seeds.

587
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:32,960
It will protect you from all evil things...

588
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:36,299
of this world.

589
00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:40,339
It's the same.

590
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:44,540
Did the lotus seed from 1,500 years ago found its way to me?

591
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,420
Sir, wait.

592
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,719
She came here for you.

593
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:03,190
Who's here for me?

594
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:15,810
It doesn't matter what you ask.

595
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,440
I won't be able to provide any answers.

596
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:28,150
That is...

597
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:29,420
I had a dream.

598
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:32,659
It was a lotus seed...

599
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:36,429
handed by someone who wanted to protect his love.

600
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,500
And his wish had transcended 1,500 years and came to me.

601
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,000
I need to know how this is all possible.

602
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,909
What is this connection from my past life?

603
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,009
Why does it have an impact on me now?

604
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,250
Do I have karma from my past life, which I am unaware of?

605
00:51:57,009 --> 00:52:01,020
You still only ask questions that I cannot answer.

606
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,350
I know that too.

607
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,389
I have had visions of the master since when I was young...

608
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,290
and dreamed about my past life too.

609
00:52:08,989 --> 00:52:11,429
I also know I'm under a curse and will die at 30.

610
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,400
I know you can't do anything to resolve these problems.

611
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,369
But at the very least, I need to know the reason.

612
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:20,499
What did I do so wrong in my past life...

613
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,670
that made me and people around me tormented like this?

614
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:28,179
Do you believe your past life and this life are...

615
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:31,380
completely different?

616
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:32,679
Of course.

617
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,750
I am Kang Young Hwa, not the woman from the past.

618
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:43,060
What about the feelings you harbor for that poltergeist?

619
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,528
What?

620
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:48,799
Perhaps everything that is happening to you now...

621
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:50,940
may be a chance...

622
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:54,369
for you to be freed from this endless karma.

623
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:56,609
What do you mean?

624
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:59,379
Karma is a question thrown at you in every single life.

625
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,350
Therefore, I do not have the answer...

626
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,949
you need to find.

627
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,549
Take courage, face your sin,

628
00:53:11,259 --> 00:53:13,759
and look into your heart.

629
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,000
That is where the answer lies.

630
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,380
A third figure was...

631
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,750
entangled in our curse, and I was unaware of that?

632
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,020
That is impossible.

633
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:49,130
Even if that was the case, I could not have missed it.

634
00:53:57,299 --> 00:53:58,400
(Situation Room)

635
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,409
Yes, hello. You know me, right?

636
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,979
We have a business to take care of.

637
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,850
Please give us some privacy.

638
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:12,150
Let's go.

639
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,549
You must be alarmed. It's all right.

640
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:16,020
Are you okay?

641
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,059
We're running out of time, so find it in a hurry.

642
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,528
That man, Seok Chul Hwan,

643
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,528
met with Han Min O here, right?

644
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:25,758
I did call a meeting on that day,

645
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:27,299
but I didn't know things would blow up like this.

646
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,230
Find it.

647
00:54:57,759 --> 00:54:58,799
You.

648
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:02,429
Who are you?

649
00:55:10,779 --> 00:55:14,980
What about the feelings you harbor for that poltergeist?

650
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,619
Perhaps everything that is happening to you now...

651
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,949
may be a chance...

652
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,290
for you to be freed from this endless karma.

653
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,299
The feelings I have for you.

654
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,210
When I was about to die,

655
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:54,380
I regretted...

656
00:56:56,049 --> 00:56:57,920
not having told you that I couldn't leave you yet.

657
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,389
I...

658
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,889
like you.

659
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:25,179
Do you believe your past life and this life are...

660
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:28,350
completely different?

661
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,869
Ms. Kang Young Hwa.

662
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:50,940
You recognize me this time, right?

663
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:56,210
We often run into each other by coincidence.

664
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,678
Because the connection we made in our past life...

665
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:01,449
could not end that easily.

666
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,380
What?

667
00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:07,850
It is just like...

668
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,618
how your tragic tragedy repeats itself...

669
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:14,929
the moment you give your heart to Do Ha.

670
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,770
("Like the Moon in the Day" by Zia)

671
00:58:56,469 --> 00:58:59,170
(Moon in the Day)

672
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:00,869
Han Ri Ta!

673
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:04,679
Confirm the scar you made with your two hands.

674
00:59:05,279 --> 00:59:06,639
Did it hurt a lot...

675
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,210
when you died?

676
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,980
Where is Seok Chul Hwan?

677
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:13,449
He's not an easy fight.

678
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,089
Do Ha brought everything upon himself.

679
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,960
I will protect you.

680
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,960
I killed you...

681
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:25,130
with my two hands.
