1
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:20,618
(Kim Young Dae)

2
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:22,490
(Pyo Ye Jin)

3
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,189
(On Ju Wan)

4
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:33,429
(Jung Woong In, Lee Kyoung Young)

5
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:49,078
(Moon in the Day)

6
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,148
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:51,218
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,249
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

9
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,749
Move, Jun O!

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,399
Young Hwa.

11
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,550
Is she dead?

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,789
Young Hwa. Wake up, Young Hwa.

13
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,220
- Is she okay? - She was hit.

14
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,280
He was way too faint-hearted.

15
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,319
Do not be sad.

16
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,149
Everything worked out nicely.

17
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,680
It is time to wake up.

18
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,500
Your wound should not be too severe.

19
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,430
I avoided...

20
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,139
the vital points on purpose.

21
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,850
Are you...

22
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,660
looking for this?

23
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,840
I will kill you without fail!

24
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,350
I can tell by the way you hold the sword...

25
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,680
that you are trained quite exquisitely.

26
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,650
However,

27
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,560
you make unnecessary actions.

28
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:47,030
It does not seem like you have ever killed anyone.

29
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,269
I thought I made myself clear.

30
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,600
I avoided your vital points on purpose.

31
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,139
That is not something you can touch and taint.

32
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,539
Give it back to me!

33
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,250
This time, I will hit your vital point.

34
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,750
Did you wish to get your revenge purely on your bravado?

35
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,280
How arrogant.

36
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,889
Do you wish to follow your parents' suit?

37
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,389
I was ready to die when I came this far.

38
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:35,309
Killing someone who already came ready to die...

39
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,510
sounds a little...

40
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:42,479
too easy.

41
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,729
Ma'am!

42
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,999
Her heart stopped. I need help!

43
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,280
I cannot lose you again like this.

44
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,390
No.

45
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:29,660
I need to save her. I need to do whatever it takes.

46
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,070
- Jun O. - Let go of me.

47
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,629
Let go!

48
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,749
It looks like...

49
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,549
you and I will...

50
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:56,090
miss each other to the end.

51
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,669
(Moon in the Day)

52
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,270
(Episode 4)

53
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,970
I have had more than one or two like you.

54
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,669
Who sent you here?

55
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:00,749
Just kill me instead.

56
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:06,960
I already told you.

57
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:10,299
It is too easy if you ask me to kill you.

58
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:23,840
Good choice.

59
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,199
You might have thought...

60
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,799
I would give up and leave if you humiliated me like this.

61
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,669
Just wait.

62
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:56,140
I will make sure you regret letting me live.

63
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,710
I told you to burn the garbage, not the laundry.

64
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,749
Where did the lord find this dazed girl?

65
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,059
Give it to me.

66
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,640
The daughter of the Great Gaya's general...

67
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,510
had been alive.

68
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,029
Your shoulder is probably still unwell.

69
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:58,409
You are training very hard this early in the morning.

70
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,440
You would miss my foot...

71
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,249
even if I was standing in front of you.

72
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,820
I thought you would run away before half a day was up.

73
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,790
I guess you were not such a reckless girl.

74
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,359
This is the only way to survive...

75
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,129
and plan for the future.

76
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
My lord.

77
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:27,800
Is that why...

78
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,139
you work as a maid by day and train in the morning...

79
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,279
to take my life?

80
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,379
That is correct.

81
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,210
When you load the bow,

82
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,909
the arrow must always remain in the same spot.

83
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,649
That way, it is easier to calculate the error,

84
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,720
and it increases your accuracy rate.

85
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,430
Be it my arrow or my sword,

86
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,899
it will end up in your chest.

87
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,200
To do that,

88
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,310
spread your feet...

89
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
in shoulder width.

90
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,749
You need to know how to shoot an arrow...

91
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,680
to shoot one and kill me.

92
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,720
Teach me.

93
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,960
Pull the string further back...

94
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,399
because your hand slows down when you let it go.

95
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,769
Can you do this?

96
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,680
Make your shot simple and quick.

97
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,320
Relax your shoulder unless you want to be crippled for life.

98
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:26,989
Now.

99
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,560
Aim for the neck instead of the head.

100
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,759
If you aim for the torso, aim for the center.

101
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,060
That is how you will kill me.

102
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,570
If you had taken that shot at me,

103
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,909
I would have died right now...

104
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:53,779
in your hands.

105
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Continue.

106
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,070
Now.

107
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,680
Aim for the neck instead of the head.

108
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,950
If you aim for the torso, aim for the center.

109
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,409
That is how you will kill me.

110
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,450
Why does he talk like someone who wants to die?

111
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,769
General Kim Do Ha, lift your head.

112
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,648
Do Ha, you have rendered distinguished service...

113
00:12:58,649 --> 00:12:59,950
in our conquest of the Great Gaya.

114
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,779
How shall I reward you?

115
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,989
It was my father's order to fight in this war.

116
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,989
I had to win the war to fulfill my duty as his son.

117
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,389
Therefore, the contribution and the reward are also my father's.

118
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,229
Head So, you have found yourself a great stepson.

119
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:21,029
Thanks to our general who always returns in victory,

120
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:24,670
you always receive the contribution and reward.

121
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,970
I am grateful...

122
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,879
to be of your help...

123
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,749
by adopting a great stepson, Your Majesty.

124
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,950
Yes, of course. It is quite helpful.

125
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,359
You have grown rather old, so you can finally relax in peace.

126
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,960
There would not be a problem in leaving your position to him.

127
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:51,399
I also feel rest assured.

128
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,639
I heard you killed Gaya's general with a single arrow.

129
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,909
I would like to see your excellence in archery.

130
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,540
You may accompany my hunt today.

131
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,509
Of course.

132
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Your Majesty.

133
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,149
Allow me to escort you today.

134
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,450
Why should you do that?

135
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,560
My son just returned from war,

136
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,259
and he is still unwell.

137
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,930
I would be ashamed as his father...

138
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:25,070
if he failed to show you everything he could do.

139
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,369
Your Majesty.

140
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,499
I received my talent in archery from my father.

141
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:33,269
You should grant my father a chance.

142
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,249
"Of course?"

143
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:53,330
You got to join His Majesty in his hunt, just as you wished.

144
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,560
You still do not look pleased.

145
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,300
All His Majesty could talk about was you.

146
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,710
He decided to grant you...

147
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,810
some land and soldiers as the reward for this victory.

148
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:12,779
Are you not happy?

149
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,119
I am not...

150
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,350
happy.

151
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,989
You are not happy?

152
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:23,060
Yes, that sounds like my son.

153
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,460
I shall give you the reward.

154
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,159
In the next battle,

155
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:31,629
you should return with injury.

156
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:34,369
That way, I will not feel embarrassed...

157
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,070
to be worried about you.

158
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,979
General, our dear General.

159
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,790
What is this?

160
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,999
Yes, that is a present from Lord So to commemorate your victory.

161
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,119
What are those?

162
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,979
They look like berries.

163
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,759
Yew berries.

164
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,430
It is as sweet as ripe persimmon, but its seed carries deadly poison.

165
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,269
It is used to coat the arrowhead before we go to war.

166
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,399
I see.

167
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:44,739
He must have given it to you to bid for victory in the next war.

168
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,340
Those who wish to take their own lives...

169
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,909
also eat this berry.

170
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,050
Sorry?

171
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,879
Goodness. Should I remove it?

172
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,550
No.

173
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,690
It is still a token from my father.

174
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:20,869
You have lovely hands.

175
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,409
I have never seen you here before.

176
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,040
Put everything in front of me.

177
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:27,409
Everything is safe for you to eat.

178
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,419
All right.

179
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:46,990
Let us eat.

180
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:48,899
Yes, Father.

181
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,969
You may leave.

182
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,480
Come here.

183
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,889
What took you so long?

184
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:17,619
Is the father making his son check the food for poison?

185
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,129
Gosh.

186
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,830
It is because he is not his biological son.

187
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,330
And Lord Do Ha is not an ordinary man either.

188
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,500
He never skips a meal and does it every time.

189
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,699
Is he not afraid of death?

190
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,679
You have found a new maid.

191
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:47,090
Her hands were as lovely as her looks.

192
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,189
The hunt must have been boring.

193
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,659
You are suddenly discussing that lowly maid.

194
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,800
It was the first time...

195
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,070
you took in a woman without my consent.

196
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,369
I just took her...

197
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:09,540
instead of debt.

198
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,109
"Debt."

199
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,830
It is because he is not his biological son.

200
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:28,859
He never skips a meal and does it every time.

201
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,199
I guess he doesn't fear death.

202
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:37,270
- It bothers me. - I know. She annoys me so much.

203
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,570
Hey. She's coming.

204
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,449
You can't even carry a tray.

205
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:49,350
Is there anything you can do?

206
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:53,750
Don't get in our way by not doing chores right.

207
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,790
Instead, follow and attend to Lord Do Ha today.

208
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,689
I don't know if you'll be able to follow him, though.

209
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:08,529
Have fun.

210
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,369
- It serves her right. - I know.

211
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,570
We'll see how you do it.

212
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,639
Where do I have to go?

213
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,310
The day is shorter today, so we should hurry.

214
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,919
What are you doing here?

215
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,918
Where are the other servants?

216
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,429
Do you also think I'm good for nothing?

217
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:36,800
It's not a place for you to go. Get someone else.

218
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,500
Don't worry.

219
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,530
I'm good for something too.

220
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,209
What are you doing? You said we need to hurry.

221
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Right.

222
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,280
Stay here.

223
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,459
Why is he taking so long?

224
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,699
The sun is about to set.

225
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,850
What is he doing?

226
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,330
Who are you praying for?

227
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:40,810
I told you to stay there.

228
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,580
It better not be...

229
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,209
what I think it is.

230
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:55,520
It is to commemorate the people of Gaya...

231
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,859
whose bodies they couldn't recover.

232
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,830
You can see the land of the Great Gaya the best...

233
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,859
from here.

234
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:14,270
After killing numerous people,

235
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:16,179
how could you...

236
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,310
It was my mission to destroy the Great Gaya.

237
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,350
I had no other choice...

238
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,820
but to exterminate...

239
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,089
Gaya's rebel forces and their family...

240
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,419
to end the war as quickly as possible.

241
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,719
If you had no other choice,

242
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,530
why do you pray for them?

243
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,859
I did it because I had no other choice,

244
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,800
but it's still a sin.

245
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:42,969
Do you think your sin will vanish by piling up some rocks?

246
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:50,409
I should pray for them, though it's shallow...

247
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:52,449
so that one day,

248
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:57,219
I will dare to sleep free from resentment and cries...

249
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,020
of the people I killed.

250
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,959
Are you saying you're feeling guilty now?

251
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,289
How dare you ask for forgiveness to feel at ease?

252
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,929
Even if I beg for forgiveness,

253
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,899
they won't ever forgive me, will they?

254
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,540
Han Ri Ta.

255
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,469
The daughter of Gaya's general.

256
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,740
How did you...

257
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,449
Your father...

258
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:31,850
was a brave general who wouldn't back down at the war.

259
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,619
I could even remember vividly...

260
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,619
the sentence written on his sword.

261
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,189
Stop being hypocritical.

262
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,990
Nothing's going to change even if you act like this.

263
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
That's right.

264
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:46,570
That's the way it should be.

265
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:52,439
Even if I turn back the clock,

266
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:57,040
I would make the same choice.

267
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,719
So, you should...

268
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:09,090
never forgive me.

269
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,570
I don't care if your apology is sincere or not.

270
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,609
You are still my enemy.

271
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:38,750
I don't see the horses.

272
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,290
Did you keep the reins untied?

273
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,330
It's the servants' job to tie...

274
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,199
Follow me.

275
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:55,270
It's too late.

276
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:57,100
You can't find the horses that ran away.

277
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,209
Wild animals will come out after the sunset.

278
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,580
Are you going to stay here all night long?

279
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,480
If you walk too slow, I'm going to leave you behind.

280
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,919
Don't worry.

281
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:17,060
I will follow you by any means, even if you leave me behind.

282
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,230
No matter where I go,

283
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,340
you will find me.

284
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,770
Of course. It's obvious.

285
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,040
It gets cold at night.

286
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,609
Wearing wet clothes...

287
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,340
does not help you to recover.

288
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,750
You should be in good condition, at least if you want to kill me.

289
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,090
Come over here.

290
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:15,969
Do you really think I cannot kill you?

291
00:31:16,939 --> 00:31:18,939
I think you can.

292
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,149
Maybe you can...

293
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,060
end...

294
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:37,399
my eternal sufferings.

295
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,730
You think you can trick me with your words?

296
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:43,699
That you can feel guilty does not make you a better person.

297
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,949
It was the fiery pit I chose.

298
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,850
I always had to obey...

299
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,119
my father's commands,

300
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:07,959
even if it was a murder.

301
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,030
Aim for the neck instead of the head.

302
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,199
If you aim for the torso, aim for the center.

303
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,300
That is how...

304
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,740
you will kill me.

305
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:25,179
The words you told me when teaching me the archery.

306
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,550
They were all true.

307
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,590
You want me to finish your sufferings with my own hands?

308
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:38,560
You should have killed yourself at first.

309
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,959
I expected myself to be a better being someday.

310
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,800
But it was just a dream...

311
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:52,570
unreachable in this life.

312
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:56,740
If I am killed by your hands,

313
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,850
it will be worth dying as a human being.

314
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,889
No, that cannot be a revenge.

315
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,929
It is because even if I kill you,

316
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,500
you do not feel any pain.

317
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:18,300
It is what you want!

318
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,669
Maybe you are right.

319
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,969
You have no right to do this.

320
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,010
You took many precious lives.

321
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,010
Then you should take your life seriously.

322
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:35,050
Because it is too easy to kill someone who is ready for death!

323
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,490
Stay alive.

324
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,820
Whatever it takes.

325
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,030
I do not care about your suffering.

326
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:50,859
You should survive whatever it takes.

327
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,139
Someday, when you are desperate to survive,

328
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,810
I will kill you no matter what.

329
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:14,949
Lord did not come back.

330
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,119
You see? I was right.

331
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,929
Something must have come up between the lord and her.

332
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,388
Seriously?

333
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,330
You are so slow-witted.

334
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,698
I did not know!

335
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,900
She did not know how to buckle down.

336
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,169
That darn girl.

337
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,068
I knew it. From the beginning...

338
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,609
When she came as a maid suddenly, it looked strange.

339
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,770
That is why...

340
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,810
- Do Ha did not come back? - He did not, my lord.

341
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,020
He left alone?

342
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,319
He left with his maid.

343
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,949
Was it the new maid?

344
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,360
How did you know that, my lord?

345
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,029
Check who she is and report me.

346
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,830
Do it in secret.

347
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yes, my lord.

348
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,739
"Stay alive."

349
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:19,339
I did not know to hear from the one who came to kill me.

350
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,528
If you suddenly rise like that...

351
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:41,589
Where is Young Hwa?

352
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,199
She turned the corner, at least.

353
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,330
In the ward, there are...

354
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,679
- Follow him. - Yes, sir.

355
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,179
(Ward B)

356
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,520
(Name: Kang Young Hwa)

357
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,549
If it happened early,

358
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:40,219
she could have gotten away with it.

359
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:01,009
My lord...

360
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,880
My lord...

361
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,119
(Ward A)

362
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,360
Jun O!

363
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:23,460
She woke up. I will let the doctor come.

364
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:24,730
Yes.

365
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,540
Young Hwa,

366
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,770
you are in the hospital.

367
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,369
How do you feel now?

368
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,139
Was it you Mr. Han?

369
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,949
Sorry?

370
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,279
Someone was here...

371
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,089
a moment ago.

372
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:20,619
My lord.

373
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,860
It can't happen.

374
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,889
She...

375
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,290
You...

376
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,360
died long ago.

377
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,299
Young Hwa!

378
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:08,569
I hate you.

379
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,040
You should have called me the moment you woke up.

380
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,250
I think...

381
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,580
I'm actually back.

382
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,318
Have you been to the afterlife or something?

383
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,719
What do you mean, "I'm back?"

384
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,960
You know,

385
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:36,290
back from a dream...

386
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,029
that felt so real.

387
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,440
What if...

388
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,540
she's dead?

389
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,610
That means I'm a murderer. What do I do?

390
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,989
Sir,

391
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,330
I honestly don't remember a thing.

392
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:11,029
I opened my eyes,

393
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,900
and my hands were on the wheel,

394
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,500
and a woman was...

395
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,069
I doubt that was strong enough to kill her.

396
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:21,440
But...

397
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:25,739
why are you helping me, Mr. Seok?

398
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,350
It's a prize from me.

399
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:32,179
A prize?

400
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,049
You've done a fabulous job.

401
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:36,790
Things went very smoothly, thanks to you.

402
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,400
By the way, where are we?

403
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:48,469
A place...

404
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,069
where no one can find you.

405
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:01,409
(Cancer Hospital)

406
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,519
After an intentional car crash, Actor Han on the scene...

407
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,449
We'll have to keep an eye on you,

408
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,789
but the test results don't look so bad.

409
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,388
And he fled immediately.

410
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:12,689
- If you had stayed unconscious, - The police are...

411
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,588
- it could have been very dangerous. - worried about his escape...

412
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:16,460
But you regained your consciousness so fast.

413
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,528
People call you the Miraculous Firefighter for a reason.

414
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:19,829
The victim, Ms. Kang,

415
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,630
- It was a huge accident, - was moved to a nearby hospital...

416
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,169
Considering that, these are only minor injuries.

417
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,238
We have information...

418
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:26,969
- that she will make it. - Okay.

419
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,150
How did you get this?

420
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,920
It was on the ground on the scene of the accident.

421
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,420
It looked like it belonged to you.

422
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,360
I thought I'd never see it again.

423
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:52,900
Thank you, Mr. Han.

424
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,469
I can't apologize to you enough.

425
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,069
You could have died.

426
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:02,239
I jumped in before I knew it.

427
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,679
How's Jun O?

428
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,520
Was it too traumatic for him?

429
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,850
It's not that severe.

430
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,130
He's doing fine, so don't worry.

431
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,339
Maybe his condition is really bad.

432
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,639
He hasn't even called or texted.

433
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,210
(A Ward)

434
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,750
Are you going to stand here all night?

435
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,649
You can just open the door and enter.

436
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,679
I am worried...

437
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,589
that I will hesitate.

438
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,690
Hesitate to do what?

439
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,159
(Seoul Gieun Police Station)

440
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,500
Tae Ju went to see who?

441
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:39,770
Her name is Jung Yi Seul.

442
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,738
In the witness interview,

443
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,710
he claimed that he only went to say hi.

444
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:47,179
Should we trust him?

445
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,778
Why are you asking us that?

446
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:52,449
There was a scandal between Mr. Han and Ms. Jung.

447
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,849
And Mr. Han happened to get the part...

448
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,290
that Mr. Gu dropped out of.

449
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,919
I was wondering if there was a connection...

450
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,059
What kind of connection are you talking about?

451
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,600
It's a mere scandal.

452
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,060
Is that clear enough for you?

453
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,529
I read the comment section, and it wasn't a mere scandal.

454
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,568
Sang Min, give me that thing you showed me earlier.

455
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,468
I can't seem to find it.

456
00:46:14,469 --> 00:46:16,369
Just... Let me go and check.

457
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,250
What is he looking at?

458
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,508
Excuse me, Officer Moon.

459
00:46:23,509 --> 00:46:24,549
Yes, sir?

460
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:26,020
Jung Yi Seul's witness footage.

461
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,129
The witness said that they saw...

462
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,428
Tae Ju and me going at it?

463
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:39,499
It's not up to me.

464
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,769
It was decided by the higher-ups. What choice do I have?

465
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,799
But it's only ten minutes before the live broadcast!

466
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:46,469
Why can't I be on TV because of some comments?

467
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:48,170
We'll talk about this later.

468
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,639
- Producer. - Yes.

469
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,040
Good luck with lying low.

470
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,610
"Lying low?"

471
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:57,849
Why would I do that?

472
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:59,219
What do we do?

473
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,449
If people find out that you were going out with Tae Ju...

474
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:02,619
Quiet!

475
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,190
Let me think.

476
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,868
"A soul that can't leave where it died..."

477
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:17,339
"and has to wander around the place of death."

478
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:22,468
Does this have something to do with...

479
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:24,080
him obsessing over Young Hwa?

480
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,218
"Of all ghosts..."

481
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:33,279
Oh, my gosh.

482
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:35,150
What are you doing?

483
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:37,219
Why are you so surprised?

484
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,189
Is that a ghost that I shouldn't know about?

485
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,829
That's not it.

486
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,559
You just popped into my office out of nowhere.

487
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,060
You must have a lot of free time.

488
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,270
Ms. Jung?

489
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:49,500
This way.

490
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:51,199
Yes, Mr. Han.

491
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:57,239
(Gu Tae Ju Met Jung Yi Seul on the Day of the Accident?)

492
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,008
(Do you even have proof?)

493
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:02,210
(I knew something was off with Yi Seul.)

494
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,520
But everyone has already seen it.

495
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:10,860
Give me the original photo of Tae Ju and me.

496
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,659
Or destroy it completely.

497
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,330
Don't tell me...

498
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:19,529
that you already handed it over to the police.

499
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,069
I'm thinking about it.

500
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,600
You're going to abandon me?

501
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
I'm going to star in that drama with Jun O.

502
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:29,869
Are you sure that you have nothing to do with Tae Ju?

503
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,040
Are you telling me that you believe the comments saying...

504
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,250
that I tried to kill Jun O with Tae Ju?

505
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,480
There doesn't seem to be evidence that proves you weren't.

506
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,449
I used to be in a relationship with Jun O.

507
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,949
How would one kill someone that they loved?

508
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,259
I'm telling you the truth.

509
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:48,830
What should I do to make you believe me?

510
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,659
What actions from you will make me...

511
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,130
believe you?

512
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:02,009
Did you get the photo?

513
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:04,739
If I got it, would I be making this face?

514
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,310
Why did you have to cheat on him?

515
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:10,420
You should have stuck to loving Jun O.

516
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,650
What did you just say?

517
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:16,989
You cheated on him.

518
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,520
No, about love.

519
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,290
What if I wasn't in love with him,

520
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:26,299
but I am currently in love with him?

521
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,199
Pardon?

522
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,138
It's good that you took the bodyguard job.

523
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,580
All those haters even sent you get-well-soon gifts.

524
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:40,809
You didn't have to bring them here. They're too heavy.

525
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,080
Let me carry them with you.

526
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:45,279
I won't let you do that in your condition.

527
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,449
But are you sure you can be discharged this early?

528
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:52,460
You said that it was good that I took the guard job.

529
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,690
I should return to work.

530
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,630
Are you insane? Is that why you insisted on being discharged?

531
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,500
The doctor said that I could get back to my everyday life.

532
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:04,270
The contract term isn't that long. I have to keep my promise.

533
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:08,139
I smell something.

534
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,940
What?

535
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,839
Are you into Jun O?

536
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:14,880
My gosh.

537
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,380
Me? Into Jun O?

538
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,519
I like a guy...

539
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,819
who's cute, nice, and mellow.

540
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,460
Not like Jun O, who's tall,

541
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,159
has a shapely nose,

542
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:33,000
and looks like he's got stories to tell.

543
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,330
An innocent and pitiful lord...

544
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,839
with a fickle fate is not for me.

545
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,479
Your dream was about Lord Jun O?

546
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,678
No, I said that he was a prick.

547
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:51,719
Oh, a lord?

548
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:54,489
That's okay. I dream about him too.

549
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:58,920
You've had a dream about Jun O too?

550
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:03,730
Jun O and I had a lower-body bath, just the two of us.

551
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,199
Look who's talking.

552
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,130
You dreamt about your lord too.

553
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:13,239
How did Jun O look in a historical drama setting?

554
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,270
You called him your lord, then...

555
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,380
Was it a forbidden love between him, a noble lord in the Joseon Dynasty,

556
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,948
and you who were his servant that were in love?

557
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:25,219
Whatever. It was cliché and childish.

558
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,150
A heartbreaking story of a woman who loved her enemy or something.

559
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:38,900
My heart fluttered for a second, but...

560
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:41,830
What's going on?

561
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,940
Why are you blushing?

562
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:51,310
Something happened in your dream with him, right?

563
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,809
What is it?

564
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,350
Is it worse than a lower-body bath?

565
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:57,110
You're so gross. I'm not telling you anything.

566
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,540
Did you kick out...

567
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:20,400
the keepers and bodyguards so that you could just stand there?

568
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:25,880
Are you going to starve until Ms. Kang returns?

569
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:33,850
I'm going to ask her to come back as soon as she's recovered,

570
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,389
so don't worry.

571
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,049
But you were against it.

572
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,420
I'm still against it.

573
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,730
She has her personal life,

574
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:44,360
and we're the only ones causing her harm.

575
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:48,770
Do you get how sorry for her I am about this accident?

576
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,369
Why?

577
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,409
Does it bother you that she's injured?

578
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,739
There's only one person that I worry about.

579
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,080
My brother, Jun O.

580
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,949
I can be as shameless as possible before Ms. Kang...

581
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,389
if it means reducing your pain.

582
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:10,319
If there's even little chance of a miracle,

583
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:14,560
I'm willing to risk my life.

584
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,770
Doctor Choi said that you might be in pain due to the shock.

585
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:30,569
Take 1 pill every 12 hours.

586
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:34,810
Also,

587
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:39,980
if we're reborn in our next life,

588
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:43,020
you can be my older brother.

589
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,429
That way, you'll see how the older brother feels.

590
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,230
I have a meeting to get to.

591
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,310
When someone is reborn,

592
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:09,710
they usually don't remember...

593
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,520
anything.

594
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,380
Have you come to see me?

595
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:56,389
I never noticed...

596
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,830
how she looked exactly the same.

597
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:07,199
Moon, bright moon

598
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:15,350
Where do you go in the day

599
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:23,119
To come back to us at night?

600
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:30,900
Moon, bright moon

601
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,460
Give me a moment. I'll come down there.

602
00:56:05,659 --> 00:56:06,659
Jun O...

603
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,040
What? Why did he just leave?

604
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,520
(Call Records)

605
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:32,960
(Han Jun O)

606
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,659
Jun O.

607
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,569
(Oxipod)

608
00:56:51,779 --> 00:56:53,540
"Narcotic analgesic?"

609
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:02,719
Jun O.

610
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,690
Jun O!

611
00:57:10,529 --> 00:57:11,600
Jun O?

612
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:13,799
Hey.

613
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,540
I have to call Mr. Han.

614
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:22,710
No. Call an ambulance first.

615
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,100
Jun O, are you all right?

616
00:57:57,069 --> 00:57:58,110
What are you trying to do?

617
00:58:00,279 --> 00:58:01,350
Just a second.

618
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:10,520
Your pulse is too fast.

619
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,029
(Oxipod)

620
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,130
How many of these have you taken?

621
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,770
Were you trying to kill yourself?

622
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:25,000
What are you?

623
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:27,969
What?

624
00:58:30,009 --> 00:58:33,139
Who are you?

625
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,779
What is wrong with you?

626
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,880
How many did you take...

627
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,650
to forget who I am?

628
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:45,319
I kept taking them,

629
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,759
but the pain didn't go away.

630
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,929
I'm still clueless,

631
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:00,199
even after 1,500 years.

632
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:06,839
You make me so weak, and I can't tell...

633
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:12,480
who you are.

634
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,420
And...

635
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,029
why am I so hesitant?

636
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:31,900
Listen to me, Jun O.

637
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,969
I'm here to save your life.

638
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,239
So, man up...

639
00:59:42,049 --> 00:59:43,310
and only think about surviving.

640
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:47,650
Survive.

641
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:50,089
Whatever you do, survive.

642
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,020
To win,

643
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,290
you will also have to live for a thousand years.

644
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:59,900
As long as I'm here, you can never die.

645
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:48,909
(Moon in the Day)

646
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:53,079
Han Ri Ta's 19th reincarnation is Young Hwa.

647
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,489
The one who confined me here.

648
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,619
I have to go and take back what's important to me.

649
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,389
The victims completely vanished.

650
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,830
Do you think you can commute to work from Jun O's place?

651
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:10,730
I thought I saw you in my dream.

652
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,569
Young Hwa, who on earth are you?
