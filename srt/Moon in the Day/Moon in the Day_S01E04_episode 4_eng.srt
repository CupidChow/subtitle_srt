1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,790

2
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,070

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,320

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,520

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,250

6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,510

7
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,570
Han Joon Oh! Move!

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,350
Kang Yeong Hwa.

9
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,760
Kang Yeong Hwa. Kang Yeong Hwa, wake up.

10
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,980

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,300
How could he be so weak?

12
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,620
Don't be so sad.

13
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,080
Things worked out perfectly.

14
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,730
 It is time to wake up now.

15
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,520
 Your wound should not be too severe.

16
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,360
 I made sure...

17
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,050
 to avoid the vital point.

18
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,560
 By chance...

19
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,550
 are you looking for this?

20
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,570
 I will kill you no matter what!

21
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,710
 The way you are holding the sword

22
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,750
 tells me you learned how to combat quite a bit.

23
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,100
 But...

24
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,350
 you act a bit clumsily.

25
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,040
 It seems you never killed someone before.

26
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,370
 I think I told you.

27
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,460
 That I avoided the vital point on purpose.

28
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,240
 That is not something you are allowed to defile.

29
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,530
 Give it to me!

30
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,260
 I will aim for the vital point this time.

31
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,600
 You dare try taking revenge with courage only.

32
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,280
 How arrogant you are.

33
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,960
 Do you wish to join your parents?

34
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,540
 I would not have come this far if I were not willing to die.

35
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,270
 Killing someone willing to die...

36
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,360
 seems kind of...

37
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,330
 too easy.

38
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,610
 Ma'am!

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,970
It's a cardiac arrest. Help!

40
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,540
 I cannot lose you like this again.

41
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,340
No.

42
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,210
I need to save her.

43
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,030
I need to save her no matter what.

44
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,400
- Joon Oh. 
 - Let go.

45
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,350
Let go!

46
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,800
 It appears you and I...

47
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,600
 will never...

48
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,030
 cross paths.

49
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,330

50
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,600

51
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,040
There were plenty of people like you.

52
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,670
Who sent you here?

53
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,780
You might as well kill me.

54
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,860
Did I not tell you?

55
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,420
Death is too light of a punishment.

56
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,110
You made the right decision.

57
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,280
 You must have thought I would give up if you humiliated me like this.

58
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,210
 Just wait and see.

59
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,480
 I will make sure you regret sparing me.

60
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,530
I told you to burn trash, not laundry.

61
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,620
Why did he find someone so clumsy like you?

62
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,460
Give it to me.

63
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,660
 The daughter of the great general of Gaya...

64
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,570
 was alive.

65
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,080
Your shoulder could not have healed yet.

66
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,490
But you are practicing so hard so early in the morning.

67
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,570
Even if you were up close,

68
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,250
it would not even reach the tip of your toe.

69
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,770
I thought you would run away in less than half a day.

70
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,400
I suppose you are not just reckless.

71
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,490
Because this is the only way to survive and plan for the future...

72
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,590
My Lord.

73
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,450
So...

74
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,710
you are a servant during the day

75
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,660
and you are practicing to kill me like this at dawn?

76
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,390
Of course. Without a doubt.

77
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,120
When you shoot an arrow, you always

78
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,700
have to hit the same spot accurately.

79
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,730
That way, you can calculate the error...

80
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,750
and your accuracy rate will go up.

81
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,360
Whether it is with an arrow or a sword,

82
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,970
it will end up in your chest.

83
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,920
In order to do that,

84
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,250
move your feet.

85
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,520
As wide as your shoulders.

86
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,500
You need to know how to shoot an arrow in order to kill me with one.

87
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,670
Go ahead and teach me.

88
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,860
If you pull the bowstring far,

89
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,480
it will slow down your hands when you fire.

90
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,690
Can you do it?

91
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,600
Firing needs to be short and quick.

92
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,300
Relax your shoulders unless you want to stop using them forever.

93
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,550
Here.

94
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,750
Aim for the throat rather than the head. Aim for the center of the torso.

95
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,110
That way, you can kill me.

96
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,490
If you had shot an arrow like this,

97
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,020
I would have been killed just now...

98
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,710
by you.

99
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,930
Shoot more.

100
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,510
 Here.

101
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,280
 Aim for the throat rather than the head.

102
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,650
 And aim for the center of the torso.

103
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,240
 That way, you can kill me.

104
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,300
He acts like he wants to die.

105
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,870
Great General Kim Do Ha, lift your head.

106
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,820
Do Ha, you contributed significantly to the conquering of the Great Gaya.

107
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,500
What do you want as a reward?

108
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,330
I fought that war following my father's order.

109
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,440
It was my duty to win as a son.

110
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,950
It was his achievement, and he should be rewarded.

111
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,140
Minister So Ri Bu, you chose the right son to adopt.

112
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,050
Thanks to the Great General who always brings victory,

113
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,090
you take all the credit and rewards.

114
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:26,760
Being able to support you with my adopted son

115
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,090
makes me very happy.

116
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,660
Of course, he is a great support.

117
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,960
You have aged now. You can finally rest.

118
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,240
You can even pass down your position to him now.

119
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,450
I feel very much assured to have him as well.

120
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,300
I heard you killed Gaya's great general with just one arrow.

121
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,260
I would like to see your excellent archery skills.

122
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,850
You should join me hunting today.

123
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,910
It would be my pleasure.

124
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,580
Your Majesty,

125
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,670
I will accompany you today.

126
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,550
Why should you?

127
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,250
My son just came back from the war.

128
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,060
He has not recovered yet.

129
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,580
If he cannot do his best,

130
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,240
I would be humiliated as his father.

131
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,250
Your Majesty, I inherited my archery skills from my father as well.

132
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,300
You should give him a chance as well.

133
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,330
 It would be my pleasure.

134
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,270
You are joining His Majesty for hunting as you wish.

135
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,400
But you still look troubled.

136
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,350
His Majesty could not stop talking about you.

137
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,650
He promised to reward me with land and soldiers for that victory.

138
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,900
That is happy news.

139
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,180
I am...

140
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,730
not happy.

141
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,880
You are not happy?

142
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,690
Yes. That is my son.

143
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,400
I will reward you myself.

144
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,800
Get injured somewhere in the next war.

145
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,880
So I do not feel embarrassed

146
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,210
for worrying about you.

147
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,370
The great general. My great general.

148
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,960
What is this?

149
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,130
Sir So Ri Bu gave it to you as a victory reward.

150
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,760
What is that thing?

151
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,060
They look like berries.

152
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,680
They are taxus berries.

153
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,610
The flesh is as sweet as ripe persimmon, but the seed is poisonous.

154
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,210
You put the poison on the arrowhead before you fight in the war.

155
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,260
He gave it to you so you win the next war as well.

156
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,000
People take these berries to commit suicide as well.

157
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,620
Pardon?

158
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,910
Goodness.

159
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,850
Should I put them away?

160
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,290
It is all right.

161
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,580
It is still from my father.

162
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,940
What beautiful hands.

163
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,560
I have never seen you before.

164
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,140
Put everything in front of me.

165
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,380
You may eat.

166
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,160
Yes.

167
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,710
Let us eat.

168
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,760
Yes, Father.

169
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,830
You may leave now.

170
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,730
Come.

171
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,500
Come here.

172
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,850
Why did you come out so late?

173
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,680
Is the father making his son check for poison?

174
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,380
It is because he is not his biological son.

175
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,510
Lord Do Ha is extraordinary as well.

176
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,490
He does this every single meal.

177
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,780
I suppose he is not afraid to die.

178
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,650
You have a new servant.

179
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:44,030
Her hands are as pretty as her face.

180
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,500
Hunting must have been boring for you...

181
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,810
to mention a lowly servant.

182
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:00,100
It is because this is your first time bringing in a woman without my permission.

183
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,310
She was given to me...

184
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,010
instead of a payment for debt.

185
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,960
Debt, huh?

186
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,000
 It is because he is not his biological son.

187
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,240
 He does this every single meal.

188
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,120
 I suppose he is not afraid to die.

189
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,670
I hate it.

190
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,260
She is so annoying.

191
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,450
Here she comes.

192
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,490
You cannot even carry a tray.

193
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,350
What is it that you know how to do?

194
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,830
Do not be clumsy with chores and get in the way.

195
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,840
You should serve Lord Do Ha today.

196
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,000
Although I am not sure you can handle it.

197
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,580
You deal with it. Serves you right.

198
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,180
- I know. 
 - Let us see how well you do it.

199
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,710
Where am I supposed to go?

200
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,380
The day is short today. We need to hurry...

201
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,390
What are you doing here?

202
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,820
Where are the other servants?

203
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,810
Do you also think I do not know how to do anything?

204
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,270
It is not a place you should go. Bring someone else.

205
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,950
Do not worry.

206
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,730
I know how to do things, too.

207
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,400
What are you doing? You said we need to hurry.

208
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,440
Do not follow me.

209
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,180
 Why is he not back yet?

210
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,680
 Looks like the sun is going down.

211
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,850
What is he doing?

212
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,600
Who are you praying for?

213
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,400
I thought I told you not to come up.

214
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,380
Could it be...

215
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,350
It better not be what I am thinking.

216
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,990
It is for the people of Gaya whose bodies were not even collected.

217
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,650
This is the place with the best view of

218
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,840
the Great Gaya.

219
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,670
You killed all those people.

220
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,470
How dare you—

221
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,690
It was my duty to destroy Great Gaya.

222
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,380
The massacre of the rebels in Gaya

223
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,750
and their families...

224
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,880
was unavoidable in order to end the war quickly.

225
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,150
If it was unavoidable, why are you praying for them?

226
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,970
Even if it was unavoidable,

227
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,040
a sin is still a sin.

228
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,020
You think stacking a few stones will make your sin disappear?

229
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,130
I need to be shallow like this, at least.

230
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,560
That way, someday,

231
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,780
I dare hope I sleep soundly free from the bitter grudge

232
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,760
and screams of the people I killed.

233
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,790
Are you saying you feel guilty now?

234
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,160
You ask for forgiveness just so you feel better?

235
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,140
Asking for forgiveness does not mean

236
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,990
I will be forgiven.

237
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,430
Han Ri Ta.

238
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,620
The daughter of the great general of Gaya.

239
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,220
How did you—

240
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,840
Your father...

241
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,610
was a brave general who did not back down on the battlefield.

242
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,580
The crest on the sword he was swinging

243
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,800
is still clear in my head—

244
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,910
Do not be a hypocrite.

245
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,530
This does not change anything.

246
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,350
Yes.

247
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,400
It should not.

248
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,520
Even if I go back to that time,

249
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,190
I would have made the same decision.

250
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,740
So do not ever...

251
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,110
forgive me.

252
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,570
 Whether your apology was sincere or not,

253
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,590
 the fact that you are my enemy does not change.

254
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,810
I do not see the horses.

255
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,330
Did you keep the reins loose?

256
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,420
That is the servants' job to...

257
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,050
Follow me.

258
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:54,180
It is too late. You cannot find the horses that ran away.

259
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,510
Wild beasts come out after the sunset.

260
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,640
Will you stay here like this all night?

261
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,550
I will abandon you if you walk too slowly.

262
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,130
Do not worry. I will follow you even if you do.

263
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,160
No matter where I go,

264
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,370
I see you will be able to find me.

265
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,790
Of course. That goes without saying.

266
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,190
It is chilly at night.

267
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:42,560
Keeping wet clothes on cannot be good for the wound.

268
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,930
You should be in good health to kill me.

269
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,160
Come closer.

270
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,760
You must think I will not be able to kill you.

271
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,230
I think you will be able to.

272
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,940
Perhaps you might...

273
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,110
be able to...

274
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,720
free me from this hell.

275
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,510
Do you think you could fool me like that?

276
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,740
Are you proud that you feel a little guilty?

277
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,220
I chose to be in this hell.

278
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,750
If my father ordered me to,

279
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,140
killing someone...

280
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,030
should have been nothing to me.

281
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,640
 Aim for the throat rather than the head.

282
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,260
 And aim for the center of the torso. That way...

283
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,650
 you can kill me.

284
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,010
The things you said to me while teaching me archery.

285
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,750
You meant all of them.

286
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,580
You want me to free you from hell?

287
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,660
Why did you not die, to begin with?

288
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,130
I thought I might be able to live like a human.

289
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,740
But I cannot achieve...

290
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,680
that dream while I am alive.

291
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,970
But if you kill me,

292
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,030
I think I can die like a human being, at least.

293
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,010
No. That cannot be revenge.

294
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,850
Even if I killed you, you would not be in pain at all.

295
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,380
Because that is what you wanted.

296
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,060
That might be true.

297
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,980
You do not have the right to be like this.

298
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,030
You took other people's precious lives.

299
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,340
But you cannot think lightly of yours.

300
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,120
It is too easy to kill someone who is willing to die!

301
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,560
Live.

302
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,800
Live no matter what.

303
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,800
I do not care what your hell is like.

304
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,140
Hang in there with all of your might and live.

305
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,510
When you start wanting to live desperately,

306
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,130
I will make sure to kill you then.

307
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,870
Lord Do Ha and she did not return.

308
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,070
See? I told you.

309
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,120
There is something going on between him and her.

310
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,310
Really?

311
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,500
- Yes! 
 - Can you not read the air?

312
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,840
- I did not know. 
 - She did not seem uneasy at all.

313
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,030
That crafty little thing.

314
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:30,440
I knew it was strange when he suddenly wanted her as his servant.

315
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,730
I know. It is true. It is true.

316
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,760
- Do Ha has not come back? 
 - No, sir.

317
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,110
Did he leave alone?

318
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,400
He left with his servant girl.

319
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,130
Was it the new one by chance?

320
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,390
How did you know?

321
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,400
Find out about that girl.

322
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,970
You will have to be discreet.

323
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,200
Yes, sir.

324
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,200
♫  The bright day has gone  ♫

325
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:27,300
♫  And I'm stuck under the dark sky  ♫

326
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:33,950
♫  Through a lonely flower petal that's blowing in the wind  ♫

327
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:39,410
♫  I'm conveying my desperate heart  ♫

328
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:46,690
♫  Since I met you again, 
 I couldn't see you even though you were next to me  ♫

329
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:53,430
♫  My season was stolen in all these years  ♫

330
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,900
♫  I will not get tired  ♫

331
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:08,180
♫  So I can smile on the spring day that will be blindingly bright  ♫

332
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,670
I am being told to live...

333
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,400
only from the person who came to kill me.

334
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:37,800
♫  Even that moonlight in the clouds is looking away as if it knows us  ♫

335
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:44,720
♫  Amidst time that is passing by cruelly  ♫

336
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,050
♫  I still try to smile again  ♫

337
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:57,260
♫  Since I met you again, 
 I couldn't see you even though you were next to me  ♫

338
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:04,080
♫  My season was stolen in all these years  ♫

339
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,500
♫  I will not get tired  ♫

340
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:20,900
♫  So I can smile on the spring day that will be blindingly bright  ♫

341
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,920
- You can't get up so fast like that— 
 - How's Kang Yeong Hwa?

342
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,200
She made it through the worst part.

343
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,510
She's in the ward right now—

344
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,660
- Go that way. 
 - Okay.

345
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,610

346
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,640
 If this happened sooner,

347
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,240
 she would not have gone through all that.

348
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,930
My Lord.

349
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,870
 My Lord.

350
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,770

351
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,470
Joon Oh.

352
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,700
She woke up. I'll get the doctor.

353
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,400
Okay.

354
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,600
Ms. Yeong Hwa.

355
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,890
You're at the hospital.

356
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,430
How are you feeling?

357
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,980
Was it you, CEO Han?

358
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,410
Pardon?

359
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,150
Someone...

360
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,110
was here just now.

361
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,340
 My Lord.

362
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,850
 This is not possible.

363
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,750
 She...

364
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,990
 You...

365
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,490
 died a long time ago.

366
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,260
Kang Yeong Hwa!

367
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,560
You jerk.

368
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,160
You should've called me first if you woke up.

369
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,950
I guess I really came back.

370
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,210
Did you experience the afterlife or something?

371
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,770
What do you mean you came back?

372
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,730
I was just...

373
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,250
in a long dream.

374
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,970
It felt so real.

375
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:42,580
 What if that woman died?

376
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,540
That'd make me... That'd definitely make me a murderer.

377
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,240
What do I do...

378
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,760
I really don't remember anything.

379
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,330
When I woke up, I was driving

380
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,610
and some woman was—

381
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,270
I'm sure that won't kill her.

382
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,030
By the way,

383
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,730
why are you helping me, CEO Seok?

384
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,470
This is my reward to you.

385
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,340
- Reward? 
 - You did a very good job.

386
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,680
Things went as planned.

387
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,130
What?

388
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,350
By the way, where are we?

389
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,460
It's somewhere...

390
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,210
no one can find you.

391
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,520
 After running into them on purpose, Mr. Han, who was at the scene...

392
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,520
We'll have to keep an eye on you,

393
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,270
- but the test results aren't bad, either. 
  - He ran away from the scene.

394
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:10,520

It could've been dangerous if the coma had gone on longer.

395
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,710
But you regained consciousness quickly, too.

396
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,640
They call you the miraculous firefighter for a reason.

397
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,540
It was a major accident.

398
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,410
But you barely got injured, considering.

399
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,580
- I see. 
  - Fortunately, her injuries are not life-threatening.

400
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,840
Why do you have this, CEO Han?

401
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,050
It was found at the accident site.

402
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,240
I thought it might be yours.

403
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,850
I thought I'd never see it again.

404
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,640
Thank you, CEO Han.

405
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,310
I don't know how to thank you enough.

406
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,030
You really could've died.

407
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,040
My body responded first.

408
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,740
But how's Han Joon Oh?

409
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,650
Is he struggling a lot because of the shock?

410
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,060
It's not too bad.

411
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:17,190
He's doing well. Don't worry.

412
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,440
Is Han Joon Oh in a very bad condition?

413
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,700
He's not even reaching out.

414
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,340

415
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,950
Will you stay up all night here?

416
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,710
Just open the door and go in.

417
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,440
I...

418
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,770
am worried that I'll hesitate.

419
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,420
What do you mean?

420
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:29,510
 Goo Tae Joo met whom?

421
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,520
It's Jeong Yi Seul.

422
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,910
During the witness interview, she said they just said hello.

423
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,650
But can I believe her?

424
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,650
Why are you asking us that?

425
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,210
Han Joon Oh and Jeong Yi Seul had a scandal.

426
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,970
But Han Joon Oh was cast for the part Goo Tae Joo lost.

427
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,820
I was wondering if that's related somehow—

428
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,970
How could that be related—

429
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:01,030
It's just a scandal.

430
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,630
Does that answer your question?

431
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:06,610
According to the comments, it's not just a scandal.

432
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,470
Sang Yoon, the thing you showed me earlier...

433
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,400
Gosh, I can't read.

434
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,830
Hey, you... Excuse me. What's he doing?

435
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,830
What's he staring at like that?

436
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,510
Excuse me, Officer Moon.

437
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,530
Y-Yes?

438
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,200
Jeong Yi Seul's eyewitness video.

439
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,340
The witness saw me and Goo Tae Joo being close?

440
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,680
I had no choice. It was the higher-ups' decision. What can I do?

441
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,920
But it's 10 minutes before we go live.

442
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,490
Why can't I be on air because of some comments?

443
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,330
Gosh, let's do this next time. Next time.

444
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,630
- PD! 
 - Y-Yes.

445
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,180
Act like you're regretting for now. Okay?

446
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,360
Regretting?

447
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,740
Why would I do that—

448
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,310
What do we do?

449
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,410
If they find out you dated Goo Tae Joo—

450
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,490
Be quiet!

451
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,340
Let me think.

452
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,840

"Not being able to leave where they died,

453
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,270
these souls linger where they died."

454
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:21,320
Does this have to do with why he's obsessed with Kang Yeong Hwa?

455
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,120
"Among the souls—"

456
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,330
Gosh, geez! My gosh...

457
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,970
Why did you suddenly show up like that?

458
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,370
Why are you so startled?

459
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,060
What? Is it a ghost I shouldn't know about?

460
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,740
No, it's not that.

461
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,550
It's because you suddenly showed up in my office.

462
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,240
You must have nothing better to do.

463
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,430
Ms. Jeong.

464
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,040
This way.

465
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,230
Yes, CEO Han.

466
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,620

467
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,260

468
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,530

469
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,550
I've already seen all these.

470
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,200
Give me the original copies of the photos of Goo Tae Joo and me.

471
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,710
Or destroy it completely for me.

472
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,110
Did you...

473
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,640
already give them to the police, by chance?

474
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,010
I'm thinking about doing that.

475
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:21,400
Will you betray me like this?

476
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,470
I said I wanted to film the drama with Joon Oh.

477
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,460
Do you really have nothing to do with Goo Tae Joo?

478
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,480
"She and Goo Tae Joo plotted to kill Han Joon Oh."

479
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,580
Do you believe in comments like that?

480
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,510
There's no evidence to prove otherwise.

481
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,100
I used to date Joon Oh.

482
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,900
How could I kill someone I used to love?

483
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,350
I'm serious.

484
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,910
What can I do to make you believe me?

485
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,980
How do you think I could...

486
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,780
believe you?

487
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,230

488
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,000
Did you get them? The photos?

489
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,900
Would I be making this face if I did?

490
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,080
Why did you have to cheat on him...

491
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,420
You should've just loved Han Joon Oh.

492
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,500
What did you just say?

493
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,740
That you cheated—

494
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,450
Love.

495
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:20,620
What if he's not someone I loved,

496
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,170
but someone I love?

497
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,660
Pardon?

498
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,180
Good thing you became a bodyguard.

499
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,210
All of your haters are sending you gifts now.

500
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,800
Why did you have to carry all those heavy things?

501
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,390
Give me. I'll help you.

502
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:42,440
Come on. Not in that condition.

503
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,530
By the way, is it okay to go home so soon?

504
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,510
You said it was a good thing I became a bodyguard.

505
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,150
I should get back to it soon.

506
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:54,290
Are you crazy? Is that why you left?

507
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:57,520
The doctor said I can do everyday tasks.

508
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,330
The contract period is short. I should keep my promise.

509
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:04,730
Something's suspicious about this.

510
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:10,190
Are you into Han Joon Oh, by chance?

511
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,250
Seriously...

512
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,180
I'm into Han Joon Oh? Wow.

513
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:21,200
Unni, I like the ones who are cute, kind, and sweet.

514
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,950
He's too tall and...

515
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:26,380
his nose is straight,

516
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,210
his eyes tell too many stories,

517
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:35,160
and he's like a dreamy and pure aristocrat with a tragic fate.

518
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,880
I hate that type.

519
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:44,380
Did you dream about Han Joon Oh as an aristocrat?

520
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,520
No. I'm saying he's too much, maybe? 
  (Sounds like aristocrat or lord)

521
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,440
Oh, My Lord?

522
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,290
It's okay. I dream about him, too.

523
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:55,030
Did you really dream about Han Joon Oh, too?

524
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:59,990
Well, I dreamed about taking a bath alone with him.

525
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,520
- Yuck. 
 - How about you?

526
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,150
You dreamed that he was a lord.

527
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,740
What's the historical version of Han Joon Oh like?

528
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,250
Since he was a lordly master...

529
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,680
Forbidden love between a Joseon lord and his slave? Was it a dream like that?

530
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,200
I don't know. It was a really obvious and childish dream.

531
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:27,210
A heartbreaking story of a woman who loved her enemy. Something like that.

532
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,870
 Although my heart fluttered for a moment...

533
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,100
What?

534
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,870
Why are you blushing? Huh?

535
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:47,400
Something else happened with your lord in your dream. Right?

536
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,360
What is it? Was it more than a bath?

537
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,000
Gosh, that's so gross. Seriously...

538
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:17,380
Did you let the housekeepers and security guards leave to do this?

539
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,860
Are you planning not to eat until Ms. Kang comes?

540
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,300
I'm thinking of asking her to come back as soon as she recovers.

541
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,520
Don't worry.

542
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,230
You were opposed to it.

543
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,690
I still am.

544
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,070
She has her own personal life, too.

545
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:41,060
But we're only causing her troubles.

546
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:45,140
Do you know how guilty I feel for her because of the accident?

547
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,860
Why?

548
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:51,150
Are you concerned that she got injured?

549
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:54,710
There's only one person I'm concerned about.

550
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,310
My brother, Han Joon Oh.

551
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:01,560
It's okay to be shameless in front of her.

552
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,170
As long as you can suffer less.

553
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:07,270
If a miracle can happen,

554
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,690
I can give my life.

555
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,800
Dr. Choi said the shock could suddenly cause a lot of pain.

556
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,450
Take one every 12 hours daily.

557
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,570
And...

558
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,940
when you are born in the next life,

559
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:39,870
you be my older brother.

560
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,370
I want you to feel how I feel, too.

561
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,260
I have a meeting. I'll get going.

562
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,310
When you come into your next life,

563
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,720
you won't remember anything...

564
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,280
at all.

565
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,320
Are you here to see me?

566
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,410
 Did Kang Yeong Hwa...

567
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,700
 resemble her that much?

568
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:04,220
♫  Dear moon, moon, bright moon  ♫

569
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:12,060
♫  Where do you go during the day  ♫

570
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:19,900
♫  and come back when the night comes?  ♫

571
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:27,520
♫  Dear moon, moon, bright moon  ♫

572
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,460
Wait a moment. I'll be right down.

573
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,430
Han Joon...

574
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,990
What? Why did he just leave?

575
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,910

576
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,490
Han Joon Oh.

577
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,070

578
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:50,450
Narcotic painkiller?

579
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,540
Han Joon Oh.

580
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,520
Han Joon Oh—

581
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,030
Han Joon Oh.

582
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,430
Han Joon Oh.

583
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:16,780
I should call CEO Han... No...

584
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,630
911. 911 first.

585
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:44,150
Han Joon Oh, are you okay?

586
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,030
What are you doing...

587
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,220
Hold on.

588
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,590
Your pulse is too fast.

589
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,150

590
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,120
How much of this did you take?

591
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:18,740
Were you determined to die?

592
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:21,830
Who are you?

593
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,450
Huh?

594
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,710
I'm asking...

595
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,100
who you are.

596
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,670
What's with you?

597
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,940
How many pills did you take

598
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,580
that you don't even recognize me?

599
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:42,340
No matter how much I took,

600
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,570
my pain wouldn't go away.

601
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,840
I really don't know.

602
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:57,280
Same with 1,500 years ago and now.

603
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,800
You make me weak like this.

604
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:09,380
I don't know who you are...

605
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,280
and why...

606
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,750
why I'm hesitating.

607
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:25,650

608
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,860
Listen carefully, Han Joon Oh.

609
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:34,350
I'm here to save you.

610
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:37,170
So stop sounding so weak...

611
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:40,300
and try to live first.

612
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,560
 Live.

613
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,720
 Live no matter what.

614
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,250
 If you want to win, you'll have to live a thousand years, too.

615
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:57,070
As long as I exist, you will never die.

616
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:06,500
♫  The day you first came to me  ♫

617
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,900
♫  I still remember clearly  ♫

618
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:24,400
♫  I heard that you are like me, if you say so  ♫

619
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,690
♫  Your smile wants to shine  ♫

620
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,450
♫  Always brightening  ♫

621
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:35,660
♫  You shine so brightly  ♫

622
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,800
♫  You make me feel love  ♫

623
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,200
♫  You are alone but precious  ♫

624
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,830

625
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:49,020
 Han Ri Ta's 19th reincarnation is Kang Yeong Hwa.

626
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,490
 The one who trapped me here.

627
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:55,300
 I need to go retrieve what's important.

628
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:59,560
 The perpetrators disappeared without a trace.

629
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:04,000
 Would you be able to work from Joon Oh's place, by chance?

630
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,710
 I think I saw you in my dream.

631
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:12,480
 Kang Yeong Hwa, who are you, exactly?
