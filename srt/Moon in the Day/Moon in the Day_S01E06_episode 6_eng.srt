1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,870

2
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,467

3
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:18,367

4
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:22,117

5
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:29,377

6
00:00:41,697 --> 00:00:45,017

7
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:47,817

8
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:52,577
Han Joon Oh! Are you okay?

9
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:55,017
Why now...

10
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:58,167
Han Joon Oh! Are you okay?

11
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,407
Han Joon Oh.

12
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:04,357
Han Joon Oh, wake up! Han Joon Oh.

13
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,137
My Lord.

14
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:54,887
Joon Oh.

15
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,197
Joon Oh!

16
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:57,967
Joon Oh!

17
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,367
Joon Oh.

18
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,687
What happened?

19
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:08,567
What happened?

20
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:14,067
Stop making such a fuss.

21
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:19,017
Joon Oh.

22
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:22,057
I thought something happened to you.

23
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,927
Did your pain get worse?

24
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:25,907
How did you—

25
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:27,937
I just felt...

26
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:31,317
I just felt dizzy for a moment.

27
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,447
Is he right?

28
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:36,947
So...

29
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:42,557
He leaned on me momentarily...

30
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:55,187
Let me check just one thing.

31
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:03,987
There's a pulse.

32
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:07,197
You should've told me if you weren't feeling well.

33
00:03:07,197 --> 00:03:11,277
This is no good. Let's cancel the schedule first.

34
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:15,517
I'm sorry, but I'll get going now.

35
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:18,517
Let's talk later.

36
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,277
Ms. Kang.

37
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:24,407
I need you to do me a favor.

38
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:34,067
Well, we're here.

39
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:37,947
Oh, okay.

40
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:45,427
- Thank you, Mr. Jang. 
 - Sure.

41
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:52,917
By the way,

42
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:57,267
can I take sick leave for a few days?

43
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:59,587
I'm not feeling so well.

44
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,777
I'll tell CEO Han myself.

45
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:05,007
Well, you should talk to Joon Oh about it.

46
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:07,847
No, please just...

47
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:13,107
tell Han Joon Oh that I'll recover in just a few days.

48
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:16,147
By the way, you're really okay. Right?

49
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:18,137
Yes.

50
00:04:18,137 --> 00:04:19,337
Yes, I'm okay.

51
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:21,917
T-That's a relief.

52
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:25,017
Thank you.

53
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:26,327
Sure.

54
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:28,557
Take care. Bye.

55
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,867
 I almost...

56
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:38,667
 lost the body.

57
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,727
 I can't yet.

58
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:42,987
 Never.

59
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,607
I told you to sit down.

60
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,417
Drink some water first.

61
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:04,787
What's wrong?

62
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,287
The water's cold.

63
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:08,937
This is no good.

64
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:12,097
Let's go to the hospital and get examined properly.

65
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:14,987
Feeling dizzy enough to faint means it's serious.

66
00:05:14,987 --> 00:05:16,967
I said I'm okay.

67
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:19,777
How many times do I have to tell you?

68
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,977
Insisting won't fix anything, Joon Oh.

69
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:25,547
You just passed out.

70
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:31,367
That was something I didn't expect.

71
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:36,247
Also, the fact that Kang Yeong Hwa found out my true self.

72
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:38,117
True self?

73
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:47,327
It was definitely Lord Do Ha.

74
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:52,767
How could the person from my dreams be in front of me...

75
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,157
I just hallucinated because he resembles Han Joon Oh too much.

76
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:15,477
But it looked so real.

77
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:39,537
 W-Who are you?

78
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:42,957
 You...

79
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,977
 see me, don't you?

80
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:50,907
What? What's going on?

81
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:52,917
The mirror...

82
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:56,087
- The mirror over there... 
 - Huh?

83
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,607
What mirror?

84
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:00,277
You see the mirror over there.

85
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:12,457
What's with this memory?

86
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:19,487

87
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:22,267

88
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:42,177
I looked for you everywhere.

89
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:48,887
Were you looking for me?

90
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:53,527
I will eat with Do Ha. Prepare the dinner.

91
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:55,367
Yes, sir.

92
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:32,437
You may eat.

93
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,937
You shook your hands a lot at first.

94
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:48,167
I guess your shoulder injury is recovered now.

95
00:08:48,877 --> 00:08:51,577
How did you hurt yourself?

96
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:54,267
Did you get stabbed or something?

97
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:58,457
Why do you not answer?

98
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:03,597
It is nothing, sir.

99
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:09,887
A lowly servant got stabbed.

100
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:15,237
Was it really nothing?

101
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:18,397
 You must look everywhere.

102
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:20,177
 Yes, sir.

103
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:22,497
 Nothing here. Nothing here, either.

104
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:26,377
What are you doing right now?

105
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:30,847
I heard things in the house have been disappearing.

106
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:35,687
So I told them to be suspicious of the new servants.

107
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:53,107
All of these were found in that servant's belongings.

108
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:57,477
The evidence is so clear.

109
00:09:57,477 --> 00:10:00,277
You probably cannot deny it.

110
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:03,887
Can I take your silence as affirmation?

111
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:08,617
If I say no, will you take that as an affirmation?

112
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:14,717
What an insolent girl.

113
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,627
She has no interest in asking for forgiveness.

114
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:23,937
What should I do with her, Do Ha?

115
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:28,487
She dared to steal from my house.

116
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:31,807
We should cut off her hands and feet

117
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,027
to set an example.

118
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:39,217
She is not clearly guilty yet.

119
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:42,247
Someone could have planted evidence on purpose.

120
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:44,677
On purpose?

121
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:48,527
Who would do that for what purpose?

122
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:52,277
She is a servant I took in.

123
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,037
I will investigate thoroughly.

124
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,347
You should not worry and—

125
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:58,187
Right.

126
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:01,337
She is the servant you took in, but...

127
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:05,097
everything in this house is mine, is it not?

128
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,117
I will handle it my way.

129
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:10,917
Put her in the shed immediately and beat her

130
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,637
without pausing...

131
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:15,657
until she confesses.

132
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:17,617
 Yes, sir.

133
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:39,727
What a spiteful little thing.

134
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:45,117
How come we do not hear her screaming at all?

135
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:48,687
What is the reason you are doing this?

136
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:51,587
Are you suspicious of me right now?

137
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,397
They were all valuable things.

138
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:56,557
Not many people in the house

139
00:11:56,557 --> 00:12:00,487
can handle those things freely.

140
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,767
How strange.

141
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:07,827
Since when did you worry about the servants?

142
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:13,377
Are you worried that something might happen to her by chance?

143
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:19,287
She is just a lowly servant.

144
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:22,957
She did not appear that lowly to me.

145
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:28,067
The way she talks and behaves seems elegant and proud.

146
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:32,297
Enough to make a fellow fall for her.

147
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:37,167
 Sir.

148
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,427
You have to see this.

149
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:54,487
The traitor's child is alive?

150
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:59,757
You said someone knows what the family of the great general of Gaya looks like.

151
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:01,407
Yes.

152
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:05,107
Bring that person over as soon as the sun comes up.

153
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:09,737
I need to confirm the identity of that

154
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:11,857
suspicious servant first.

155
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,767
Yes, sir.

156
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:37,957
 How are your wounds?

157
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:45,797
My Lord.

158
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:49,457
Are you gravely injured?

159
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:56,177
 Isn't this for the better, My Lord?

160
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,067
 I am just a clumsy assassin

161
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:03,887
who arrogantly tried to kill you.

162
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:07,427
Can't you just get rid of me this way?

163
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:11,047
You said you will...

164
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:14,527
take revenge on your own.

165
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:19,337
Why are you being so weak?

166
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:26,087
Play ignorant.

167
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:29,447
Why are you trying to get so involved in this?

168
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:36,277
Meeting you...

169
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:40,407
made me want to achieve something.

170
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:56,207
Lord Do Ha?

171
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:06,097
Is she the remaining daughter of the great general of Gaya?

172
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:10,307
I will let her leave and make sure she never comes near here.

173
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:11,757
Turn a blind eye.

174
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:15,807
It is my order and a request.

175
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,527
Please forgive my loyalty to the country.

176
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,467
There is no time to waste.

177
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,357
Let us go.

178
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:06,577
The path to the former Great Gaya will appear this way.

179
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:10,387
It is dangerous because it is sloped, but no one will see you.

180
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:13,687
You did not have to kill him.

181
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:17,717
But why did you kill him?

182
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:22,117
If I did not, the whole world would know your identity. If that happens...

183
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,847
you will die.

184
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:31,797
Why are you going so far to save me?

185
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:34,687
I said...

186
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:39,527
meeting you made me want to achieve something.

187
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:43,317
Like you told me once...

188
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,247
I dearly...

189
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:51,297
dearly want to live.

190
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:54,807
How could someone like that kill his bodyguard

191
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,717
and let the traitor's daughter escape?

192
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:01,517
- What would they do to you when you return? 
 - "Make sure to survive.

193
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,430
I will make sure to come to kill you."

194
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,917
You just need to say that.

195
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:14,157
♫  Through a lonely flower petal that's blowing in the wind  ♫

196
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:16,827
♫  I'm conveying my desperate heart  ♫

197
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,857
You had better stay alive.

198
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:22,727
I will not forgive you otherwise.

199
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:27,807
♫  I couldn't see you even though you were next to me  ♫

200
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:32,297
I will make sure to come back.

201
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:35,417
I will be waiting for that day.

202
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,957
So you had better...

203
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:42,357
stay alive.

204
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:44,070
Han Ri Ta.

205
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:56,127
So, a famous celebrity showed up in your dream

206
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,897
and told you to go to the Great Gaya. Right?

207
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:02,940
Yes.

208
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,170

209
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:08,037
The dream itself isn't a problem—

210
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:11,597
I said I saw him in real life, Doctor.

211
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:15,437
When I was a kid, he used to talk to me, too—

212
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:19,187
That celebrity must've been young 20 years ago, too.

213
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:21,597
How did you recognize him?

214
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:23,457
So, you mean...

215
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:27,557
I didn't actually see him?

216
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,997
If you hallucinate again,

217
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:35,847
tell yourself, "This isn't real. This is fake."

218
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:41,307
Accepting it isn't real is the first step of the treatment.

219
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,317
You understand, right?

220
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,677
V-Venerable! Venerable!

221
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:01,387
Venerable!

222
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:03,337
Venerable!

223
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,947
Seeing how you came all the way here,

224
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:12,957
you must be furious.

225
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:15,917
Because I almost lost my body.

226
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:20,747
Does having a human body make you want to exist in this world?

227
00:20:20,747 --> 00:20:24,207
I was in this world for more than a thousand years.

228
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:27,107
Why would I want to linger?

229
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:31,027
If not, why are you hesitating so much?

230
00:20:32,307 --> 00:20:36,707
The fact that a lost soul got stuck to a human

231
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:40,977
means he has a deep resentment for the person.

232
00:20:40,977 --> 00:20:43,767
Don't you have to resolve the resentment...

233
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:47,447
so you can leave?

234
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:52,507
Since you already know,

235
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:55,527
I will skip the explanation.

236
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:14,927
I came back to resolve my deep resentment and leave.

237
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:19,027
If I hesitated to kill her, that is because...

238
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:22,817
something went wrong momentarily.

239
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:29,117
So you should never interrupt me again. If you do that again,

240
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:34,187
it will cost you more than a cup.

241
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:42,417
Deep resentments...

242
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:44,947
don't get resolved by just revenge.

243
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:49,877
Sometimes, you have to look into it closely.

244
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,557
Why are you so serious?

245
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:09,097
The doctor said it's common.

246
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:12,607
Unni,

247
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,977
it won't get worse. Right?

248
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:18,227
I'll get better if I take the medicine. Right?

249
00:22:18,227 --> 00:22:21,917
Hey! You need to pull it together.

250
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:24,397
Be quiet! Seriously...

251
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,407
Enter.

252
00:22:31,027 --> 00:22:32,887
Start.

253
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:44,417
A point!

254
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:48,277
A point!

255
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:56,987
Ms. Choi wins.

256
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:03,547
I would've won if it wasn't for my injury.

257
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:05,957
So what if you hallucinate?

258
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:09,327
The world gives you enough headaches. Just ignore it.

259
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,967
Okay.

260
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:13,307
- I can't hear you. 
 - Gosh, seriously.

261
00:23:13,307 --> 00:23:16,797
I'll just ignore the hallucination or whatever!

262
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,370
 [Kendo

263
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:25,447

264
00:23:26,177 --> 00:23:28,657
Okay, bye.

265
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,567
Take care. Bye.

266
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,107
See you.

267
00:23:32,107 --> 00:23:37,537

268
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:43,737
 Yes. This is real.

269
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:46,407
 I did hallucinate.

270
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:49,587
 Let's just forget about it.

271
00:23:58,577 --> 00:24:03,557
You wanted to go to the temple first thing in the morning.

272
00:24:04,217 --> 00:24:08,327
How many hours have we been in the car now?

273
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:25,417
 I suppose I didn't have to worry.

274
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:28,347
 You seem completely fine.

275
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:30,207
 "My Lord."

276
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:33,247
 You...

277
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,767
 see me in your dreams, don't you?

278
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:41,767
 I just dream about someone who looks like you.

279
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:45,167
 Now that Kang Yeong Hwa remembers me,

280
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:49,947
 it is my chance to be free from my resentment.

281
00:24:57,597 --> 00:25:00,607
My hunch was right.

282
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:03,577
I should've known when you talked about dreaming of your master.

283
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:05,827
Didn't you tell me to ignore it earlier?

284
00:25:05,827 --> 00:25:08,907
It's okay to dream about a celebrity.

285
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:12,417
But how much do you like Han Joon Oh that you hallucinate...

286
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:16,217
- Is it a sin to love? 
 - It's not like that!

287
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:22,547
Just hang in there for a bit. The bodyguard gig ends in less than a month. Right?

288
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:25,687
Once he's out of sight, you'll forget about him

289
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:28,197
and you'll no longer have nightmares.

290
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:31,157
Drink. Drink, drink, drink.

291
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,187
Gosh, hey.

292
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:52,717
Who said they're nightmares?

293
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:06,867
Where did Kang Yeong Hwa go?

294
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:11,317
Ms. Kang is over there. Don't worry.

295
00:26:11,317 --> 00:26:15,397
- Who are you? 
 - Let me introduce myself first. I'm...

296
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:18,417
Jang Yoon Je, Han Joon Oh's manager.

297
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:20,597
Oh. Han Joon...

298
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:22,247

299
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,367
Pardon? Pardon?

300
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:25,837
Oh, also...

301
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:29,977
you need to sign this.

302
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:33,757

303
00:26:52,937 --> 00:26:55,887
 There's no need to waste more time.

304
00:26:55,887 --> 00:27:01,087
 If I miss this chance, I might not be able to break the curse.

305
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:05,047
 Killing you is the only way to end this.

306
00:27:14,837 --> 00:27:16,377
 Huh?

307
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:19,177
 It's Lord Do Ha.

308
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,207
Why do you keep following me?

309
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:36,117
I should've taken the medicine instead of drinking.

310
00:27:36,117 --> 00:27:39,957
Let go of my hand.

311
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,307
You'd get yourself in trouble that way.

312
00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:47,557
I would've thrown you all the way over there if you moved a bit slower.

313
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:50,487
Don't I have amazing reflexes?

314
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:59,837
The doctor told me...

315
00:27:59,837 --> 00:28:02,077
that you're fake.

316
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:04,957
How could fake defeat the real?

317
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:09,057
So leave while I'm letting you go.

318
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:11,147
I'll forgive you this once.

319
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,517
You have to let this go.

320
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:20,787
Bye, then, My Lord.

321
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:25,517
You're here. Where else would I go?

322
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:29,497
This is the Republic of Korea. Men from Silla aren't allowed.

323
00:28:29,497 --> 00:28:32,207
You were a woman from Gaya.

324
00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:41,557
I'm too drunk.

325
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:45,387
I'll go if you won't go, My Lord.

326
00:28:46,537 --> 00:28:50,607
Let's go! Let's go to the real world!

327
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:53,730
♫  I still remember it clearly  ♫

328
00:28:57,247 --> 00:29:01,687
♫  The first time I felt you  ♫

329
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:04,857
♫  I still remember it clearly  ♫

330
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:16,367
♫  I won't forget you are like me  ♫

331
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:18,927
♫  If you say so  ♫

332
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,507
It's so shiny.

333
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:32,947
This is so cool.

334
00:29:35,147 --> 00:29:38,777
I'm on my way to the real world right now.

335
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,897
Hold on.

336
00:29:45,687 --> 00:29:51,537
How could Yeong Hwa and the superstar Han Joon Oh...

337
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,677
I can't even tell people about this.

338
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:56,427
Stop taking photos...

339
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,317
Since you already signed, you'll be fined if you breach—

340
00:29:59,317 --> 00:30:02,127
Be quiet. I can't hear what they're saying at all.

341
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:05,607
- You're noisier, okay? 
 - Gosh, hey!

342
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,407
Why do you keep following me?

343
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:16,467
Watch where you're going.

344
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:18,357
You might fall.

345
00:30:18,357 --> 00:30:20,957
Who cares if I fall or not?

346
00:30:20,957 --> 00:30:23,407
You told me to go to the Great Gaya.

347
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,917
Would everything be fine if I left?

348
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:30,827
You knew what would happen if you returned.

349
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:35,087
Does saying "Leave" help me leave in peace?

350
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,727
That's why I no longer want to dream.

351
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,527
What if something happens to Lord Do Ha...

352
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,397
Han Joon Oh if I really left...

353
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,800
I don't want to let go of Lord Do Ha or Han Joon Oh.

354
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:04,407
Don't you know...

355
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,447
what happened next?

356
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,157
He probably died.

357
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:14,267
He gave me the lotus seeds and suggested we live.

358
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:17,357
Saying things like, come and kill him.

359
00:31:17,357 --> 00:31:21,467
I'll never see Lord Do Ha in my dreams.

360
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:23,717
I'll never see him.

361
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:26,447
I'll never see Lord Do Ha...

362
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,567
Wake up now, Ms. Kang Yeong Hwa.

363
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,200
When did I get home?

364
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,977
Don't pretend you blacked out.

365
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:18,837
I have tons of questions for you right now. Okay?

366
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,047
 So leave while I'm letting you go.

367
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:24,047
 You have to let this go.

368
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:26,387
 I'll never see him...

369
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,917
What are these flashes I'm having?

370
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,607
What are you, a vampire or something?

371
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:40,907
Do you die if you see the sunlight?

372
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,587
Can't you put your clothes in the dressing room...

373
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,047
What's all this on your clothes?

374
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:52,017
Geez, seriously.

375
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,107
My goodness.

376
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,007
 Lingering feelings?

377
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,800
 I can't be hesitating due to my lingering feelings for you.

378
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,687
 It must be because I'm curious why I died.

379
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,367
CEO, what are you doing here at this hour...

380
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,897
What's the suitcase for?

381
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,187
Ms. Kang is on a sick leave.

382
00:33:46,187 --> 00:33:48,317
Of course, I should come.

383
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,367
Gosh, you didn't have to.

384
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:52,707
Mr. Jang is right.

385
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,097
I thought I said I was okay.

386
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,137
The reason I'm here isn't only because of your condition.

387
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:05,167
The suspect of the kidnapping ran away while being treated.

388
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:07,547
I heard he's on the run outside the country.

389
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,057
- On the run? 
 - I'll stay by your side until

390
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:14,457
we find the instigator.

391
00:34:14,457 --> 00:34:16,297
No matter what you say.

392
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,077
I thought you'd kick me out.

393
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,847
That's my plan.

394
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:30,027
Joon Oh, Dr. Choi said it might be difficult,

395
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,977
but I don't think so.

396
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,867
I'm looking into the hospitals in the US.

397
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,167
Let's go to the States together if we hear back.

398
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:42,477
Didn't you say I'm terminally ill, anyway?

399
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,347
I'll be gone soon. Why is everyone worrying about me so much?

400
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,617
How could you say that?

401
00:34:49,617 --> 00:34:53,117
- I'm just telling you what's real. 
 - If you die...

402
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,227
If you die, is everything over?

403
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,107
After I heard you were terminally ill,

404
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,697
do you know what I feared the most?

405
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,157
I was worried you'd leave...

406
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,687
without giving me a chance to say goodbye.

407
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,517
I didn't get to do anything for you.

408
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,707
I was afraid you'd just leave me.

409
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,557
That's what I feared the most.

410
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,377
So I'll keep fighting.

411
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,477
Before you leave,

412
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,177
I'll do everything I can.

413
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,717
For myself, who'd be left behind,

414
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,987
I'll do anything so I won't have regrets.

415
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:07,187
 Yes. You might be right.

416
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,637
 I might need more time.

417
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:14,937
 Should I try trusting you?

418
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,277
How about this, then?

419
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,957
What's this?

420
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:38,367
The person who might've instigated my murder.

421
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,447
What?

422
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,117
I don't think Joon Oh noticed yet.

423
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,817
That this person is Mr. Seok?

424
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,227
So, did you look into his whereabouts at all?

425
00:36:59,227 --> 00:37:03,907
I confirmed that he's been staying at homeless shelters until recently.

426
00:37:03,907 --> 00:37:05,417
But...

427
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,637
Excuse me.

428
00:37:10,557 --> 00:37:12,597

429
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,057
Since he shows up at shelters so irregularly,

430
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:22,517
it's not easy to locate him.

431
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:24,017
Hire more people.

432
00:37:24,017 --> 00:37:26,167
What would you do if it wasn't actually him?

433
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:28,397
I'll have to catch him and ask him.

434
00:37:28,397 --> 00:37:30,917
Is this all a coincidence

435
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:34,247
or did he actually try to kill Joon Oh?

436
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:40,977

437
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,367
Hello? This is Attorney Go Gyeong Se.

438
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:47,717
Who's this?

439
00:37:47,717 --> 00:37:51,197
 Why won't you pick up your phone, Mr. Go?

440
00:37:51,197 --> 00:37:53,167
 You make me sad.

441
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,337
M-Mr. Seok?

442
00:37:57,337 --> 00:37:59,777
I'd like to see you.

443
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,457
I have things to discuss with you, too.

444
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:08,197

445
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,800

446
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,517
Wow, seriously.

447
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:27,697
Gosh, that was so nerve-wracking.

448
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,217
Can't you mail it for me since you're already helping me?

449
00:38:32,217 --> 00:38:37,117
You need to be on camera to prove you sent it yourself.

450
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,987
I just need to disappear somewhere without a camera now, then.

451
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:47,987
There's a route I found. We can go that way.

452
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:53,287
I thought you only liked money, women, gambling,

453
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:56,107
and stuff like that.

454
00:38:56,107 --> 00:38:58,617
There's something even more fun.

455
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:02,217
- What is it? 
 - You'll find out tonight.

456
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,180
 Gosh, what is it?

457
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,540

458
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,557
 Just tell me now. Please?

459
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,657
Gosh, my head hurts.

460
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,997
Why?

461
00:39:17,997 --> 00:39:19,617
What did the Team Leader say?

462
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:22,917
To give up on the kidnapping case. He wants us to catch Goo Tae Joo.

463
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:28,117
I knew he'd say that, Senior. So I found something.

464
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,137
What do you think? Don't they look the same?

465
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,167
The jawline is exactly the same.

466
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,817
Yes.

467
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:47,467
It's a kind of psychological trauma.

468
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:49,377
It's an occupational disease.

469
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:53,147
I thought Han Joon Oh was Lord Do Ha because I was confused with the dreams.

470
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:55,557
He couldn't have understood what I was saying.

471
00:39:55,557 --> 00:40:00,497
He probably just thought it was the alcohol talking.

472
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:07,697
 You're on a small hill.

473
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:13,227
 You are a tree.

474
00:40:14,357 --> 00:40:17,997
 Let go of my hand.

475
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:20,967
 You've been standing here.

476
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:27,727
 You're feeling your deep and solid roots.

477
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:29,197
 You have to let this go.

478
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:32,197
 - Even with a storm...  
 - Gosh, seriously...

479
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:36,887
 ...you do not waver.

480
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:39,687
Is this a dream or a miracle?

481
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,977
How?

482
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:44,737
How could Kang Yeong Hwa and Han Joon Oh...

483
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:46,157

484
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:47,007

485
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,227

486
00:40:51,227 --> 00:40:52,747

487
00:40:52,747 --> 00:40:54,917

488
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:58,497
What are they talking about?

489
00:41:09,757 --> 00:41:12,697
Unni, I'll step out for a second.

490
00:41:14,497 --> 00:41:16,147
Hold on.

491
00:41:16,147 --> 00:41:19,707
Are you going to see Han Joon Oh, by chance?

492
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:22,327
I just have things to take care of.

493
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:23,807
By chance...

494
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:26,497
are you wearing that?

495
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:27,837
What's the problem?

496
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:29,827
 Could you look over here?

497
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:32,347
 Could you pose differently?

498
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:34,857
 - Gosh, thank you. 
 - Thank you.

499
00:41:34,857 --> 00:41:36,287
 Look this way, too.

500
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:38,597
 Yes. Very nice.

501
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,207
 Look this way.

502
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,677
 The models on either side...

503
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:46,567
Hey. You actually look good since you have nice proportions.

504
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:50,607
Why did I come here dressed like this, by the way?

505
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,287
Don't be too shocked.

506
00:41:57,397 --> 00:41:59,157
 It's Han Joon Oh!

507
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:03,377
Han Joon Oh! Han Joon Oh!

508
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:07,877
Please look over here.

509
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:11,767
Mr. Han.

510
00:42:25,947 --> 00:42:30,357
Jeong Yi Seul said she's dating Han Joon Oh.

511
00:42:30,357 --> 00:42:32,547
- They're dating? 
 - Yes.

512
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:34,887
Go and tell Han Joon Oh.

513
00:42:34,887 --> 00:42:36,427
Tell him to set things straight.

514
00:42:36,427 --> 00:42:38,347
What are you talking about...

515
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,807
Go.

516
00:42:50,707 --> 00:42:55,227
Ms. Jeong, you posted something interesting today.

517
00:42:55,227 --> 00:42:58,117
Are you two really dating?

518
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,327
When did I say we were dating?

519
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,117
Is it true, Mr. Han?

520
00:43:02,117 --> 00:43:04,557
Are you two in a relationship?

521
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:09,247
Mr. Han Joon Oh.

522
00:43:09,247 --> 00:43:13,227
Yes. It's true. We're dating.

523
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:14,487
Since when did you start dating? Did you meet while shooting a film?

524
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:16,027
Since when did you start dating? Did you meet while shooting a film?

525
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,967
One person at a time, please.

526
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:21,957
Why did you have to bring me here?

527
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:23,607
Geez.

528
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:26,507

529
00:43:29,897 --> 00:43:33,257
I need to thank you for being a scandal-maker.

530
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:35,997
People are reacting so quickly. Do you want to see?

531
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:40,627
Leaving already?

532
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:43,297
We were booked until 5:00.

533
00:43:44,437 --> 00:43:46,757
The show is over, isn't it?

534
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,447
What?

535
00:43:48,447 --> 00:43:50,407
I thought you weren't angry anymore.

536
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:53,047
You should be the angry one.

537
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:57,437
Why should I be?

538
00:43:57,437 --> 00:43:59,927
Both you and I got what we wanted.

539
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:03,787
I'm no longer involved in Goo Tae Joo's rumors

540
00:44:03,787 --> 00:44:08,667
and you have me after wanting me so much.

541
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:12,527
I'm sorry if I confused you.

542
00:44:14,377 --> 00:44:16,487
What do you mean by that, exactly?

543
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,607
Stop right there!

544
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:26,147
You weren't in your car. I looked for you forever.

545
00:44:26,147 --> 00:44:27,627
Where's Mr. Jang?

546
00:44:27,627 --> 00:44:31,247
I asked him to let us talk for a moment.

547
00:44:31,247 --> 00:44:34,887
You're a bodyguard, but every time I see you, your outfit is...

548
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:37,547
very pretty.

549
00:44:37,547 --> 00:44:38,957
You don't have to listen to her.

550
00:44:38,957 --> 00:44:42,637
I told you that I don't allow female bodyguards.

551
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:45,997
I don't think it's up to you to decide.

552
00:44:48,607 --> 00:44:53,227
I'm rarely dressed in Joon Oh's house.

553
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:55,617
Would that still be okay?

554
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:58,967
You don't know what we'll do.

555
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:05,117
- You should leave now. 
 - I was going to, anyway.

556
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,917
His work schedule ended. We'll get going now.

557
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:10,857

558
00:45:10,857 --> 00:45:13,717
Yes. So, go on home, Unni.

559
00:45:13,717 --> 00:45:15,617
I'll be there soon.

560
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:17,907
Okay.

561
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,487
Where are we going?

562
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:24,437
To get my stuff.

563
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:35,797
Why are you doing this?

564
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:41,317
It's true I'm worried about you, but I think I should move out now.

565
00:45:49,197 --> 00:45:51,737
We can't cause any misunderstandings later.

566
00:45:51,737 --> 00:45:53,767
Let's be clear about what happened yesterday first.

567
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:55,547
What misunderstanding?

568
00:45:56,647 --> 00:46:00,007
I've been having an issue lately.

569
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:05,187
I told you that I dream about someone who resembles you.

570
00:46:06,277 --> 00:46:10,477
But he showed up in front of me the day you passed out.

571
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:13,367
That's why I was on sick leave. I went to the hospital, too—

572
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:15,587
Did it work?

573
00:46:19,937 --> 00:46:24,387
Of course. I'm taking medicine and I'm being treated.

574
00:46:25,277 --> 00:46:28,517
But I haven't recovered completely yet.

575
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:33,667
I guess I thought you were him when I was drunk yesterday.

576
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,977
But that won't happen again.

577
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:41,547
Anyway, I apologize for yesterday.

578
00:46:41,547 --> 00:46:44,147
I told you everything yesterday.

579
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,177
You're the one who doesn't remember.

580
00:46:49,137 --> 00:46:52,087
I must've forgotten for a reason.

581
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:55,567
Stop worrying and go rest inside now.

582
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:58,107
You can't pass out again.

583
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,927
I'm leaving now.

584
00:47:18,207 --> 00:47:20,447
What does he mean, I forgot?

585
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,817
Why are you all packed up...

586
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:30,877
With what's going on with Ms. Jeong,

587
00:47:30,877 --> 00:47:34,377
I won't be able to be his bodyguard 24-7 from now on.

588
00:47:34,377 --> 00:47:38,507
I told him I'll go back to the original schedule.

589
00:47:38,507 --> 00:47:43,037
Is there something going on between you two that I'm not aware of?

590
00:47:43,897 --> 00:47:48,027
I've been noticing that Joon Oh is strangely

591
00:47:48,027 --> 00:47:53,247
obsessing over you lately.

592
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:57,497
Something happened that day, too. Right?

593
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:01,967
Joon Oh said you saw his true self.

594
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:05,117
What does that mean, exactly?

595
00:48:05,117 --> 00:48:07,337
His true self?

596
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,957
 Be gone, evil spirit!

597
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,267
 What's wrong with your face?

598
00:48:17,597 --> 00:48:19,667
That monk that day...

599
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:25,257
All the visitors at the Beginning have to check in. Right?

600
00:48:25,257 --> 00:48:28,387
Yes. It's true, but...

601
00:48:28,387 --> 00:48:30,797
why are you suddenly bringing that up?

602
00:48:33,307 --> 00:48:37,667
Starting from here to here are the names of the visitors that day.

603
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:42,667
There are so many. How could I find him?

604
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:46,237
You don't know the name of the person you're looking for?

605
00:48:46,237 --> 00:48:48,457
Well...

606
00:48:48,457 --> 00:48:50,947
He was a monk.

607
00:48:50,947 --> 00:48:54,777
A monk... It's probably this person.

608
00:48:54,777 --> 00:48:58,187
He was looking for you that day.

609
00:48:58,187 --> 00:48:59,527
For me?

610
00:48:59,527 --> 00:49:01,087
Yes.

611
00:49:11,877 --> 00:49:14,367
 Hello, this is Kang Yeong Hwa—

612
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:15,907
 Hello, this is Oksa Temple.

613
00:49:15,907 --> 00:49:19,547
 We are unavailable at the moment. Please call again.

614
00:49:19,547 --> 00:49:21,437
 Thank you.

615
00:49:23,787 --> 00:49:25,517
Oksa Temple?

616
00:49:32,457 --> 00:49:34,677

617
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:39,157
This is the mountain where Dad is.

618
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:52,657
Why did Mr. Seok have to make me come to a place like this?

619
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:57,137
Hello?

620
00:49:57,137 --> 00:50:00,447
Yes. What did the CEO say?

621
00:50:01,017 --> 00:50:04,647
Pardon? He admitted they're dating?

622
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:08,057
We spent a fortune to stop that rumor...

623
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:13,067
Don't respond at all starting now.

624
00:50:13,067 --> 00:50:15,487
I'll go back and take care of the rest.

625
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:17,977
I'll let CEO Han know myself.

626
00:50:17,977 --> 00:50:19,627
Gosh.

627
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:23,927
Geez.

628
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:48,387
Excuse me...

629
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,477
Mr. Seok?

630
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:17,147
How can I help you?

631
00:51:18,837 --> 00:51:21,397
Recently, Han Joon Oh...

632
00:51:21,397 --> 00:51:25,637
Well, you're the monk from the elevator. Right?

633
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:27,177
Yes, Ms. Kang.

634
00:51:27,177 --> 00:51:29,987
I saw you at a subway station before, too.

635
00:51:29,987 --> 00:51:32,667
How do you know my name, by the way...

636
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:36,907
Well, we met a long time ago, too.

637
00:51:37,897 --> 00:51:43,737
By chance, were you a young monk who was about this tall?

638
00:51:45,707 --> 00:51:47,127
As I expected,

639
00:51:48,377 --> 00:51:51,027
the talisman is gone.

640
00:51:57,527 --> 00:51:59,587
Lotus seed?

641
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:05,467
I don't know how I ended up with that precious talisman,

642
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:08,827
but the objects that contain strong hopes

643
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:13,187
end up finding their owners eventually.

644
00:52:14,727 --> 00:52:17,247
Do you mean my bracelet

645
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:20,027
has been protecting me?

646
00:52:20,027 --> 00:52:23,767
Most of the time, they protect their owners from evil spirits or ghosts.

647
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:26,357
Most of the time, they protect their owners from evil spirits or ghosts.

648
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:31,707
They prevent you from seeing or hearing them, too.

649
00:52:34,987 --> 00:52:37,327
How about the charm from then?

650
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:39,197
Why did that—

651
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:45,947
You came a long way. But this is all I can tell you now.

652
00:52:45,947 --> 00:52:47,747
Pardon?

653
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:52,287
Hae In, the guest is leaving.

654
00:52:53,497 --> 00:52:57,057
Wait, Venerable, just one moment. I...

655
00:52:59,627 --> 00:53:03,377
But since you're still here with us,

656
00:53:03,377 --> 00:53:07,327
you must have some lingering feelings.

657
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:12,317
Namu Amitabha Buddha. 
  (Buddhist chant)

658
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:16,637
Wait, Venerable...

659
00:53:21,427 --> 00:53:23,877
 I remember now.

660
00:53:36,897 --> 00:53:38,457
 Your heartbeats.

661
00:53:38,457 --> 00:53:40,797
 It's not my heart.

662
00:53:41,817 --> 00:53:43,787
 Whose is it, then?

663
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,057
 I'm not alive.

664
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:51,517
 I just borrowed Han Joon Oh's body momentarily.

665
00:53:53,517 --> 00:53:55,887
Let's meet.

666
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:22,497
Where are you going at this hour?

667
00:54:22,497 --> 00:54:23,737
To meet Kang Yeong Hwa.

668
00:54:23,737 --> 00:54:26,017
Things are chaotic because of the dating rumor.

669
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:28,347
- Do you have to go now? 
 - I do.

670
00:54:28,347 --> 00:54:29,787
To get her back.

671
00:54:30,657 --> 00:54:32,417
Okay.

672
00:54:32,417 --> 00:54:35,317
- Let me drive you. 
 - I can manage.

673
00:55:06,027 --> 00:55:07,897
 I love you...

674
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:10,777
 My Lord.

675
00:55:13,347 --> 00:55:16,207
 Would you be able to tell me...

676
00:55:17,517 --> 00:55:22,117
 why you did that then and why you had to?

677
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:29,997
I'm sorry I made you come all the way here.

678
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:32,327
I thought you did because you remembered everything.

679
00:55:32,327 --> 00:55:34,827
I was going to ask you about it, anyway.

680
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:40,117
What did you mean by borrowing Han Joon Oh's body?

681
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:43,467
I just can't seem to understand it.

682
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:44,687
What else?

683
00:55:45,557 --> 00:55:47,297
You said you're not alive.

684
00:55:47,297 --> 00:55:49,477
You do remember.

685
00:55:49,477 --> 00:55:52,797
What don't you understand, exactly?

686
00:55:52,797 --> 00:55:56,957
I don't know what part of this I'm supposed to understand.

687
00:55:56,957 --> 00:55:59,517
I've been thinking a lot about it, too.

688
00:56:09,437 --> 00:56:14,017
 I'm just delaying killing you just a little bit.

689
00:56:14,017 --> 00:56:16,117
 Since you...

690
00:56:16,117 --> 00:56:17,817
 Perhaps you...

691
00:56:18,717 --> 00:56:22,127
 might be able to give me the answer...

692
00:56:22,127 --> 00:56:24,507
 to my age-old question.

693
00:56:35,757 --> 00:56:37,597
By chance...

694
00:56:38,817 --> 00:56:41,787
- did you do that? 
 - I told you.

695
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:44,627
I'm not a human.

696
00:56:44,627 --> 00:56:47,117
What are you, then?

697
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:50,207
- The lost soul that's attached to you. 
 - What?

698
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:54,027
I've been trapped in this world for 1,500 years.

699
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:57,147
That's why I'd like you to help me.

700
00:56:58,107 --> 00:57:00,127
What do you mean...

701
00:57:00,127 --> 00:57:01,517
Help you with what?

702
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:04,227
I want to know how I died.

703
00:57:05,627 --> 00:57:08,397
I'm sorry. I have no idea what you're talking about.

704
00:57:08,397 --> 00:57:10,737
Only you can, Kang Yeong Hwa.

705
00:57:10,737 --> 00:57:12,287
Because you...

706
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:20,257
were my wife.

707
00:58:45,137 --> 00:58:48,277
They're prayer beads made with lotus seeds.

708
00:58:49,357 --> 00:58:52,367
It will protect you from everything...

709
00:58:53,807 --> 00:58:56,157
evil in this world.

710
00:59:01,877 --> 00:59:03,677
From now on,

711
00:59:05,757 --> 00:59:07,577
you are...

712
00:59:12,837 --> 00:59:14,487
forever...

713
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:17,987
my one and...

714
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:23,297
only wife.

715
00:59:26,587 --> 00:59:30,487
Even if death tears us apart.

716
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:39,590

717
00:59:40,717 --> 00:59:44,517
♫  Yes, it's you  ♫

718
00:59:44,517 --> 00:59:48,017
♫  You're my love  ♫

719
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:55,477
♫  Whether it's day or night, my heart doesn't change  ♫

720
00:59:55,477 --> 01:00:02,647
♫  If I create your image by connecting the stars  ♫

721
01:00:02,647 --> 01:00:09,297
♫  I try to touch you with my eyes  ♫

722
01:00:09,297 --> 01:00:14,317
♫  Since I love you forever  ♫

723
01:00:14,317 --> 01:00:17,357

724
01:00:17,357 --> 01:00:19,967
 "He definitely looks like my brother,

725
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:23,367
 but why does he seem so different?" Something like that?

726
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:26,577
 Make a decision.

727
01:00:26,577 --> 01:00:29,357
 Kill this girl or...

728
01:00:29,357 --> 01:00:31,017
 marry her.

729
01:00:31,017 --> 01:00:35,917
 Do I have to live if you tell me to?

730
01:00:39,337 --> 01:00:42,537
 You should have just killed me.
