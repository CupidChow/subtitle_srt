1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:11,030

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,590

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,440

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,200

5
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,480

6
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,170

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,990

8
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,410
 Please! Please don't do this!

9
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,300
 All of this...

10
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,090
 started in your previous life.

11
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,390
 No, I don't want to die.

12
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,650
 Why are you doing this to me?

13
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,180
 Please don't do this!

14
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,000
 In the end...

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,810
 it's something I have to do eventually.

16
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,010
 I even hesitate in my imagination.

17
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,240
 My Lord.

18
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,820
 Huh? It's Lord Do Ha.

19
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,520
 Han Ri Ta's 19th reincarnation came to remember me.

20
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,510
 Kang Yeong Hwa.

21
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,390
 Your 30th birthday is coming up soon.

22
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,170
 You will definitely die before that.

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,020
 Seeing all of your reincarnations and deaths,

24
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,920
 I promised myself that...

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,790
 I would kill you myself and leave this world this time.

26
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,370

27
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,330

If you don't mind me asking,

28
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,300
could you give me your phone number?

29
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,520
Seriously, what's with those two?

30
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,340
I guess there really is something going on.

31
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,540
Why don't you go inside now? You must be tired.

32
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,310
Well...

33
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,510
- What's this? 
 - Come on.

34
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,040
I never got to photograph you since you were wearing a mask the whole time.

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,140
As you said, we tired ourselves out playing.

36
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,520
We should take a photo for the memories, at least.

37
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,540
Look over here.

38
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,890
One, two, three.

39
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,520
It suits you well. Why don't you smile?

40
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,540
- Gosh. 
 - Look over here...

41
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,140
Geez...

42
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,020
What do you think? Don't they look nice?

43
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,720
Do you like them?

44
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,510
Pretty good, huh?

45
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,000
They turned out so well.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,540
 Kill Kang Yeong Hwa.

47
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,760
Then your brother can live.

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,370
Didn't you find it curious as to why the evil spirit that's in your brother's body

49
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,490
is obsessed with Kang Yeong Hwa?

50
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,930
Since he got possessed, he only cares about Kang Yeong Hwa.

51
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,280
 You can't get up so fast like thatâ€”

52
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,480
 How's Kang Yeong Hwa?

53
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,650
 Where are you going at this hour?

54
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,910
 To meet Kang Yeong Hwa.

55
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,220
 - Do you have to go now? 
 - I do.

56
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,170
 To get her back.

57
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,230
You mean the evil spirit...

58
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,810
has something to do with her?

59
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,760
The evil spirit was...

60
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,030
created because of a grave sin she committed in her previous life.

61
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,860
Not because of Goo Tae Joo, who recently died, and his grudge?

62
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,250
It's a lost soul who became evil due to his obsession with Kang Yeong Hwa.

63
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,380
While roaming around her,

64
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,720
he chose a person who was near her.

65
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,670
And it happened to be Han Joon Oh.

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,900
Many impossible coincidences created the ill-fated relationship.

67
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,450
I really want to help you, CEO Han.

68
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,330
So you're saying...

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,420
everything will be resolved if Kang Yeong Hwa is killed?

70
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,000
If you eliminate the reason to live, the evil spirit will have to disappear.

71
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,400
 Your expression is kind of off,

72
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,870
 but it's our first selfie. So I'll share it.

73
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,050
 Smile next time.

74
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:12,580

75
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,100

76
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,560
What? Is he reading and ignoring?

77
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,210
Is it really that hard to respond?

78
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,000
He's the reason I took this photo.

79
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,920
 What if...

80
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,940
 Like you said once...

81
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,880
 what if we were ordinary?

82
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,370
 I wonder how it would've been.

83
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,400
If we were ordinary like you said, it would've been nice.

84
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,080
They say destiny is cruel.

85
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,910
That might be actually true.

86
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,900
Goodness, goodness.

87
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,360
You scared me.

88
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,640
What's with the theatric monologue?

89
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,220
Why did you eavesdrop?

90
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,330
- Come out. 
 - Okay.

91
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,780
Why are you staring?

92
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,840
Looks like your condition is getting worse and worse.

93
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,070
What about my condition?

94
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,080
I guess dating a celebrity isn't necessarily great.

95
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,470
We're not dating, I said.

96
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,100
Gosh, whatever.

97
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,340
I have a really bad feeling today.

98
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,080
So don't go outside and stay at home today.

99
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,450
Tell Han Joon Oh that you're sick and resting at home, too.

100
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,560
Why all of a sudden?

101
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,440
Is it because you keep talking about your dreams?

102
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,540
I had your dream for you last night.

103
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,370
Really? Did you dream about your previous life, too?

104
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,740
What are you saying?

105
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,640
On a bright morning,

106
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,640
you came out of the room wearing a silk dress.

107
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,930
And?

108
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,210
But all of your teeth suddenly fell out and...

109
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,020
It's such a bad sign.

110
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,320
Please be careful for now, my sister.

111
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,350
Seriously? That was just a silly dream.

112
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,810
- I thought it was something serious. 
 - Gosh.

113
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,040
- What's this? 
 - What?

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
Huh? Hey!

115
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,240
Hey! Look, look.

116
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,070
It already started.

117
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,880
- It's another bad sign. 
 - Stop saying nonsense.

118
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,630
Well, do you have any idea about how to

119
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,620
have fun without doing much?

120
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,900
So you're insisting on going on a date with Han Joon Oh.

121
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,700
Gosh, it's not a date.

122
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,970
I just want to help him have an ordinary day, even if it's just for a day.

123
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,700
I can't even have dreams these days.

124
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,810
I think this is the least I can do.

125
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,260
What?

126
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,790
Whatever. You don't have to know.

127
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,420
So, do you have ideas or not?

128
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,370
 How come I don't hear from you today?

129
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,180
 I'll go to your place now. Let's eat something tasty together

130
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,890
 and watch a movie together if you have time.

131
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,840
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,580
Why did I have to fall on a pile of trash?

133
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,150
I don't smell, do I?

134
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,060
Hello.

135
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,950
Your face is filled with worries.

136
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,520
Something bad must've happened to you today.

137
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,920
Who are you?

138
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,790
We just noticed a very bad aura surrounding you.

139
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,210
I'd like to have a spiritual talk with you.

140
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,570
Do you have time, by chance?

141
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,140
Why is this happening to me today?

142
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,290
I'm sorry, I'm a bit busy right now.

143
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,400
Excuse me. It's not just your bad aura.

144
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,480
You have a dead person attached to you, too.

145
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,670
A very old ghost is following you around everywhere.

146
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,500
Haven't you heard of things like karma and curse?

147
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,250
What do you mean about karma exactlyâ€”

148
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,980
I think we'd better talk inside somewhere instead.

149
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,960
There's a way to reverse the karma and break the curse.

150
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,580
No, no. I didn't do anything to cause a bad karma or curse.

151
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,830
Excuse me, Ma'am. We'll tell you something important.

152
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,860
You could treat us to refreshing beverages at leastâ€”

153
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,570
Why would Iâ€”

154
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,100
Acts of kindness like this can help reverse karma.

155
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,490
You can buy yourself a drink and get us some, too.

156
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,280
Would you like to do that for us?

157
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,770
What are you doing?

158
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,800
You're Firefighter Kang Yeong Hwa. Right?

159
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,550
You saved me once.

160
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,080
Don't you remember me?

161
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,270
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,930
I didn't recognize you immediately because you improved so much.

163
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,950
I think you gave me your business card, too.

164
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,480
I don't even remember your nameâ€”

165
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,210
It's Seok Cheol Hwan.

166
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,420
I wanted to express my gratitude, but I've been busy.

167
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,820
I should be thanking you for this time.

168
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,480
I wasn't sure how to get out of that earlier.

169
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,060
That's how it was.

170
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,800
I thought you were following them because you were interested.

171
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,770
There's no way.

172
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:06,100
They talked relentlessly without giving me a chance to talk.

173
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,820
Gosh, they said I have a ghost following me and...

174
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,420
I committed a sin, too.

175
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,440
It's silly, isn't it?

176
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,430
Not all of that is silly.

177
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,370
Because ghosts actually exist.

178
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,850
Do you believe that ghosts exist, too?

179
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,470
Of course.

180
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,900
I've actually seen a ghost once.

181
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,680
Really?

182
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,410
Yes.

183
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,920
They're such evil things.

184
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,930
They should move on to the afterlife if they're dead.

185
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,560
Why do they stay in this world?

186
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:00,630
I don't think all ghosts that exist are evil.

187
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,980
Do you mean ghosts can be nice, too?

188
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,240
Well, that's...

189
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,220
Looks like you don't know yet.

190
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,430
They became ghosts because they had resentment toward this world.

191
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,880
How could a resentful ghost be nice?

192
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,360
Resentment also means extreme obsession.

193
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,680
Obsession?

194
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,720
So, if you get to see a ghost in life,

195
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,710
you cannot be fooled by what they say.

196
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,870
To achieve what they want,

197
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,520
they fool people with lies that sound convincing.

198
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,100
Once you come to your senses,

199
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,540
on the edge of a cliff, it will...

200
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,110
You're scared.

201
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,380
You're a great firefighter, Kang Yeong Hwa. Yet...

202
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,310
you're scared by a story like this?

203
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,630
It doesn't suit you.

204
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,990
You were joking. Right?

205
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,570
You talked so seriously. I got sucked in without realizing it.

206
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,170
I didn't say I was joking.

207
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,830
You're scared again.

208
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,650

209
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,640
You startled me.

210
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,750
 What was that?

211
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,980
 It sounded like he was talking about Lord Do Ha.

212
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,660
 You still have very beautiful hands.

213
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,990
 You will be learning the truth soon, Kang Yeong Hwa.

214
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,340
 I mean,

215
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,570
 Han Ri Ta.

216
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,000
 This is amazing. My friend is a nurse.

217
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,750
 Han Joon Oh is terminally ill, and he received a test at Seoul Neungil University Hospital.

218
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,790
 - You might get sued for this. 
 - Does this mean he'll die soon?

219
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,620
 - It's not even proven to be true. Don't post... 
 - It's because of...

220
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,720
 - his accident at Han River, apparently. 
 - Joon Oh is healthy.

221
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,070
 - Didn't you see the table read recently? 
 - What kind of terminally ill person...

222
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,350
 - You might get sued for this. 
 - I really pity Han Joon Oh.

223
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,560

224
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,820

225
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:18,880
Sir, you've been to Seoul Neungil University Hospital's cancer ward recently. Right?

226
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,710
Is the fact that I've been to the hospital an issue?

227
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,000
No, it's not an issue at all.

228
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,830
Except for the rumor that Joon Oh has late-stage cancer.

229
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:34,150
We canceled the rest of his schedule, too.

230
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,110
Is it true?

231
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,370
Does he really have only three months left?

232
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,110
Sir!

233
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,720
You need to say something.

234
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,190
The future of Beginning Entertainment depends on this.

235
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,810
I'm not sure.

236
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,600
It's a matter of making decisions now.

237
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,930
You haven't been around lately.

238
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,250
What brings you here?

239
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,470
What do you mean?

240
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,400
I came by because I think I've neglected to care for your health.

241
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,230

242
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,240
Looks like you haven't been taking your medicine.

243
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,270
Taking the medicine is actually...

244
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,580
worse for me.

245
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,390
You passed out after taking the medicine recently. Right?

246
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,000
I shouldn't leave this here.

247
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,650
I'm grateful you care as a brother,

248
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,630
but please don't do anything unnecessary.

249
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,680
Is Ms. Kang's job reinstatement...

250
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,730
unnecessary for you, too, then?

251
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,970
As for that...

252
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,090
I thought we already talked about this.

253
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,170
The more her reinstatement gets delayed,

254
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,630
the more difficult things might become for her.

255
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,770
You don't want to ruin her future

256
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,120
to keep her by your side. Right?

257
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,870
Isn't that right?

258
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,300
Keeping her by my side is good for her future, too.

259
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,020
- How come? 
 - Can't you just leave

260
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,920
both Kang Yeong Hwa and me alone?

261
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,370
It will be over in just a few days, anyway.

262
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,480
You still...

263
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,500
talk in a way I can't understand

264
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,940
when it comes to Ms. Kang.

265
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,990
 He is obsessed.

266
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,410
 Han Joon Oh. I'm here.

267
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,150
Since she happens to be here,

268
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,110
I should talk to her instead.

269
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,900
- Hold on. 
 - What are you...

270
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,400
What's going on, you two?

271
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,460
CEO Han...

272
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,030
- Your face is... 
 - It's nothing.

273
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,280
What's this? What's going on?

274
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,010
I'm sure he did it accidentally.

275
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,790
I brought up your job reinstatement.

276
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,020
Job reinstatement?

277
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,660
But I don't think it's the right time, looking at his condition.

278
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,090
If you don't mind,

279
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,980
let's take time to discuss this issue.

280
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,750
Okay.

281
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,450
That'd be okay, right, Joon Oh?

282
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,490
I'll get going now.

283
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,480
What's going on?

284
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,680
Huh?

285
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,980
No matter how I think about it,

286
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,230
Han Min Oh is acting strangely.

287
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,900
It's better not to keep him close.

288
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,700
He was acting the same as usual. What do you mean...

289
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,120
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

290
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,250
I'm not exactly sure,

291
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,100
but I have a bad feeling.

292
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,380
It'd be better to stay away from Han Min Oh for nowâ€”

293
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,750
You don't even know for sure. Why are you suspicious of him?

294
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,300
It's not just anyone. It's CEO Han.

295
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,350
Is this really about my reinstatement?

296
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,550
Because I might suddenly leave?

297
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,850
Yes.

298
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,550
That's not a bad reason, either.

299
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,700
That's even stranger of a reason.

300
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,620
I promised to help you. What are you anxious about?

301
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,550
He was just trying to be considerate of me.

302
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,840
Are you saying you believe Han Min Oh more than me?

303
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,730
No...

304
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,490
I'm saying this because this isn't your first time being wrong.

305
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,480
Last time, without even explaining,

306
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,770
you said I was in danger and whatnot.

307
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,570
I said that for a reasonâ€”

308
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,860
See? You can't tell me this time, either.

309
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,690
What if I did?

310
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,810
Would you be able to handle it?

311
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,630
I won't know unless you tell me.

312
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,530
Just tell me.

313
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,210
I'm ready to listen to you.

314
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,900
You're not ready at all.

315
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,470
Forget it.

316
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,060
Do you know how I felt coming here today?

317
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,330
Thinking about how lonely you must've been, I...

318
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,530
Never mind.

319
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,420
I won't talk, either.

320
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,250
I'll just go.

321
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,670
Why does he keep acting like an agonized ghost these days?

322
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,820
Are you leaving already?

323
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,290
Yes.

324
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,070

325
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,310
I'm really okay.

326
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,090
No.

327
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,140
I need to do this to feel better myself.

328
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,540
You don't want it to scar.

329
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,090
You're doing this because you're worried about Joon Oh. Right?

330
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,340
I heard you argued while talking about my job reinstatement.

331
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,620
You must've looked into it for me.

332
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,320
I apologize on his behalf.

333
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,540
There's been something I've wanted to ask you.

334
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,570
Why do you think he's so obsessed with you?

335
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,300
You said it's because he was in shock before.

336
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,910
I thought so, too.

337
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,130
But I think it's still too much.

338
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,530
It makes me think the reason

339
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,390
he's so overly obsessed is because

340
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,610
there's another reason.

341
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,980
I think the excessive obsession actually...

342
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,130
came from desperation.

343
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,990
Desperation?

344
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,100
He doesn't have many days left.

345
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:32,000
He's relying on me a lot since I'm the closest person to him. Don't you think?

346
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,980
Of course, the fact he suddenly changed must surprise you often,

347
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,760
but please be generous with him.

348
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,900
Sometimes I feel like the Joon Oh you know is...

349
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,750
a different person than the one I know.

350
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,650
 Do you know how I felt coming here today?

351
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,790
 Thinking about how lonely you must've been, I...

352
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,940
 Do you know how I feel...

353
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,060
 doing this right now?

354
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,380
 I love you, My Lord.

355
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:53,220
 I can't fall for you again

356
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,950
 and continue this hellish cycle.

357
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,290
Thank you for driving me.

358
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,950
Well, then...

359
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,570
Well, Yeong Hwa. What you told me last time...

360
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,810
You were talking about yourself, right?

361
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,590
Pardon?

362
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,000
You talked about the ones who were left behind

363
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,060
after saying goodbye to their loved ones.

364
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:36,230
 The sense of loss from the people

365
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,140
 who lost their loved ones.

366
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,730
 So I don't think you need to blame yourself and regret it in advance.

367
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:50,340
 Now is the time to do your best to make sure you don't regret it later.

368
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,340
I saw the personal information you shared when you started the job.

369
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,360
I have Joon Oh,

370
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,110
but you have no one. It must've been hard.

371
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,540
I got very used to it. So it's okay.

372
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,840
By chance,

373
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,400
can I ask you a favor regarding Joon Oh?

374
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,120
 Attack!

375
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,970
You must've waited long. It was so crowded.

376
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,870
That's why I said I'd come with you.

377
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,510
That would've made your legs tired.

378
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,700
I don't want that.

379
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,180
I need to answer this.

380
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,350
Excuse me.

381
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,970
Yes.

382
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,790
Right now?

383
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,280
No, no. Of course, of course, of course.

384
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,390
I-I'll be there right now.

385
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,580
Well...

386
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,880
I'm sorry, Na Yeon.

387
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,330
Joon Oh...

388
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,300
wants me to come right now.

389
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,900
Was it Han Joon Oh who just called?

390
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,780
Geez. I thought it was some chairman or something.

391
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,470
Also, aren't you much older than him, too?

392
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,500
Well, yes.

393
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,950
B-But Mr. Han is a bit older than he looks.

394
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,230
He does?

395
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,730
He has a situation he can't talk about.

396
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,990
A situation, my foot. I can't just let this slide.

397
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll reveal his true character to the worldâ€”

398
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,650
He really, really, really...

399
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,380
He really has a situation. He does, Na Yeon.

400
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,970
What situation is that?

401
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:03,660
I can't stand someone I like being mistreated.

402
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,010
So, tell me right now.

403
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,860
Come to think of it,

404
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,460
you'll leave as soon as I have the dream.

405
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,480
If you suddenly disappear,

406
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,200
I think I might feel a bit sad.

407
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,640
 Is it too much to ask?

408
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,330
 The last trip?

409
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,930
 After hearing what you said,

410
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:55,500
 I wanted to spend his last days with him more meaningfully.

411
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,330
 So I could say goodbye to him without

412
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,400
 regrets even if he suddenly leaves.

413
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,230
 I see.

414
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:11,460
 As you know, he doesn't feel comfortable being alone with me.

415
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,610
 If you could just bring him

416
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:19,600
 to the destination without mentioning me, I'd appreciate it.

417
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,710
Saying goodbye without regrets.

418
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:38,300
I might need to take the last trip with him, too.

419
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,900
 Hey! Kang Yeong Hwa. You're in there. Right?

420
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,510
Come out right now.

421
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,190
Hey! Whoa, seriously.

422
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,080
This is crazy. Totally crazy!

423
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,980
What's this all of a sudden?

424
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,170
Is it true that Han Joon Oh is possessed?

425
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,010
What? Who said that?

426
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,040
Just answer me. Is that true?

427
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,310
Who told you what exactly?

428
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,600
How could ghosts exist in this day and age?

429
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,380
And Han Joon Oh, at that? How does that make sense?

430
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,510
Gosh. So, it makes sense for a top celebrity

431
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,000
like Han Joon Oh to be into a non-celebrity like you, then?

432
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,140
Gosh, when I heard that,

433
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,680
I actually understood immediately.

434
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,170
Han Joon Oh wasn't in his right mind, indeed.

435
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,200
He's dating you because he's possessed.

436
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,090
- How could you say that? 
 - Whatever.

437
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,740
What will you do?

438
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,160
What do you mean, what will I do?

439
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,720
You should get an exorcist or use a charm. Do something about it.

440
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,660
Will you keep seeing a possessed person, then?

441
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,150
Do you have any evidence?

442
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,630
How could you bring up ghosts?

443
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,660
How dare you deny it?

444
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,030
I heard everything from Yoon Je. Okay?

445
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,220
- I heard you knew all about it. 
 - Mr. Jang?

446
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,750
Yes, he's a ghost. So what?

447
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,590
Did he hurt anyone being a ghost?

448
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,100
Why are you flipping out?

449
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,680
Of course, he hurt someone.

450
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,070
He's fooling the 200,000 fans and innocent public

451
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,650
and pretending to be Han Joon Oh.

452
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,250
He must have some dark motive against you, too.

453
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,200
Whoa, whoa!

454
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,260
Hey, w-who should I report this to?

455
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,640
W-What was that called?

456
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,760
Sis, stop doing that...

457
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,700
Is it called "Unanswered Questions?"

458
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,700
Or should I call the police? Who should I report to?

459
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,200

I need to talk to you. Let's take a walk together.

460
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,070
It's him just now, huh?

461
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,710
I-I should call a broadcasting station first. This is no good.

462
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,280
- Sis, please. 
 - This is no good!

463
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,520
He'll be leaving soon anyway.

464
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,220
Please let him spend his last days quietly.

465
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,470
I'll make sure you don't have to worry. Okay?

466
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,880
He's not a person, Yeong Hwa. Please.

467
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,800
You'll do what I asked. Okay?

468
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,900
Han Joon Oh.

469
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,650
I wanted to talk to you, too.

470
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,740
I thought you left in anger earlier.

471
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:21,550
I was a bit angry earlier, but...

472
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,930
Thinking about it again,

473
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,260
I wasn't thinking from your side enough.

474
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,800
My side?

475
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,140
You've lived for 1,500 years.

476
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,230
A decade or two is long enough.

477
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,820
You lived such a long time without knowing and feeling lonely.

478
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,760
Since you finally get to leave now,

479
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,340
I see how you could feel sensitive about things.

480
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,170
I didn't get to think that far earlier.

481
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,130
I'm sorry.

482
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,270
You'll accept my apology. Right?

483
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,140
Since we're on the topic,

484
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,840
I've been thinking about what I could do for you.

485
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,840
You asked me at the theme park...

486
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,910
what it would've been like if we met ordinarily.

487
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,360
That's why...

488
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,740
I want to let you spend mundane moments.

489
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,030
Let's go on a trip together.

490
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,180
Once you leave, I think I'll...

491
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,170
I'll feel lonely a lot, too.

492
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,350
I want to prepare myself before I say goodbye to you, too.

493
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,970
What do you think? Does that sound good?

494
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,700
Shall we, then?

495
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,880
I'll need some time to...

496
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,740
sort things out for the last time, too.

497
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,590
You mean it, right?

498
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,530
You'll promise me. Okay?

499
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,450
Promise.

500
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,690
What?

501
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,810
Have you never done this before, by chance?

502
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,470
You lock the pinkies together and...

503
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,740
put a stamp on it,

504
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,300
make a copy like this,

505
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,850
sign it, and...

506
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,600
 Yes.

507
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,000
You laminate it.

508
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,250
 - Maybe I had lingering feelings.  
 - You can't change your mind.

509
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,260
 Because I wanted to...

510
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,180
 see you for...

511
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,280
 another day or two.

512
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,250
You don't have to...

513
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,010
have the dreams.

514
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,500
What? Why all of a sudden?

515
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,200
You said you need to know how you died to break the curse.

516
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,070
My curse will break itself soon.

517
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,340
I made up my mind.

518
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,030
Let's go if we're done talking.

519
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,400
I'm done.

520
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,730
Huh?

521
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,260
I can go by myself. Drive Kang Yeong Hwa for me.

522
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,070
Pardon? Why aren't you going back together?

523
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,650
Wait...

524
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,540
Did he just leave?

525
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,230
He said he'd go on his own. He asked me to drive you home.

526
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,740
Did you two have a fight, by chance?

527
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,710
No, not at all.

528
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,470
We made up without any problems.

529
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,920
Why do I have a bad feeling about it?

530
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,830
Oh, right. He asked me to give this to you earlier.

531
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,340
Because you can't sleep well at night these days.

532
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,850
- Han Joon Oh did? 
 - Yes.

533
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,450
CEO Han...

534
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,780
Yes, CEO Han.

535
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,320
Yes. Thankfully, he agreed to go on a trip.

536
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,210
Thank you.

537
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,520
I'll meet you where we agreed to meet tomorrow.

538
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,530

539
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,600
Three would be enough, right?

540
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,740

541
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,320
He talks like that, but I guess he was worried about me.

542
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:31,720
Should I try some since he got it for me?

543
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,470
I've never gone camping before. I tried to pack appropriately.

544
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,210
And thank you for the gift yesterday. I enjoyed it.

545
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,520
I feel really great today, thanks to you.

546
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,300
By the way, is that all you're bringing?

547
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,320
I suppose only modern people need tools.

548
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,280
You're from ages ago. Right?

549
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,750
Give me.

550
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,610
Okay.

551
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,610
I forgot something. Just one second.

552
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,810
You...

553
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,370
What are you doing here?

554
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,010
I guess you don't watch TV these days.

555
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,550
- Get to the point so I understand. 
 - Will you keep acting like this?

556
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,520
- Get to the point so I understand. 
 - Will you keep acting like this?

557
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,290
Your name should be brought up more than mine regarding Goo Tae Joo's suicide.

558
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,220
Because he wouldn't have died if it wasn't for you and your brother.

559
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:00,390
But they don't talk about you guys at all.

560
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,740
And they won't stop talking about me. Is it a coincidence?

561
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,590
Your crafty brother plotted all this.

562
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,260
Han Min Oh did?

563
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,300
Will you keep playing ignorant?

564
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,600
He's a cold-blooded man who'd do anything for you.

565
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,270
With a mess like this, I guess you're going on a trip with that woman.

566
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,880
How laid back you are.

567
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,410
Were you hiding here to tell me this?

568
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,890
No. To tell you this.

569
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,960
I won't die alone like Goo Tae Joo.

570
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,330
If I can't recover my image,

571
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,890
I'll kill not only you,

572
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,400
but your brother and that bodyguard of yours.

573
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,760
That's not going to happen.

574
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:15,320
Wow, I'm going on my first-ever camping trip with you.

575
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,450
It feels strange.

576
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,540
I wonder if there was something similar to camping in the past.

577
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,980
Can't you say something back?

578
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,230
It's your duty to chat with the driver if you're in that seat.

579
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,890
Wow, do you have a superpower or something?

580
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,400
I've seen you turning the lights off.

581
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,230
Are electronics your specialty or something?

582
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,910
Let's just say that I am.

583
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,770
But why don't you ask where we're going?

584
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,850
This might be our first and last trip.

585
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,560
Aren't you curious?

586
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,840
I suppose it's my first time...

587
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,420
taking a trip...

588
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,540
or spending time with you like this.

589
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,760
You can look forward to it.

590
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,260
I got a recommendation from CEO Han.

591
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,780
He said he has special memories with Han Joon Oh there.

592
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,930
He said it's really nice.

593
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,190
It's a spot Han Min Oh recommended?

594
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,500
Yes.

595
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,680
Oh, you must know, too, then.

596
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,130
You said you can read Han Joon Oh's memories.

597
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,910
I try not to read his memories.

598
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:34,070
It doesn't feel good going through someone else's memories, either.

599
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,680
I'll keep it a secret until the end, then.

600
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,780
This is our last time, anyway.

601
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,730
Let's have a lot of fun. Okay?

602
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,900
â™«  I'll be by your side  â™«

603
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,750
â™«  I won't let go of you  â™«

604
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,220
Okay.

605
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,280
â™«  I'll protect you while we're drifting apart  â™«

606
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,190
It will be the last time.

607
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,560
â™«  Just stay with me  â™«

608
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,230
Why don't you turn it up?

609
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,240
â™«  I remember whenever I close my eyes  â™«

610
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,170
Wow.

611
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,700
This is so cool.

612
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,630
Gosh, my back...

613
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,730
How nice.

614
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,360
- Gosh. 
 - Which way are we going?

615
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,280
I think it's that way.

616
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,060
This and...

617
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,120
You can just carry this for me...

618
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,870
Hey, where are you going?

619
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,630
Han Joon Oh.

620
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,610
Gosh, it's so heavy.

621
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,660
Geez, it's so heavy I'm dying!

622
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,490
I can't go any further.

623
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,280
Why didn't you pack lightly, then?

624
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,760
Like me.

625
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,000
All of these are essential items for a romantic camping trip.

626
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,720
Give it to me.

627
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,770
Will you carry it for me?

628
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,300
Here.

629
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,850
It'd be less heavy if you wear it on your shoulder.

630
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,870
How could you be like this? I did all the driving, too.

631
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,400
You're supposed to carry your own stuff.

632
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,210
You can't just rely on other people like that.

633
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,720
Saying all the right things...

634
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,640
Let's get moving if you understand me.

635
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,690
Let's get moving.

636
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,510
I'll get moving. Okay?

637
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,370
Gosh, seriously. Wait for me.

638
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,450
Gosh, it's so far away.

639
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,750
I didn't know it'd be this far away.

640
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,810
You don't have to feel bad.

641
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,900
It's okay.

642
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,340
By the way, remember what you said yesterday?

643
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,530
You said I don't have to have dreams.

644
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,830
How will your curse get broken if I don't have dreams?

645
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,600
I thought I already explained yesterday.

646
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,280
It will just break itself.

647
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,450
Why have you been obsessing over me, if it will?

648
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,460
Because I didn't know back then.

649
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,300
That everything was because of lingering feelings.

650
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,820
By chance, do you have lingering feelings...

651
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,940
toward life?

652
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,280
It's about you.

653
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,320
So don't ask me anymore.

654
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,220
Our curse will come to an end, anyway.

655
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,380
What's Han Min Oh doing here?

656
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,790
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

657
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,270
I beg you.

658
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:52,490
CEO Han wants to spend quality time with you for the last time, too.

659
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,130
Let's all have a fun and pleasant time together.

660
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,170
Joon Oh, over here.

661
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,080
Thank you for coming.

662
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,940
Hurry up. I got everything set up.

663
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,640
See? He's putting so much effort into it, too.

664
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,600
You don't mind. Right?

665
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,500
Let's go.

666
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,870
CEO Han, come and have some.

667
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,550
I'm coming.

668
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,890
Otherwise, we'll eat everything.

669
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,550
It's much tastier to eat outside.

670
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,260
It's always tastier to eat outside.

671
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,980
Is that so?

672
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,660
Why aren't you eating, Joon Oh?

673
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,690
You like meat.

674
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:58,060
Maybe it's because he's not feeling so well.

675
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,780
We'll never be somewhere this nice again.

676
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,330
I worked hard on grilling it. Should I make you a wrap?

677
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,300
It's fine. Just pretend I'm not here andâ€”

678
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,840
Gosh.

679
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,470
You're eating just fine.

680
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,740
Try it. Isn't it good?

681
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,220
Talk to me for a moment.

682
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,570
I wanted to finish what we were talking about earlier.

683
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:04,550
What did you mean by having lingering feelings toward me?

684
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,790
- I told you not to ask me anymore. 
 - I know.

685
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:11,390
Why am I not supposed to know about it?

686
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:15,050
Because I must...

687
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,760
leave this place.

688
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:29,290
I thought I came on this trip to send you off.

689
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,260
But maybe...

690
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:36,740
Maybe both you and I...

691
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:42,090
If we still want to stay together longer...

692
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,120
- If that's the caseâ€” 
 - Yeong Hwa.

693
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,780
I made some coffee.

694
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,630
Can I speak to Joon Oh privately for a moment?

695
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,530
Oh, of course you can.

696
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,520
Let's talk later.

697
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,190
Drink some.

698
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:16,140
Drink it while it's warm.

699
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:28,570
Gosh. It's nice to be back here.

700
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,840
The fact that I'm spending time...

701
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,700
with you after learning you were sick makes me feel pathetic and hate myself for it.

702
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,800
No matter how busy I was,

703
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,100
I should've talked with you and gotten fresh air out here.

704
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,660
I should've done that.

705
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,200
Joon Oh.

706
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,400
Do you know why

707
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,200
I tried so hard to stay in this industry while being called...

708
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,250
a dogged and cold-hearted bastard?

709
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,600
It's because of you, you know.

710
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,030
My one and only brother, Han Joon Oh.

711
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,600
I know I'm your brother,

712
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,130
but why are you taking it so far?

713
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:29,490
Do you remember this place?

714
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:34,420
We lived near this mountain for a while after our parents died.

715
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,530
 I got a recommendation from CEO Han.

716
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,370
 He said he has special memories with the real Han Joon Oh there.

717
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:42,390
 He said it's really nice.

718
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,580
Was it somewhere there?

719
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,040
The kids in the neighborhood pointed fingers at us

720
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,950
and mocked us for not having parents.

721
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,800
 Don't leave me alone here!

722
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,150
 I'm sorry, Joon Oh.

723
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:01,110
 I'll never leave you behind again.

724
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:02,940
 I'm sorry.

725
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,300
 I'm sorry, Joon Oh.

726
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,990
That's when I made up my mind.

727
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,280
No matter what happens in the future,

728
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,630
no matter what it takes,

729
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:24,240
I'll protect my brother.

730
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:35,400
I'm able to go on, thanks to you.

731
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,930
Would I be able to last without you?

732
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:46,470
Your brother Han Joon Oh...

733
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,260
I mean...

734
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:53,970
I don't want to see you getting weak...

735
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,720
because I won't be around. So...

736
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:01,350
please live well...

737
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,480
for me, at least.

738
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,050
You sound like my brother when you talk like that.

739
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,910
 You passed out after taking the medicine recently. Right?

740
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,030
 I shouldn't leave this here.

741
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,990
I'll get you your body back.

742
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:48,090
Even if Kang Yeong Hwa has to pay for it.

743
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,510
 Okay.

744
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,790
 What will you do now?

745
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,950
 Will you kill Kang Yeong Hwa and

746
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,180
 get your brother back?

747
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:11,980
 Or...

748
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,880
 will you let her and the evil spirit...

749
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,560
 take over Han Joon Oh's body

750
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,490
 and go on as if nothing happened?

751
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,910
 Are you telling me to kill...

752
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,450
 an innocent person to save my brother?

753
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:38,750
 No, she's not innocent.

754
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,200
 Don't you remember?

755
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:47,260
 That evil spirit was created because of her karma.

756
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,580
 Should I tell you one more thing, then?

757
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,280
 Kang Yeong Hwa also...

758
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:01,040
 knows about the evil spirit.

759
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,190
 Think about how she treated him

760
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:07,050
 while he was acting so strangely.

761
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,370
 What are you doing?

762
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:13,300
 You know how he's traumatized.

763
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,380
 Please be understanding of it, CEO.

764
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,540
 Of course, the fact he suddenly changed

765
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,910
 must surprise you often,

766
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:24,880
 but please be generous with him.

767
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,560
 Kang Yeong Hwa is helping that evil spirit.

768
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,920
 So they can steal Han Joon Oh's body and stay together.

769
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:41,120
 Those two are in on this.

770
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,740
What?

771
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,270
Gosh, when did I fall asleep?

772
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:25,990
He was forced to stay for 1,500 years because of the curse.

773
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,950
How could I ask him to...

774
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,890
stay longer for me?

775
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,760
No.

776
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,950
No, Kang Yeong Hwa. No.

777
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,780
CEO Han.

778
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,880
I'm sorry.

779
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,050
I'll have to burden you...

780
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,790
for the last time for my brother, Ms. Kang.

781
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,000
Pardon?

782
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,900
Don't think this is unfair.

783
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:16,480
This is all because of your karma from your previous life.

784
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,100
What are you talking about?

785
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,220
Kang Yeong Hwa!

786
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:30,860

787
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,220
 No.

788
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:35,070
 No.

789
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:42,290
â™«  Since I love you forever  â™«

790
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:49,230
â™«  Because that love keeps growing  â™«

791
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:58,710
â™«  Even if it gets pitch black, I won't stumble  â™«

792
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:06,420
â™«  I can reach you no matter which way I walk to  â™«

793
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,990

794
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,830
 What have I done exactly?

795
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,200
 No.

796
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,700
 I would've been honest with him if I knew this would happen.

797
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,520
 I would've told him not to leave. And stay longer by my side.

798
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,880
 Kang Yeong Hwa, wake up!

799
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,330
 What's with you?

800
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,660
 Why did you do it?

801
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,540
 Seok Cheol Hwan! Was it all a lie?

802
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,500
 Do Ha has to die heroically.

803
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:36,280
 I will make sure to come back to you alive.
