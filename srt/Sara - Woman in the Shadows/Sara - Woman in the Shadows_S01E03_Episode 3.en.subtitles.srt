00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,920
BASED ON MAURIZIO DE GIOVANNI'S NOVELS

2
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,560
Come on!

3
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Give me my money.

4
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,240
My money!

5
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,000
Where the fuck
do you think you're going, Kamil?

6
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,240
Where the fuck are you going?
Where's the money?

7
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,480
-Where the fuck is my money?
-I messed up.

8
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,720
I don't have it anymore.
I'll give it back, I swear.

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,360
Please.

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,960
I warned you!

11
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,480
What are you doing?
What did you see? John Wayne?

12
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,920
You're Black too.
How can you be John Wayne?

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,200
Leave him alone. We need him, not you!

14
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,080
He's collaborative.

15
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,160
Is it true that you're collaborative?
Yes or no?

16
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,800
-Yes.
-See? You're good.

17
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Good.

18
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Hello?

19
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,040
Call the guy, Dad. Tell him it's all good.

20
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,040
Are you sure?

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,720
There's a Black guy who'll take the blame.
Give a little money to his wife and son.

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,680
All right.

23
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,080
God sees and provides.

24
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,000
-Bye.
-Bye, son. Bye.

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,880
SARA - WOMAN IN THE SHADOWS

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,800
ANTONIO CARDARELLI EMERGENCY ROOM

27
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,040
You like my car, huh?
Do you need some spare parts?

28
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,240
I want to save you some trouble.

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,720
No need to appear every time
like the Virgin Mary.

30
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
I get it.

31
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,920
-You get what?
-Well…

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You can usually find information
on pensioners doing favors for friends.

33
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,920
But nothing on you.
It's like you don't exist.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,960
Good job.

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,800
But you must've also figured out
it's better if I don't exist, right?

36
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,840
Of course.

37
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,160
If the coroner asks who you are,

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,680
what the fuck should I tell him?
That you're a ghost?

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,800
If we don't go in,
you don't have to tell him anything.

40
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,400
Why me of all people?

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,600
You haven't worked a real case
in four years.

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,720
Ever since your all-too-evident honesty

43
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,280
led you to step on the toes
of someone bigger than you.

44
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,200
So you got a nice promotion
to the crappiest office in the station,

45
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,920
where, except for
the occasional substitution,

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,680
like the night my son died,
you're rotting away.

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,440
Inevitably losing, day by day,

48
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,520
your identity as a good investigator.

49
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
Fine.

50
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,160
So let's say I work with you.

51
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,160
And you and your friends
get me back on the mobile unit.

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,120
No.

53
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,080
You don't work with me. You work for me.

54
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,520
MORGUE

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,040
It's weird. Not only are the causes
of death different,

56
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,800
but the times don't match.

57
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,560
Gaspare Russo was shot
three times in the chest.

58
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,040
One, two and three.

59
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,280
When the two bodies were found,
he'd been dead for about three hours.

60
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,600
But not the kid.
He'd been dead a lot longer.

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,640
You could say he was unlucky.

62
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
-Meaning?
-Follow me.

63
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,840
Sergio Minucci had a rare spleen disease
that made it extremely vulnerable.

64
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,080
A single blow, not even a very hard one,

65
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,000
caused it to rupture
and the slow hemorrhage that killed him.

66
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,280
How slow?

67
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,080
From the bruises and lesions,

68
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,280
I'd say the beating occurred
36 hours earlier, 48 at the most.

69
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,280
The kid was beaten and tied up,
as you can see from the wrist marks

70
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,200
and the ankle marks,
and left for dead where he was found.

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,960
-Okay. Thanks a lot.
-Don't mention it, Pardo.

72
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,720
He got beaten, but not in the face.

73
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,800
-He wasn't supposed to die.
-So what do you think? Intimidation?

74
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,640
Information, more than anything.

75
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,240
Care to tell me why, or do I have to wait
for the next apparition?

76
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
They ransacked his house.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,400
Someone wanted to know something,
and he didn't talk.

78
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,400
I don't know why I want to humiliate
myself by asking you this,

79
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,720
when I know you'll never answer, but…

80
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,560
If you and your friends are handling this,
maybe you have ties with the kid, right?

81
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Couldn't that be the key?

82
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,440
Maybe whoever kidnapped him
wanted information about you?

83
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,520
Let's start with Gaspare Russo.
Who was he? What were his ties to the kid?

84
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,080
Why did they leave them
next to each other?

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Okay.

86
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,400
I work for you now. What do I have to do?

87
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,320
How should I know? You're the cop.

88
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,120
POLICE

89
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,440
According to our colleagues,

90
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Gaspare Russo supervised
illegal immigrants' work.

91
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,800
But he was low-rank. A small fish.

92
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,120
-Boris! Hi!
-Musella! So?

93
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,360
The weird thing is,

94
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,880
forensics say that Russo sent
a voice message to his wife from the car

95
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,760
saying he was going home.

96
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,160
Only, he died and the car disappeared.

97
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,560
Anyway, it's all in here,
car papers included.

98
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,120
Is everything okay?

99
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,720
What?

100
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,080
You suddenly took leave
without telling me.

101
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,400
And you've got Boris.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
-I took some leave to be with my dog.
-Fine.

103
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,200
-It's none of your business anyway.
-Absolutely.

104
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,840
-Go inside. Thanks.
-You're welcome, Inspector.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,560
Boris. No, Boris! Hey!

106
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,440
Thanks for the lift.

107
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,200
I had to finish some work.
I never would've made it getting the bus.

108
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,480
What do you do,
if you don't mind me asking?

109
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,920
I do check-ins for vacation rentals,

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
wedding photos, loser actors' portfolios.

111
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,600
Shit like that.

112
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,640
In theory, I'm a photographer. In theory.

113
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,600
-Is it much farther?
-No.

114
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,640
I mean, is it here?

115
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,720
I know, the place sucks, but he's good.

116
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,440
Morning, Nino.

117
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,160
Nino.

118
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,040
I didn't do anything, Inspector.
I didn't do anything.

119
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,880
Where are you going?

120
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,320
Hey!

121
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,360
Will you stop? Hey!

122
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,560
Damn…

123
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
Again, sir?

124
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,640
-I'm not arresting you. Will you shut up?
-What do you want, then?

125
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,800
I need some information.

126
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,880
-Information?
-Yeah.

127
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,040
I need to find this car.

128
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,240
Can you help me?

129
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,360
-Park there.
-Here?

130
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,280
Yeah.

-Hi.
-Hi.

135
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,560
-Fusco, pleasure to meet you.
-Sara Morozzi. You too.

136
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,920
Come on.

137
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,000
Who's that? A relative?

138
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,160
No, an acquaintance who gave me a ride.

139
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,280
Okay, got it. Come in, take a seat.

140
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,520
Excuse me.

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,240
Hello? Good morning.

143
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,000
I wanted to know if Mr. Tarallo

144
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,360
will hold a press conference
for the death of his aide, Sergio Minucci.

-The mechanic sent me.
-Oh, it's you?

148
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
Where's the car?

149
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
It's in here. Want me to take you?

150
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,960
Give me the money.

151
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,160
See you later, man.

152
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,080
Here's Gaspare Russo.

153
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,960
Hey, Musella.

154
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,640
I found Russo's car.
I'm sending you a pin.

155
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,440
No. Musè, listen.

156
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,080
You take the credit for finding the car.

157
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,560
Have forensics analyze it
and let me know when there's news. Okay?

158
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,760
Where did you find that doctor?

159
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,760
He was smoking in the studio.

160
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,960
-Can't we choose another one?
-He watched Giorgio grow up.

161
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,520
He's his best friend's dad.
Your son spent his teens with them.

162
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,080
They're the first people I met
after we started dating.

163
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,120
His father, your ex-husband,
had been dead a while.

164
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,560
He said they were both crazy,
and they had lots of fun together.

165
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,200
They were the family he never had.

166
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,360
-We're here.
-What is this place?

167
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,720
It's my place.

168
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,160
OBSTETRIC ULTRASOUND

169
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,280
I used to take Giorgio here.

170
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,560
It's really ugly,
but it was paradise for us.

171
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,400
He gave me a massage every night.

172
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,360
But that's not the only reason I miss him.

173
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,920
I miss the things he didn't do too.
I miss everything about him.

174
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,240
How old were you when you got pregnant?

175
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,400
He didn't even tell you that?

176
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,480
I was your age.

177
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,200
He never mentioned you.

178
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,680
One day we were talking
about the baby and…

179
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,720
about possible resemblances.

180
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,040
-He only told me that--
-He hoped the baby wouldn't look like me.

181
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,760
So I asked him what had happened.

182
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,160
He just told me you left
and forgot about him. That's it.

183
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Do you think you can forget that?

184
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,240
If my mom's right,
and you're a criminal, yes.

185
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,720
But that's not what you think.

186
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,240
The bench you sat on
the first time you were waiting for me

187
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,760
was Giorgio's favorite.

188
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,600
But you couldn't know that.

189
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,440
I think that…

190
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,360
there's something bigger,
more powerful, that goes beyond us.

191
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
That's what I think.

192
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,400
Listen, I have to go.

193
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,400
If you don't mind, I'll go with a friend.

194
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,720
-No. I can drive you if you--
-No.

195
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,840
If you want…

196
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,000
we can meet again, even tonight,
maybe on that same bench.

197
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,640
I never thought I'd say this,
but it's good for me.

198
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,320
Maybe. I don't know.

199
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
All I know is I go crazy at home.

200
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,240
-Hey, Musella.
-I owe you one, Inspector.

201
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,040
They're all congratulating me.
Even the mobile unit couldn't believe it.

202
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,760
Okay, Musella. Get to the point.
I'm in a hurry. I'm busy.

203
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,240
Yes. Russo's car is covered
in fingerprints of a Nigerian felon,

204
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,160
a guy named Kamil Usman.

205
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,840
I sent a picture to your phone.

206
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,920
He's in Castel Volturno.
They're going to get him right now.

207
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,160
Okay. Thanks, Musella. Thanks.

208
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,360
Hey, enjoy the celebration.

209
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,600
-Thanks, Inspector.
-Bye.

210
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,840
I'll show you.

211
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,320
You fucking know-it-all.

212
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,440
-Pardo.
-Morozzi.

213
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,640
One of my informants told me
there were fingerprints

214
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,880
inside Gaspare Russo's car
belonging to a Nigerian named Kamil Usman.

215
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,920
Oh good.

216
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,640
-That's it?
-Want me to congratulate you?

217
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,800
Of course not. Never mind.

218
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,400
Come on.
The press conference is about to start.

219
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,440
-Coming. I'll be right there.
-Okay, bye.

220
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,640
What the fuck?

221
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,160
MORE SECURITY, MORE FREEDOM
I'M WITH TARALLO

222
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,040
Good morning, everyone.

223
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,560
I just talked with the police chief,

224
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,520
and we caught the man
who killed Gaspare Russo,

225
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,240
a supervisor on the tomato fields,
and our Sergio.

226
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,840
His name is…

227
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,120
Kamil Usman.

228
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,040
Turns out he's an illegal immigrant.

229
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,200
He was arrested a short time ago.
He didn't resist and…

230
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,080
he confessed.

231
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,320
Sergio was probably in that area,

232
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,000
as he often was,
because he was a researcher.

233
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,960
He was someone who took initiative.

234
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,840
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,560
That's what I liked about him.

236
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,320
After all, illegal farm work
is one of the many plagues on our country,

237
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,520
but especially in our region, Campania.

238
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,160
It's likely that Gaspare Russo
and Kamil Usman saw Sergio,

239
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,320
and something that was meant to be
a lesson or a just scare,

240
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,760
turned into a murder.

241
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,960
We lost a friend.

242
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,440
I… lost a friend.

243
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,360
My aides were so worried,
to the point they thought I might give up.

244
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,320
I want to take the opportunity
at this press conference

245
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
to assure everyone.

246
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,360
I won't give up.

247
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,160
I have no intention of giving up.
I owe it to Sergio.

248
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,400
And we'll keep fighting for our only goal.

249
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,880
"More freedom, more security." That's it.

250
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,880
Can you explain
what a 30-year-old member of your staff

251
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,760
was really doing
walking around tomato fields at night,

252
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,160
which are teeming with illegal immigrants
and supervisors linked to organized crime?

253
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,720
It's honestly hard to believe
it was either pure coincidence

254
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,720
or his own initiative.

255
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,920
Thank you.

256
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,360
Look, Sergio definitely wasn't there
at my behest.

257
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,240
But if I ever find out, or even sense

258
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,840
that I haven't been told everything
and there's more to this,

259
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
I assure you, you'll know.

260
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,080
Because I'll use all my power
to get Sergio justice.

261
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,720
Who is that?

262
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,440
Edoardo Belliti, a freelance journalist.

263
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,080
That's it. I'm done.
The press conference is over.

264
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,280
Have a nice day. If you'll excuse me.

265
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,480
So, how did it go?

266
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,760
Tarallo's good at answering.

267
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,640
We'll talk later.

268
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,720
I'll take care of it.

269
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,480
-No nuclear power!
-Calm down!

270
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,240
No nuclear power!

271
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,000
No nuclear power!

272
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,000
-Let us through, please.
-We want you out! Go away!

273
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,760
The main question remains unanswered.

274
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,520
What was Sergio Minucci doing
in the tomato fields?

275
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,960
Once we figure out what his relationship
was with fucking Gaspare Russo,

276
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,760
it'll be clearer, right?

277
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,680
But in his confession, the killer said
that he and Gaspare Russo knew each other.

278
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,240
Sergio Minucci was there by chance
or by mistake.

279
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,400
Anyway, my informant said

280
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,440
they found Gaspare Russo's phone
at Kamil's house.

281
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,760
Maybe we could clear up some doubts.

282
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,600
Oh, and can't your informant
let us have a look?

283
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,280
Well, actually I was
counting on you for that.

284
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,960
I don't like surprise visits.
Maybe you forgot.

285
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,360
I didn't forget.

286
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,720
The situation is bigger
than we thought, Terè.

287
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,640
Meaning?

288
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,480
The circumstances are strange.

289
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,600
And the killer's confession is even worse.

290
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,600
See? Your Christmas present came early.

291
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,040
I don't think I'm the right person
to get to the bottom of this.

292
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,040
Why is that?

293
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,160
You look like you're finally feeling alive
after a long time.

294
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,160
I look like I'll go to jail
if I don't do what you say.

295
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,600
You're in now.

296
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,840
Your boyfriend died slowly,

297
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,480
after getting beaten by someone
presumably looking for information.

298
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,360
Now, what would a Nigerian
working in tomato fields

299
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,560
fucking want with Sergio?

300
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,360
Say it. What do you need?

301
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,120
Tell me about Tarallo. The truth.

302
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I've been watching him for months.
He's as clean as a whistle.

303
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,520
I'm telling you one more time,
stay away from him.

304
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,040
No one in Rome has to know

305
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,320
we're creating files on candidates
the old-fashioned way.

306
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,240
Then get me Gaspare Russo's phone
from forensics.

307
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,480
That's impossible for the same reason.
I can't ask for inside favors.

308
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,360
Do you want the truth or not?

309
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,920
Lower your voice.

310
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,600
I told you there's nothing I can do.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have called you.

311
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,440
That's not true.
You called me to cover your ass.

312
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,600
Because you were fucking
an unreliable asset.

313
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,640
If this gets out,
the unit is done and so are you.

314
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,640
Watch your mouth.

315
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,040
You want me to get to the truth
before someone you can't blackmail does.

316
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,560
But I found the kid for you.
The mission's over. Fuck you!

317
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,200
The mission's over when I say it is.

318
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,120
Find a fucking way
to get to Russo's phone.

319
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,920
And use this
to copy everything that's in it.

320
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,720
Or we can end it here as you said,
and I'll see you in Poggioreale.

321
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,320
I'll send photos of your grandson
as he grows up.

322
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,560
For a moment I thought you wouldn't come.

323
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,280
She would've been happy.

324
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,400
Me too, maybe.

325
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,360
I don't know.

326
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,640
It's weird being with you
talking about Giorgio.

327
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,560
Having second thoughts?

328
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,720
No.

329
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,920
The only thing I'm sure of
is that I need to understand.

330
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,680
Earlier today, you told me about your job.

331
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,040
Did you leave him for love or your career?

332
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,840
Let's say for both.

333
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,360
Where did you learn
to read situations like that?

334
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,880
Posture, lip-reading.

335
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,840
I don't know. It comes easy.

336
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,160
Let's try something, then.
Stand there and watch.

337
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,720
I hope this doesn't seem unprofessional.

338
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,880
And until proven otherwise,
I'm actually not asking you.

339
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,560
I'm just a voice in your head.

340
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,960
Would it seem so weird
if I asked you to come to dinner with me?

341
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,080
I fell in love with a man who was my boss.

342
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,480
Our unit was specialized
in field interceptions

343
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,000
and a certain kind of stakeouts.

344
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,880
There were Mafia attacks,
violent political struggles, terrorism.

345
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,920
I was good at understanding
other people's conversations.

346
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,760
Even from afar.

347
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,720
Okay. This explains a lot.

348
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,880
How do you do it?

349
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
See those two?

350
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,040
He's the paternal grandfather.

351
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,400
"Grandpa, when's Dad coming?"

352
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,520
"He promised he'd come play with me."

353
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,560
"Your dad can't come. Something came up.
You and I can play together."

354
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,840
"No, I only want to play with Dad."

355
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,680
How do you do it?

356
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,760
The lips.

357
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,720
You just have to practice.
Sound can be superfluous.

358
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,000
What if you miss something?

359
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,000
If I miss something,
there are facial expressions, posture,

360
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,800
the movements of the hands,
shoulders and eyes.

361
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,200
It's like connecting the dots with a pen.

362
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,000
The more you observe,
the less empty space is left.

363
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,800
There's something I've never told anyone.
I don't know why I want to tell you.

364
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,040
My relationship with Giorgio…

365
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,800
Something was off.

366
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,200
He had something on his mind. You know…

367
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,120
A woman can tell.

368
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,720
The silences.

369
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,160
The blank stares.

370
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,080
I can't do what you do,
but I can connect the dots occasionally.

371
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,480
Does this change anything for you?

372
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,920
No.

373
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,800
But I hope my child will be happy
playing with only me.

374
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,200
POLICE

375
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,120
Are you ready?

376
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,640
I like how you ask,
as if I had any alternative.

377
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,000
It's called being polite.

378
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,800
Lucky me! Then yeah, I'm ready.
Thanks, that's very kind of you.

379
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,560
-I heard you were on leave.
-In fact, I am.

380
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,800
I'm asking you as a personal request.

381
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,560
The lady… She's an ex-colleague.

382
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,000
And the mom of the kid
who got run over a few days ago,

383
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,160
Giorgio Alberti.

384
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,640
She says a bracelet is missing
from her kid's belongings.

385
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,280
It's important.

386
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,920
-If you'd just let us in a second…
-No.

387
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,960
She has to come back tomorrow
when the boss is here.

388
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,160
-Even if she was a colleague, I…
-Come on, Renato. Help me out.

389
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,120
No.

390
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
All right.

391
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,480
-Nothing. He said--
-I know what he said.

392
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,040
May I?

393
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,560
-Please, ma'am.
-Good evening, agent.

394
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,160
I appreciate and understand
your respect for procedure,

395
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,640
but that bracelet
has an enormous sentimental value.

396
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,240
I can't go back to my daughter-in-law
who's eight months pregnant like this,

397
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,360
empty-handed.

398
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,000
Do not insist.

399
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,800
No. I'm just saying…

400
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,560
Let Inspector Pardo in.

Coming!

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,120
Pardo, do you need help?

00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,120
Coming, Renato. Hold on.
I'm getting my bearings.

Ma'am?

415
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,480
Everything okay, ma'am?
Hold on. I'll get you a glass of water.

416
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Listen to her…

You're a good actress too.

422
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,240
Actually, you're more reckless than good.

423
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,840
Reckless? That's a nice word.

424
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,240
Who said that my crying was fake?

425
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,320
Anyway, I see no correlation to Sergio.

426
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,720
It would seem
that Kamil's confession is real.

427
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,200
Sergio was there by chance.

428
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,240
There's no link at all
between Gaspare Russo and Sergio.

429
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,000
-And between Russo and the Nigerian?
-Nothing.

430
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,880
Unless they communicated
in some other way.

431
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,280
Maybe with Sergio too.

432
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,960
Or maybe it's just bullshit.

433
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,320
-Filomè, are you sleeping?
-Listen.

434
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,800
You could've called me, you know?

435
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,040
I'm in the car already.
I'll be home in five minutes.

436
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,840
Okay? See you there. Take care.

437
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,760
Russo sent this voice message
to his wife just before he was killed,

438
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,040
but it doesn't add anything. Or does it?

439
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,520
Do we have anything else?

440
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,400
Not on Gaspare Russo.

441
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,600
Instead, this is Sergio's stuff
that I managed to photograph.

00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,240
Nothing in the previous days.
He was in contact with his fiancée,

446
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,880
and a group chat he used
to look for a house in Chiaia's Riviera.

That's why you're the best agent

453
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,240
Stay that way.

454
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,960
Do that for me.

455
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,520
What do you want?

456
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,160
Aren't you afraid of going
in that basement alone at night?

457
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,160
I don't want to share
what I feel with you.

00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,680
How do you get over it?

459
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,720
How long does it take?

460
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,600
How do you go on? Tell me.

461
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,040
Tell me, Saretta.

462
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,280
Just do the opposite of everything I did.

463
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,320
Want a coffee?

464
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,200
-Hi, Viola.
-Hi.

465
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,880
Sorry to bother you, but I need a favor.

466
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,720
That's if you still want to keep
your mind occupied, uh?

467
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,200
I'll see.

468
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,120
Go on Sergio Minucci's

469
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,280
I just sent you the login details.

00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,000
Try to find traces of a house search.

471
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,640
House search?

472
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,800
Yes, he was looking for one
in Chiaia's Riviera,

473
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,600
through some group chats.
Can you verify that?

474
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,920
Yes. Just a sec.

475
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,520
I can do that, but why?

476
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,400
He doesn't need a house anymore.

477
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,320
No, he doesn't.

478
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,800
You have email and password
and want me to get in?

479
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,040
I have to do someone a favor
and I need your help.

480
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,280
-Okay, I'll call you back.
-Thanks.

481
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,720
If you weren't blind,
I'd say you chose an amazing view.

482
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,800
Do you know why I didn't miss
your sense of humor, Sara Morozzi?

483
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,720
Because you don't have one.

484
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,600
They were all crazy about you.
I never got why.

485
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,680
You are and always will be
a dull woman to me.

486
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm glad I left some good memories.

487
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,320
You didn't spend much time
cultivating your friendships.

488
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,640
Even if I didn't spend much time
on friendships,

489
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,360
an ex-colleague of ours needs help.

490
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,520
And I'm at a dead end. I need you.

491
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,040
The blonde and the brunette.
The stars of the unit.

492
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,720
You're like those rock bands

493
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,440
that get back together
because they ran out of money.

494
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,240
Listen, it's just a few seconds.

495
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,600
Tell me everything you hear.

496
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
Then I'll leave the same way I arrived.

497
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,760
First, I'd say this man has a thing
for cheesy music, to say the least.

498
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,760
Not enough background noise
for him to be in the city.

499
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,920
I'd say he was driving
on a secondary road.

500
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,400
No. In the country.

501
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,040
As he was finishing recording the message,
he drove over a manhole.

502
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,800
Thanks, Catapà.

503
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,040
You're almost as good as me.
Even though you're still an asshole.

504
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
And you're still a bitch.

505
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,480
As he was finishing recording the message,
he drove over a manhole.

506
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Not enough background noise
for him to be in the city.

507
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,560
I'd say he was driving
on a secondary road.

508
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,120
No. In the country.

509
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,840
Kamil Usman confessed
that he and Gaspare Russo killed Sergio.

510
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,040
Then he argued with Russo
and killed him as well.

511
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,640
Then he got rid of the bodies
in the place where they were found.

512
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,760
That's correct, yeah.

513
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,880
But it's false.

514
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,400
Because Gaspare Russo
was killed right there.

515
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,320
He wasn't with them before.
He ended up there by accident, not Sergio.

516
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,160
What we know is that Gaspare Russo
sent a voice message to his wife

517
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
just before he got killed.

518
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,560
He was driving.

519
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,000
Filomè, are you sleeping?

520
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,120
You could've called me, you know?

521
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,280
Anyway, I'm already in the car.
I'll be home in five minutes.

522
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,320
Okay? See you there. Take care.

523
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,000
He ended up just a few hundred meters
from where the bodies were found.

524
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,920
Who's this guy?

525
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,360
Let him get out of the car.

526
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,720
He got out of the car, and they shot him.

527
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,440
Hey, what happened? What are you doing?

528
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,520
What does the Nigerian
have to do with Sergio?

529
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,400
Exactly. What's he have to do with him?

530
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,080
I mean, why did Kamil lie
about what happened?

531
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,000
Like he wanted to take the blame.

532
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,800
Why did he take the blame
for someone else?

533
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,600
It's important.

534
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,160
Oh, nice.

535
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,960
So…

536
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,600
renting and renovating this house

537
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,240
was your last attempt to not get dumped?

538
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,320
It was him. Boris.

539
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,560
Let's go get some air.

540
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,160
Not you.

541
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,920
You later, okay?

542
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,720
If you wanted to go for a walk,
you could've said so.

543
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,760
I know a couple of places
that are nicer than this.

544
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,480
Relax. You don't look like a cop.

545
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,080
-Oh, you're being ironic?
-Yeah.

546
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,160
You should've been a comedian.
I piss myself laughing whenever you speak.

547
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,000
You do the honors.

548
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,840
Thanks.

549
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,080
-That's her.
-Yeah.

550
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,640
Ma'am?

551
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,360
Ma'am…

552
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,600
We're off to a good start, huh?
Ma'am, open the door.

553
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,720
Ma'am, we don't want to harm you.
The gate was open, ma'am.

554
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,280
Hey, open the door! We're from…

555
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,800
-If it's obvious, what's the difference?
-Stay back.

556
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,960
Ma'am, don't be afraid.

557
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,160
I'm Sara, a friend of Kamil's.

558
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,000
We're looking for Kamil and his family.

559
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,240
Maybe you can help me. Huh?
I just want to talk for a few minutes.

560
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,840
Can you open the door?

561
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,000
Just you and me.

562
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,080
Not him.

563
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,560
Not him.

564
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,280
Kamil Usman is in debt.

565
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,400
Even to the husband of that woman
who he had to give his house to.

566
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,560
The house? That's a house?

567
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,560
Then he got arrested…
for a crime he confessed to.

568
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,200
But the dynamic in his confession
doesn't line up with the facts.

569
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,960
The police don't get it,
he remains in prison,

570
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,280
still in debt, I guess,
and his wife and son leave.

571
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,400
Yeah. With what money?

572
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,160
The money he earned by taking the blame
for the death of Sergio and Gaspare Russo.

573
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,920
Gaspare Russo just happened to be there
at the wrong time.

574
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,200
The two deaths are not linked.
We only lost time.

575
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,560
Someone linked them later.

576
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,720
The same person who paid Kamil
to take all the blame

577
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,440
and wanted us to find his car so easily.

578
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,440
Otherwise, why didn't Kamil
torch it or sink it in the sea?

579
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,760
See? You're not dumb.

580
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,320
Some good news every now and then.

581
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,760
-So we have to start over?
-No. Why?

582
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,840
Who is it?

583
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,800
Viola.

584
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,680
Viola.

585
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,800
So, Sergio was doing something weird.

586
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,240
Exactly once a week,
he'd write in the same group

587
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,880
that he was looking for a house.

588
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,560
Same formula, but different areas
and different kinds of houses.

589
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,000
It doesn't make sense
for someone who's looking for a house,

590
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,840
unless they're schizophrenic.

591
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,400
You never met my ex.

592
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,200
It's a code.

593
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,880
I asked Viola to do research
because I noticed some coincidences.

594
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,080
His last post mentions the address
of the museum he visited before dying.

595
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,280
Look.

596
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,040
Isn't that the address
of the Museo delle Reliquie? Scroll down.

597
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,400
Isn't that where Museo del Castello is?

598
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:53,920
Yeah.

599
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,160
It was a way for Sergio
to set up a safe meeting in a museum

600
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,720
that he indicated
through the fake house search?

601
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Exactly.

602
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,960
Could you post a new ad as if he did it?

603
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:06,920
Yes.

604
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
We'll go to the meeting
and find out who he secretly met with.

605
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,920
At the Donnaregina?

606
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,720
-Yes.
-What should I write?

607
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:22,520
"Urgently looking for a spacious house
on Donnaregina Street."

608
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,160
"Tenant has references

609
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,200
and intends to continue
the activity carried out so far."

610
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,800
-Should I post it?
-Yes.

611
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,120
-I have to go now, but I'll let you know.
-Thank you.

612
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,000
-Bye, Pardo.
-Bye.

613
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
Was it really necessary to involve her?

614
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,920
Necessary, no. Useful, yes.

615
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,720
Do you think we'll find
Sergio's real killer at the museum?

616
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,440
Let's see if they take the bait.

617
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,160
Who killed Sergio
is not important anymore.

618
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,120
What's important is who's behind it.

619
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,400
The situation is more serious
than I imagined.

620
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,520
SERGIO PUBLISHED A NEW POST

621
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,880
URGENTLY LOOKING FOR SPACIOUS HOUSE
ON DONNAREGINA STREET

622
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,920
TENANT HAS REFERENCES AND INTENDS
TO CONTINUE ACTIVITY CARRIED OUT SO FAR

623
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,520
