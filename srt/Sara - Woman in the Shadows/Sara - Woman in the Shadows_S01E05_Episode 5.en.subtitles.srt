MISSED CALL
EDOARDO BELLITI

3
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,360
-Your call is being forwarded to…
-Fuck.

4
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,080
-Morozzi. Hey.
-What is it?

5
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,200
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

6
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,720
-What's all the noise? Where are you?
-Hold on, I'm moving.

7
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Listen. I found a missed call
from Edoardo on my phone.

8
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,640
I called back, but it's disconnected.

9
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,240
-Did you hear me?
-All right.

10
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm going to his house. When you're done
dancing, meet me there, okay?

11
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,600
Okay, all right.

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,040
See you there. Bye.

13
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,240
Shit.

14
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,800
SARA - WOMAN IN THE SHADOWS

15
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,240
Bye, Sara.

16
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,160
Bye.

17
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,440
Viola.

18
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,480
It's been so long
since I went to a concert.

19
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,400
Listen, I have my screening
the day after tomorrow.

20
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,320
You can come back if you want.

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,800
Maybe in a more official capacity
this time.

22
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,600
-Bye.
-Bye.

23
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,520
Go on, open this door.
Show me what you can do.

24
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,440
A jackhammer would've been more discreet.

25
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,560
Said the spy who can't pick a lock.

26
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,560
It's modern. Otherwise,
I'd open it just by looking at it.

27
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,160
-What are we looking for exactly?
-Computer and tablet.

28
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
No computer…

29
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,360
-No tablet.
-Not even a piece of paper.

30
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,360
He ran and took everything with him.

31
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,360
All this has to do with
the investigation into Tarallo.

32
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,040
So?

33
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,600
What does that mean? Huh?
That he ended up like Sergio?

34
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,160
Even if he did,
there's nothing else we could've done.

35
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,480
That's enough for you
to sleep at night? Huh?

36
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,440
Not for me.

37
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,560
Musella. Yeah.

38
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,280
I need some information.

39
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,640
Find Edoardo Belliti.

40
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,440
He's a journalist.

41
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Thanks, Musella.

42
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,320
Yeah?

43
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,120
Open up, Inspector, it's me.

44
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,680
No, I'll come down.

45
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,240
Okay.

46
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,080
Excuse me. Didn't you hear the buzzer?

47
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,360
I'm not the maid here.
I'm already taking care of the poor beast.

48
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,040
-Poor beast, my ass.
-He's suffering from loneliness.

49
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,600
No, it's me who's been suffering
from his company since I got him.

50
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,560
Can I get my jacket, please?

51
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,560
Listen, I'm going out.
Can I get you something? A coffee?

52
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,520
Yeah. Make it
a large soy ginseng macchiato.

53
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,760
Which is not coffee, but…

54
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,000
Ignore him. He doesn't deserve you.

55
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,520
-Hey.
-Inspector.

56
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,120
Oh. Rough night, I see, huh?

57
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,160
We have nothing on the journalist
at the moment.

58
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,840
No one has reported him missing,
and he didn't check into any hospitals.

59
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,560
Same goes for the ports and airports.

60
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,080
And obviously, no body either.

61
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,080
Okay.

62
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,520
And?

63
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,040
-What?
-That's it?

64
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,600
That's it.

65
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,120
Couldn't you have texted me?
You came all the way to my house.

66
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,120
I could have, Inspector,
but you're my informant now.

67
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,280
-I'm what? Your informant?
-Just joking.

68
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,680
I wanted something more intimate.
It's been a while and I missed you.

69
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Got it.

70
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,560
-See you.
-Hold on, Inspector. There is one thing…

71
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,200
-Remember Pino Failla, the patrol car guy?
-Yes. The one with the goatee…

72
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,160
The ugly, obnoxious guy. What about him?

73
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,480
-Ugly is subjective.
-Pino Failla's ugly.

74
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,280
-I know that women like him.
-Yeah? Okay.

75
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,280
-Anyway, yesterday…
-Yes?

76
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,880
He offered me a coffee.

77
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,680
-What do I care?
-He asked lots of questions.

78
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,160
-He wanted to know stuff about you.
-Failla?

79
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,240
The leave, what you're doing,
how you are, who you work with…

80
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,240
-It was weird.
-What did you tell him?

81
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,480
Nothing. I was vague.

82
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,280
All right. Well done.

83
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,160
Actually, it is weird.

84
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,560
-What now?
-Nothing, Musella. Absolutely nothing.

85
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,280
If he asks you any more questions,
you come tell me, okay?

86
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,040
-Fine.
-I got stuff to do.

87
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,960
Hey, I'll top up your phone credit, okay?

88
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,440
-Just text me. No need to come here.
-Where are you going?

89
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,040
Mind your fucking business.
I'm going for a coffee.

90
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,920
Ginseng macchiato…

91
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,040
-Whatever.
-Okay. thanks.

92
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,760
Nothing for me?

93
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,320
Again?
You don't scare me anymore, Morozzi.

94
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,520
What did Musella say?

95
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
He says that a colleague of mine,

96
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,320
an idiot called Failla,
is asking lots of questions about me.

97
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,960
-Okay, I'll handle that.
-Yeah.

98
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,920
-Belliti?
-Edoardo?

99
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,720
Nobody seems to be missing him.

100
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,840
Anyway, no. We haven't found him.
What about Tarallo's car?

101
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,160
Nothing much.

102
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,080
Can you see if there's anything
on the kid's phone?

103
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,320
-Meanwhile, let's go to the newspaper.
-No.

104
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,880
No. You have to give me a moment
to fix my fucking beard.

105
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,400
Hold on.

106
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,640
There's an unread message
from this morning.

107
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,680
From a guy named Luigi Laudanna.

108
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,560
It says, "Still need my help?
I'll see you at 10:30 a.m."

109
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,520
-Who's this guy Laudanna?
-Yeah.

110
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,560
Just a sec.
Grandpa here has zero reception.

111
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,880
Here he is. History of Political Doctrine
professor at Federico II.

112
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,440
Confirm the meeting with the professor,
and ask Teresa to track Edoardo's phone.

113
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,120
I'll go to the university.

114
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,360
Shave your beard.
You really look like an old man.

115
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
I'm off.

116
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,440
It's not true.

117
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,080
The beard looks good on you.

118
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,360
She's old-fashioned.

119
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,520
I can't right now. I'm expecting someone.

120
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,960
Come back on Thursday.

121
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
The person you're expecting isn't coming.

122
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Excuse me?

123
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
Edoardo's not coming.

124
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,080
He seems to have disappeared.

125
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,400
Tell me what you know
and why you were supposed to meet today.

126
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,120
What are you talking about?

127
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,160
I'm sorry, who are you?

128
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,040
I'm the only one who can help him
if he's really in danger. Trust me.

129
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,400
In danger?

130
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,800
Do you often help him
with his investigations?

131
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
No. Actually…

132
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Never.

133
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,320
But…

134
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,920
Maybe something bad happened to him?

135
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
That's what we are trying to understand.
Help me, Professor.

136
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,400
Edoardo is one of those rare gems

137
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,720
universities have trouble holding on to.

138
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,680
We had an argument about this.

139
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,640
I had an outburst of jealousy.

140
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,720
And I was unlucky too.

141
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,200
Because in that same period,

142
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,600
his best friend,

143
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,320
a researcher at an institute
on this same floor…

144
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,160
He died. The poor guy.

145
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,120
Maybe you heard about him.

146
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,080
Sergio Minucci.

147
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,360
Of course.

148
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,840
-And he was here, on the same floor?
-Yes.

149
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,280
2 YEARS

150
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,440
You're engaged, right?

151
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
It's a bit complicated.

152
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,640
We decided not to smother each other.

153
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,400
We each have our own space.

154
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,640
COPY ALL FILES?

155
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
Who locked this door?

156
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,960
Open up!

157
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,000
They can't hear us.
Call security, there's someone in there.

158
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,280
Sara. I found something interesting
in Sergio's files. Look.

159
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,240
An encrypted file called "Richelieu"
nested into several subfiles.

160
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,800
Look, I printed everything out.

161
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,920
It's Edoardo's investigation.

162
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,000
They really were after him, huh?

163
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Hey.

164
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,000
He's the Italians' boss.

165
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,440
Shoulders back, no sign of tension.

166
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,840
He's there to make sure
everything goes as it should.

167
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,680
In fact, when the meeting's over,
the others don't leave until he does.

168
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,480
Why did those three Italians
go see the German neo-Nazis?

169
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,560
I'm sorry, but what I just saw
doesn't suggest anything.

170
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,760
Lip-reading's hard
because of the low lighting.

171
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,800
But I'm sure they're talking about crowds,
players, and right timing.

172
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,640
We need concrete evidence,

173
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,520
not predictions based on pixelated images
where you can't see shit.

174
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,400
I have to report
to the Parliamentary Committee.

175
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,480
-Not to the bowls club.
-Yes, we know that.

176
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,360
In fact, you don't need to make
a great effort. Just report it.

177
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,800
-They're talking about an attack.
-I'm not here to be insulted.

178
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,360
-I'm a Senator of the Republic.
-No, there's no need to get worked up.

179
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,800
Maybe we all need to calm down here, huh?

180
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,360
Did you verify the identity
of the guy presumed to be the leader?

181
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,120
The wiretaps are fuzzy,
but we believe his name is Enrico.

182
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,240
We're trying to identify him.

183
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,920
Is someone really following you,
or did you just miss this place?

184
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,200
Black Opel with a suspicious plate.
I already checked.

185
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,440
Maybe it belongs to the nosy cop
I texted you about.

186
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,960
Failla? No way. I asked.

187
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,080
He's fucking Pardo's ex.

188
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,480
All those questions
were probably due to him feeling guilty.

189
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,960
Unlucky guy.

190
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,880
Edoardo's phone was switched off
at 10:48 p.m.

191
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,760
The Pianura cell tower picked it up,
near the construction sites.

192
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,560
I found this in an encrypted file
on Sergio's computer,

193
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,320
along with the material
gathered for the investigation.

194
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,040
With Tarallo.

195
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,880
We know that Cosa Nostra
is planning more attacks.

196
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,760
It's been planting bombs
with someone's help for 18 months.

197
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,920
I get it, Massimiliano. But the fascists?

198
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,240
-With the German neo-Nazis?
-Why not?

199
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,800
The Years of Lead are over, Massimiliano.

200
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,920
The people out there have moved on.
If we don't too, we've already lost.

201
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,040
Goddamn. Just trust me, okay?

202
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,640
Our procedures
and protocols are certified.

203
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,200
This unit follows scientific methods.

204
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,200
What are they saying?

205
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,520
-They don't trust us.
-Obviously. The assholes.

206
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,880
We have to find that guy anyway.

207
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,400
"We have to find that guy anyway.
He doesn't work for Cosa Nostra, okay?"

208
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,760
So, it's either political,
or something we don't know about.

209
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,960
But if he really wants to plant a bomb
somewhere, we need to stop it.

210
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,160
Tamburi…

211
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,800
"You and a few other trusted officials
have one specific task."

212
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,960
Stop the mafia attacks.

213
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,080
Maybe I wasn't clear.

214
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,600
-That's what I'm trying to do!
-Massimiliano. Hey.

215
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,160
Teresa, is everything okay?

216
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,760
You didn't tell me you were coming back.
Need something?

217
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,440
What year did they get to?

218
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,240
Up to 2000.

219
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,040
Sent to Rome or destroyed.

220
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,680
When did you decide to get so efficient?

221
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,720
Us? The people in Rome are in a rush.

222
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,920
Don't touch the folders in my office.

223
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
-Clear?
-Clear.

224
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,560
-What place is that?
-I'm trying to figure it out.

225
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,920
Your phone.

226
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,200
-Anna Maria?
-What is it, Teresa?

227
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,800
You have to do me a favor.

228
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,680
Find out everything you can
on Enrico Vigilante.

229
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,480
-It has maximum priority. Hurry up.
-Bye.

230
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,760
Can you take over?
I need to make some calls.

231
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,440
-Hello?
-Musè, hey!

232
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,800
I'm your informant. How are you?

233
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,440
Fine, thanks.

234
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Listen, I need a favor.

235
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I need a list of all the illegal
construction sites that were put on hold.

236
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,200
-From all of Naples?
-No, Pianura and the surrounding areas.

237
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,520
-Okay?
-Okay. I'll do it as soon as I can.

238
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,200
Okay, thanks. Bye.

239
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,200
Rachele?

240
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,680
Hello.

241
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,920
What's going on?

242
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,440
I wanted to give you this.

243
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,560
You'll admit you don't look like the open,
detached couple you described.

244
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,120
What do you mean? We had freedom,
but that doesn't mean we weren't in love.

245
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,640
Anything else? I'm waiting for my father.

246
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,320
Did Sergio ever introduce you
to his dear friend Edoardo Belliti?

247
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,640
He's a journalist. Remember him?

248
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,760
Vaguely, I might've met him once.

249
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,520
Really, it's been a rough day.

250
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,880
Does the name Enrico Vigilante
mean anything to you?

251
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,480
No, I don't think so.
As I said, I'm meeting my father.

252
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,760
Have a nice evening.

253
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,800
-Pardo?
-Hey, Morozzi.

254
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,280
We identified the place
where Tarallo and Vigilante met.

255
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,080
Via Pascetta,
near the building sites in Pianura.

256
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,920
That's where Edoardo's phone
was switched off.

257
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,080
-That's why I looked there first.
-Perfect. Good job.

258
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,800
-I'll be right there.
-Okay.

259
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,200
Get your legs off of there.
This isn't your house, okay?

260
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,880
I don't want to rub it in
with gender stereotypes, okay?

261
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,200
But do you realize you drove 20 kilometers
more than needed to get here?

262
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,760
I don't want to rub it in either and say
that you're superficial, like all men are,

263
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,800
but did you notice that we have an admirer
who's been tailing us for days?

264
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,120
-No. Honestly, I didn't.
-Exactly.

265
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,840
-I took the long way to lose him.
-Could it be Failla?

266
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,000
It's Pino Failla, the dickface.

267
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,320
Can't your friend incinerate him
with a satellite?

268
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,160
Whoever it is, he needs to think
he's wasting time with us.

269
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,840
It's here.

270
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,840
Here we are.

271
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,480
Take this.

272
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,360
Pardo.

273
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,640
Enrico Vigilante,
the man you saw with Tarallo,

274
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,800
I already know him.

275
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,000
In the '90s we were all over him,
but never managed to catch him.

276
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,160
I don't know what he's up to now,
but I can assure you he's very dangerous.

277
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,000
Dangerous how?

278
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,560
Cosa Nostra called him
to get fascists to plant bombs.

279
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,600
If he has anything to do
with Sergio or Edoardo, the situation--

280
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,120
Let me get this straight.
Are you worried about me?

281
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,840
Whatever this guy did,
it takes a lot more to upset me, okay?

282
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,480
Good. In that case,
I can get something else off my chest.

283
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,360
You don't need to protect me. Go ahead.

284
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,360
Failla doesn't want to frame you.

285
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,400
He just feels guilty
because he's fucking your ex.

286
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,840
Pardo.

287
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,120
Look.

288
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,080
Fuck.

289
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,520
Edoardo's glasses.

290
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,320
Now tell me again
there's nothing else we could've done.

291
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
I've seen plenty of shit in my life.

292
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,160
I've seen people getting killed
for the most absurd reasons.

293
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,080
But this dark evil.

294
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,680
These hidden, abstract interests…
I just don't get it.

295
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,280
-You don't need to get it.
-Yeah.

296
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,640
-If anything, you have to fight it.
-Fuck that.

297
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,920
It makes me sick, Morozzi.

298
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,640
It makes me sick. It scares me.

299
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,440
I want nothing to do with it.

300
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,920
I bet those shits took the body

301
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,200
and took it somewhere else
to stage another farce, right?

302
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,240
The poor kid even did them a favor
by being Black.

303
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,480
Why didn't I answer the phone?

304
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,360
Here, you talk to Musella.
I don't give a fuck.

305
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,840
Tomorrow I want you all out.

306
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,800
-The fuck are you doing?
-What am I doing?

307
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,080
Tell your friend.

308
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,720
Tell the Minister of the Interior.
Tell the Pope! I'm done! It's over!

309
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,840
Will you calm down?

310
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,120
Calm down? Calm down, my ass!
And get those legs off there!

311
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,440
-Don't fucking touch me!
-Shut up! Shut up.

312
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,160
TARALLO - CAMPANIA
MORE SAFETY, MORE FREEDOM

313
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,680
Given the time,
I hope this will at least be entertaining.

314
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,840
I'm afraid the journalist is dead, Teresa.

315
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,240
They haven't found the body,
but the meeting spot was full of blood.

316
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,280
They found three shell casings
and two bullets,

317
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,880
which means the third
is still in the body.

318
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,560
He's fucking with us again.

319
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,160
If they'd listened to us back then…

320
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,040
Vigilante had to be taken down
right there.

321
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,680
Yeah, the whole thing
drove Massimiliano crazy.

322
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,280
He was obsessed with it until the end.

323
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,760
He never got over that missed opportunity,
and for failing afterwards.

324
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,760
He was right. He got it all wrong.

325
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,280
And since I took his place,
I know that wasn't his only mistake.

326
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,160
So it's destiny for whoever's in charge
to get it all wrong.

327
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,640
Sure. It's far more convenient to hide.
That way, you don't make mistakes.

328
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,040
It's Anna Maria. She says
your inspector wants us to fuck off.

329
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,720
Yeah, it was too much for him.
Might as well let him go. He won't talk.

330
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,320
Can you handle going ahead on your own?
Or is this investigation over?

331
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,480
What the fuck are you talking about?

332
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,760
Don't make me remind you
how we got into this mess.

333
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,800
I'll see you at Pardo's.

334
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,280
Listen, I have my screening
the day after tomorrow.

335
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,240
You can come back if you want.

336
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,760
Maybe in a more official capacity
this time.

337
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,360
No, God damn it.

338
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,600
Not today.

339
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,440
Not today. Fuck, not today!

340
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,400
Come on, let's go. Come on.

341
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,480
MUSELLA

342
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,240
Hey.

343
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,680
What happened? What's wrong?

344
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,560
That car's still tailing me.

345
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,880
I didn't feel like putting Viola at risk.

346
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,200
We're waiting for Slim
to pack everything up here.

347
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,240
-Musella texted me.
-What did he say?

348
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,440
He says that the DNA found in Pianura
belongs to two people.

349
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,040
One's probably Edoardo's.
The other one we don't know.

350
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,640
We know the casings and the bullets,

351
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,600
because they're from the same gun
that killed Gaspare Russo.

352
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,920
So, what do they think?

353
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,080
They're checking it out.

354
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,320
The hypothesis is that
there was a struggle,

355
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,240
some gunfire,
but they didn't have time to clean up.

356
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,040
So two people are dead?

357
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,320
-There are three.
-Three?

358
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,720
Musella said Edoardo's informant
was stabbed last night.

359
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,680
A mugging, they say.
Who the fuck believes that?

360
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,320
But Edoardo's body and the guy who died
with him are missing. Which is weird.

361
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,240
They're obviously waiting
for the right time to pull them out.

362
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,120
Anyway, Edoardo's Vespa was found nearby.

363
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,800
-So he went there willingly?
-Yeah.

364
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,320
They must've tipped him off,
but it was a trap.

365
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,240
Exactly.

366
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,320
And they finished him right there.

367
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,600
So you're still with us?

368
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,600
No. But since you're still here,
I wanted to tell you myself.

369
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,240
Hold on. There's a conversation
you need to hear.

370
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,520
Turn up the volume.

371
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,640
Thanks for finding the time, Enrico.

372
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,040
Actually, I didn't find the time,
so make it quick.

373
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,360
What do you have to tell me?

374
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,960
-It's Vigilante.
-It's Vigilante.

375
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,640
I heard about a private poll

376
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,840
that puts me four points behind.

377
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,280
That's a lot, right?

378
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,080
It depends.

379
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,240
But we're ready for anything, right?

380
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,200
Some other magic trick
from our master and…

381
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,640
let's say a little push
at the end of the electoral campaign.

382
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,640
You're asking me if I have
everything under control?

383
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,120
And what about you?

384
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,400
Do you have everything under control?

385
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,720
To tell you the truth,
something else came to mind.

386
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,880
-Is that right?
-Yes.

387
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,440
Because, according to this poll,

388
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,560
what my voters don't like about my program
is neither security nor immigration.

389
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,920
It's energy.

390
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,920
What about energy?

391
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
My voters are divided on nuclear energy.

392
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:56,320
We had a referendum against it.
It's expensive and it… scares people.

393
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,840
Are you backing out?

394
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,960
No. It's not backing out.

395
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,320
-It's an opportunity.
-I heard you.

396
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,600
But I don't know what the fuck it means.

397
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,280
It means that we should tone down
some of our positions.

398
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,800
I mean, give people time to digest it.

399
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,960
That's all.

400
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,200
Your voters would love that, right?

401
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,120
Yes.

402
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,480
Because you have voters now.

403
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,880
Yes, I do.

404
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,400
I know we started
with nuclear energy, but…

405
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,520
I have a strong gut feeling
and I'd like to go with it.

406
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,800
It's winning that counts after all.
Am I wrong?

407
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,280
You're not wrong.

408
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,040
Anything else you have to tell me?

409
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,280
Not right now.

410
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,240
Goodbye, then. Take care.

411
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,920
We have another problem.

412
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,720
Look at that. Look at that profile.

413
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,640
He really looks like a scoundrel.

414
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,400
Everything's looking good. Very good.

415
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,360
I'm starting to get contractions, though.

416
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,880
Considering how far along you are,
your cervix is a bit short,

417
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,160
but the kid's ahead.

418
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,320
It's okay if he's born a little early.

419
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,480
Kiddo,

420
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,080
we're almost there.

421
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,080
You sure that second-hand smoke
won't hurt me?

422
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,880
I'm not a lung specialist.

423
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,200
If a glass of wine at dinner is okay…

424
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,120
Is someone coming to pick you up
or do you have to take… the bus again?

425
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,480
-In this heat…
-No, someone's coming.

426
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,840
Actually, I have to go.

427
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,360
No, wait.

428
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,720
There's something
I want to tell you before you go.

429
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm going to be a grandpa.

430
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,240
That's great! Congratulations!

431
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,440
My son told me that he and Giorgio
talked a lot about it.

432
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,440
He would have liked…

433
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
for the kids to grow up together.

434
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,720
Like they did, right?

435
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,080
But now that Giorgio…

436
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,240
isn't here anymore,

437
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,480
if you want,

438
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,560
we can do the same with you.

439
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,320
And the little one.

440
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,560
What do you think?

441
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,280
Excuse me.

442
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,880
I'm growing old.

443
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,040
Tarallo knows about the sham.

444
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,520
He even asked to stage a bigger one,
for the finale.

445
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,160
What the fuck do we care
about arresting Tarallo?

446
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,640
Didn't you hear how scared he was?
Tarallo's a puppet.

447
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,040
Vigilante's the puppet master,
like 30 years ago.

448
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,280
What will we do if he wins the election?

449
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,920
It'll be a mess.
It's exactly what Vigilante wants.

450
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,320
What Vigilante wants
is a nuclear power plant.

451
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,240
That's not the point.
And we can't prove it.

452
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,680
VIOLA

453
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,320
-Should I step in?
-Mind your own business.

454
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,400
That pause, Teresa.

455
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,080
That low, upset tone, when Tarallo
was talking about the power plant…

456
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,880
I heard that pause!

457
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,240
But I don't care, because unlike you,

458
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,920
who does not exist, I report to someone.

459
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,280
I need to have something
to take action, okay?

460
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,440
If I have proof against the possible
future regional governor, I'll use it.

461
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,800
Bullshit. You're just covering your ass.
Because the unit is done. Shut down!

462
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,600
You need a trophy to show off
to make it to retirement.

463
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,040
What did Lembo offer you?

464
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,840
A nice seat in Rome
to top off your career?

465
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,120
And what if he did?

466
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,720
You think you're less selfish than that?

467
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,480
You think someone believes
you're doing this for your country?

468
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,040
You don't think it's obvious
you want to get Vigilante

469
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,160
to settle the score for Massimiliano? Huh?

470
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,440
Then do it. You're free to do it.

471
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,880
Unless it gets in the way
of national security

472
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,920
and what I want. Period!

473
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,160
Either you tell me what the fuck
is going on or you can leave.

474
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,280
It's your call.

475
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,600
It's very likely that Vigilante
represents a powerful group

476
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,880
interested in building
a nuclear plant in Campania.

477
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,600
I heard that. Thanks. So what?

478
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,960
So someone's paying him
to make it possible, whatever the cost.

479
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,400
That's why he chose
a manageable politician.

480
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,600
There are other powerful groups
that are equally important.

481
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,520
The other night at the restaurant,
they offered Tarallo money directly.

482
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,600
To embrace their cause, renewable energy.

483
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,000
That's why Tarallo asked Vigilante
to abandon the nuclear plant project.

484
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,280
Not knowing that that's exactly why
Vigilante wanted him

485
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,520
and what may win the election for him.

486
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,760
Good.

487
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,440
So? What should we do now?
Go after Tarallo?

488
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,640
Exactly.

489
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,840
Because what we just told you
is plausible, but very difficult to prove.

490
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,080
While we have clear, simple proof

491
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,400
that Sergio and Edoardo's investigation
was solid.

492
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,600
And that Tarallo is dirty.
We'll see about the rest.

493
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,440
I'm out here. I can hear you.
Open the door!

494
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,000
Open up!

495
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,600
Do you understand what I do
for a fucking living or not?

496
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,040
If I don't answer,
it's because I can't, or I don't want to.

497
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,280
You're a bitch!
I can't believe I trusted you!

498
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,520
My mother was right.
You're a bitch and a liar! Fuck you!

499
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
We're being tailed, not sentenced
to death. That was unnecessary.

500
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,640
I don't want to put her at risk.
She'll understand.

501
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,000
Teresa.

502
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,080
What?

503
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,880
-I'm almost done with Vigilante's file.
-So?

504
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,440
It looks like he has a big media company
nested like Chinese boxes.

505
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,400
And guess what?
It's one of Paolo Anzovino's companies.

506
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
Rachele's father.

507
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,000
There. He's the one
who put Sergio on Tarallo's staff.

508
