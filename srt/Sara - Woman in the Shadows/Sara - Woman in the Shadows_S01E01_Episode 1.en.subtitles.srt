00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,760
BASED ON MAURIZIO DE GIOVANNI'S NOVELS

2
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,320
SARA - THE WOMAN IN THE SHADOWS

3
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,240
A FEW DAYS EARLIER

4
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,560
-Hello?
-Hi, Morozzi. It's you, right?

5
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,720
-Is this still your number?
-Yes. Who's this?

6
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,200
It's Di Blasio.
I was in the operations room.

7
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,440
Giorgio Alberti is your son, right?

8
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,200
Yes.

9
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,520
Okay, listen… You need to come
to Cardarelli Hospital.

10
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Cardarelli Hospital?

11
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,960
What ward?

12
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,120
AUTOPSY ROOM

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,560
My condolences.

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,040
May I?

15
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,400
Do you want to sit down?

16
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,200
I have to send your son's belongings
to forensics.

17
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
It's procedure.

18
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,960
She's a colleague. She knows how it works.

19
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
What happened, exactly?

20
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,960
You can talk to the first responders.

21
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,080
We can't spend any more money.
What am I going to do with you?

22
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,280
You're still betting?

23
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,400
It happened again last night.
20 teams, over 1.5. And Monza? 1-0.

24
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,680
You never win. You're only wasting money.
Don't you get it?

25
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,200
Here they are.

26
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,600
That's our colleague.
She looks like a bum.

27
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,680
They killed her son.

28
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,480
You think she'd
waste time picking out her clothes?

29
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,840
Major Sara Morozzi on leave.

30
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,400
Agents Silvani and Fregoli,
from the Fuorigrotta precinct.

31
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,320
My condolences.

32
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,560
I really need to go back now, Morozzi.
Be strong.

33
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,560
I need to know how it happened. And where.

34
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,360
It was right outside his house.

35
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,960
He was walking his dog,
and… as he was crossing the road…

36
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,720
What's the address?

37
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
We hadn't seen each other in a while.

38
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,840
He lived at 20 Piazza D'Annunzio.

39
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,840
The man who hit him
said he had no time to brake.

40
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,160
He's devastated.

41
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,880
He said he died
in the ambulance as he held his hand.

42
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,640
He rode along because your son's partner
wasn't up to it.

43
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,480
Did you know he had a partner?

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,000
No. I know nothing about him.

45
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
I need to talk to that man.

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,760
Maybe he's still at the ER.
His name's Ludovico Terzani.

47
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm the mother of the young man you hit.

48
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,840
It wasn't my fault.

49
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm a doctor.
I should save lives. And yet…

50
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
Tell me about the accident.

51
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
I didn't see him in time.

52
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,920
I saw the light on his phone first,
then his silhouette, and…

53
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,280
I think he was texting someone.
I don't know.

54
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,200
He hesitated, and…

55
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,080
What do you mean, he hesitated?

56
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,880
When I saw him…

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,520
I instinctively slowed down
and flashed my lights.

58
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,240
And he stopped.

59
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,280
But as soon as I sped up again,

60
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,600
he let go of the dog
and jumped in the street.

61
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,120
And I couldn't avoid him.

62
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,720
Sara!

64
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,320
Sara! Please stop, Sara!

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,040
You don't know what you're doing.
You're crazy!

66
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,520
I can't fake it, Gennaro.

67
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,320
What? Being with your son is faking it?

68
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,040
-I can't give him what he needs!
-Dad, where is Mom going?

69
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,280
Dad will be right back, sweetie.
Go home. Go on.

70
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,720
Sweetie.

71
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,920
Di Blasio, what is this woman doing here?

72
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,480
I get it, but she's the kid's mother.

73
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,360
She wants to talk with her son's partner.
Why does she need to talk to us?

74
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,720
Really?

75
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,800
I get it. But it's late, Di Blasio.

76
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,960
Honestly, if what you're saying is true,
it's also a little late to get involved.

77
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,320
-Don't you think?
-Did it happen here?

78
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,200
Di Blasio, my colleague's here.
I'll call you back. Bye.

79
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,000
Sorry. I didn't see you.
Inspector Davide Pardo.

80
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,840
You asked where he was hit, right?
It's difficult to tell.

81
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,840
The asphalt's wet,
and there aren't any skid marks, but…

82
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay, got it.

83
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,040
Musella!

84
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,800
Inspector.

85
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,480
I'm going up to the dead kid's partner.
You stay with her.

86
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,400
Who is she?

87
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,320
The kid's mom. A former colleague too.

88
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,480
-The kid's mom?
-Yeah.

89
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,920
My condolences, ma'am.

90
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,960
And you are?

91
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,640
Sergeant Attilio Musella.

92
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,680
You're no more than a kid yourself.

93
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,760
You have nice eyes, you know that?

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
Thanks.

95
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,720
My son Giorgio's phone was missing
from his personal effects.

96
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,040
The guy who hit him
said he was holding it.

97
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,840
I have it.

98
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,720
I found it about 30 feet over there,
in the dark. But it's broken.

99
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
-So you haven't handed it in yet?
-No.

100
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,360
I mean, not yet.

101
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,440
I'd like to see it.

102
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,320
That's not possible, ma'am.

103
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,280
For you young people, your phones
are like snapshots of your life.

104
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,680
It's been ages
since I knew anything about my son.

105
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
Sir?

106
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Yeah, Giovanni. Go on.

107
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,400
The tow truck hasn't arrived yet.
Should I call him again?

108
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,280
-Yeah, good. Call him.
-Okay, sir. I'll call and keep you posted.

109
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,920
Thank you.

110
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,680
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.

111
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,440
-Imagine the state she's in.
-How, if you don't let me in?

112
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,760
Tell her I'm here.
If she doesn't want to see me, I'll leave.

113
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,440
Excuse me.

114
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,200
Your partner's mom is here.
Giorgio's mom. She wants to talk to you.

115
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,760
She had the nerve to show up now?
Tell her Viola doesn't want to see her.

116
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
My daughter's pregnant.

117
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,160
You need to leave her alone.

118
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,040
Sorry, I need some information.

119
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,840
I'll send her away if you want.

120
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,800
How far along are you?

121
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,960
Eight months. It's a boy.

122
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,080
What do you want?

123
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,800
What was Giorgio's job?

124
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,560
He was a researcher at Napoli Biochimica.

125
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,640
Did he ever have problems at work?
Any arguments?

126
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,120
Everybody loved Giorgio.

127
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,320
He was really sweet.

128
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
What time did he get back?

129
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,760
At 9:00 p.m.

130
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,640
It had just stopped raining,
then he took a shower…

131
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,440
He had dinner and took our dog Rita
for a walk, just like always.

132
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,640
I don't understand what's going on.

133
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,240
-I just need to understand.
-Understand what? It was an accident.

134
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,320
You answer now. I have a question.

135
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,040
How do you abandon your own son?

136
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
Like you did. He was seven.

137
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,600
I fell in love,
and Giorgio didn't want to see me anymore.

138
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,240
-Sara Morozzi?
-Yes.

139
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,280
Please come in.

140
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,240
-Do you want some coffee?
-No, thanks.

141
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,640
Naples Police, right?

142
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,720
Listen, my goal is to assemble
a team of skilled agents,

143
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,520
ready to commit totally to the job.

144
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,000
We have new challenges,
and I can't afford mistakes.

145
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,520
Naples is a new challenge every day.

146
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,880
I'm not talking about Naples.
Or about raids or arrests.

147
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,160
What is it, then?

148
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,600
Outside the bar
where I had coffee this morning,

149
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,240
I saw this graffiti on the wall that said,

150
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,160
"After the chilling Years of Lead,

151
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,560
let's enjoy these warm years of shit."

152
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,960
It's true. The Years of Lead
are a thing of the past.

153
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,360
But the subversive cells, they keep going.

154
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,840
They're just subtler,
more hybrid, more hidden.

155
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,880
I believe that's
the Secret Service's duty.

156
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,480
Shovel the shit.

157
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
-Coffee?
-Yes, thanks.

158
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,160
Coming.

159
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,880
God, you've aged.

160
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,320
So have you, but you hide it well.

161
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,480
I'm sorry about your son.

162
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,840
Is the guy who just left
a friend or a new recruit?

163
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,360
-He's someone we can use.
-So, work's going as usual?

164
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,400
Well, a lot has changed.

165
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,720
Now they gave us this American software

166
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,680
that crosschecks data
and flags any suspects.

167
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,400
But you're still in charge
of audio surveillance?

168
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,680
Yes, of course. We are.

169
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,960
Did you hear I'm the boss now?

170
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,320
No. But I'm glad. You're good.

171
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
That's not true.

172
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,320
You should have taken
Massimiliano's place, not me.

173
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,120
What we were doing
only made sense to me with him.

174
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,920
Seeing him die
like that must've been horrible.

175
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,600
We were keeping track, in our way, but…

176
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,920
You know the rules.
We couldn't get in touch.

177
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,200
You didn't come here
to talk about the past.

178
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,160
No.

179
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,320
It's about Giorgio.

180
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,680
It was an accident, right?

181
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,960
He was writing or reading a text
when he got run over.

182
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,440
I want to know
who he was communicating with.

183
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,760
And whatever you might get out of this.

184
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,320
I think he took his own life.

185
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,920
But I need to know if that's the case.

186
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,480
I can't do it on my own.

187
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,760
I need your help.

188
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,880
Considering how you left,
I shouldn't talk to you.

189
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,560
You know that?

190
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,440
-I'll be in touch, okay?
-How?

191
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,080
The old way. That hasn't changed.

192
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,560
ACCESS FORBIDDEN
DANGER OF DEATH

193
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,040
-Hi, Teresa.
-Good morning.

194
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,840
Everything okay?

195
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,560
All good.

196
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,120
Hey. What's up? How's it going?

197
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,040
-Dead, more or less.
-Mm.

198
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,600
-See what Sergio does?
-What?

199
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,880
He has this habit. Every time he enters
Tarallo's office, he looks at the camera.

200
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,600
Does he know he works
for the Secret Service?

201
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,120
It's okay.
Those guys have no fucking clue.

202
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,800
What can you get out of this,
apart from what's on it?

203
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,280
-Whatever's stored on the cloud.
-Good.

204
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,160
I need all of it, including call logs
and location history. Everything.

205
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,040
I can't ask the phone company.

206
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,200
-I have to hack in?
-Hack away!

207
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
What a drag, though.
This way, I lose my focus.

208
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,480
When you were still in diapers,

209
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,600
I teamed up with an agent who,
with no mics or headphones,

210
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,720
without any fucking thing,
just by looking at the guy's lips,

211
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,920
could have told me everything he said.

212
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,200
No one could read lips like she could.

213
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,680
What happened to her?

214
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,680
She thinks she's dead…

215
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,960
but maybe she's not.

216
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,560
Your gift is still incomplete,

217
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,240
but you were always the best at waiting.

218
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,360
GIORGIO: WHO ASKED YOU THAT?
LO GIUDICE: DAVIDE

219
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
What are you doing here?

220
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,920
Do you regret it?

221
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,000
I miss him.

222
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,560
NAPOLI BIOCHIMICA

223
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,200
-Good morning.
-Morning.

224
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,120
I'm Giorgio's mother.
I'd like to talk to his boss.

225
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,840
Of course. Follow me.
We're sorry for what happened.

226
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,800
Thank you.

227
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,080
Andrea, may I? Please wait here.

228
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,560
How's that possible?
Giorgio told me she was dead.

229
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,000
Fine, let her in,
and tell them I'll be 20 minutes late.

230
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,360
Colonel Prati is waiting
for you at the base.

231
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Let her wait.

232
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,240
There's no point in sending someone else
if I'm taking Giorgio's place.

233
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,520
-Please.
-Thank you.

234
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,840
We're all devastated about what happened.

235
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,480
My deepest condolences.

236
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Was he happy?

237
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
Yes, I think so.

238
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,520
He liked his job.

239
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,480
And he was about to have a kid.

240
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,680
The day of the accident,
Giorgio took your place in "LP."

241
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,040
According to the messages you exchanged,
he insisted on it. Why?

242
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,920
He needed the afternoon off.
I don't know why. I didn't ask.

243
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,880
What does "LP" stand for?

244
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,600
Sorry, ma'am, but why are you asking
so many questions?

245
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,320
Why are you so interested?

246
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,960
Because Giorgio's gone.

247
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,160
I'm curious about everything.

248
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

249
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,640
We have important clients.
They demand confidentiality.

250
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,280
Did he have specific duties?
A position of responsibility?

251
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
-Did he make a mistake?
-No mistakes.

252
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,360
Was that his?

253
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,800
Yes.

254
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,200
To Giorgio, I really was dead.

255
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,840
-Hello.
-Andrea Lo Giudice. They're expecting me.

256
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,840
Let me check.

257
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,320
-Sir, we need to do a check.
-Sure.

258
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,240
Mr. Lo Giudice!

259
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,720
Colonel Prati, good morning.

260
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,280
I'll handle everything, at least for now.

261
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,360
I already accessed the data
Giorgio collected before the accident.

262
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,080
They're encrypted files. Don't worry.

263
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,680
UNKNOWN
PIZZA. YOUR PLACE.

264
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,400
How the hell can you live in this dump?

265
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,480
Massimiliano wouldn't approve.

266
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,840
Massimiliano is dead.

267
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,600
The dead don't care either way.

268
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,080
The rest of Giorgio's phone data.

269
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Is there a minibar in this dump?

270
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,760
There is.

271
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,200
I took the liberty of taking a look,
if you don't mind.

272
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,040
Does the former Proto NATO base
ring a bell?

273
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,440
No. Why?

274
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,160
Your son went there every day,
from 2:30 to 8:30 p.m.

275
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,280
But he didn't go on the day he died.

276
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,760
He went to Lago Patria, the new base.

277
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,640
Why would he go to Proto if it's closed?

278
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,280
The area was given to the city.

279
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,800
As far as I know, they're dismantling it.

280
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,600
If you know more,
and I know you know more, brunette,

281
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,560
don't bullshit me and say it.

282
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,240
Storage, personnel in hazmat suits
and masks.

283
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,680
That's what I saw.

284
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,960
And Giorgio wasn't emptying storage rooms.
He had a chemistry degree.

285
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,720
Yeah, but now you have to sit tight
because the army is involved.

286
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,320
Being cautious used to piss you off.

287
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,720
It still does.
It's not being cautious. It's tactics.

288
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,840
But what if Giorgio got hold of something
he shouldn't have.

289
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,440
Don't look for conspiracies,
hoping he was like you.

290
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,920
Could be collateral damage.

291
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,360
Maybe he couldn't handle something
he found out and killed himself.

292
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,800
Let me look into it.

293
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,160
This beer is crap.

294
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,320
Bye.

295
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,800
I always like having pizza with you.

296
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,200
I always like having pizza with you.

297
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,680
As for the kid you're staring down at,
yes, sometimes I use him as a driver.

298
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,720
But mind your fucking business, okay?

299
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,640
Who is it?

300
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,200
I need to talk to Viola.

301
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,640
Viola isn't feeling well, and she has
no intention of talking to you.

302
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,080
I'll wait. Tell her it's important.

303
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,200
His work stuff and diary are in here.

304
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,440
I found nothing weird.
Take a look, if you want.

305
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,680
How long were you two together?

306
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,960
A couple of years.

307
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,040
How did you meet?

308
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,680
What do you want from me? Huh?

309
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,880
I shouldn't even talk to you
out of respect for Giorgio.

310
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,040
You're right.

311
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,520
I have no right.

312
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,960
Not even to feel upset seeing
that his name disappeared from the buzzer.

313
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,400
What are you talking about?

314
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,320
Where did you come from? Stay.

315
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,480
Boris!

316
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Boris.

317
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,520
Good evening.

318
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,320
Look who you found.

319
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,840
-How are you?
-Fine, thanks.

320
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,960
Listen, I would've called you tonight,
but since I ran into you…

321
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,280
Yeah, by chance.

322
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,680
This is where you take your dog to pee.

323
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,840
I live nearby.

324
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,240
I always walk the dog here,
only he never stays still.

325
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,320
He runs away
before I can put a leash on him, okay?

326
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,040
Anyway, I wanted to let you know
that we questioned Terzani again.

327
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,240
From how he describes the dynamics,

328
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,760
it looks like

329
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,160
your partner committed suicide.

330
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,040
I'm sorry.

331
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,200
Is that why you were asking
so many questions?

332
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,040
To know if he had a reason
to kill himself?

333
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,840
Maybe you thought
abandoning him messed him up?

334
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,000
It's bullshit. Giorgio was fine.

335
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,880
As he left, he asked me
to pick a movie to watch together.

336
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,960
You think someone would say that
and then jump in front of a passing car?

337
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,000
If that's what happened,

338
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,280
get ready to fight the insurance guys.

339
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,360
What insurance?

340
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,480
Your partner… took out
a life insurance policy.

341
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
For you. You and the baby.

342
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,960
I knew nothing about that.

343
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,080
I'm tired.

344
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,880
You can keep that.

345
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,200
If it's your son's,
you have to hand it over.

346
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,640
Hey!

347
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,480
-That's not going to happen.
-Excuse me?

348
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,800
You're not even on duty.

349
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,920
Summon me officially, if you want.

350
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,120
Have a nice walk.

351
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,360
LAGO PATRIA MILITARY BASE

352
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,800
Yeah?

353
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,520
From 7:00 to 10:00 a.m.
Sure, we can bring it to your room.

354
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,200
There's a little extra fee.

355
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,440
All right. Fine, good night.

356
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,400
Did you see this, Sarè?
We have a guy with balls now.

357
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,400
-And who might that be?
-Tarallo.

358
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,960
No, I don't like him.

359
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,800
You too, going on about
how he's a fascist.

360
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,040
There are no fascists anymore.
He's good for us. The fascists…

361
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,400
We'll see about that.

362
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,000
TARALLO'S COMEBACK
THE CANDIDATE LEADS IN THE NEW POLLS

363
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,320
You'll smoke later.

364
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,720
Hey.

365
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,640
Hey.

366
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,840
Are you really making coffee?

367
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,600
Can't I surprise you for once?

368
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,760
-Isn't it late?
-Very. I wanted to serve it in bed.

369
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,200
I should have picked Tarallo over you.

370
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,000
That's what I'm paying you for.

371
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,640
-Yeah.
-What are you doing for him today?

372
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,280
I have to go through the speech

373
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,480
for his meeting
with the Islamic community.

374
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,800
He asked me to add
that he worked in Lebanon for ten years,

375
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,960
that he's like a brother to them,

376
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,120
but that security is a universal asset,
for Christians and Muslims both.

377
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,960
So that he can end his speech
with the usual,

378
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,360
"More security for all…"

379
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,920
"More freedom for all."

380
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,400
That's it?

381
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,680
Yeah, and the usual six-hour meetings
full of pointless talk.

382
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,920
Yeah, but sometimes what you need is
in all that talk.

383
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,320
You just have to find it.

384
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,120
In the years of the strikes,

385
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,120
reports from assets like you were crucial,
you know?

386
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,040
Is that right?

387
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,040
Let me get this straight.

388
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,840
You brought these assets home
back then too?

389
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,800
Obviously.

390
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,120
Except I'd kill them afterwards.

391
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,360
Listen…

392
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,920
Why are you so interested in Tarallo?
I mean…

393
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,400
No. If you start asking questions,
I'll have to kill you right away.

394
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,520
No! But… I mean, if you think
there's more than what you see…

395
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,480
Tell me.

396
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,360
I'll work better if I know.

397
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,240
I don't think anything.
I'm on Tarallo like I'm on the others.

398
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,560
You're the one
who has to keep his eyes open.

399
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,320
You got that?

400
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,840
Come on, go. Hurry up.

401
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,760
-Morning. Your ID, please.
-Morning. Yes.

402
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,880
-You may go.
-Thanks.

403
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Morning.

404
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,040
Morning. The service providers
need to use the back entrance.

405
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,600
-Oh.
-Yeah.

406
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,760
I didn't know. It's my first time here.
I'm filling in for Pinelli.

407
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,400
-Oh, the substitute. They notified us.
-Yeah.

408
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,680
-Is your colleague sick?
-No, he's fine.

409
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,840
He had to take a trainee
to the regional offices.

410
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,200
-I see.
-We train too, in our own small way.

411
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,200
Listen, since you're so kind,

412
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,760
my boss said that
a Colonel Prati, maybe…

413
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,160
-Silvia Prati, sure.
-Silvia Prati, yes.

414
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,320
She complained about the vending machine.

415
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,280
-I wouldn't know where to find her.
-Yes. Okay, let me check the floor.

416
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
Yes.

417
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,560
First floor.

418
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,480
Thank you.

419
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,200
ELECTRICAL PANELS
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

420
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,560
ITALIAN AIR FORCE

421
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,000
Morning, Colonel Prati.

422
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,480
It's solved. It was a false alarm.

423
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,360
-Morning, ma'am.
-Excuse me. What are you doing here?

424
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,120
I'm sorry. I'm a cleaner.

425
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,840
I remembered that yesterday

426
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,120
I lost my necklace while cleaning here.
In fact, I found it.

427
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,520
-I'll leave right away.
-No, wait.

428
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,440
What was your name again?

429
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,360
I didn't say my name. Why?

430
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,080
I feel like I know you. Have we met?

431
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,720
Well, maybe… I don't know.
Because I work here, maybe.

432
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,840
But it's not likely.
My face is so generic. Bye.

433
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,480
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Stop. Don't turn around.

434
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,480
Found her.

435
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,240
You're spying on me now?

436
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,280
No, but I know you.
What did you steal in there?

437
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,760
What did I steal?

438
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,680
Nothing.

439
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,360
I broke into the office of a colonel
involved in Proto's dismantling.

440
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,360
And I found jack shit. Who's that guy?

441
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,840
Someone who owes me lots of favors
and doesn't ask questions.

442
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,320
You must've told him something
to get me caught.

443
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,320
I told him that if he saw a loony
dressed like a bum wandering around,

444
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,360
he should tell me.

445
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,360
And here we are.

446
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,800
One, I'm not dressed like a bum.
And two, I didn't sneak in, I walked in.

447
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,160
Well done. Who helped you?

448
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,720
Someone who owes me favors
and doesn't ask questions.

449
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,920
Listen, brunette, fuck you.

450
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,720
I asked you to give me time.

451
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,840
But you just did what you wanted.
You made a big mess.

452
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,760
Get in.

453
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,320
Listen.

454
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,960
There are two sets of keys
with Giorgio's personal effects.

455
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,440
I need the one with the plastic tag
and two numbers on it.

456
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,680
One and 15.

457
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,080
It'll be worse
if I get them on my own, right?

458
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,320
All right.

459
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,160
Tomorrow, 1:00 p.m., in front of
the usual bookshop in Port'Alba.

460
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,160
Okay?

461
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,400
But this is the last favor
I'm doing for you.

462
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,880
They're all over me. You get that?

463
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,280
Any excuse is good to shut down the unit.
Lembo's doing what he can to defend us.

464
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,360
Lembo is a puppet.

465
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,080
What the fuck do you know?

466
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,000
About what we've all become?

467
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,480
About what Lembo's become?
What do you know?

468
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,280
Look. This can't happen.

469
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,240
Tamburi.

470
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,000
-The big shots are paying us a visit.
-Who's that?

471
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,360
Lembo.

472
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,920
I'll go say hello. After all,
we have him to thank for getting paid.

473
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,400
Hey. Translate for me.

474
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,320
"Not bad,
considering what all this stuff cost us."

475
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,640
"Come, I'll introduce the new recruits."

476
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,080
Fuck. I should've gone to the hairdresser.

477
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,560
"Wait. Tell me
which one you're fucking first."

478
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,000
Mr. Lembo, Pandolfi, and Morozzi.

479
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,880
It's a pleasure.

480
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,040
Ma'am, you dropped that.

481
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,600
Thanks.

482
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,800
NAPOLI CHAMPION OF ITALY 2022/2023
PIAZZA ORIENTALE THANKS YOU

483
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,320
Fuck!

484
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,520
No!

485
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,400
-No! What the fuck do you want from me?
-Don't worry.

486
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,960
Colonel Silvia Prati.

487
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,600
I'm Giorgio's mother.

488
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,800
That's where I'd seen those eyes.

489
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,360
"SG." A present from Giorgio, right?

490
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,480
Were you having an affair?

491
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,560
It was one of those encounters
where there's no going back.

492
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,040
We met on the job three years ago.

493
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,520
Then, one year later,
I found out I was sick.

494
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,440
And I left him without an explanation.

495
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,280
I don't know how,

496
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,480
but he found out about my illness
and came to see me the other day.

497
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,040
He said he'd rented this place
and that he'd wait for me here.

498
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,320
I let him wait.

499
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,480
But why?

500
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,680
I knew he was about to have a kid.

501
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,280
And it's not right to ask a young man

502
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,480
to be with a woman
who doesn't even know if she'll make it.

503
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,520
Ludovico says it's this love
that's killing me.

504
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,360
But it's because I didn't want to live it.

505
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,720
Ludovico?

506
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,320
My oncologist.

507
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,200
Ludovico Terzani.

508
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,040
After I left Giorgio,
I don't even know why…

509
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,760
Maybe to try and forget him,
but we had a brief relationship.

510
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,760
He's married, but that's not the point.
I just didn't love him.

511
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,920
ONCOLOGICAL HOSPITAL

512
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,840
He decided to stay with me anyway.

513
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:00,080
As a patient, I feel protected,
but… at times, it's suffocating.

514
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,320
I'm a doctor.
I should save lives. And yet…

515
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,600
We were both right. As always.

516
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,280
There's no sinister plot
behind Giorgio's death.

517
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,400
We're not bound together by mystery.

518
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,480
That's why I can't give you the keys.
I tossed them.

519
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,560
I don't want Viola to get them
with Giorgio's personal effects.

520
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,200
-She can't think he was cheating on her.
-Why? Was he cheating on her?

521
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,400
It's way more complicated than that.

522
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,480
Jealousy doesn't give a fuck
about details.

523
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,120
