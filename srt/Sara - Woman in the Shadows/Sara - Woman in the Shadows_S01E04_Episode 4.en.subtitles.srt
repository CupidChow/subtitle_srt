00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,560
BASED ON MAURIZIO DE GIOVANNI'S NOVELS

2
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,840
-Did you do the full route?
-Down to the last meter.

3
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,800
-What are you doing here?
-You never got back to me.

4
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,200
The Nigerian took the blame.
That's all there is to know.

5
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,240
What about Tarallo?

6
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm going to check the square
for the final speech.

7
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,400
Is there a problem?

8
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,240
No. But you know,
with what happened to Sergio…

9
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,520
there'll be a lot of people.

10
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,360
I trust you. Let me know.

11
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,440
Thank you.

12
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Hug Rachele for me, Anzovino.

13
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,560
SARA - WOMAN IN THE SHADOWS

14
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,280
Oh. No apparition
of the Virgin Mary today, Morozzi?

15
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,320
Maybe you're just learning how to look.

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,600
Or maybe, if I wait leaning on the gate,
you're done for.

17
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,400
Oh, so it's a contest.
Let's go. Let's see if I was right.

18
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
If we were right, Morozzi.

19
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,960
It is a contest.

20
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,480
Let's see who shows up
at the appointment with Sergio.

21
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,320
This is a combo ticket.

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,240
Yes, ma'am. In the brochure

23
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,560
there are all the artworks
that you can find upstairs.

24
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,520
Can you explain
what a 30-year-old member of your staff

25
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,040
was doing walking around tomato fields
at night…

26
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,000
FOUND HIM. HALL 4

27
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,600
Who did you see?

28
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,080
A journalist.
He was at Tarallo's press conference.

29
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Oh, okay.

30
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,880
You go that way.

31
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,960
Wait!

32
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,720
Stop. Stop!

33
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,840
Easy.

34
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,600
What do you want from me?

35
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,840
We're Sergio's friends.
You're not in danger.

36
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,720
-Why are you armed then?
-Lower those hands. Just trust us.

37
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,080
I'm geotagged.

38
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,000
If I'm not back in two hours,
they'll raise the alarm.

39
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,320
You'll be back sooner
if you tell us what you know.

40
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,760
If you're here, you're still interested
in what you did with Sergio.

41
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,920
Why did you two meet?

42
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,600
Why should I tell you?

43
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,480
If one of you had been Sergio's friend,
he'd still be alive.

44
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,360
I know you're behind this.

45
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,600
Who's he talking about?

46
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,480
He thinks we're Secret Service,
but we're not.

47
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
We're here because we need you.

48
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,920
How did you figure out we were in contact?
Sergio can't have told you.

49
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,280
We were trying to save him
and figured it out.

50
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,560
We traced his moves backwards.

51
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,400
-But we were too late.
-Listen.

52
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,640
If we wanted to kill you or kidnap you,
we would've done it already.

53
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,560
Clear?

54
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,720
If you talk to us,
you'll even earn our protection.

55
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,600
Real protection.

56
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,640
Sergio and I were friends.

57
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,080
I couldn't believe he was at Tarallo's.
He wasn't like that.

58
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,280
Yeah, we know that.

59
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,880
But that's not what
put him in danger, is it?

60
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,840
No.

61
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,840
I mean, yes and no.

62
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,600
I'd discovered some things,
and he was helping me prove them.

63
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,760
What things?

64
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,840
-Do you know how Tarallo got rich?
-No, let's hear it.

65
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,720
Bribes.

66
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,080
He sells himself as exemplary now,

67
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,800
but as city councilor,
nothing moved until he got his percentage.

68
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,080
Okay.

69
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,520
Can I go now?

70
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,160
I knew we'd manage
to get something out of him.

71
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,640
I have a gift for making people talk.

72
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,400
So when he hesitated twice
before answering,

73
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,240
he was looking for the right words?

74
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,160
He was scared, unsure. It's normal.

75
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,160
If you have spare time
and feel like doing some research,

76
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,800
you'll find articles titled

77
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,920
"Bribes and Public Administration"
by Edoardo Belliti.

78
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,480
-Meaning?
-He gave us something he knows well.

79
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,920
And he can keep providing details.

80
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,440
Could be.

81
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,240
-You're not always right, you know?
-You don't die for something like that.

82
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,880
Sergio shouldn't have died like that.

83
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
The beating and the kidnapping
were intended to make him talk.

84
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,040
-So we're at a dead end again?
-We're halfway there.

85
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,760
When will we get to the end?

86
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,640
We'll never earn that journalist's trust,

87
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
but we have to focus on him.

88
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,120
Let's keep an eye on him,
see where it leads.

89
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,400
-Fine. Let's keep an eye on him.
-Exactly.

90
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,520
And since I'm a gentleman,
you take the afternoon.

91
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,080
I'll take the night, mm?

92
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
Since you're a gentleman,

93
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,080
you take the night and afternoon,
because I gotta go eat a pizza now.

94
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,800
A pizza?

95
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,400
Seriously? Or is that
one of your code words, Morozzi?

96
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,840
Keep me posted, okay?

97
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,440
Hey, brunette.

98
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,000
All dressed up as usual, huh?

99
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,760
What do you need to tell me?

100
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,680
Do you know a journalist
named Edoardo Belliti?

101
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,000
I've read some of his articles.
Nothing more.

102
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,920
Sergio knew him well.

103
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,440
They were probably
investigating Tarallo together.

104
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,000
That's not possible.

105
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,640
He would have told me.

106
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,880
I actually think he died
so he wouldn't have to.

107
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,320
To avoid talking about it.

108
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,720
Not even with me.

109
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,720
How do you know that's why he died?

110
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,040
Because of the secret way
they kept in contact.

111
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,800
How did they contact each other?

112
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,960
Sergio would write a fake post
looking for a house near a museum.

113
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,840
The next day they'd meet there.

114
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,440
Is there a link between Tarallo
and the unit, apart from monitoring?

115
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,840
No, you know that.
We monitor him like everyone else.

116
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,800
When I stopped Belliti,
he alluded to the Secret Service.

117
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,440
He was scared. Maybe Sergio told him
what he was doing for you.

118
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,280
-Journalists are full of shit…
-Stop it, Teresa!

119
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,080
I know it hurts
that your boyfriend lied to you.

120
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,600
But this case is getting too dangerous
to waste more time.

121
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
Do you have more on Tarallo?

122
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,000
No, goddamn it! Or I'd tell you.

123
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,760
Then find out what's behind Tarallo.

124
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,800
I'll try to understand
where this journalist is going.

125
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,440
I almost lost the use of my legs too
standing here waiting for you.

126
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,440
Can I come up?

127
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,720
Are Massimiliano's lead soldier models
on the table?

128
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,040
Yes.

129
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,120
But I don't think
that's why you're here, right?

130
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,280
And it's not even my birthday today.
Why this package?

131
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,320
I'm not here for you.

132
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm here for me.

133
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
What can I do for you?

134
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,360
Get rid of my guilt.

135
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,560
Towards Massimiliano.

136
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,800
What's he got to do with it?

137
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,400
Right before he died,
he asked me to help him

138
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,360
to prepare something for you.

139
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,320
I was supposed to give it to you
after he died.

140
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,320
And why didn't you?

141
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,120
I was jealous.

142
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,840
I waited years for the right moment
to tell him how I felt about him.

143
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,840
Then you showed up,

144
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,520
and all hopes died.

145
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,120
Make good use of what I brought you.

146
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,960
I'll walk you.

147
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,000
There's no need.

148
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,440
My love,

149
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,360
if you're hearing these words,
it means I'm gone.

150
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,920
Or that Catapano's playing
a bad joke on you.

151
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,640
He really couldn't stand you, you know?

152
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,520
We spent our whole life
thinking about other stuff. The job, us.

153
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,080
Now that--

154
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,080
Hey.

155
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,200
Hi.

156
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,760
How do you feel, honey? Huh?

157
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,440
The medicine will take effect soon.

158
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,280
Okay? Think about something else.

159
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,560
Think about us.

160
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,800
Think about the first time we met.

161
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,520
Remember the first time we met?

162
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,720
Such fools…

163
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,440
THE END IS JUST A BEGINNING
YOUR MASSIMILIANO

164
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,240
…first ball played by Napoli.

165
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,200
Zieliński tunnels.
Anguissa sends it away. Di Lorenzo.

166
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,800
Genoa tries to attack.
Guðmundsson steals the ball.

167
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,720
He attacks the space,
Retegui asks for the ball.

168
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,280
Comes in late. Blatantly a foul.

169
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,280
It's a free kick.
The first yellow card of the match.

170
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,640
Mário Rui, ball near the goal.
Martínez on the ball.

171
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,240
Passes it to Rui.

172
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,920
Martínez comes forward,
closes in on Strootman.

173
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
-Hi.
-Hi.

174
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,680
-Where is she?
-Where do you think? Glued to the TV.

175
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,320
-Ball for Martínez again.
-Did she behave?

176
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,880
Yes, she did.

177
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,360
I was feeling nostalgic
and didn't want to eat them alone.

178
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,800
What are they?

179
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,800
Open it.

180
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,880
No! Struffoli are my favorite dessert!

181
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,960
I shouldn't… They're too yummy.

182
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,560
Why nostalgic?

183
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,920
Massimiliano had no vices,
but he went crazy over these.

184
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,640
He was convinced that at Sanità
they were better than anywhere else.

185
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,840
So I went there and bought some.

186
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,160
Do you miss him?

187
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,800
A lot.

188
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,120
So it doesn't go away?

189
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,200
It transforms.

190
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,000
But it takes time.

191
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,960
I don't want to grow old in sadness.

192
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
I don't want to forget Giorgio,

193
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,480
but I don't want to spend
the rest of my life missing him.

194
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,040
Am I a bad person?

195
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,200
No. The opposite.

196
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,920
I'd like to hug you right now,
but I don't know if I can.

197
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,720
I don't know if I want to.

198
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,160
Ely?

199
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,600
Sweetie?

200
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,440
Østigård…

201
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,520
Who did your homework? You or him?

202
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,640
Hold on, Mom. I'm watching the game.

203
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,240
-Ball for Politano on the fly. Goal!
-Goal! He scored!

204
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,600
Goal!

205
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Goal!

206
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,800
Goal! Go, Napoli!

207
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,880
Hooray!

208
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
See how awesome we are?

209
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,000
Goal!

210
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,560
-Who gave this to you, honey?
-Edo did.

211
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,640
Tell me. What would Giorgio have done now?

212
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,000
He would've jumped off the couch

213
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,160
and started hopping around like an idiot.

214
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,840
Would you like a photo of him?

215
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,320
From the ones I took.

216
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,000
He wouldn't let anybody but me
take his picture.

217
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,280
Sure, I'd like one. Yeah.

218
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,720
-If you come tomorrow, I'll bring you one.
-Okay.

219
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,240
Zerbin shoots…

220
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,720
Header by De Winter.

221
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,960
Look.

222
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,160
He waited, the other guy arrived…

223
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,600
They're not meeting by chance, Morò.

224
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,720
Look. He asks for money.
The guy gives it to him.

225
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,080
I can see that.
No need for the commentary.

226
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,200
All right. This is big, really big!

227
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,120
He's blackmailing him
or he's an informant.

228
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,760
Anyway, I already notified Musella.
He got his plate number.

229
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,120
Huh?

230
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
I'm sorry.

231
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,480
-About what?
-About always saying you're wrong.

232
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,200
You're not sorry.
Tell me, what did I get wrong?

233
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,960
This video might be useful
for the Financial Police, but not to us.

234
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,960
Unless you need to fix a moped
and pay cash in hand.

235
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,880
Meaning?

236
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,880
His hand movement gave it away.
How he picks grease from his nails.

237
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,560
Anyway, what they said
is that Edoardo's carburetor is fixed.

238
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,760
It'll last ten years
if he takes care of it.

239
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,480
You got all that
just by watching the video?

240
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,240
So, if it's not their posture,
it's their lips.

241
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,600
If it's not their lips,
it's the third eye.

242
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,160
If it's not the third eye,
it's the soul of your ancestors!

243
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,040
I'll call Musella again.

244
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,320
What am I doing here
if I never get anything right?

245
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,600
You keep me company.

246
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,160
Go home. I'll stay here tonight.

247
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,720
A coffee.

248
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,880
GET HIM IDENTIFIED

249
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,680
What's new?

250
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,880
Another hit, just like the others.

251
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,960
-Where?
-At the old Treasury building.

252
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,240
Galleria Principe di Napoli. At 2:45 p.m.

253
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,520
Something will definitely go down.

254
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Boris!

255
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,160
Goddamn!

256
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,840
Hello?

257
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,960
Can I talk or are you dying?

258
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,520
If you talk fast

259
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,160
and stop making fun of me,
I might hear something before I die.

260
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,480
By the way, Morò, I sent Musella…

261
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,800
We'll handle that later.
Now memorize this.

262
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,560
Galleria Principe di Napoli. At 2:45 p.m.

263
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,840
-Edoardo will be there.
-Yeah, I memorized it. All right.

264
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,280
Boris, the last gift from that huge bitch.

265
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,880
Hi, Lembo.

266
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,600
You come here more and more often
for someone so marginal.

267
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,600
"Marginal?"

268
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,120
You always send us interesting findings.

269
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,920
Even if you keep your mouth shut
about your friend.

270
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,960
You know what I know.

271
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,040
-Why did you ask to meet?
-I didn't want to meet at the unit.

272
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,040
You wanted to talk about Sara?

273
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,600
No.

274
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,880
It's not easy for me to say
what I have to say.

275
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,240
You never had problems with that.

276
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,000
Maybe because I never
had to share… a defeat.

277
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,160
Not with you now,
or before with Massimiliano.

278
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,240
I lost the battle, blonde.

279
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,760
They're shutting down the unit.

280
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,360
Did I bother someone at the top?

281
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,960
No.

282
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,040
"Spending review," they said.

283
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,760
They're using the cuts as an excuse
to change the world as we know it.

284
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,840
I only know part of it,
and I think it works.

285
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,640
I think so too.

286
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,880
I did what I could, believe me.
There's nothing else I could do.

287
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,520
So what happens now?
How much time do we have?

288
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Well, an operation like this
doesn't happen overnight.

289
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,320
They'll send someone
to go through the files

290
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,200
and make all necessary checks,
then we'll know the timeline.

291
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,040
Goodbye, blonde.

292
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,720
-Oh my God! My purse!
-Police! Freeze!

293
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,960
Police! Freeze!

294
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,760
Freeze or I'll shoot! Freeze!

295
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,520
Freeze!

296
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,880
So? What are you doing?

297
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,320
Musella, where are you?

298
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,040
Come to
Galleria Principe di Napoli, quick.

299
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,120
See the nice present I got for you?

300
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,840
Now you know what I need you for.
Best sidekick ever.

301
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,560
I was the only one who ran.

302
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,120
There's nothing to see here. Thank you.

303
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,760
-Let's go.
-Come on!

304
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,200
Why did you go after that lady?

305
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,760
Do you have a badge?

306
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,360
A badge? I'll break your head with it!
Right now, with all the checks going on.

307
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,560
What do you care?

308
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,760
He'll talk to your colleagues.

309
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,080
-Here I am, Inspector.
-I'll show you what I care.

310
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,040
-What'd he do?
-Take him to the station.

311
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,960
This one? Move! Take him away.
I'll be right there. Quick.

312
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,960
Congrats.
You'll see the headlines tomorrow.

313
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,480
-That's it. I'll say it was thanks to you.
-You don't get it.

314
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,160
Mind your own fucking business, Musè.
Take the purse too. Go.

315
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,680
Edoardo!

316
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,680
Edoardo!

317
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,400
Let's see if he still talks about
bribes and percentages.

318
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,640
I was there because
I needed to be sure about something.

319
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,080
Sure about what?

320
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,200
I'm writing a piece that comes out
right before the elections.

321
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,200
It's a bomb. But I can't afford mistakes.

322
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,480
What's it about?

323
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,800
Someone organizes crimes
committed by illegal immigrants.

324
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,160
Then Tarallo feeds on it,
honing in on fear.

325
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,880
And people believe him.

326
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,240
Even I've got brains, Morò.

327
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,200
I wasn't buying the mess
those two made earlier.

328
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,560
I knew it was going to happen.
It was no occasional robbery.

329
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,760
What was Sergio's role?

330
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,600
He was helping me.
We had just reconnected.

331
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,880
We lost touch after university.

332
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,720
When I met him,
he was uncomfortable on Tarallo's staff.

333
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,160
We talked a lot and…

334
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,520
he started passing me information.

335
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,600
To clear his conscience, he said.

336
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,200
If that's why they killed him,
you can't expose yourself.

337
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,040
But I want to. I've been working
for months on this piece.

338
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,440
Do you have a way to leave the city?

339
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,720
I don't intend to.

340
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,800
It's just a few days.

341
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,600
I'll publish everything,
then I can disappear.

342
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,200
Waiting for more tip-offs?

343
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,440
-No. But I can't rule it out.
-Okay, so…

344
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,720
If that happens, call this number.
It's always on, Edoardo.

345
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,720
-Got it? Call this number, not any other.
-All right.

346
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,960
Please.

347
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,280
And send me yours now.

348
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,680
I have to get back to the newsroom now.

349
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,680
At this point, I think it's clear

350
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,600
that the Nigerian who took the blame
for the deaths of Sergio and Gaspare Russo

351
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,760
was paid to throw more mud
on illegal immigrants, right?

352
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Yeah, sure.

353
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,680
What's the matter, Morò?

354
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,720
You're not going to tell me
he was lying this time too?

355
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,440
He was sincere, I'm sure.

356
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,240
Posture, his eyes, all that stuff?

357
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,880
Memories flooding back.

358
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,080
What kind?

359
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,880
Of a world and people
behind a certain kind of politics.

360
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,640
Meaning?

361
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,960
Even if we have no proof
of criminal activity right now,

362
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,560
we can't let our guard down. Look here.

363
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,600
The guys you're tailing arrived in Berlin.

364
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,680
They're creating ties
with German neo-Nazis.

365
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,080
We need to find out
what they're planning and their roles.

366
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,320
Are we clear?

367
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,200
It was smart of you
to start monitoring Tarallo.

368
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,160
I didn't do anything.
I just followed procedure.

369
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,240
We have a result now.

370
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,760
For now, the only result I see
is a dead man.

371
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,160
Sergio was naive.

372
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,560
Or he was betrayed.

373
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,400
He was mature enough
to make his own choices.

374
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,120
Like not telling me
about the journalist's scoop, for example.

375
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,440
-Exactly.
-We have to start over from there.

376
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,440
But we can't make the same mistakes.

377
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,840
Going past a certain point, as you know,

378
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,920
means getting close
to high-ranking politics.

379
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Are you up to that?

380
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,800
If the unit has to sing its swan song,
I want everyone to hear.

381
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,520
Loud and clear.

382
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,760
Now I recognize you.

383
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,560
First we need to plant some bugs
in Tarallo's car,

384
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,000
in all the places
Sergio hasn't already put them.

385
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,680
We'll do as I say.

386
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,400
Let's go, Boris.
Let's see who it is. Come on.

387
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,480
Fuck you.

388
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,840
Yes, just a second.

389
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,480
-Hey! Who is it?
-Pardo? Am I disturbing?

390
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,960
Hey, Morozzi.

391
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,320
Um…

392
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,120
It's not like a gentleman to open the door
like that, but style is not his forte.

393
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
What are you doing?

394
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,440
Or intuition. Okay.

395
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,680
-We're setting up our new base. Come in.
-Hi.

396
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
-Morning.
-Put that here, Anna Maria.

397
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,840
What new base?

398
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,160
We needed a safe place for wiretapping.
This looks perfect. Come on.

399
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,120
-At my house? Morozzi! Excuse me?
-Yeah?

400
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,120
Forgive me, honey,
but that's a glass table. Be careful…

401
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Yeah. Thanks.

402
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,080
Anyway, I think you should
put some pants on.

403
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,320
What if I was with someone just now?

404
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,240
Were you?

405
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,560
Should I hook everything up?

406
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,760
-Yes, go ahead, get started.
-Okay.

407
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,800
-The door. Thanks.
-Sure.

408
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,320
Make yourselves at home.

409
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,440
Thank you.

410
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,160
You come out now?

411
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,120
Something's come up.

412
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,800
Let's hear it.

413
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,960
Same amount?

414
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,920
Same amount.

415
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,080
What's it about?

416
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,040
A meeting in Pianura.

417
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,880
Apparently, they're planning a new hit.

418
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,960
So soon? Right after the last one?

419
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,280
This one's bigger.

420
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
When is it?

421
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,800
Tonight. Be ready. Prepare the money.

422
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,640
As soon as I know time and place,
I'll contact you.

423
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,000
Thanks.

424
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,640
-Slim, are you done? All good?
-Yeah.

425
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,560
You were never here, okay?

426
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,520
-Of course, ma'am.
-Good.

427
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,800
-Bye.
-Bye, Teresa.

428
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,960
How long will the invasion last?

429
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,760
At least until the elections.
Then we'll see.

430
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,280
Oh. And that should make me happy?

431
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,640
No, but you shouldn't ask
stupid questions.

432
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,200
Do you know the duration
of an investigation at the start?

433
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,040
-We're not at the start.
-We're not that far into it either.

434
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,760
-Any news?
-Yeah.

435
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,200
Tarallo is having dinner
at 9:00 in Via Posillipo.

436
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,120
Oh, good. We need to plant a bug there.

437
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,640
Do you know how to place a bug?

438
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,760
Pardo, I'll see you out front
20 minutes early.

439
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,480
I can't stay.

440
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
Um…

441
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,120
I kept my promise.

442
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,040
He was really angry when I took it.

443
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,560
Then he looked at the camera and smiled.

444
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,760
Nice, isn't it?

445
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,720
Really nice.

446
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,880
Just think…

447
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,400
I had this crazy idea.

448
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,600
In Giorgio's laptop bag I found tickets
to my favorite singer's concert tonight.

449
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,760
I guess he wanted to surprise me.

450
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,160
What do you have to do?

451
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,680
Monitor someone.

452
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,360
-Take me with you.
-How am I supposed to do that?

453
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,560
Because I'm pregnant?

454
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,120
That's a good enough reason, right?

455
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,080
What's more innocent and unsuspicious
than a pregnant woman?

456
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,920
Hi, Pardo.

457
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,200
-Don't say a word.
-What's she doing here? It's dangerous.

458
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,920
-Cut it out. I made the decision.
-On what basis?

459
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,840
On the same basis I chose you.

460
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,760
-Listen--
-Cut it out!

461
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,720
If we do our job, it'll be okay.

462
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,160
So?

463
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,120
Nothing. She needed some air,
and I took her out for a walk.

464
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,160
Let me get this straight.
We're a team from now on?

465
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,040
Yeah. Don't you like that?

466
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,360
Get in the car.

467
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,240
Morozzi.

468
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,040
You wanted to get back to the mobile unit?

469
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,280
They work in teams, don't they?

470
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,880
VOTE BONELLI

471
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,760
VOTE BONELLI

472
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,640
Thanks.

473
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,440
What I was saying is it's the same old
conflict between thestate and the regions.

474
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,640
If only our hands weren't so tied…

475
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,120
Listen, Tarallo, where we operate
we don't have this problem

476
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,600
Miss? Miss, is everything okay?

477
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,240
Help me sit over there, please.

478
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,880
Help me sit there. Take me there.

479
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,400
-Can you get me water at the restaurant?
-I have some in my car.

480
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,360
Here you go.

481
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,840
-Should I take you to the hospital?
-No. I'll end up giving birth in the car.

482
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,000
I'll call an ambulance.

483
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,840
No, I'm having a home birth.
I won't give up because he's in a rush.

484
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,160
Fine, but I can't stay here all night.

485
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,640
You're right.
Will you just help me breathe?

486
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
-Hold my back, please.
-What…

487
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,440
Hold my back. I'll put my legs up here.
Hold tight. Let's breathe together…

488
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,040
An opening like that would jump start

489
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,920
the energy sector in a second.

490
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,160
As it was for construction.

491
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,520
Sure, but that's not all.

492
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,000
We took the liberty
of doing a poll among your electors.

493
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,840
Only a small number
are still in favor of nuclear energy.

494
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,960
Trust me, renewable energies
are the right investment for you too.

495
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
I know.

496
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,600
Thing is, I made some promises.

497
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,640
When did you make them? Before the war?

498
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Then the war came, and the cold.

499
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
And everything blew up in our face.

500
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,080
Everyone will get used to it without…

501
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,320
worrying at all about what you said
some time ago.

502
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,720
The higher the stakes,
the greater the gratitude you receive.

503
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,600
Right?

504
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,320
Cheers.

505
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,560
No! Please, I'll tell you what,
let's do the pain positions.

506
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,480
Come with me, stand here.
Just stay with me.

507
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,680
Stay with me, do what I say
and then we'll see.

508
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,480
-Down. Lower.
-Lower?

509
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,760
Lower.

510
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,680
Lower than this, miss?

511
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,440
-Let's do the open vowel.
-The open vowel?

512
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,160
Keep going.

513
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,120
-Relax.
-I'm relaxed, miss.

514
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,600
Relax with me.

515
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,120
Yes, like that. Now the open U.

516
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
More air.

517
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,320
Fuck.

518
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,400
-Pasquale, what's going on?
-She's not feeling well.

519
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,600
Let's get her up.

520
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,480
Here. Do you want to sit down?

521
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,360
-Sit here.
-No, thanks, I'm feeling much better.

522
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,480
Thanks.

523
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,840
Oh God.

524
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,360
INSPECTOR DAVIDE PARDO

525
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,560
Pianura, in an hour. In Via Pascetta.

526
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,080
I know where it is.
Everything's in the usual place.

527
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,800
I didn't know
I was bringing along a genius.

528
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,360
At least the prenatal course paid off.

529
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,360
You could've signaled that you were done.

530
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,960
Why? I was having fun for once.

531
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,280
-Oh God.
-Yeah, right.

532
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,760
Oh, God, no.

533
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,840
Oh God!

534
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,640
-You're serious now?
-Oh God. Yeah.

535
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,480
-This is for real?
-Yes.

536
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,720
What are you feeling?

537
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,920
What are you feeling?

538
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,640
That'll teach you.

539
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,720
Did you plant the bug properly?

540
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,720
-Are you serious right now?
-Okay, I trust you.

541
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,160
Yeah, make the effort. Good night!

542
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,520
Anyway, it's not that late, right?

543
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,400
I don't want to go home.

544
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,280
Show me those tickets.

545
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,120
"Dada' live."

546
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,160
Your call is being forwarded to a voice--

547
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,720
Protection, my ass.

548
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,760
Asshole!

549
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,160
Where are you going, you shit?
Where are you going?

550
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,440
Hey, stop! Where are you going?

551
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,920
Piece of shit!

552
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,920
