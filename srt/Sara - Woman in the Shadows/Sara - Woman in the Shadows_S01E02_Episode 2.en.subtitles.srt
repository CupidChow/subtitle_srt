BASED ON MAURIZIO DE GIOVANNI'S NOVELS

2
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,160
I know I cost you,

3
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,120
and that choosing me keeps costing you.

4
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,560
And there's nothing wrong
if sometimes you find yourself wondering

5
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,080
if it was worth it.

00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,600
CONVERSATION WITH S. LAVORI

9
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,040
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

10
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,400
WHERE ARE YOU

11
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,000
Hi.

12
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
Hi.

13
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,440
You're here already?

14
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,280
Couldn't sleep.

15
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,720
Well, just wait for a meeting to start.

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
It'll put you right to sleep.

17
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
-How did it go yesterday afternoon?
-Same old bullshit.

18
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,720
-Was our source at Tarallo's?
-No.

19
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,400
I don't think I saw him yesterday.

20
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
You think you did see him or you didn't?

21
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,520
No, I didn't see him.

22
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,320
Go upstairs.

23
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,240
So?

24
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Did you get any smarter last night?

25
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
Wanna tell us who you work for?

26
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,240
Are you gonna talk?

27
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,000
I told you, I work for Tarallo.

28
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,160
He asked who you really work for.
Got it, asshole?

29
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,520
It's true. I work for Tarallo.
Check. Go on.

30
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Look, kid,

31
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,360
if you tell us what we want to know,

32
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,520
no one gets hurt and we can leave
this shithole real quick.

33
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,920
Why should I lie to you? Why?

34
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,160
I work for Tarallo. I'm on his staff.
You got the wrong guy. Believe me.

35
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,920
You're mistaken.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,040
We're looking for an asshole who,

37
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,760
does the opposite
of what he should be doing.

38
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,480
His name is Sergio Minucci.
What's your name?

39
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,680
Hey. What's your name, huh?
You need to talk. What's your name?

40
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,960
Hey! Easy, or you'll hurt
that pretty face of his.

41
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,520
Get him up!

42
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,640
Wait.

43
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know who told you this about me,
but it's not true.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,280
Maybe there's some guy on his staff
who thinks he's smart.

45
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,520
Might be. If you let me go,
I can help you find him.

46
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,000
Listen to me. Let me go.
I'm at your disposal.

47
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,760
I'll help you find him.
No one will know. I'm with you…

00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,920
I'll do it later.

FATAL INCIDENT LUDOVICO TERZANI

53
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,680
RENOWNED ONCOLOGIST
KILLED IN HIT-AND-RUN

54
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,240
What the fuck?

55
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,640
-Hey, Renà.
-Inspector.

56
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,200
I have to pick up
Giorgio Alberti's personal effects.

57
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,480
Giorgio Alberti. Okay.

58
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,640
-There's nothing there.
-I'm telling you.

59
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,200
Make it work, Renà.

60
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,520
Praise be to the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

61
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,200
who has blessed us in the heavenly realms
with every spiritual blessing in Christ.

62
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,520
For he chose us in him
before the creation of the world.

63
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,480
Of course!

64
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,600
May Giorgio stand with the angels
at the throne of the Highest.

65
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,160
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

66
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,840
Giorgio, aren't you coming?

67
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,360
The doctor who ran over your son
is dead. Did you know?

68
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,480
When?

69
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,040
Last night.

70
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,440
He got run over too.

71
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,080
Life is weird, huh?

72
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,040
Yeah.

73
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,880
-Condolences, again.
-Thanks.

74
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,720
About the insurance,
I still have to take care of it.

75
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,040
I'm not here for that. I wanted to give
you your partner's personal effects.

76
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,960
-I'll take them, thanks.
-No, let go.

77
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,080
-Sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
-You didn't. I'm just surprised.

78
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,760
The lawyer told me it usually takes time.

79
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,560
Was it her?

80
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,720
-Why?
-Considering she used to call the shots.

81
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,520
No, not at all. It was…

82
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,760
It was my initiative. Want my advice?

83
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,440
Don't trust that person, okay?

84
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,200
Whatever you need,
don't hesitate to get in touch.

85
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Goodbye.

86
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,720
-Goodbye.
-Thanks.

87
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,000
Where are you going?
The inspector told you not to.

88
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,360
-Viola.
-Mom!

89
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,400
-Where did you get that?
-In his office, but I can give it back.

90
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,880
I only needed it
to find his smell again, but…

91
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,640
it's too late for that.

92
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,960
It's okay. Keep it.

93
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,640
The inspector's right.

94
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,840
I didn't help
get Giorgio's things for you.

95
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,160
And I never called the shots.

96
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,200
But you can trust me.

97
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,480
How do you know what we said?

98
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,720
You can count on me.
Believe me. I won't disappear.

99
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,760
You've got it easy with me, Terè.
I'm always around.

100
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,280
Exactly.

101
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,560
I need you. One of my contacts is missing.

102
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
I don't work with the unit now.

103
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,440
Not for the unit. For me.
Nobody at the office can know.

104
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,840
Let's put it this way.
I don't work anymore. Period.

105
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,800
Terzani spied on your son's movements.
Did you know?

106
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,000
How did you find out?

107
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,440
I started from your interest
in Colonel Silvia Prati.

108
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,960
And you told me there was a love story
behind Giorgio's death.

109
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,840
Terzani killed Giorgio,
and you killed him.

110
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,640
I can prove it.

111
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,520
-Are you blackmailing me?
-Blackmail? No.

112
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,800
Let's say that I need you,
and I'd do anything to get you.

113
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,240
Who is he? And when did he go missing?

114
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,240
Sergio Minucci.
The guy who gave you the keys.

115
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,400
He's on Tarallo's staff.

116
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,800
He hasn't answered calls
or used his phone in 24 hours.

117
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,480
No anomalies in the previous days.

118
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,960
He only contacted his girlfriend,
his… high school friends,

119
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,240
and a group chat he used
to look for a house on Chiaia's Riviera.

120
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
He skipped the texts he's supposed to send
to say everything's okay,

121
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,080
and he didn't show up
at our emergency meeting.

122
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,040
I'm sure he's in danger.

123
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,480
-How much autonomy do I have?
-Whatever you want or need.

124
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,800
-Just don't approach Tarallo.
-Why?

125
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,760
Because I can't afford
to have it all blow up in my face.

126
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,880
I'm on him.

127
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,200
Just like I'm on other candidates.
It's business as usual.

128
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,960
Here's Sergio's address, his mother's,

129
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,760
all the info on his fiancée,
a SIM card, and a USB drive.

130
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,280
You know how to use a USB drive, right?

131
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,000
Fuck you, blonde.
I didn't quit the job in the Middle Ages.

132
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,480
Copy the content of his computer onto it.

133
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,120
If you need me, you know how to find me.

134
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,560
Sergio?

135
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,440
Sergio!

136
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,520
Sergio, it's Mom! Open up!

137
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,120
Sergio, open the door!

138
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,040
Mrs. Minucci, what's going on?

139
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,720
-It's Sergio!
-What happened?

140
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,320
He won't open the door!

141
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,840
-Oh God, what happened?
-I haven't heard from him in 24 hours.

142
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,640
He calls me every three hours.
I'm so worried.

143
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,680
Oh, good Lord. Don't you have a spare key?

144
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,360
-A copy?
-I don't. I'm going to the police.

145
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,920
I don't care what his girlfriend says.

146
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,600
No! No, sir, no!

147
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,480
I don't think he's a hero either. No.

148
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,440
No, sir. It's just…

149
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,080
But… could it be that he's not talking
because he has nothing to say?

150
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,000
No, sir, no! Okay. Okay, sir.

151
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,360
Sir, just say the word,
and we'll do it. Okay.

152
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,240
-Give me that.
-Come on, Dad. You had a bypass.

153
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Shut up, you asshole!

154
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,440
I'M WITH TARALLO - 2024 ELECTIONS

155
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,080
POLICE

156
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,760
-Morning.
-Good morning.

157
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,080
How are you, Lorenzo?

158
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,720
Worried, now.

159
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,440
I need a copy of a missing person report
for Sergio Minucci.

160
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,800
-His mother should've just filed one.
-Who are you working for now?

161
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,200
Why? Have I ever told you
who I worked for?

162
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,240
No.

163
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,280
But it's different now.
Tamburi's dead. You disappeared.

164
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,240
I might get in trouble for this.

165
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,560
What the fuck are you doing?

166
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,360
I'm not what will get you in trouble.

167
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,280
Lorenzo!

168
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,680
What did she want?

169
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,600
Evening, ma'am. I'm with the police.
Are you Sergio Minucci's mother?

170
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,400
Yes. What happened? Did you find him?

171
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,240
Unfortunately not, ma'am.

172
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,800
I'm here to get more information.

173
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,760
And, given that you filed a report,

174
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,440
to ask why you don't believe
he decided to disappear.

175
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Please, sit down.

176
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,120
Thanks.

177
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,960
This isn't like Sergio.

178
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,480
He hasn't spoken to me or his sister.
She lives in Milan.

179
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,920
They talk every day.
He didn't call yesterday or today.

180
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,440
-Excuse me.
-Of course.

181
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,320
Hello, ma'am. Inspector Davide Pardo.

182
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,320
We were supposed to come together.
The inspector was late.

183
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,840
When you didn't show up, I went ahead.

184
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,560
-Please, sit.
-Thanks.

185
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,600
-Have a seat. Want a coffee?
-No, thanks. I'll stand. Thank you.

186
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm sorry.

187
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,320
As my colleague was saying,

188
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,400
we had an intruder
at the station, and I had to go check.

189
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,920
But please, go on.

190
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,560
Your colleague at the station explained
that we need to wait 48 hours for adults.

191
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,520
Yeah.

192
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,000
But Sergio was supposed to take me
to the doctor yesterday.

193
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,360
It's not like him to behave like this.

194
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,720
No one heard from him, ma'am?
A friend? His fiancée?

195
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,440
-That one? Forget about her.
-Why?

196
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,800
I don't like Rachele. Or her family.

197
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,080
Sergio dropped out of university
to follow her father.

198
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,400
Why's that, ma'am?

199
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
He put him to work on Tarallo's staff,

200
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,920
writing press releases,
speeches, and stuff like that.

201
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,240
-Is he a politician too?
-Not at all.

202
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,680
He works in security.
He runs a security firm.

203
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,920
-It's called Anzovino. Heard of it?
-No.

204
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,080
-No.
-No.

205
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,320
Why don't you like it?
I mean, it's a good job, right?

206
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,880
Well paid too.

207
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,920
His girlfriend likes people with status.

208
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,480
You guys might like Tarallo,

209
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,160
but Sergio never did.

210
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,800
There are things
not even money can justify.

211
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,280
Hey!

212
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,040
-What the fuck are you up to?
-You followed me. You saw, right?

213
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,080
Do you know the difference
between retired cops and cops on duty?

214
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,680
Retired cops stay home and rest.
They don't play Murder, She Wrote.

215
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,240
-I have you all figured out.
-Oh.

216
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,520
You want to look aggressive,
dominant, right?

217
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,000
It's an act.
That's why even your dog ignores you.

218
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
Done with the X-ray?

219
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,640
What the fuck are you up to, Morozzi?

220
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,040
-A favor for a friend.
-Where does the kid come in?

221
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,280
-That's confidential.
-Confidential, my ass!

222
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,520
You said you were a cop,
extorted information. What the fuck?

223
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,960
We did. You were there too.

224
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,440
I'm a police inspector on duty.
I can ask whatever I want, okay?

225
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,800
-And I can keep an eye on you.
-Fine.

226
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,120
I'm going to see
the missing guy's fiancée.

227
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,080
What about you? Are you going to tail me,
or should we go together?

228
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,080
Get in.

229
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,800
Do I have to open the door?

230
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
That would be nice.

231
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,520
Sergio called me yesterday morning.
He was okay.

232
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,960
He just said he was busy.
His mother's exaggerating.

233
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,520
A very present mother.

234
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,680
Yeah.

235
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,880
But she's his mom. I don't have a say.

236
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,360
And you never heard back from him?

237
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,600
-No.
-Is that normal? Did you have a fight?

238
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,240
No. No fights.

239
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,600
-You're engaged, right?
-Yes.

240
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,480
It's a bit complicated.

241
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,560
We decided not to smother each other.

242
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,040
We both have our own space.

243
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,400
So whole days can go by
without a call, right?

244
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,240
It happens.

245
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,520
You didn't feel the need to call him,
just to check?

246
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,440
-No.
-No?

247
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
Could he be seeing someone else?

248
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,880
He might.
But honestly, I don't want to know.

249
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,280
-I could be too.
-Of course.

250
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,880
So you weren't house hunting?

251
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,640
We never talked about moving in together.

252
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,040
Even though he got a good job.

253
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,400
It's not a matter of possibility.
It's a matter of choice.

254
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,040
-Not exactly a great love story.
-What does that mean?

255
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,400
You don't have to be together
all the time to love each other.

256
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,920
We see each other less
since he started working for Tarallo.

257
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,520
But this didn't change things between us.

258
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,920
Where can I take you?

259
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,680
Nowhere. I'm walking.

260
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,880
I need to walk. Do you like walking?

261
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,440
Do I like walking?

262
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,400
Where's your car?

263
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,920
-Why do you ask?
-Why do you ask why I'm asking?

264
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,840
My car is just fine,
and it's where it's supposed to be.

265
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,800
-I need to think about what we've got.
-What we've got? Huh.

266
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,200
Sorry, I didn't know
we were working together.

267
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,640
And I haven't got anything.

268
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
You don't?

269
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,400
You came halfway across Naples
just to follow me?

270
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Okay.

271
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,680
Mother vs daughter-in-law.

272
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,480
His mom thinks Minucci is the perfect guy,

273
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,040
but his fiancée describes him
as someone living his own life. So?

274
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,480
Rachele is keeping something from us.

275
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,600
-No. Why? She seemed genuine to me.
-No.

276
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,240
Those pauses, her eyes, her posture.

277
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,640
It all contradicted what she was saying.

278
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,680
Posture? You're an osteopath now?

279
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,360
And she didn't look happy.

280
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,920
Sorry, I go by facts, not feelings.

281
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,960
Why? Words and behaviors
have nothing to do with facts?

282
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,680
Take you, for example.

283
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,760
You talk about moving in together
like it's a mandatory milestone.

284
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,960
Saying it's not love if they don't
call each other ten times a day.

285
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,960
So what?

286
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,800
So there's clearly something
behind your remarks.

287
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,880
What is it? A separation? Abandonment?

288
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,400
A heartbreak?

289
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,880
And this is a fact.

290
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,240
Thanks for the lecture.
I have stuff to do now.

291
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,880
Listen, what if I need you again?

292
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,640
Then you should tell me what you're up to.

293
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,320
Because you're up to something,
and that's a fact.

294
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,160
But I know you won't tell me.
So, good luck.

295
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,120
Such a shame. Just when we were
starting to like each other.

296
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,240
Giovà! Come down.

297
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,640
I'm coming. Just a sec. Hold on!

298
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,560
Ma'am, you dropped this.

299
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,040
Thanks.

300
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,440
Were you having Sergio followed
to protect him?

301
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,600
No, why?

302
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,600
I remembered seeing a white van

303
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,920
when he gave me the keys.

304
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,520
Do you have one like that?

305
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,240
We have lots of vans, but I'm telling you
I didn't have him followed.

306
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,480
Why does it matter?

307
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,360
I'm sure it was there.

308
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,400
What's the link to Sergio?
Lots of vans drive by.

309
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,880
I don't know. Just a feeling.

310
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,360
You're back.
You're starting to like it again.

311
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,520
I want to get it done so I never have to
see you again. Can I trust Davide Pardo?

312
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,400
You were always good
at figuring people out, weren't you?

313
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Fuck you.

314
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,480
Help me. Help me, please.

315
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,080
I'm really hurt.

316
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,960
Kid, if you don't talk,
we're all going to hurt, got it?

317
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Come in.

318
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You like it?

319
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Yes.

320
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,920
-What do you think?
-It's the ugliest view I've ever seen.

321
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,440
That's why I brought you here.

322
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,320
People are in a rush here
and won't notice us.

323
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,680
It's just me and you.

324
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,640
Hi, Sara.

325
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Teresa.

326
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,560
-What? What happened?
-Lembo's in there.

327
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,800
-When did he get here?
-Ten minutes ago.

328
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,080
Should we have offered him coffee?

329
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,280
If he doesn't shut us down,
we'll offer him a double coffee.

330
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,320
Right.

331
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Hi.

332
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
Hey!

333
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,680
You get prettier by the day, Terè. Huh?

334
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,600
Can I say that, or will you report me
for workplace harassment?

335
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
So this is still a workplace.

336
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Of course it is. I'm doing all I can
to keep it that way as long as possible.

337
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
Any news?

338
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,560
No. The usual stuff.

339
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,360
What are you doing in Naples?

340
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,600
I was passing through.
I thought I'd say hi.

341
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,160
You did the right thing.

342
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,880
I heard about Morozzi's son.

343
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,600
Yeah, that's an ugly story.

344
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
How is she?

345
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,680
Same as always. Just a few years older.

346
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,640
Is she still determined
to stay out of the game or not?

347
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,480
I don't know. Why do you want to know?

348
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,360
I always liked you two.
Though I never let it show. Never.

349
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,920
Cut it out. I'm serious.

350
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,320
-Why do you want to know?
-Terè.

351
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,280
If you want me to defend you
and this hole, I need to know everything.

352
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Sure.

353
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,240
In case there's anything to know,
I'll keep you posted, don't worry.

354
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,760
Day, month, and year.

355
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,640
That's when you came into my office,
and smiled at me.

356
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,560
There are a lot of secrets in my files

357
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,880
that would completely change your idea
of the State and what's around us.

358
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,800
Promise me you'll only look at the files
that could help you in an investigation.

359
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,400
Don't look for anything else.
I'm saying it for you.

360
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,680
ARCHIVE - YEAR
PAO-PAS

361
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,000
PARDO

362
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,600
MOROZZI SARA
MOBILE SQUAD - DISMISSED

363
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,840
-Musè?
-Yeah?

364
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,000
Do you think it's normal for a woman
who was in the Mobile Unit for so long

365
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,640
to suddenly get dismissed, and after that
nothing can be found on her?

366
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,280
Who are you talking about?

367
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,960
Sara Morozzi, the mother
of the kid run over by the doctor.

368
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,920
I guess there was nothing else to know.

369
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Hello?

370
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,240
Excuse me, can I know
who this phone belongs to?

371
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,480
Viola?

372
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
Who is it?

373
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,840
It's Sara, Giorgio's mom.

374
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,120
You called me.

375
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,320
Maybe we should meet.

376
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,920
Yes, sure, whenever you want.

377
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,200
It's been on Giorgio's desk
ever since he moved in with me.

378
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,880
Turn it over, look on the back.

379
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,960
There's no name.

380
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,680
That's why I called
without knowing whose number it was.

381
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,640
At first I thought it was
some girl's keepsake.

382
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,240
I don't know why…
I felt the need to talk to her.

383
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,840
So, you two met up?

384
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,760
It's not true he hadn't seen you
since you abandoned him.

385
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,200
No, I didn't give it to him.

386
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,160
Who did, then?

387
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,720
Someone did it on my behalf.

388
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,160
I recognize the handwriting.
It's my partner's.

389
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,000
You have a partner?

390
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
I did.

391
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,000
-Did you know he went to see Giorgio?
-No.

392
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,760
I mean, I knew they'd met
and that it didn't go well.

393
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,760
If Giorgio kept it,
it must've gone better than I thought.

394
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,360
The more I look at you,
the more I see the resemblance.

395
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,040
You have the same eyes.

396
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,640
Maybe the baby will have them too.

397
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,280
I don't know if I want to hope for that.

398
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,360
I understand.

399
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,280
But, even though I wasn't a good mother,

400
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,400
I might be a decent grandmother.

401
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,560
I need to think about it.

402
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,840
I need to have reliable people around me.

403
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,720
MESSAGE FROM

404
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,400
FOUND TWO RINGS.
ONE WAS THE ONE WE WERE LOOKING FOR.

405
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,680
Are your neighbors discreet?
Do they mind their own business?

406
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Why?

407
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,800
Nothing, just…

408
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,480
You could invite me up.

409
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
No?

410
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,000
BREACH

411
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,240
Oh, fuck.

412
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,480
Fuck.

413
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,840
You're insane.

414
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,120
-I could've shot you, you know?
-I have a question for you.

415
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,080
Ask away.

416
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,280
No eyeliner.

417
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,680
Panda eyes.

418
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,680
Red, watery eyes. Doesn't take much
of an effort to figure it out.

419
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,720
Figure what out?

420
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,720
If you didn't call me to tell me
they found Sergio Minucci's body,

421
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,520
but texted me instead, it's because
you didn't want me to hear you.

422
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,440
You knew I'd figure out what was going on
between you two from your voice.

423
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,520
Why didn't you tell me?

424
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,160
What was I supposed to say?

425
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,600
That I fell in love with a guy
20 years younger than me?

426
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,920
You called me to help you save him,
not preach to you.

427
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,680
-Me, of all people.
-I made a mistake. So what?

428
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
So stop hiding stuff from me.

429
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,600
Why do you think they killed him?

430
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
I don't know.

431
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,920
I don't know.

432
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,560
Sergio was an ordinary guy.

433
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,120
Not for me, obviously.

434
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,040
Who's the other body?

435
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,920
-It hasn't been identified.
-Where were they found?

436
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,760
Near the crop fields in Somma Vesuviana.

437
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,240
Anything else I need to know?

438
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
No.

439
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
I'm serious.

440
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,680
You're a bitch, Terè.

441
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,760
But I am sorry.

442
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,040
-Take another one here.
-Yes.

443
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,240
-Here.
-Yes.

444
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,960
-Okay.
-Okay, done.

445
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,040
Come on, move.

446
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,880
We identified the other one too.
His name was Gaspare Russo.

447
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,520
He worked in a body shop
in Vicolo delle Fratte.

448
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,520
His wife reported him missing
an hour ago. Record's clean.

449
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,160
Anyway, ma'am, illegal workers
are exploited in this area.

450
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,160
You don't need me to tell you that.

451
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,720
The dynamic is off, though.

452
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,160
One was found in a burlap sack,

453
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,960
the other killed
with three shots to the chest.

454
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,760
-Oh.
-It's nice, right?

455
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,200
-It sucks, as always.
-Oh, well!

456
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,120
-Here.
-Yeah.

457
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay.

458
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,640
Bye.

459
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,480
Did you get all primed up for me?

460
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,440
I want to know how the fuck you do it.

461
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,480
-Me?
-Yeah.

462
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,040
I can teleport.

463
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,480
Back then we used brooms,
but you know how progress is…

464
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,560
Very funny.

465
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,840
Since you don't care about feelings,
I have a fact for you.

466
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,360
Sergio Minucci is dead.

467
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,040
-When?
-I don't know.

468
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,560
But a Gaspare Russo died with him.

469
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm sorry for the kid.

470
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,920
You're so good at getting information.
What do you want from me?

471
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,840
You need to fill in the gaps.

472
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,280
Because Gaspare Russo was shot.
I don't know how Minucci died yet.

473
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,200
So?

474
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,360
So, as soon as the coroner is done
with the autopsy, I need the report.

475
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,360
-Oh.
-And the forensics report.

476
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Details on the items found
with the bodies, their phone data,

477
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,640
anything that comes out from now on.

478
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,720
-You want a nice rum baba too?
-No, I prefer honey balls.

479
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,560
You really think I'm taking orders
from you, Morozzi?

480
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,600
I only got dragged into this
because I was overzealous, okay?

481
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,520
I'd say you were curious about me.

482
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,840
You wish.

483
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,880
You think you're the center
of the universe. You're not.

484
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,960
You're not the center of mine for sure.
So forget we ever met. It's for the best.

485
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,080
I thought you were interested
in finally working a good case.

486
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,400
Thanks, but I don't need you for that.

487
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,080
Seeing where you ended up,
I don't think so.

488
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,400
Too bad. I was hoping to skip a step.

489
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,760
But I guess not.

490
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,000
Your grocery bag.

491
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,560
If they turned his home upside down,

492
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,160
it means they didn't get
what they wanted from him.

493
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,960
But what did they want?
There was nothing on his computer.

494
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,040
That's not enough to rule out
he didn't have secrets.

495
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,200
Given where the body was found,
they'll investigate the tomato racket.

496
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,400
-What does Sergio have to do with it?
-And Gaspare Russo?

497
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
Nothing.

498
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,920
Never heard anyone mention this
Gaspare Russo. Not Sergio or anybody else.

499
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,160
We must go back to the beginning,
without ruling out that they wanted info.

500
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,240
What exactly did Sergio do for Tarallo?

501
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,320
At first, he did more data analysis
than communication.

502
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,360
But he was good, so Tarallo asked him
to help write his speeches.

503
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,920
Why did you recruit him?

504
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,120
He seemed like a fish out of water.

505
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,360
My instinct told me
he might be the weak link in there.

506
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,720
Instead, you can't imagine
how strong he was.

507
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,480
It simply weighed on him
to support an electoral project

508
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,080
that was so different from his beliefs,

509
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,600
based on the fear of immigrants,
of differences.

510
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,520
You were in love.

511
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,800
I was even thinking
of giving it all up for him.

512
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,520
I often thought about you.
About your choices.

513
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,200
I'm not a good role model.

514
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,360
Everyone makes mistakes.

515
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,240
I don't want to settle
for the official investigation, brunette.

516
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,600
Knowing who killed him is not enough.
I want to know why he died.

517
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,760
Then I need you to do something for me.

518
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,960
Inspector Pardo speaking.

519
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,280
Pardo, it's Giuliani.

520
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,280
Mr. Giuliani, hello.

521
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,480
-I apologize if…
-What are you doing?

522
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,640
I'm a little out of breath.
I'm walking my dog.

523
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,920
But I'm listening, go on.
Should I come to the station?

524
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,440
-Not at all. You're free, Pardo.
-What do you mean?

525
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,840
Your request for leave was approved.

526
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,800
No, excuse me, what leave?
What… What leave?

527
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,880
Pardo, from what I see,
you asked for leave.

528
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,320
Effective immediately.

529
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,800
-Okay. Got it.
-Enjoy your time and don't fuck up.

530
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,840
-And say hi to your dog.
-Goodbye.

531
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,680
Okay.

532
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,440
Walk's over, Boris.
You didn't piss? Your fucking problem.

533
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,640
POLICE

534
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,720
Hi, Pardo.

535
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,640
-It's not a good time, Morozzi.
-Why?

536
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,400
-I have to go to HR before it closes.
-What for?

537
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,520
Say it's not what I think.

538
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,000
It's amazing how fast
things can change, huh?

539
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,280
I believe you have some time for me now.

540
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,840
