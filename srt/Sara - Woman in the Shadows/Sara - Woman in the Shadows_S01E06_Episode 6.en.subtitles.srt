Asshole!

00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,400
Where are you going, you piece of shit?

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,240
You piece of shit!

5
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
We put you back on your feet.

6
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,120
But you have to leave.
We don't want trouble.

7
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,800
-I'm not a criminal. I'm a journalist.
-I didn't ask.

8
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,080
And I don't care. I just want you to go.

9
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,080
Fine, but can I send a text first?
I think I lost my phone.

10
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,080
I don't give a fuck.
You're not using our phones.

11
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,640
It's getting light. We're leaving.

12
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,600
Get him dressed and send him on his way.
Are we clear?

13
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,640
Throw your clothes down there.
I'll take care of them.

14
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,400
If you send me away now, they'll kill me.

15
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,200
Do you have money?

16
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,240
I have this.

17
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,800
Go see Manuel. He works there.

18
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,720
If it's enough for him, maybe he'll help.

19
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,960
It's getting light out now.

20
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,240
Here, get dressed.
Hurry up. You have to leave.

-Where are you?

24
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
At Anzovino's agency, why?

25
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,760
Anzovino didn't come home last night.

26
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,040
He hasn't arrived here either.
They opened ten minutes ago.

27
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,680
What should I do? Go in with an excuse
and ask for information?

28
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,480
His daughter just came out.
I'll follow her. She might lead me to him.

29
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,920
-Okay?
-Fine.

Where? You piece of shit!

32
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,160
Dad?

33
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,280
Ma'am.

34
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,560
Hold on. I have to ask you something.

35
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
Do you know this guy?

36
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,480
No. Blacks don't come here.
They know we don't want them.

37
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,440
Oh.

38
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,160
-What's the baby name?
-Goran.

39
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,960
-How old is he?
-Ten months.

40
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,480
Ma'am, just tell me
where the Black guy is.

41
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,480
It'll be better for everyone. Okay?

42
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,600
What do you want?

43
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,560
Ninotchka sent me.

44
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,360
What room do you want?

45
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,200
They're all free.
This place gets busy later, you know?

46
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,400
You pick one.

47
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,400
Room 112.

48
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,600

What am I supposed to do now?

61
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,800
Tell her?

62
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,360
She slams the door in my face,
and I help her anyway?

63
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
I don't think so.

64
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,080
Fuck.

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,960
THANKS. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

68
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,360
Hey. What's up?

69
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,600
Pardo, Edoardo's alive.

70
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,520
I sent you what he just posted.

71
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,120
No museums this time,
but his home address.

72
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,840
-I'll meet you there.
-Okay. What about Anzovino?

73
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,400
-We'll deal with him later. Hurry up.
-Yes.

76
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
Hey.

77
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,680
-I'm here.
-Well?

78
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,200
Not a thing.

79
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,080
The door shows no signs of a break-in,
apart from ours.

80
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,080
Here… it looks like
they didn't touch anything.

81
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
Anyway, I asked Anna Maria to verify
the IP address the post was sent from,

82
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,920
and she even sent me the location.

83
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,360
Let's go.

84
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,520
-Hello.
-Good morning.

85
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,440
Morning.

86
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,760
I have to say something.

87
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,600
-Look over there.
-Huh?

88
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,480
The key to 112 is the only one missing.
First floor.

89
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,800
Come on.

90
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,040
Who the fuck is that?

91
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,800
Aldo Esposito. From Bagnoli. Check him.

92
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,240
You think Edoardo shot him?

93
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,120
If he did, it was to save his own life.

94
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
It's locked.

95
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,840
It's locked, Morozzi.
Listen, let's just take it.

96
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,880
I'd take it.

97
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Otherwise, we have to beg all the saints
in heaven to tell us what's on it.

98
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,840
Huh? What do you say?

99
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,080
I say…

100
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,400
we found Sergio's killer.

101
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,520
Teresa, he's the one who killed Sergio.

102
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,040
-Hey, I was about to call you.
-Yeah.

103
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,480
Belliti used his credit card
at the airport two hours ago

104
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,400
and bought a ticket to Lisbon.

105
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,960
-Oh.
-What time's the flight?

106
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,320
It left. If he was running,
he'd jump on the first flight.

107
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,720
Who can say for certain it's him?

108
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,840
-I'll find out.
-Hey.

109
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,320
-Whose is that?
-The dead guy's.

110
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,480
One thing at a time. Let me hack
airport security, then I'll get to that.

111
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,480
They were fast.

112
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,200
They're your men.

113
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,680
They move fast, Lembo.

114
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,320
I'm sorry, Teresa.
You know I did what I could.

115
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,960
Anyway, It's not over for you.

116
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,360
I want you in Rome with me.

117
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,960
No, thanks.

118
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,240
I'd rather get my life back.

119
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,040
You'd get bored in a minute.
I'll give you full autonomy.

120
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,720
-You can make all the decisions you want.
-Why, what have I done up to now?

121
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,040
Otherwise, they wouldn't have
shut down the unit, right?

122
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Here.

123
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,560
You can keep them.

124
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,720
This space is still ours
until the movers take away the furniture.

125
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,880
What do I do with it?

126
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,400
You can bring Morozzi here to see
this little theater one last time, no?

127
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,840
I wouldn't mind.

128
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
What's Sara got to do with it now?

129
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,720
Didn't Tamburi have it built just for her

130
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,920
so she wouldn't ruin
her eyesight reading lips?

131
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,440
Yes, and the unit buried her
along with Massimiliano.

132
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,600
Oh. So you two meet
to talk about the weather.

133
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,400
Yes. And about time going by.

134
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760
About how it passes,
but nothing ever fucking changes.

135
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,520
Take care.

136
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
The footage is from two hours ago.

137
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,880
Look.

138
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,240
There. There he is.

139
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,080
-It's him.
-Yes, it's him.

140
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,800
What's up, Terè?

141
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,360
Hey, Anzovino's not at home anymore.
I'll send Anna Maria everything.

142
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,040
According to his location history,
it looks like he moved to Campi Flegrei.

143
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,240
But what's interesting is when he left.

144
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,160
Meaning?

145
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,720
After Sergio died.

146
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,280
He often calls his daughter,
but the calls go unanswered.

147
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,040
-What are you doing here?
-Hear me out.

148
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,200
We don't have prosecutor authorization.

149
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,880
I even told my colleague we needed one,
but she's got her own methods.

150
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,200
Hi, Rachele.

151
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,680
How did you get in?

152
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,960
Using the aforementioned methods.

153
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,520
You put that photo I gave you
on your nightstand.

154
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
Get out of my house.

155
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,040
Why? What are you going to do?
Who will you call for help?

156
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,920
Your dad? I doubt it.

157
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,040
You're not even picking up his calls.

158
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,320
I saw the way you were crying
at his grave today.

159
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,800
You only hide a love
as big as Sergio's out of fear.

160
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,920
It's not like that.

161
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
No?

162
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,120
Then you love someone else so much
you need to defend it?

163
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,360
Who is it? Your father? Huh?

164
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,720
Who's friends with Vigilante
and works for Tarallo,

165
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,280
who Sergio started investigating
with Belliti.

166
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,200
What happened, huh?

167
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,400
What? Did you find something out?
Did you tell him everything?

168
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,680
Now you feel guilty
because Sergio died because of you!

169
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,800
Yes!

170
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,240
It's my fault Sergio died, yes!
But that's not what happened.

171
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,560
He was acting weird.
He stopped telling me what he was up to.

172
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,320
So I followed him,
and I saw him with a woman,

173
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,440
a woman who could've been his mother.

174
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,160
He told me he was being forced to do it.

175
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,360
That he felt disgusting
every time he got out of her bed.

176
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,520
Then he mentioned an investigation,
one that would make a lot of heads roll.

177
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,840
Was your father's head one of them?

178
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,760
-No.
-Then whose?

179
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,160
Vigilante's. I lied to you
when I said I didn't know him.

180
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,040
He saw me grow up.
And he saved my dad when he was in debt.

181
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,280
So you felt
you had to tell him everything.

182
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,720
Not him. My dad.

183
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,120
I wanted him to disprove Sergio,
and he did.

184
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,720
But then Sergio disappeared.

185
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,640
Why didn't you tell us the truth
when we came to you?

186
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,920
We might've been able to save Sergio.

187
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,280
Because my dad told Vigilante everything.

188
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,120
But then Sergio died
and you still didn't say anything!

189
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,880
He's my father!

190
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,360
What was I supposed to do?
He was terrified.

191
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,920
If I'd talked, they would've killed him.

192
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Call him.

193
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,640
No.

194
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,560
-I want nothing to do with him.
-You don't get to decide shit. Call him.

195
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,600
Rachè. How are you?

196
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,440
You know how I am.

197
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Who are they?

198
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,800
It's over. They know everything.
You can't run anymore, Dad.

199
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,240
We finally meet.

200
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,240
I asked Vigilante to help me with Sergio.

201
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,200
And he found him a job with Tarallo.

202
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,400
How could I not tell him?
The kid was causing trouble.

203
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,160
Are you saying it's for the best
that the kid died?

204
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,280
Of course not, but try to understand.

205
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,080
What's Vigilante up to?

206
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
What interests are behind all this?

207
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,120
I don't know about his business.

208
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,400
Then why were you so worried
about Sergio's investigation?

209
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,360
-I swear, I don't know anything.
-Anzovino.

210
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,720
Don't look at me. Look at her.

211
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
I won't say what I think of you.

212
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,720
But if you want us to understand,
you have to talk to us.

213
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,120
Huh? You handle his security, right?

214
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,720
You don't know where he goes,
who he sees? Should I call the station?

215
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,600
Well?

216
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,800
Do you follow all Vigilante's movements?

217
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,880
No, not all of them.

218
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,080
Sometimes he tells me
he wants to go alone.

219
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,960
Good. Then next time he tells you that,
you tell us.

220
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,720
What a drag.

221
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,400
Yeah?

222
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,840
Hello, it's Musella,
I'm looking for Inspector Pardo.

223
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,200
He's not here. What do you want?

224
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,120
Who are you?

225
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,960
Mind your own fucking business.

226
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Sorry.

227
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,040
Who is it? Oh, it's Musella.

228
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,360
Musella, you got something for us?

229
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,720
Of course, or I wouldn't have called.
I found out something crazy.

230
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,560
If you're heading back, I'll wait for you.
I'm here, outside your house.

231
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,960
I was passing by
and I thought I'd drop by.

232
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,160
Your new girlfriend
said you weren't there.

233
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,200
She's not my new girlfriend, Musella,

234
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,760
and you have to stop dropping by my place.

235
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,160
You understand?

236
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,080
All right.

237
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,560
Hey! Tell me what you found out.

238
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,400
So, Aldo Esposito

239
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,920
was shot with the same weapon
that killed Gaspare Russo.

240
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,560
-Yeah.
-Aldo's father, Vito Esposito,

241
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,840
is a fugitive.

242
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,880
But I think… he's dead too.

243
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,080
Why do you say that?

244
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,960
The DNA we found in Pianura
with the journalist's

245
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,480
has a father-son link
with Aldo Esposito's, so…

246
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,840
Okay. Thanks, Musella.

247
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,640
-Welcome. Anyway, I'm here if you--
-I said, "Thanks, Musella."

248
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,400
God, he's impossible. It's absurd.

249
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,760
He always wants to stick his nose
in my fucking business.

250
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,880
But he's a good kid.

251
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,640
So you feel it too.

252
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,680
What?

253
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,920
Nostalgia.

254
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,280
Fuck you, Pardo.

255
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,360
Anyway, I just saw a Japanese guy
in front of Viola's house,

256
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,120
looking up at her window,
and I don't like that.

257
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,880
Everything's under control, don't worry.

258
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,360
He's an agent from the unit.
And he's Chinese.

259
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,640
He's Chinese.

260
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Okay.

261
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,000
Today is an important day for Naples.

262
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,280
Everything's ready for the rally that
will close Tarallo's electoral campaign.

263
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,520
The politician, who made security
the key issue of his platform,

264
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,000
is the candidate expected to become
president of the Campania region,

265
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,200
backed by a strong coalition
providing an unwavering support.

266
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,680
Aldo Esposito worked for Vigilante.

267
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,000
These are the photos from his phone.

268
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,560
So it's confirmed.

269
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,800
It was Vigilante who had him killed.

270
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,080
-Sergio shouldn't have died.
-Cut the bullshit, Sara.

271
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,400
If the beating didn't kill him,
once they got the information,

272
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,880
they'd have killed him.

273
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,520
The phone the photos were sent to,

274
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,520
whatever name it was registered to,
had to be Vigilante's.

275
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,840
I want to know everything.
Open it up like a tin can.

276
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,440
-It's encrypted. It'll take time.
-Work on it. You're good.

277
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,880
Teresa.

278
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,400
Leave me alone.

279
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,400
You were right, as always.

280
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,760
Arresting Tarallo
would've been a fucking mistake.

281
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,680
Give me that cigarette.

282
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,160
Smoking again to show support?

283
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,360
You're right, Paolo Anzovino
was right under our nose.

284
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,440
Mine more than yours.

285
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,760
Sergio was right under my nose too.

286
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
But I didn't fucking know a thing.

287
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,160
I was looking at him in a different way.

288
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,480
The same way he was looking at you.

289
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,400
When Sergio disappeared,

290
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,440
Rachele thought he was with you.

291
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,360
He told her he'd fallen in love.

292
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,440
Are you saying that out of pity?

293
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,440
You know I'm unable to lie.

294
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
If I lied, you'd know.

295
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,120
Excuse me. It's Anzovino.

296
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
Put him on speaker.

297
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
-Talk to me.
-I got some news.

298
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,000
Vigilante just took me off managing
the security detail for Tarallo's rally.

299
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,120
He claims the party wanted
a company from Rome to handle it.

300
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,320
-Has this ever happened before?
-No.

301
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,400
Thank you.

302
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,240
-Something's definitely going down.
-Of course.

303
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,480
This guy is really pissing me off.

304
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,320
TO BE HUMAN
HUMAN GOD

305
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,440
Just a few more minutes

306
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,440
and our presidential candidate
will be with us.

307
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,680
Oh God! Wait. Let me help you. Easy.

308
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,360
-Easy. Put your hand here. Easy.
-Tell me what you want from me first!

309
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,000
I don't want you to have the baby here
for starters.

310
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,800
-You've been following me for days.
-Easy now. Relax.

311
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,800
Viola!

312
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,560
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'm a friend of Sara's.

313
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,160
I'm taking Viola to the hospital.
Her water broke.

314
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
-You're a friend of Sara's?
-Viola!

315
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,320
Know anyone who'd kidnap a woman in labor?

316
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,960
-I'm her mother.
-I don't.

317
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,960
But I wouldn't bet on
the people Sara knows.

318
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,400
Okay. Take it easy…

319
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,400
Calm down. Breathe.

320
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,800
You and that wretched woman
will be the death of me!

321
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,480
Do you have a gun? Shoot her!

322
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,120
Here he is!

323
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,680
-Good morning.
-You're the best!

324
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,360
Sir.

325
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Nice to see you.

326
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,920
-Hello.
-Good morning.

327
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,800
-Hello.
-Good morning.

328
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,040
-You're a legend! Bravo!
-Tarallo, you're the best!

329
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,000
-You're great!
-You're number one!

330
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,840
Thank you.

331
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,600
My friends,

332
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,520
first of all,
I want to thank you. All of you.

333
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,920
My greatest achievement
during these months with you

334
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,760
is creating a community.

335
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,840
A community of people
who love this land and its traditions.

336
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,880
A community of people

337
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,840
who are also not afraid
to face the future.

338
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,280
ARREST ME TOO

339
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,960
No, no…

340
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,600
Shame on you!

341
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,200
Do not react to their provocation.
That's what you are!

342
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,600
-Come on, push!
-Push.

343
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,000
-Push, sweetie.
-Again!

344
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,080
-Push.
-Push, sweetie.

345
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,560
Shut up, Mom!

346
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,520
-This is what you are!
-Shame on you!

347
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,640
This is violence.
This is the opposite of democracy.

348
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,080
-Shame on you! You should be ashamed.
-Shame on you!

349
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,680
They shot the president!

350
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It was him! Catch him!

351
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,840
-See you at Pardo's.
-Yes.

352
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,040
-You called it.
-It's logic. It came from there.

353
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,640
Push!

354
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,520
Hello?

355
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,880
Everything's good.

356
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,520
We took care of it.

357
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,320
Sadly, a few minutes ago

358
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,880
a statement was just released
announcing the death of Tarallo,

359
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,440
whose condition had appeared very serious
immediately following today's attack.

360
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,640
Messages of condolence and support
for the family are coming in

361
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,040
from across the institutional world.

362
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,600
Authorities have currently detained
a 35-year-old Nigerian man

363
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,240
whose identity is being--

364
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,880
Clearly they ran out
of scapegoats for hire

365
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,000
and dragged in some poor guy
who has jack shit to do with it.

366
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,040
Who knows if Tarallo
knew about this whole mess or not.

367
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,720
What he didn't know was that his life
was at risk. He knew about the rest.

368
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,600
I'm sure Vigilante told him
to stay on stage no matter what.

369
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,200
To make a hero out of him.

370
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,120
The nuclear energy business
was too important to lose

371
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,680
because of Tarallo.

372
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,440
Actually, we're the ones who lost. Again.

373
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,360
Where should I take this stuff?

374
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,240
Throw it away, as far as I'm concerned.

375
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,320
The unit no longer exists.

376
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
Yang.

377
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,840
In a public hospital.
In this neighborhood.

378
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,880
Rescued by a migrant friend of…
that witch. I…

379
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,440
Tell me, how can anyone
give birth like this? Tell me.

380
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,480
May I?

381
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,600
May she?

382
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,760
Mrs. Rosaria, let's go get a nice coffee.

383
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,240
I'll take your bag. Let's go.

384
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,640
I didn't like how you treated me.

385
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,760
You're right.

386
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,680
I was afraid for you.

387
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,400
I'd never forgive myself if you got hurt.

388
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,400
Couldn't you have just told me
to stay away?

389
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,640
I wasn't sure you would have.

390
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,600
No. Actually, I wouldn't have.

391
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,720
Remember the adrenalin at the restaurant?

392
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,280
He's handsome, isn't he?

393
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He's gorgeous.

394
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Want to hold him?

395
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,400
I don't know.

396
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,560
Come on. Hold him.

397
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,000
Easy.

398
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,480
Here he is.

399
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,320
Where's Pardo?

400
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,520
He's outside.

401
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,880
-Let him in. I'd like to see him.
-Yeah?

402
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,160
-Come on.
-Yes.

403
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,720
Sweetie.

404
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,440
Hi.

405
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,320
Here we are.

406
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,240
Where is she?

407
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
-Hi.
-Hi.

408
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,400
You look like the Virgin with Child.

409
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,560
I definitely have a child.
I don't know about the Virgin.

410
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,600
Have you chosen a name for him?

411
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
Massimiliano.

412
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,240
I like it. It's a nice name.

413
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,400
I can't wait to take him home.

414
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,240
Did I tell you that Giorgio's office
will be his room?

415
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
No.

416
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,920
It has the nicest view and…
I think that's what he'd want.

417
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,840
"Due to urgent move,
apartment for rent in via Duomo

418
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,760
with beautiful furnished kid's room
and lovely balcony."

419
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,080
Yay!

420
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,160
-Morning.
-Hello.

421
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
Hello.

422
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,640
Excuse me.

423
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,880
I have something urgent to do.

424
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,680
-Congrats. He's beautiful, Viola. Really.
-Thank you.

425
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,160
Come here.

426
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Thank you.

427
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,640
-Who is it?
-Ma'am?

428
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,520
-Good evening.
-Evening.

429
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,040
Sorry to show up at this hour,
maybe you're still having dinner.

430
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,160
Where's Edoardo?

431
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,360
That's exactly what I want to talk about,
ma'am. I'm a police inspector.

432
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,000
Show me your ID.

433
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,600
It's called a badge, ma'am.
It's not an ID. Anyway…

434
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,600
I don't have it, because I'm on leave…

435
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,800
Ma'am?

436
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,160
Edoardo is in Lisbon right now.

437
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,000
That's not true. I tried calling him.
He's unreachable.

438
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,400
And I saw you the other night,
you and a woman. You kicked his door open.

439
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,960
-And you came back again.
-Yes, you're right, ma'am. That's true.

440
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,160
We did it because we want to help Edoardo.

441
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,080
-If you let me in--
-I'm calling the police.

442
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,040
I am the police, ma'am.

443
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,280
You need to leave!

444
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,680
What… What are you doing?

445
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,320
Where's Edoardo?
Why is he not coming back?

446
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,280
Hi.

447
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,920
Edoardo is on vacation right now.
I'm a friend of his.

448
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,120
Let me in?

449
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,000
APARTMENT TO RENT IN VIA DUOMO

450
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,120
I don't get why Edoardo
described Ely's room.

451
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,880
I don't know, ma'am,
but maybe we can ask the kid?

452
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,040
Yes, sure. Her room's this way.

453
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,320
-Please.
-Thank you.

454
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,120
-Ely?
-Ely.

455
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,440
Ely… Can I ask you question?

456
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,240
Is there a chance

457
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,880
that Edoardo came to your room

458
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,520
and maybe used your computer or your toys?

459
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,840
I don't have a computer.
I go to his house when Mom's at work.

460
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
Look.

461
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,160
When we watched the game together.
He gave me this.

462
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,520
He told me never to abandon it.

463
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,320
-When was that, exactly?
-Just before he went missing.

464
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,360
Can I see it a sec?

465
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,160
Don't worry. My father was a tailor.
I'm very good at it.

466
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,760
A terrible new scandal
is upsetting Italian politics.

467
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,840
The attack where
regional candidate Tarallo lost his life,

468
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,760
would only be its final act.

469
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,320
Edoardo Belliti uncovered an earthquake
that rocked the whole world of politics.

470
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,080
Betting on hate and fear,

471
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,720
Tarallo and his committee gave life
to a xenophobic electoral campaign.

472
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,320
For months, crimes were committed
by illegal immigrants in Campania,

473
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,160
with the intention
of boosting Tarallo's campaign.

474
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,560
Belliti's investigation
opened a Pandora's box

475
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,400
of a political system that relies
on corruption and criminal support.

476
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,680
The investigation on Tarallo and
the criminal system that supported him

477
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,720
is traveling around the whole world.

478
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,400
NAPLES: HOW TARALLO WAS SUPPOSED TO WIN

479
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,080
THE TARALLO INVESTIGATION:
CHRONICLE OF ELECTORAL FRAUD

480
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,080
The fucking phone ruined my apparition!

481
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,920
Damn!

482
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,760
Alright. What did you want?

483
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,720
Congratulations. How did you do it?

484
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,600
Well, I'll explain later.

485
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,000
You'll figure it out on your own.
I have something to tell you.

486
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,200
During Tarallo's rally,

487
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,200
the security cameras were off
for half an hour, right?

488
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,840
We know Vigilante
has his finger in every pie,

489
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,560
but for something like that,
a criminal isn't enough.

490
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,800
Okay? Even a criminal like him.

491
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,720
Vigilante never stops.

492
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,440
Berlin, Rome, Milan, Palermo.

493
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,840
What else do we have?

494
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,400
Wiretapping.

495
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,320
Audio, obviously. Otherwise, those guys
in Rome would never have invited me.

496
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,160
Truth is, no one invited you.
I'm bringing you along.

497
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,080
-So, the attack was confirmed?
-Maybe.

498
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,240
If Rome doesn't trust sending them here,

499
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,000
it means there's something juicy
in those wiretaps. Let's go.

500
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,640
How did it go in Rome?

501
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,920
As expected.

502
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,360
Meaning?

503
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,640
A dead end.

504
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,920
Sorry.

505
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,160
Hi, Brunette!

506
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,440
Did you listen to Massimiliano's CD?

507
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,920
No. I'm not ready yet.

508
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,440
What do you need?

509
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,680
Before the attack in Florence

510
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,920
you and Massimiliano went to Rome.

511
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,800
What happened there?

512
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,040
I'm not the person you should be asking.

513
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,960
I wasn't invited. Lembo didn't let me in.

514
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,800
When he walked out of the room,

515
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,280
Massimiliano said that
we were back to square one,

516
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,320
and that the wiretapping
was fucking useless.

517
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,840
And you believed him?

518
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,960
Yes, of course I believed him.

519
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,080
Why would he have lied?

520
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,920
Hi, Lembo.

521
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,760
You got here late, Morozzi.

522
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,880
If you're talking about the truth, maybe.
But what matters is getting there.

523
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,280
It was you, right?

524
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,200
Today like yesterday.

525
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,040
Massacres, attacks.

526
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,080
It was you who covered them up.

527
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,720
You still have the habit of being
out of line without a shred of a proof.

528
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,640
Know who else was out of line?

529
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,800
The sniper on the roof at Tarallo's rally.

530
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,360
But this time Vigilante
won't come out clean.

531
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,640
Take care, Brunette.

532
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,960
And do what a good agent should always do…

533
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,000
Forget.

534
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,400
Massimiliano was the best at that.

535
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,320
Florence and all of Italy are mourning.

536
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,120
An attack, in the dead of night,

537
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,000
occurred just steps away
from the Uffizi Gallery,

538
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,200
in via dei Gergofili,
causing deaths, injuries,

539
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,320
and immense damage to the artistic
heritage of the Tuscan capital.

540
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,120
More than 30 were injured,
and five are dead, including two children.

541
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,240
What's happened--

542
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,240
-Hi.
-Hi.

543
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,560
Is that Vigilante's location history?

544
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,480
Yes.

545
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,560
It's the last thing Anna Maria did for me.

546
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,400
-What did you find out?
-Nothing.

547
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,080
Except that he likes to go running.

548
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,240
It's Lembo who covered up for Vigilante.

549
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,160
He's always covered up for him.

550
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,800
You're starting to enjoy it, huh?

551
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,640
It's a bit late, though.

552
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,880
That's the same thing he told me.

553
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,160
I confronted him and he let on
that Massimiliano knew.

554
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,800
He knew and he didn't stop him.

555
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,520
Lembo is a bastard.

556
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,480
He's only trying to tarnish
the memory of a dead man.

557
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,720
If Massimiliano knew,
he would've told you.

558
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,400
You really think so?

559
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,000
I was never good at lying, you know that.

560
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,880
If I lied, you'd know, right?

561
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,120
I'll make you a coffee.

562
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,400
HOW TARALLO
WAS SUPPOSED TO WIN THE ELECTIONS

563
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,080
My love,

564
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,080
if you're hearing these words,
it means I'm gone.

565
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,280
Or that Catapano's playing
a bad joke on you.

566
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,560
He really couldn't stand you, you know?

567
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,200
We spent our life thinking
about something else. The job, us.

568
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,480
But now that I'm gone,

569
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,760
don't stay on you own.

570
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,480
SARA - WOMAN IN THE SHADOWS

571
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,280
