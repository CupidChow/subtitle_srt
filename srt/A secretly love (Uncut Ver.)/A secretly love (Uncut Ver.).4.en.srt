1
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:01,572
I’m sorry

2
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:04,890
We promise then, that we’ll do everything as Sroi wants.

3
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:07,658
Sroi… don’t leave me, please.

4
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:11,742
Is there ever going to be a day when Kon Prod will ask me to love you like this?

5
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,853
I think Sroi might have a new girlfriend now.

6
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:17,391
I pity Jess.

7
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:19,555
Why do you pity me?

8
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:20,877
Hey!!

9
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,039
Your mouth is this big, and you still dare to argue with me?

10
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:28,474
Wait, I’ll make a wound for you.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,363
Oh no, Kon Prod.

12
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:34,698
Tum doesn’t feel well. He can’t sing properly.

13
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:41,026
Alright! Then, why don’t you call Moak to sing earlier, before the time comes?

14
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:43,689
Moak is singing at another place now.

15
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,782
What should we do then?

16
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:50,909
Hey! What’s up, friend? What’s up, twin?

17
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,251
What?!

18
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:53,415
What’s up, twin?

19
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:54,985
Oh, brother,
Help sing first.

20
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:58,194
The twin’s song is out of tune.

21
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:00,185
Are you willing to risk it?

22
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:02,618
It’s a mess. What should we do now?

23
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:09,608
Uh, what about your song? The boy from the alley.

24
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:11,869
This isn’t the time to joke. Are you teasing me?

25
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:15,278
Alright, I’ll shoot. I’ll shoot. If you speak like this, I’ll shoot.

26
00:02:15,278 --> 00:02:16,370
Seeing as there’s no singer.

27
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,213
No, don’t! Don’t let all the guests leave the restaurant. Be good.

28
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:22,148
What about your friends? Here they are.

29
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:24,327
What about your group of friends? The handsome gang.

30
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:25,350
Oh no!

31
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,118
I think there must be someone who has to sing well.

32
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:29,078
Do you believe me?

33
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:29,953
Go help me a bit.

34
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:32,121
Drag everyone onto the stage.

35
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:33,459
What?!
Go! Kon Prod

36
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,497
You believe me, one of them has to sing well.

37
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:37,388
Really?

38
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:40,531
Alright, go! Go now. Help me.
Go, go ahead.

39
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:45,879
This is the time to sing, come on! Go!

40
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,115
Um! I have something I need help with.

41
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:54,036
What’s the matter, Kon Prod?

42
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:56,948
Does anyone in the group know how to sing?

43
00:02:56,948 --> 00:02:58,408
Why do you ask?

44
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:02,968
Don’t tell me you’re going to make us go on stage.

45
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,727
I don’t want that.

46
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:09,222
I’m embarrassed. If I go up there, what will the girls think?

47
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,402
P’Gnaung.

48
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:16,043
Just speaking already makes me embarrassed, I probably won’t take you up to sing.

49
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:19,387
Kon Prod, are you bullying me?

50
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:20,806
Oh no!

51
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,463
And what happened?

52
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:27,955
The singer isn’t feeling well, so he can’t make it.

53
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:31,538
As for the one singing now, we have to go sing elsewhere.

54
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:34,631
What are you saying, Pleum?

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,735
He didn’t ask me.

56
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:42,237
Pleum, even if I don’t go up to sing, there’s still Nick here.

57
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,442
Their voices are equally good.

58
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:47,337
Okay, let me sing.

59
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:50,208
What should I sing?

60
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,602
Casual and relaxed vibes, sir.

61
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:53,861
Let’s do it!

62
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,939
Hey! Wait!

63
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,209
You don’t have to. I’ll do it myself.

64
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:00,932
Oops!

65
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,510
Where’s the guitar?

66
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,350
Do you want me to sing live? And if the guests aren’t interested, and the shop closes, don’t blame me.

67
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,720
Waste of words.

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,240
Where’s the guitar?

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,866
What song do you want me to sing?

70
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:39,399
Any song is fine, as long as people don’t throw stuff at us.

71
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:43,070
But if you can’t think of one, try looking at the notebook in front of you.

72
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,301
Should I sing alone?

73
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:49,840
Let’s just do what you can handle.

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,261
On this night, so dark without stars

75
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:24,819
The path of love seems cold and distant

76
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:30,104
(Where shall we go…)
This is the song we just shared

77
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:38,104
Who will lead me?

78
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:45,337
Until one day, when you came

79
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:52,354
You came to help guide the flickering light

80
00:05:52,354 --> 00:06:04,440
Illuminating the darkness on this starless night

81
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,756
You’re like a dream

82
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:18,113
A beautiful dream in real life

83
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:21,927
You offer a resting love

84
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:26,299
That I can secretly lean on

85
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:31,911
Happiness above all else

86
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:36,251
Like a star above

87
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:39,183
Hey! You! Go get more drinks! Hey!

88
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:39,683
Nick!

89
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:41,747
You here.

90
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:44,759
Oh… I want to drink more.

91
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,696
Hey, man, drink with me. Quickly.

92
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:53,560
Uh… uh…

93
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,417
What should we do now?

94
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,622
I’ll go take him myself.

95
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:03,070
You’ve never had to handle this many before.

96
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,128
Well, you take care of them well.

97
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:09,200
Who’s going to take the drunk guy then?

98
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,845
I’ll go.

99
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:13,345
I have something to do.

100
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:14,793
You go take the drunk guy.

101
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,069
Okay.

102
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:26,840
Oops! Hey! Jate! Nick! Where are you guys going?

103
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,440
Both of you, can stand up now.

104
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,287
Hey!

105
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:38,924
Hey!

106
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,040
How come you can just sleep here?

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,978
Let’s go drink.

108
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:51,836
Over there.

109
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,479
Take it easy, walk slowly.

110
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,455
I’m sleepy, sir.

111
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,396
I have something to disturb you a bit, sir.

112
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:26,285
Don’t tell me you’re going to withdraw money from me again, right?

113
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:28,522
Yes, sir.

114
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,354
Sir Pleum.

115
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:33,808
Last month you withdrew, but you haven’t finished using up my debt.

116
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:36,159
And now this month you want to withdraw again?

117
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,938
Hey! If you keep acting like this, you need to plan your finances better, sir.

118
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,448
If you keep doing this every month, you’ll be in trouble, and you’ll become accustomed to it.

119
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:47,427
I won’t let you withdraw.

120
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,025
Don’t think I’m heartless.

121
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,145
So you can improve yourself.

122
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:54,400
Go home.

123
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
Go.

124
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:27,586
P’Nan, P’Nan

125
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:36,275
Oops!

126
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,791
Pleum, here.

127
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,263
Is this your house?

128
00:09:49,263 --> 00:09:52,721
What are you doing around here?

129
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:55,214
Don’t have to get involved in my affairs.

130
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:56,209
Go inside.

131
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,324
Sure!

132
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:02,984
Or maybe he knows that this is P’Soi’s house.

133
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,841
What the hell?

134
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:14,261
What the hell?

135
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:15,771
Don’t complain about me.

136
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:18,171
No, sir.

137
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:21,920
Why are you standing stubbornly? Go inside.

138
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,800
Huh?

139
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,846
Home? Our home? What’s going on?

140
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:32,389
Kon Prod have you returned home, son?

141
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:34,916
And who brought you here?

142
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:38,978
Oh, I didn’t come to be escorted, Mom. I came by myself.

143
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:40,820
But I met him in front of the house.

144
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,720
His name is Pleum. He’s a senior from university.

145
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,084
Hello, ma'am.

146
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:54,203
Oops! And you were standing outside talking to the front of the house for what?

147
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:56,017
Come inside and talk, dear.

148
00:10:56,017 --> 00:10:57,151
Please come in.

149
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:02,403
Do you want something to eat, ma'am?
I’m very hungry.

150
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:05,760
We have some boiled rice parcels.

151
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:28,829
Oh.

152
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:31,296
If you’re hungry, eat the boiled rice parcels to fill your stomach first, son.

153
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:32,823
Mother’s craftsmanship.

154
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:35,635
Thank you, Mom.

155
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:38,533
Mom, go rest now. Don’t worry.

156
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,003
I’ll take care of him myself.

157
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:42,959
Take it easy, dear.

158
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,113
I’m asking for real.

159
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:48,801
Why did you follow me?

160
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:50,929
Do you know whose house this is around here?

161
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:53,518
I don’t know anyone around here.

162
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:55,335
Sure.

163
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:56,901
Definitely.

164
00:11:56,901 --> 00:12:00,959
The reason I followed you here is because I wanted to ask about something.

165
00:12:02,977 --> 00:12:03,838
About what?

166
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,590
About… P’Sroi

167
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,908
You said you didn’t know anyone around here.

168
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:16,972
I don’t know anyone around here, but I said I followed you because I wanted to ask you about P’Sroi.

169
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:21,600
So, I’m saying that’s why I’m here.

170
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,735
I see you talking to P’Sroi .

171
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:31,133
You must be close. How close are you?

172
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,913
He’s a university senior.

173
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:35,371
He’s a customer at the shop.

174
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:37,964
What’s the matter?

175
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:39,282
Lies.

176
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:42,094
Someone like me, I know P’Sroi well.

177
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,387
P’Sroi doesn’t easily talk to guys.

178
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:46,729
Like you, you must have known each other for a long time.

179
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,199
Accidentally, you know each other longer than I do.

180
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:53,028
Uh, okay.

181
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:57,585
That’s right. P’Sroi’s house is opposite mine.

182
00:12:57,585 --> 00:13:00,839
Quite close to each other.

183
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,880
In that case, you must understand, right, sir?

184
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,143
Um, then that’s fine.

185
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:17,353
Then I’ll order you to investigate P’Sroi’s relationship with Froy, whether they’re really dating or not.

186
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:20,175
Or if it’s just a trick to deceive me.

187
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,936
Uh, okay.

188
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:26,603
And do you have anything else?

189
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,521
No, sir.

190
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,800
Hmm, then, eat up. It’ll calm your nerves for now.

191
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,489
Ugh!

192
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:42,835
You’re not going to help at all, huh?

193
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:46,920
This is your house, not mine.

194
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,480
Hey! That’s P’Sroi’s house.

195
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,330
Um, thank you.

196
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,647
Later on, I won’t mistakenly come to the wrong house.

197
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:03,399
And why is that?

198
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,794
Can’t I come to your house?

199
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:10,025
Sure, sir. I didn’t say anything like that.

200
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,912
That’s good.

201
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:16,378
I’ll come by more often. See you later.

202
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:24,770
He’s another problem of his own.

203
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,412
What’s wrong with you?

204
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,000
Been stressed since morning.

205
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,979
I want to sell this house.

206
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:40,687
What?!

207
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:41,985
Sell the house?

208
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:43,557
Why would you sell the house?

209
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:45,066
Isn’t it your father’s property?

210
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:47,790
I need money.

211
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,769
For medicine, doctor fees, your mother’s things, right?

212
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:57,414
I asked to withdraw from P’Gnaung, but he won’t allow it.

213
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,082
Think about it, this is your father’s property.

214
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:01,934
Okay.

215
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:02,434
Do you need help?

216
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:03,819
Please, the teacher is calling.

217
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:08,405
Hello, sir.

218
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:09,557
Hello.

219
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:11,340
What’s up?

220
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,547
Regarding the volunteer camp.

221
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:16,279
Go.

222
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:18,814
Go, the teacher is waiting.

223
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:24,716
Darn it, there’s stress every day.

224
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,317
Hey! You’re always like this.

225
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:32,409
Hey, you!

226
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,595
Hello, sir.

227
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:36,120
Hey, go with Jess, sir.

228
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,980
Jess?

229
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,990
Where are we going?

230
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,228
To talk about the volunteer camp, sir. Do you have anything?

231
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,399
Oh! What’s this?

232
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,385
What is it to him?

233
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:55,397
I don’t know. Why didn’t you ask him earlier? Why ask me? I’m not his girlfriend.

234
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:58,795
Hey! I just asked once. You’re giving me a long answer.

235
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:05,521
Hey! But I noticed that the milk he’s holding looks like what’s in the prod’s bag. Did he steal it?

236
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:08,694
Or did he steal the prod’s stuff?

237
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,750
3 boxes, tsk tsk (humorous tone).

238
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,751
We need to insert an R character

239
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:13,408
Uh.

240
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,073
Okay.

241
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:16,042
Here.

242
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,953
All set.

243
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,075
Okay, don’t forget to send the file to our email.

244
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:25,193
I won’t forget. But can I send my heart first?

245
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,571
Where’s this email?

246
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:33,480
Right here.

247
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,182
Hello, Sroi.

248
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:38,356
I’m Win from the Architecture Department.

249
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:41,704
I have a bear cub to introduce.

250
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:47,157
Thanks on behalf of Sroi, but you don’t need to later.

251
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,751
Remember, don’t mess with someone else’s girlfriend.

252
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:58,038
Understand?

253
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,488
It’s too much, Froy.

254
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:10,421
Oh! Sroi! We have to play our roles as lovers a bit, you know. (Froy speaks)

255
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:15,343
Just watch. Tomorrow, everyone at the university will be gossiping about us, so I need to act annoyed.

256
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:20,400
And everyone has to understand that we’re really together, right?

257
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,330
Gee!

258
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:32,120
Here, teacher.

259
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,712
There’s a school that wants us to help teach and renovate buildings and places.

260
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:41,791
and renovate buildings and places.

261
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,425
I think it would be better if we went to do activities and then came back.

262
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,851
I think it’s a good idea

263
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:53,508
because teachers haven’t seen students doing this kind of activity in a while.

264
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,120
The important thing is, students these days prefer to travel.

265
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,539
But I’m worried if the younger students will join this activity or not.

266
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,311
Because nowadays, kids these days prefer to travel rather than do anything difficult.

267
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:10,020
But I believe that our students are united in one heart.

268
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,423
And another thing, going to this volunteer camp will provide activities for our first-year students to enjoy together.

269
00:19:15,423 --> 00:19:18,030
I guarantee that it’s definitely not dangerous, teacher.

270
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:25,574
Okay, if that’s the case, try summarizing the details of the project for me again.

271
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:30,134
And if it passes, how should I present it to the dean?

272
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:31,482
Thank you very much, teacher.

273
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:31,982
Sure.

274
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:35,330
Jess, what’s up? Prepair Freshy night?

275
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,722
You haven’t updated the teacher yet.

276
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:43,058
We’ve prepared some things for the fourth year. This year, my friends and I will be performing inside the event.

277
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:48,240
And Pleum will play the guitar too.

278
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,222
I have something to talk to Kon Prod.

279
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,228
Speak up then.

280
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:24,039
It’s personal. Go to class first.

281
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,199
Do you have something with me?

282
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:33,581
I’ll pay you to do something for me.

283
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:38,114
What payment? I’ve never taken a job from you before.

284
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:42,596
I told you to investigate Sroi and Froy.

285
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:45,320
Take it.

286
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,342
What’s up, Mom?

287
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:25,789
Oh, really?

288
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,745
Sroi wants to eat, so it’s perfect.

289
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:32,704
Um, then Sroi will go back to sleep at home tonight.

290
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:34,674
I will help make food with Aunt' Par too.

291
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:38,240
Okay, see you then.

292
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,276
Tonight, we’re going back home.

293
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:44,986
Oh, really? Then let’s go and pick them up.

294
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:48,931
It’s okay. I thought I’d go buy something for Mom too.

295
00:21:48,931 --> 00:21:51,380
It’s better for Froy to go back to sleep in the apartment.

296
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,388
Is that so?

297
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:55,840
Then I'm leaving.

298
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,178
Today, Mom has a lot of helpers.

299
00:22:28,178 --> 00:22:32,872
Mom has a lot of orders to fulfill.

300
00:22:32,872 --> 00:22:37,440
I told Mom not to work so hard.

301
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:42,109
Aunt and Sroi came to help too.

302
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:46,152
Mom’s sweets, everyone compliments them, and they want more.

303
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:56,162
I came to help is because there’s payment in pastries. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come.

304
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:58,898
Um… P'sroi.

305
00:22:58,898 --> 00:23:02,364
I have something I want to talk to you about.

306
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:03,411
Outside.

307
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:08,313
I’ll be right there.

308
00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:09,666
Yes.

309
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,722
Well, if it’s about Jess, I’m not talking.

310
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:32,358
It doesn’t matter.

311
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:35,209
Anyway.

312
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:39,646
Tum suspects something about Pleum and Froy.

313
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:40,653
If they’re really dating.

314
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:47,261
Pleum prefers not to get involved in this matter. It’s his private affair.

315
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:51,234
I’m sorry.

316
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,518
Sroi

317
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:59,524
Please, what’s this?

318
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:04,638
Um… I don’t know.

319
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:07,120
You don’t know. What do you mean?

320
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,799
I really don’t know.

321
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,080
Pleum, excuse me. I’ll go first.

322
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,960
Don’t follow her now.

323
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,600
Wait, it warms up first.

324
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,704
Mom, Sroi will go back to my apartment tonight.

325
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,664
Oh, who said he’s going to sleep at home?

326
00:24:34,664 --> 00:24:38,191
I just remembered he has a submission to his professor tomorrow morning.

327
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:40,076
I'm leaving, Mom.

328
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:42,203
Hello, Prapa.

329
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:42,703
Yes.

330
00:24:42,703 --> 00:24:46,444
Please, take these pastries tomorrow.

331
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:50,788
It’s okay. Sroi can come back to eat at home later.

332
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:51,387
Yes.

333
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:59,988
Kids these days. Coming and going.

334
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,800
There must be real work to do.

335
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,738
And the house is far from the university.

336
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:10,218
I feel sorry for Prapa too.

337
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:14,509
Don’t worry too much. He wants to be close to Mom.

338
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:20,440
I myself still want Suea to be close by.

339
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,121
So what did you talk about?

340
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:30,477
Why did you ask me to find out about Sroi and Froy?

341
00:25:30,477 --> 00:25:34,717
I asked you to investigate, not to ask directly.

342
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:37,996
Do you understand the word “investigate”?

343
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,014
Understood.

344
00:25:40,014 --> 00:25:42,352
So what did you do?

345
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:43,464
Asked.

346
00:25:45,871 --> 00:25:49,159
Asked and got what?

347
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,803
And why did Pleum come here?

348
00:25:56,803 --> 00:25:59,960
To find Sroi?

349
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,320
About that much.

350
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,807
I apologize for making Sroi angry.

351
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:12,827
It’s okay.

352
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,439
If so, I’ll go change clothes first. I have to hurry to work.

353
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,920
Wait.

354
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,396
I’ll take you to work.

355
00:26:23,396 --> 00:26:24,311
Huh!

356
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:27,754
I’ll take you.

357
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,862
It’s okay. I’ll take the bus myself.

358
00:26:31,862 --> 00:26:34,024
Don’t be stubborn.

359
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:40,594
Hurry up!  and change your clothes, you’ll be late.

360
00:26:40,906 --> 00:26:42,291
Go on.

361
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,562
Have you ever been in a relationship?

362
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:43,026
Is this a question for me?

363
00:27:44,942 --> 00:27:51,409
Sitting here with two people,
if you don’t answer, who will?

364
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,039
Never or just not saying?

365
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,125
Never, sir.

366
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:04,115
Because I’ve been attached to feelings for certain people.

367
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:09,302
I secretly liked her for so long that there’s no room for anyone else but her.

368
00:28:09,302 --> 00:28:14,608
And why didn’t you speak up?

369
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:16,613
I kept it in my heart for…?

370
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:25,919
I’m afraid of getting hurt, and besides, she probably doesn’t like me either.

371
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,720
And if you don’t tell her, how do you know she doesn’t like you? Huh?

372
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,399
If you tell her, maybe there’s hope.

373
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:50,000
I did tell her once, sir. But I found that sometimes seeing her happy with someone she likes might be better.

374
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,204
At least we’ve seen her smile with someone she loves.

375
00:28:55,204 --> 00:29:00,110
And we smile when we see her happy.

376
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,710
Hmm

377
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,772
You’re like a child in a lavender field.

378
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:08,737
And you don’t feel any pain?

379
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:12,697
I’ve accepted it, sir.

380
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:18,269
It’s a feeling that comes from myself, and I have to accept it.

381
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:23,411
She never asked me to feel this way.

382
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,000
If I speak out, she might accept it.

383
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:38,840
I’m afraid to speak out.

384
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,000
And how many years have you liked her?

385
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,919
7 years, sir.

386
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,418
7 years.

387
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:55,824
You’ve endured it for 7 years.

388
00:29:55,824 --> 00:30:00,480
She must be very beautiful.

389
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,383
Hmm…

390
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:15,432
Sometimes, I don’t even know if I’m suited for love at all.

391
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:19,350
Or maybe I’m not suited for love at all.

392
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,299
No one is not suited for love.

393
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,949
Huh…

394
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:31,200
But we’re all different in finding love that suits us.

395
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:38,360
Is this love advice from me?

396
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,460
Go on.

397
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,509
I have a teddy bear to give you

398
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:17,840
Thanks, but you don’t have to do this again next time, Sroi.

399
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,009
Just remember not to meddle with other people’s partners.

400
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,064
You understand?

401
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,080
It’s will be far, Froy.

402
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:41,639
Maybe we’re just too attached

403
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,129
Sorry, Sroi.

404
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:54,791
We didn’t mean to, it’s just the mood led us.

405
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,499
Hey

406
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:06,545
Who said we were staying home?

407
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,713
Don’t want to sleep, huh? Too lazy to wake up early?

408
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,228
Oh really?

409
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:27,451
You probably still haven’t gotten over it.

410
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:56,930
You can go back now, brother. You’re wearing a student uniform; it’s not suitable for the store.

411
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,559
May I have the menu, please?

412
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,758
Prod !

413
00:33:39,758 --> 00:33:41,203
Prod!

414
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:44,204
The customer requests a menu, didn’t you hear?

415
00:33:44,204 --> 00:33:45,396
Here you go.

416
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:46,808
Give me the menu.

417
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:48,781
I heard you.

418
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,700
Oops!

419
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,166
Hey!

420
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,786
No, no, no.

421
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:57,959
Go take care of the customer; we’ll handle this ourselves.

422
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,275
Then we’ll leave this here.

423
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,898
Watch out!

424
00:34:01,898 --> 00:34:05,802
You might get hurt like that.

425
00:34:09,176 --> 00:34:14,679
My lips haven’t even healed yet, and you’re adding more trouble.

426
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,837
Go get a broom to sweep.

427
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:22,078
Why use your hands?

428
00:34:22,078 --> 00:34:24,480
I thought it was a big piece, so…

429
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,331
I wasn’t careful at all.

430
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:29,362
Go get a broom to sweep.

431
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:31,767
Go on.

432
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:39,568
Come on… it’s time to go home, brother.

433
00:36:39,568 --> 00:36:42,300
Oh, this is the sign of the store owner being sleepy.

434
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:49,656
Oh! Who comes must have…
Alright, alright, go home, kiddo, go home.

435
00:36:49,656 --> 00:36:51,260
Be early for work tomorrow.

436
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,992
Um, be quick, kiddo.

437
00:36:53,393 --> 00:36:54,918
Go.

438
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,548
Brother’s sleepy.

439
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,279
I’ll go back first, brother.

440
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:00,878
Okay, go home, kiddo.

441
00:37:00,878 --> 00:37:03,199
I’ll wait here to settle the store’s accounts first.

442
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:03,699
Okay.

443
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:04,199
Go home, okay?

444
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,089
Goodbye.

445
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:08,026
Thanks, don’t be late tomorrow.

446
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:14,000
What time are you going back?

447
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Um…

448
00:37:23,802 --> 00:37:26,008
Oh!

449
00:37:30,643 --> 00:37:31,440
Here.

450
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:40,490
Um…

451
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,811
Don’t stay up late like this. Your manager won’t like it.

452
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:49,616
And why haven’t you gone back yet?

453
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:52,026
If you go back, you won’t see me here.

454
00:37:52,026 --> 00:37:53,401
Go, get in the car.

455
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:58,920
You’re waiting for me

456
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,599
We've arrived, get off.

457
00:38:38,911 --> 00:38:40,975
Prod

458
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,718
Prod

459
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:48,599
Hey, wake up, Prod.

460
00:38:58,105 --> 00:39:05,025
Come here, you good sleeper.

461
00:39:15,482 --> 00:39:18,050
Prod.

462
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:21,241
Are you trying to trick me?

463
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,440
Oh! I’m boiling with anger again.

464
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,319
How many years have you been sleeping like this?

465
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:58,675
Come here, good sleeper. What kind of deep sleep is this?

466
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:01,136
Oh!

467
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:09,720
You sleep so comfortably.

468
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,418
Don’t even think about waking up, thanks to me, right?

469
00:40:52,418 --> 00:40:58,319
I volunteered to carry you, darn it.

470
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,760
Pleum.

471
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,520
Feeling better now? What happened?

472
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,828
Looking through your phone, what’s so fun?

473
00:41:56,828 --> 00:41:59,189
Real things are better than staring at screens.

474
00:41:59,189 --> 00:42:01,616
Is that an invitation?

475
00:42:01,616 --> 00:42:05,372
Your opportunity has come.
Hurry up and increase your score.

476
00:42:05,372 --> 00:42:07,322
Don’t come at me like that.

477
00:42:07,322 --> 00:42:10,812
And why are you here?

478
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:12,321
And why are you here?

479
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,815
I’m here to pick you up for college, remember?

480
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:19,225
Oh, let’s eat together.

481
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:24,416
It’s okay,  You eat.
