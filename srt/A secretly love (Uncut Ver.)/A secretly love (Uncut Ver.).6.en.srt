1
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,160
It's not fun to watch on a mobile phone.

2
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,876
It's much better to look at the real thing.

3
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:07,974
Are you inviting me?

4
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:11,814
Your chance has come. Hurry and grab it.

5
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:12,867
Don't you tease me.

6
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:16,640
Why are you here?

7
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,293
So why are you here too?

8
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:20,833
I'm coming to take Prod to university together.

9
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:25,176
Ah! eat together

10
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:30,149
It's okay. I'll eat it.

11
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:37,920
Didn't you just tune this guitar? Why do you have to re-tune?

12
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,880
Why do you tune the sound?

13
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,978
Why! What's the problem?

14
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:52,425
I don't have a problem. You're the one with the problem.

15
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:55,741
You're going to take this, right?

16
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,572
Come on.

17
00:01:57,572 --> 00:02:02,070
Hey hey Prod, dear friend, we're going to study together.

18
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,283
Twin came at just the right time.

19
00:02:06,283 --> 00:02:11,599
Prod , hurry up and go to class, or you'll be late. Hm!

20
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,480
Hm

21
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:16,720
Yes, yes.

22
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,609
The train crashed.

23
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:20,762
Huh!

24
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:22,037
fast
go

25
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:23,748
Go.

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,434
What happened?

27
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,616
I do not know

28
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:55,830
You don't know, and who knows?

29
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,958
P'Pleum and P'Jess arguing.

30
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:02,292
That's it, I don't know what happened.

31
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:06,710
When I entered the room He forced me to eat with him.

32
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,973
He fed me And forced me to feed him too.

33
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:14,865
What are you guys?

34
00:03:14,865 --> 00:03:17,741
I think it's strange.

35
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:22,878
But I think P'Pleum should be teasing P'Jess.

36
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,400
Why was he teasing P'Jess ?

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,635
I do not know

38
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,760
oh

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,159
I'm sure you don't think like me (Heh heh)

40
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,959
What's theirs?

41
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,120
Oh! I thought she was going to be late.

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,960
Whether near or far, we are always punctual.

43
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,795
Uh... Aunt Wan, how are you? How are you?

44
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,476
Holiday that you will stop by to visit.

45
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:21,759
Fine, selling things is a little chaotic.
Let's go study.

46
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,479
You guys are 3rd year seniors.

47
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,564
I'm already a senior. But he acted inappropriately as a senior.

48
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:47,400
Having to let 4 year olds like me come and scold you like this. Aren't you tired?

49
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm tired.

50
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,440
You all line up.

51
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,775
Why do you always have to make people wait?

52
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:09,520
After this, don't be late again. Got it ?

53
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,968
( Yes/Yes) Yes, I understand.

54
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:23,058
I called everyone today. Because I want everyone to see the club room.

55
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:28,022
How do you guys take responsibility? Why?
Dirty like this

56
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:33,876
We share cleaning duties every day.

57
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:42,754
You look, the floor is full of dust and clutter. Use it and don't know how to put it away.

58
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:53,136
You guys tell me. What should I do with you?
Tell me!

59
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:06,280
good!
If you guys don't give me an answer, I ask for permission.
Let's order now.

60
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,400
Kon Prod, you are responsible for cleaning this room.

61
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,127
Get it clean today.

62
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:20,960
Pleum Today is someone's duty, let him do it.

63
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,984
What are your duties?

64
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:31,560
I am the boss Whose duty is it?

65
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,792
Take orders

66
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,145
Take orders

67
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,775
Receive orders.

68
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,039
No problem, I'll help you clean it up.

69
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,305
This is not your duty. Don't interfere.

70
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,939
It's not my job, but I have kindness.

71
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,723
You guys took Jess home.

72
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:10,584
I'll just watch Kon Prod clean it up.

73
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:13,001
Don't you dare impose power on me, Pleum .

74
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:17,922
your actions will cause your younger sibling trouble

75
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:21,907
You know, don't you? What burdens do you have?

76
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:27,573
Oh, I forgot.

77
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:36,365
People like you are never in trouble. So I can't sympathize with other people.

78
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:39,087
You see, the battle for masters.

79
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:42,062
Oh, I'm watching.

80
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:47,600
But this is an order.

81
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,290
Pleum, why are you being so stubborn?

82
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,255
Whose work queue is today? They divided the duties together to do it.

83
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:00,000
We can go our separate ways.

84
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,867
go

85
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,867
You can go now.

86
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:05,367
fast

87
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,999
I'll be back with you today.

88
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:13,758
We'll go to work together now.

89
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:16,759
What work do you do?

90
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,846
I'm a new employee at P'Guang.

91
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:24,960
I'm going to have to let the Pro teach me a lot.

92
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,810
Let's go. Let's go.

93
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:32,092
yes

94
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,442
I thought so.

95
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,880
So what should I do?

96
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,467
Prod ! Prod!

97
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,289
Come here first.

98
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:22,062
yes

99
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,161
Please watch over the counter for me. I'll come and I'll have a stomach ache.
Fast (Yes)

100
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:31,360
Leave it to me.
( Yes, sir.)

101
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,703
Do you get anything more?

102
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:42,402
Take a glass of this.

103
00:09:42,402 --> 00:09:44,839
okay

104
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,881
And why did P' Froi come alone?

105
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:08,391
Where did P'Sroi go?

106
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:10,343
Sroi has returned to his home.

107
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,863
Prod, don't you know?

108
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:15,895
Oh, I'm just busy. So I didn't care.

109
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:18,673
Why did P'Sroi go back to his house?

110
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:20,703
He must be bored with you.

111
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:26,623
I'm bored. Two of you are lovers. Why do you have to be bored with each other?

112
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:30,929
What kind of boyfriend are you? You're all lying.

113
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:39,006
Why do you have to lie? Two women are.
My boyfriend doesn't see any damage at all.

114
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:45,657
It's cute. I think that love these days shouldn't be divided between genders.

115
00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:49,819
To discourage your seniors.

116
00:10:49,819 --> 00:11:00,600
really sincere with Sroi , but Sroi probably only thinks of you as a friend.

117
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,506
Charge it now.

118
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,814
Yes, yes.

119
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,768
No need to change.

120
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,344
thank you very much

121
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,939
Is there something wrong? Kon Prod

122
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:35,615
There's nothing.

123
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:37,875
P'Froi just sits and drinks to relieve his loneliness.

124
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:44,739
oh ! What about Sroi ? Every time I see him stuck together all the time.

125
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:47,739
I don't know.

126
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,167
Ouch! What will Mom do?

127
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:18,782
It happened that Mom was going to deliver it to P'Sroi because Aunt Wan was very busy and couldn't come pick it up herself.

128
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:22,118
nevermind I'll take it to you myself.

129
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:23,077
yes

130
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,400
Stay still, Mom.

131
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,927
Thank you, son.

132
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:31,654
Sroi

133
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:36,937
I'm asking directly.

134
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:43,360
two of us have a chance to get back together like before?

135
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,873
I've said it all, Pleum.
Let us go.

136
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:54,301
the story about you and Froi true?

137
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:57,697
I say you don't bother me with Froi .

138
00:12:57,697 --> 00:13:02,568
Even if I'm not his girlfriend I won't go back to you.

139
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:08,214
Let's be honest.
I don't love you anymore Please take my mind off me.

140
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,548
oh! Prod!

141
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,959
I'm about to go take things from your house.

142
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,978
Sroi

143
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,570
P'Pleum needn't worry about P'Sroi.

144
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,496
I'll help you talk for you.

145
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,040
Don't be busy.

146
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,267
What is wrong with him?

147
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,405
Look, what's wrong with you? Why are you making that face?

148
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:10,507
Just now I met P'Pleum in front of P'Sroi's house .

149
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:12,653
oh...

150
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:16,764
What are you looking at?

151
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:19,258
oh! Mom was looking for P'Pleum .

152
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:20,628
Why didn't he come in?

153
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,440
He's gone back.

154
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:31,040
he returned
That means he came to see P'Sroi , not to see his son.

155
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,639
two brothers used to date each other.

156
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:40,423
We were in a relationship, which means we broke up.

157
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:49,680
P'Sroi will definitely quit, but P'Pleum I'm not sure at all.

158
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,353
Hello, mother.

159
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,514
hello

160
00:14:55,514 --> 00:15:00,564
Hey P'Jess, how did you get into the house?

161
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:03,160
The gate was open.

162
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,575
I guess I forgot to turn it off.

163
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:08,558
yes

164
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:14,471
Mother, may I please take Kon Prod outside today?

165
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:18,351
If there's anything to talk about, feel free. Mom, please excuse me.

166
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,674
Thank you, mother.

167
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:02,880
Sroi, I'm honestly asking, will the two of us have a chance to come back to the way we were before?

168
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,669
I've said it all, Pleum.

169
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,346
Let us go.

170
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:14,827
the story about her and Froi true?

171
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,251
Sroi

172
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:46,079
P'Pleum, don't worry about P'Sroi .
I'll help you talk for you.

173
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,239
Don't be busy.

174
00:16:54,987 --> 00:17:03,646
What the hell am I doing?

175
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,624
In conclusion... Do you have something to discuss with me?

176
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:15,856
Well, this is my business.

177
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:21,317
It's a holiday. I want Prod to be able to relax a bit.

178

I am happy every day.

181
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:38,823
I don't think forcing your own feelings is a good thing.

182
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:41,135
I really mean it.

183
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:44,951
What I'm doing today I'm really happy

184
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:49,616
I can accept it.
Today we will go to work together.

185
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:54,117
I'm considerate.
nevermind I'll go myself.

186
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:56,840
up to you

187
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,667

excuse me

190
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:13,879
No problem. No problem. No problem. Customer.

191
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:14,898
Jess

192
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:16,377
nevermind I'll close the glass again. It's okay.

193
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:17,633
Jess, come here.

194
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:18,133
Yes, sir.

195
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,814
Come pick up a glass.

196
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:20,679
yes

197
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,345

198
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:25,039
It's okay. It's okay.
Jess, take care.

199
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,948
Okay, okay, I'll give you a new glass.

200
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:32,050
Ouch!

201
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,560
As you please.

202
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,628
Is something a big deal wrong?

203
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:47,280
a little

204
00:18:51,760 --> 00:19:00,720
Well...I'll go get a broom and sweep it for you.
yes

205
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,500
Thank you.

206
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,179
nevermind

207
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,280
If P'Jess can't take it, you can ask P'Guang to come home first.

208
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,760
Just this, far from my heart

209
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,642
I won't go back first.
I'm waiting to take Kon Prod home together.

210
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,764
Well... I guess you don't have to wait for me.

211
00:20:12,764 --> 00:20:19,546
P'Jess also has a sore finger. If your finger hurts
Don't forget to take painkillers as well.

212
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:26,440
Whoever becomes a fan of Kon Prod will love their favorite one very much.

213
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:40,120
There probably won't be that day.
Because I still don't think I'll have anyone.

214
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:54,559
It's so good, how could it not have an owner?

215
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,243
Because I already have someone in mind.

216
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:01,155
Huh?

217
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:19,211
I already have someone I like.
I don't want to look at other people.

218
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:23,734
I didn't know that Prod already had someone he liked.

219
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:30,520
I've never told anyone. besides close friends

220
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,636
Who will be that lucky person?

221
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:44,424
Maybe he knew, but maybe he didn't see it. It can be good luck.

222
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:49,172
Because he...

223
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:50,413
Because of what?

224
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:55,297
Because he already has someone he likes.

225
00:21:55,297 --> 00:22:02,320
Prod, don't you want to let him know that you like him?

226
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,600
I used to.
But I abandoned that idea a long time ago.

227
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,159
Moreover, I am satisfied with my position.
this

228
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:22,400
Will there be a chance? that I will go in place of that person

229
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,324
P'Jess

230
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:30,520
I'm just kidding.

231
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,820
I just feel sorry for that person.
He missed such a good person.

232
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,723
like

233
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:50,240
Um...well...I think we'd better get to work.

234
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,640
Kon Prod 's favorite person, that would be great.

235
00:23:10,673 --> 00:23:12,272
Prod

236
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:17,881
P'Pleum, why did you come?

237
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,505
I'm going to apologize.

238
00:23:21,505 --> 00:23:27,279
Oh...if you'll excuse me, P'Sroi.
I think...you'd better come tomorrow.

239
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,695
I'm going to apologize to you. who said something bad this morning

240
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:36,537
I don't mind anything. You can rest easy.

241
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:43,104
Uh...I think it's late now. Please come home.

242
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:47,556
I don't want to stay home alone. Can I sleep here?

243
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,607
but....

244
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:51,494
Aunt Pa has given permission.

245
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,600
thank you

246
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,200
okay

247
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,095
Prod

248
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,392
Eat.

249
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:27,657
I've been working so hard. There will be something to take care of.

250
00:24:27,657 --> 00:24:31,111
thank you

251
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:35,226
Eat it now.

252
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:04,770
I'm going to take a shower first.

253
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,080
P'Pleum If you're going to take a shower...

254
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,640
Go to sleep already.

255
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,480
P'Pleum

256
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,211
P'Pleum

257
00:28:48,182 --> 00:28:50,845
I'm sleepwalking.

258
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:19,033
Umm...

259
00:29:32,756 --> 00:29:35,399

260
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,200
What's going on? Call me early in the morning.

261
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,875
There we go, our friend is in love.

262

00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:03,989
Jess

264
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:06,361
Jess reveals her boyfriend?

265
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:07,873
who

266
00:31:07,873 --> 00:31:11,472
You take a look at Jess ' IG and you'll be shocked.

267
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:15,989
Well...I'll go take a look.
That's it.

268
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:11,518
Mom

269
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:12,117
Huh...

270
00:32:12,117 --> 00:32:13,107
Have you seen P'Pleum ?

271
00:32:13,107 --> 00:32:16,561
Oh...he stayed here last night?

272
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,756
Uh...yes. He asked to stay here.

273
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:24,880
I don't see it at all.
This morning, mother woke up and saw no one.

274
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:41,960
P'Pleum 's car wasn't there, he must have gone home.

275
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,359
P'Pleum Sir, would you like to be P'Pleum 's favorite ?

276
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,911
Jess

277
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,503
What's up?

278
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:50,760
I saw that I was injured. So I'm going to ask if it's a big deal.

279
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,264
It's not a big deal. It'll be gone soon.

280
00:34:55,264 --> 00:34:59,640
Who hurt you?

281
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:07,160
Who else but Kon Prod ?

282
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,851
I want to ask you something.

283
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:14,527
What are you so interested in that kid?

284
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:18,253
Why, why can't I care?

285
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:22,751
So what are you involved with?

286
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:29,458
You're just paying attention to that kid. You don't think about how other siblings will view you.

287
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:34,427
No matter how you look at it But I don't care

288
00:35:34,427 --> 00:35:38,440
You have 2 standards.

289
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,572
It's more of a different standard.

290
00:35:44,572 --> 00:35:47,492
So how is it different from 2 standards ?

291
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:59,640
Kon Prod is my favorite.
As for the other juniors, just general juniors.

292
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,255
I'm telling you first.

293
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:07,663
I will try my best to win your younger sister's heart.

294
00:36:07,663 --> 00:36:15,119
Then I will take someone's place.
You've been watching.

295
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,599
I've secretly liked him for so long that there's no room left for him.
Who but him?

296
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:29,780
Pleum

297
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,613
Hey! Pleum.

298
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:42,599
You already know this. You can stop pestering your younger sibling. Consider it a friend's request.

299
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,179
Are you sure?

300
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:48,626
Yes! I'm sure

301
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:54,510
Thank you for understanding.

302
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,560
Sroi, is there something wrong with making an appointment with us?

303
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,501
Yesterday Pleum came to visit us at our house.

304
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:21,857
Huh, hasn't he stopped chasing Kai yet?

305
00:37:21,857 --> 00:37:23,422
Do you want us to take care of it for you?

306
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:27,122
No need, the two of us have already cleared things up.

307
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:29,164
Don't tell me that we've gotten back together.

308
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:34,352
no! Quit is quit. But he won't come to bother you.
with us again

309
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:40,589
Oh, that's good, now you don't have to stress anymore.

310
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:45,289
Then it's time to cancel the matter between the two of us.

311
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:47,804
About what?

312
00:37:47,804 --> 00:37:51,375
What about pretending to be your girlfriend?

313
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:57,615
When someone comes in to flirt with you, you will feel comfortable, not uncomfortable.

314
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,593
Do you want that?

315
00:38:07,004 --> 00:38:08,903
okay

316
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:15,429
For your comfort
I'd like to move out of the room.

317
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:20,257
When someone comes to see us There will be no need to be considerate of each other.

318
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:27,301
Froi

319
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:46,377
I'm the first to tell you.

320
00:38:46,377 --> 00:38:55,000
I will try my best to win your younger sister's heart.
Then I will take someone's place.

321
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,440
You've been watching.

322
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,000
Why do I have to think about him?

323
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,560
Pleum , what's wrong? I've seen you sitting blankly since morning.

324
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,935
Uh...who's confused?

325
00:39:33,935 --> 00:39:38,911
Khun Pleum , I see you with my own two eyes .
You're sitting blankly.

326
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:40,556
You don't have to make excuses.

327
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:43,235
Or are you thinking about Sroi ?

328
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:48,336
I'm thinking about Jess.

329
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:53,240
Jess, Jess, what's the matter?

330
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,256
It's abnormal.

331
00:39:56,256 --> 00:39:58,908
If you have a story, tell it.

332
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:07,314
Jess go?

333
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:13,720
Khun Jess goes to talk with the teacher. About Fresh Night

334
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,943
Jess says she likes Prod .

335
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:20,562
Huh?

336
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:21,088
Huh?

337
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,023
Huh?

338
00:40:22,023 --> 00:40:24,948
Jess really say that?

339
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:28,204
Pleum probably wasn't joking.

340
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:31,666
But I'm glad about it.

341
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,994
What are you happy about?

342
00:40:33,994 --> 00:40:37,108
Hey, I want to see my friend have a boyfriend.

343
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:44,861
I think maybe it's just that I feel sorry for Prod , so I thought I liked Prod , that's all.

344
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:45,714
I think...

345
00:40:45,714 --> 00:40:52,098
Pleum
And Jess , what do you think? Please tell me.

346
00:40:52,098 --> 00:41:02,480
The story you told me Regarding the plaster that was posted on IG , so I went to ask.

347
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:12,000
Jess says Prod already has someone in mind.

348
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,680
Jess wants to win the Prod's heart. She wants to replace that person .

349
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,783
Oh, the mission is very difficult.

350
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:28,728
Jess wants to know who is the enemy in his heart.

351
00:41:28,728 --> 00:41:37,789

00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:47,324
At least it will help make it come true.

354
00:41:47,324 --> 00:41:49,229
It's a high-pitched voice.

00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:50,903

356
00:41:50,903 --> 00:41:54,680
Chai , so I followed your lead.

00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:01,880
Are you sure what you said?

358
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,828
Yes, yes.

359
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:06,272

362
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,512
The voice is low.

363
00:42:19,198 --> 00:42:23,027
Prod told him that last night P'Pleum went to sleep with him at home.

364
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:25,342
So what was he thinking when he went to sleep at Prod's house?

365
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,358

00:42:35,698 --> 00:42:38,459
You're just a waiter. Why bother with other people's affairs?

373
00:42:38,459 --> 00:42:41,787
Froi , can you let me take a stand?

374
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:44,129
In summary, have you made your choice yet?

375
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:45,201
What do you choose?

376
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:49,782
I chose to move on from P'Pleum to be with P'Jess.
