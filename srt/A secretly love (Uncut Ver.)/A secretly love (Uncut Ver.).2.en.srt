1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,282
Try going to tell him you like his older brother.
Sometimes he might like you back.

2
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:08,920
I’ve been through it. But then it all fell apart

3
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:13,752
You’re still bringing us to meet his older brother, though.

4
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:16,589
The two of you, following me to study here.

5
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:17,480
Why?

6
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,168
So love is a game of win or lose, huh?

7
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:22,818
Well, I love him. I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

8
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,559
Want another shot at it?

9
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,915
Seeing you like this makes me feel really sorry for you.

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,840
Then why do you guys keep telling me what to do?

11
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,840
I’ve told you not to speak.

12
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,206
Eat plenty of fish. It’s easy to digest.

13
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:42,481
Your child will be smart if they eat lots of fish.

14
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:44,902
I’m Intelligenct, you know.

15
00:01:44,902 --> 00:01:51,419
Oh, well. Aunt( whan  ) stopped by at noon to visit Mom and bought some traditional Thai sweets.

16
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:52,854
Mom keeps them for you

17
00:01:52,854 --> 00:01:55,245
Keep them for yourself

18
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:59,807
Hmm! He also asked his mother. Have you met P’Sroi?

19
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:06,305
Prod group and P’Soi  group are different groups.

20
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:10,289
So we rarely meet.

21
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,769
Chears!

22
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:12,705
Hmm

23
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:15,713
When will Prod go to visit?

24
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:16,950
I don’t know. Call him

25
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,450
Um

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,518
What’s up? I’m having lunch.

27
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:36,450
Oh! I thought you’d come eat with us.

28
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,287
I’m eating with Mom.

29
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:42,346
Finish your meal and take a shower. I’ll follow you.

30
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:44,049
Oh! Kitty face.

31
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,444
You’re not coming tomorrow, are you?

32
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:48,080
Um! Then I’ll go tomorrow.

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,817
Hey! Wait! Hurry back. Um. Hurry up. It’s coming.

34
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:53,617
Well, you guys are going to eat first. Don’t worry about me.

35
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:56,480
See you soon  bye

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Umm, hurry up

37
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,763
He will come soon

38
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,263
Ok

39
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,293
Mom, sir.

40
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:10,000
I’ll go see the twins first.

41
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:15,735
Sure, dear. Look after your friend. Don’t let them eat too much.

42
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:20,408
Watching is fine, but if you want to forbid, it might not work.

43
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,084
If you’re full, go take a bath and change clothes.

44
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:26,825
I’ll clear the table myself

45
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:30,211
No, I’ll handle it myself.

46
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,590
If Mom’s full, she’ll go rest.

47
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,167
Don’t do it.

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,980
Yes

49
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,861
Absolutely not.

50
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,706
I know

51
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:55,196
Hey! Let me do something, son

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
So cute

53
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,120
But I prefer that table.

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,169
Sroi is for tourism.

55
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:22,120
I Think her broke up, I think he’s new here.

56
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,003
Buffalo

57
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:26,920
Handsome, wealthy, like Brother Pluem.
Do you think anyone will come to compare?

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,645
Foolish! Even the sky has a sky above it.

59
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:31,004
That’s how handsome I am, even compared to you.

60
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:35,053
You can talk, don’t be shy. Who told you that?

61
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:37,374
You go ask your parents.

62
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:37,874
(Music accompaniment)

63
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,730
Darn it!

64
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:46,949
What else is there?

65
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:50,840
Oh, P’ Gnaung

66
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,681
Oh, hey! Handsome gang

67
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:53,481
What’s up, Pluem?

68
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:54,993
Hmm! Regular customer.

69
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:55,493
Hello there.

70
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:57,820
How’s it going? Handsome gang, come on in.

71
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,962
Sure thing. Something big happened

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,297
Do you think we’ll make it?

73
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:09,094
Come this way for real.

74
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,320
Hey! Twins

75
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,785
Hello, brother.

76
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:20,189
Uh, and Kon prod, are you working?

77
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,129
Nope, today’s a day off.

78
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:26,921


79
00:05:29,238 --> 00:05:31,272
Come sit here

80
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,712
As you wish

81
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:33,524
Uhh

82
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:34,959
Hmm

83
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,219
Please, feel free. Whatever you want to drink or eat, it’s on me.

84
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,466
Please, come in.

85
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,689
Please, come in.

86
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,372
Please, come in, brother.

87
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:49,484
Get a glass for my brother.

88
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:50,823
Five glasses, please.

89
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,989
Hello there, Tum.

90
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:24,736
Why is Pluem standing over there?

91
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,800
Uh, you come to talk to me.

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,193
We’ll talk later

93
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:31,153
You know it.

94
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:34,564
You’ll know soon. You come in first.

95
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:35,688
I can’t speak.

96
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,346
Hey! Is kon prod?

97
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,074
Yes, brother.

98
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,360
Hey! Prod, come in quickly. We’re waiting.

99
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,115
Have you heard?

100
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:49,680
Uh, you can go in.

101
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,919
Come

102
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,800
Cheers!

103
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:03,285
Everyone’s finished their drinks already, wow.

104
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:12,440
Hey, they didn’t offer us alcohol to drink, it’s not just water.

105
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,457
Well, take my glass and drink it all.

106
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:18,480
I’m allergic to alcohol.

107
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:21,524
Even if you’re allergic, drink and let it win.

108
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,257
Cheers!

109
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:23,737
Drink up!

110
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:28,921
Pluem, don’t you know for real?

111
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:33,700
People who are allergic to alcohol, if they drink it, they might die, you know.

112
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:49,360
Um, I’ll excuse myself to talk to my brother. I’m a bit tired.

113
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,040
What’s wrong?

114
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,035
My sister ran away because of you.

115
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:56,035
Hmm, haven’t seen your face in a while.

116
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:58,526
She won’t come to the shop anymore, she’s gone now.

117
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:00,362
Come often, huh? Miss you.

118
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:03,240
I have a lot of studying to do right now, brother, sorry.

119
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,920
Hmm, study and travel together, okay with you, brother?

120
00:08:07,406 --> 00:08:08,045
Ok

121
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:08,569
Ok

122
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:09,069
Huh!

123
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:10,861
Oh, what’s going on here?

124
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:11,396
Huh?

125
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:13,752
Isn’t today a holiday?

126
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,337
Huh?

127
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:17,084
And you’re still out here on holiday?

128
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:21,706
Oh, wow! Can’t relax, huh? You’re too busy.

129
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:23,943
Just a bit, big bro. Friends dragged me along.

130
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:26,548
Just a bit. It’s okay, take care of yourself.

131
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,931
Hey, wait!
And don’t forget to come to work tomorrow, okay?

132
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:30,400
If you’re not out here vacationing, don’t skip work.

133
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,580
Sure thing.

134
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,200
See you, big bro.

135
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,121
P’Sroi, P’Froy.
Hello, there.

136
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:41,522
Is today a holiday? You’re not at work.

137
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:45,201
Yes, it is. We came to see the twins.

138
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:49,376
Sroi, we’re gonna use the restroom first.

139
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:50,217
Uh-huh.

140
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,081
Please sit down. Let’s chat.

141
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,178
P’Sroi.

142
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:04,866
At noon, Nuan came to see mom at home.

143
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:07,567
She asked if I’ve seen you.

144
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:11,186
And  what did you say? , Prod

145
00:09:11,186 --> 00:09:18,182
I said we rarely meet because we’re in different faculties.

146
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:26,520
Why did you and P’Pluem break up, Sroi?

147
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,359
Do you have someone new?

148
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:31,488
Why do you think that, Prod?

149
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:39,702
Well, P’Pluem is handsome, rich, perfect for you. How do you expect people to react?

150
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:42,940
The breakup was just normal. Nothing significant.

151
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,698
He was overly possessive and jealous.

152
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:48,735
He couldn’t handle me being independent.

153
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,680
Wait, let me feed you. Want some?

154
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:53,543
No, thanks.

155
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,995
Just looking at your face fills me up. How’s it taste?

156
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:57,841
I haven’t eaten yet.

157
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:59,151
Have some water, at least.

158
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,607
And you’re still not eating?

159
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,957
Just looking at your face, Soi, fills me up.

160
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:08,888
Oh.

161
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:20,000
Sroi, I bought some snacks while we were out.

162
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,807
Thank you.

163
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:28,991
Have some.

164
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,880
Um, then maybe we should head back now.

165
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,709
I was afraid someone might have put something in your snacks.

166
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:02,002
How can I eat? If I die after eating, what then?

167
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,633
We’re worried about you.

168
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,961
No need to worry. Our group isn’t lacking in numbers.

169
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:18,926
But Kate’s group has gone overboard.

170
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:22,479
Oh! If they’re afraid, let’s show them how we do things.

171
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,939
Alright, alright. Let’s leave it for now. We’ll make plans later.

172
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:28,379
Okay, let’s meet up later then.

173
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:29,735
Who’s that?

174
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,253
Molly.

175
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:33,367
Which Molly?

176
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,273
My friend from college.

177
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:40,590
What kind of girl is she? Does she dress as a woman or as a man?

178
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:44,733
She dresses as a woman. Are you satisfied?

179
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:46,659
Hmm.

180
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:49,387
But if there’s a chance to end it all, I’ll end it all.

181
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:53,897
I know that in this day and age, people switch back to dating women a lot. You never watched YouTube, huh?

182
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,780
Here’s Sroi.

183
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:05,920
Sroi never understands us.

184
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,940
Sroi.

185
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,279
Sroi.

186
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:25,278
Are you going back to the room?

187
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:26,536
Hmm, yes.

188
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,357
Come back with us.

189
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:29,857
Wait!

190
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:34,247
We decided to take Sroi out to eat and buy some things first.

191
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:37,064
Froy, you can go home by yourself.

192
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,137
Oh, Pleum.

193
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,710
Where did you say you were going after dropping us off?
We decided to take Sroi out to eat and buy some things first.

194
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:48,760
Well… well… we just realized that we want to take Soi out to eat.

195
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:52,869
Oh, really? Okay, Pleum.

196
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,446
We just don’t want Froy to come along.

197
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:02,145
Why?

198
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,959
We’ve already slept together all night, and we still have to go back together?

199
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:10,979
Is that so?

200
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:11,489
Sroi

201
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,073
Do you want to rent a room alone?

202
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:16,077
We can pay for it.

203
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:19,947
What do you mean?

204
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,588
Sroi

205
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:28,924
I want Soi to stay with me only here.

206
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:30,564
No need to be with anyone else.

207
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,347
Just me is enough. I miss you.

208
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,308
Sroi

209
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:42,308
Sroi.

210
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:48,242
The whole time we’ve been together, I’ve been really happy.

211
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:50,687
I’ve been so attached, I don’t know anything else.

212
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:52,835
Do I have a social life?

213
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,964
I told him to adjust, but he didn’t.

214
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:58,246
What should I do?

215
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:01,059
My patience also has limits.

216
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:04,296
But what he misses is because I’m his girlfriend.

217
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:09,560
But I’m not a bird to keep me from meeting other people.

218
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:14,254
It shows that I’m not happy with him being like this.

219
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,771
Yes, very unhappy.

220
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:24,537
It shows that the love he has for me has no meaning at all, right?

221
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,076
If it has no meaning at all.

222
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:32,534
Then I’ll ask for a breakup.

223
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,154
Please explain what you mean.

224
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:43,028
If you’re not happy with him, I’ll ask to be his new girlfriend.

225
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:46,483
Because I’m really happy with him.

226
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,087
Sroi.

227
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,101
Stop.

228
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,208
Stop right there.

229
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,093
We’ll talk to Sroi later.

230
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:08,168
Why are you following us?

231
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:13,578
She’s lost interest. Shouldn't each person move on?

232
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:14,406
Go, Soi.

233
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,480
I want to drink more.

234
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,883
Go ahead and drink, who’s stopping you?

235
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:48,441
You see, when someone steals the scene, anyone wouldn’t feel like drinking anymore.

236
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:51,605
Thrown up that much, someone’s losing cell count.

237
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:55,601
It’s me. Drink until you’re wasted.

238
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:57,755
You don’t need to think about her.

239
00:15:57,755 --> 00:16:01,960
Prepare to comfort her. However, Sroi won’t go back to her.

240
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,355
Sroi, number 20.

241
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:09,287
And don’t you think there might be a number 21?

242
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,822
What’s the deal with it?

243
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:19,822
Hey, Twin.

244
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:21,515
Yes, sir.

245
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:23,250
And kon prod?

246
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,240
He’s gone already, sir.

247
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,800
Where to?

248
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,868
I think we should go home, sir. I saw him just leave earlier. Do you have anything to report?

249
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:35,270
Oh, nothing, sir. I thought we’d help them carry the bodies a bit.

250
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:40,336
Jess, help me carry them a bit, will you?

251
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:42,336
Oh, I know.

252
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,559
Shall we go back?

253
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,250
Shall we help?

254
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,480
It’s okay. We’ll handle it ourselves.

255
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:57,228
Go?

256
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:05,575
Oh my god!

257
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,861
Sroi, don’t leave me.

258
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,611
Where would I take you?

259
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:14,414
Oh no, Sroi. Sroi!

260
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:15,160
Sroi!

261
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,635
“Sroi, please don’t go. Huhu…”

262
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:21,996
It’s heavy now.

263
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:24,536
Is it heavy?

264
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:25,998
It’s me.

265
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:26,765
Oh.

266
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:31,852
I think like this, it won’t take long, it’ll forget soon.

267
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,409
People like Pleum, changing partners often, will die.

268
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:38,868
The one who drinks the last alcohol will suck people.

269
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:42,896
Haha, you suck like Somchai.

270
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,800
But alcohol never sucked my hair.

271
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,680
It’s your thing!!!

272
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,670
I think let’s go back.

273
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,952
Sroi!

274
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:56,700
Can you create from listening? Listen to us crying.

275
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,640
Um, this is Jess.

276
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,829
What are you with your Prod today?

277
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:06,965
What’s wrong? It’s nothing.

278
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:10,261
Hey, I see you just staring at it.

279
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:12,728
I stare at everyone.

280
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:16,493
Hey, let’s go back.

281
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:19,166
Um, see you tomorrow.

282
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,850
Boy, who are you going back with?

283
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,560
Jess and Nick, they’re together, they have to go back together.

284
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,339
Oh, I know.

285
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:31,884
You, I entrust you to take care of Somchai.

286
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:35,146
Hey, why throw shit at me?

287
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:41,533
Jess, Nick, I’m grown up, I don’t need anyone to take care of me.

288
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:47,596
Your condition, you’ll easily be deceived by children, let them send you easily.

289
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:52,880
Um, you don’t have to worry, I won’t let it sleep and die like a street dog.

290
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,560
Ugh, mouth.

291
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,060
Why?

292
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,292
Kissable.

293
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,492
Ugh, darn it.

294
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:00,101
Go, go back.

295
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,571
Sroi!

296
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:09,000
Enough!

297
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:13,924
Don’t go anywhere, stay with us first! *sobs*

298
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,514
People without love are carefree.

299
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:40,404
This guy will never talk about dharma one day. Will you die?

300
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:41,757
And what do you want me to talk about?

301
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:44,093
Anything.

302
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:48,454
Shall we go steal something? Only gains.

303
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:49,688
You’re irritating.

304
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,243
You’re… black noodles.

305
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:54,191
Special please.

306
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:01,110
What?

307
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,124
Ow!

308
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,968
Who bought it for you, Pleum?

309
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:15,900
Who will buy it for me?

310
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,570
Oh, then who did you buy it for?

311
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:26,055
Did you meet someone new, Pleum? Glad you moved on.

312
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:28,593
See? I told you.

313
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:31,187
I’ll buy it for Sroi.

314
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:36,583
Why don’t you hurry and give it to Sroi? Before it fades away.

315
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:43,115
I, I’m not brave enough.

316
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:47,508
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

317
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:54,440
You guys see it too, that Sroi won’t let me
Get close. Won’t let me explain anything.

318
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:01,040
So, I thought of sending flowers with a letter
Hoping she’ll read it.

319
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,280
Who’s gonna give it to you?

320
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,360
Me. I’m not backing down from this.

321
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:13,802
I just… I’m allergic to flowers.

322
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:18,789
I’m into stock trading.

323
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,790
I’m withdrawing from this mission. I forgot
I have urgent business.

324
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,720
Hey! Chai!

325
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,679
You guys… darn it!

326
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:43,800
You guys don’t have to. I’m out.

327
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,832
Who’s that?

328
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:51,600
Prod… come here.

329
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,811
Is there something?

330
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:06,800
I have something for you tomorrow.

331
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:13,275
Pleum, I think you shouldn’t let her do it. It’s not
Sroi. She knows him already.

332
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:19,000
It’ll be inconvenient. Just deliver the stuff. Plus,
She knows him already.

333
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,453
So, what’s the matter?

334
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,402
You’re taking flowers and a letter to Sroi at the faculty?

335
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:32,411
Yes.

336
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,201
Um, but I have to rush.

337
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:35,737
Alright, but I have to go.

338
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:40,261
Senior, can’t you?

339
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,435
Yes.

340
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:11,360
Deliver the stuff and take a picture. So, I’ll know
if Sroi really received the flowers.

341
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,159
And don’t forget to show me.

342
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,456
Okay.

343
00:23:17,768 --> 00:23:19,161
Understood. I’ll hurry.

344
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,054
Hey!

345
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:35,635
I think you’re going too far, Pleum.

346
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:38,008
How so?

347
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:41,032
It wants to do something. Let it be.

348
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,251
Oops!

349
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,164
Need any help?

350
00:24:03,164 --> 00:24:07,279
My shoe got stuck.

351
00:24:09,457 --> 00:24:13,245
Okay, hold on. Let me take it off first.

352
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,215
Like it?

353
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,071
Like what?

354
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:29,799
Um, I like helping people.

355
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:34,399
I’ll get up first.

356
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,790
Shoe.

357
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,760
Thank you.

358
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,880
I’m Somchai. My dad’s name is Somsri, and my mom’s name is Somsak.

359
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:46,742
Um, thank you.

360
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:48,935
I’m Pai.

361
00:24:48,935 --> 00:24:57,524
Pai. Chai. Pai. Chai. Pai. Chai. Pai. Chai.
363

362
00:24:57,524 --> 00:24:59,887
It rhymes well.

363
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:05,582
Um, thank you again. I have to go now.

364
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:17,754
Oops!

365
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:18,663
Go.

366
00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:21,437
Oops!

367
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,040
P’Sroi, P’Sroi!

368
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,640
What’s up? Prod

369
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,349
Um…

370
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:43,681
Um,  asked for this from the seniors, right?

371
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:46,518
Um, yes, sir.
It’s just that…

372
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:47,158
Take this.

373
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,411
Don’t, Froy.

374
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:54,656
I don’t care anymore. Why are you forbidding me?

375
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:58,627
If you want to leave, just leave me.

376
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:02,822
Um, but before you leave, can I take it as evidence?

377
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:04,860
Why do you need evidence?

378
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,394
Well, they ordered me, I don’t want any trouble.

379
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:18,279
Is this enough? Hurry, they need to go to class.

380
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,994
And there’s this too, sir.

381
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,070
Take it.

382
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,782
Why did you bring it to me?

383
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,777
It’s a favor. Including this letter.

384
00:26:34,777 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh, why don’t you just leave it yourself?

385
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,850
Here, they asked me to keep it.

386
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,270
As for what you do with it, it’s your business.

387
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,270
Go away, Sroi.

388
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:53,166
I told you, it’s unfortunate.

389
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,280
Are you going to leave, please?

390
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:32,048
Why would you leave it? It’s such a waste. The flowers are still fresh.

391
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:33,795
It’s just right.

392
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:36,000
So, if that’s the case, I’ll take it.

393
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,981
Do we want it?

394
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:40,007
Yes, if you give it, I’ll take it.

395
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,351
You can have it.

396
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:47,114
Thank you, Prod.

397
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,000
It’s here.

398
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,041
Where did it come from?

399
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,642
Who are you calling?

400
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:22,513
Oh, it’s you, Prod.

401
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:31,560
Hey, how’s it going?

402
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,160
Where are you?

403
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,734
Um, I’m around here. What’s up?

404
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:37,125
And where exactly is ‘here’?

405
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,609
You don’t need to say much.

406
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:41,659
You guys wait for me outside the faculty. I’ll be there soon.

407
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:49,022
Don’t just leave without saying anything.

408
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,430
Hey, cool.

409
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,628
How did you do that?

410
00:28:58,628 --> 00:29:01,800
Hey, and like this, won’t they be suspicious that it’s Pleum?

411
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,395
What are you suspicious about?

412
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:10,554
Oh, it’s Prod, our junior. They won’t think that the one who sent it is Pleum.

413
00:29:10,554 --> 00:29:12,358
Right, Prod?

414
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:17,340
They should know.

415
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:23,229
What about you, Soraya?

416
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:26,546
Um, what about you, Sroi?

417
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:33,838
I don’t really say anything. I just gave flowers and a letter, then took a photo.

418
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,803
Hmm, just like that?

419
00:29:35,803 --> 00:29:39,579
And it didn’t have that 'feel good so good' vibe at all?

420
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:44,397
That’s it, and then I went back to studying.

421
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:47,440
That’s good enough.

422
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,975
At least it’s a signal that Sroi’s feeling better.

423
00:29:52,975 --> 00:30:00,202
If they read the letter, I believe they’ll understand me better.

424
00:30:00,202 --> 00:30:09,159
Um, then you can let them go back later. You don’t have to use them like this again.

425
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:18,840
Well, I’m not sure. If it’s a bridge to Sroi’s heart.

426
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:30,830
Just chill, dude. This is your problem, you need to deal with it yourself, not drag others into it like this.

427
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,366
And why are you complaining?

428
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:36,866
Hey!

429
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:38,577
You’re not saying anything yourself.

430
00:30:38,577 --> 00:30:41,765
I think you guys should stop arguing first.

431
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:47,392
Please, just hurry up and go study.

432
00:30:47,392 --> 00:30:48,031
Go.

433
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:58,366
Fine, use a new service then.

434
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:29,159
Hey, look at his face, look at it!

435
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,086
What errands did you come here for? You look so serious.

436
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:43,639
My errands, P’Pluem.

437
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:45,636
Huh! P’Pluem.

438
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:48,316
Then what are P’Pluem’s errands?

439
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:52,932
It’s none of your business, you guys shouldn’t care at all.

440
00:31:52,932 --> 00:31:58,075
That’s not true. I think you want to see P’Pluem more than anything else.

441
00:31:58,075 --> 00:32:04,809
Otherwise, you wouldn’t be loitering around where P’Pluem usually walks.

442
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,708
Exactly! That’s what I think.

443
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:13,240
So, what are your errands then?

444
00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:22,890
Um, I think we should go study.

445
00:32:26,926 --> 00:32:30,150
We need to know the truth about this.

446
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:30,664
Yes.

447
00:32:30,664 --> 00:32:31,164
Let’s go.

448
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:31,800
Follow.

449
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,769
Hey!

450
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:55,399
What’s up?

451
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,561
Are those flowers for me?

452
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,996
Um, sort of.

453
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:08,742
Are you overthinking, bro?

454
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:11,806
They might just coincidentally match what you ordered.

455
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:20,747
Like hell! These are my flowers. I arranged them myself. Who else could they be for?

456
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:23,609
I don’t know about that.

457
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:33,600
Arranged flowers look the same anyway. Don’t think too much about it. Your stuff is over there.

458
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:40,399
But I’m afraid someone might take Sroi.

459
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:44,874
Sis!

460
00:33:44,874 --> 00:33:47,276
Oops! P’Pluem.

461
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:51,347
Are these flowers for a girl?

462
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:55,515
Um, no, not really. These are from P’Prod.

463
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,704
Prod?

464
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:01,525
Hey, P’Pluem.

465
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:03,560
P’Pluem, wait for me. P’Pluem.

466
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:17,197
Tasks have been assigned, but there hasn’t been any progress so far. Why?

467
00:34:17,197 --> 00:34:19,565
Why?

468
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:21,376
Are you guys not talking or what?

469
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:23,529
The work isn’t progressing like this.

470
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,765
What’s going on?

471
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,036
What’s up?

472
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:36,954
It’s about the volunteer camp. There’s been no progress so far.

473
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:39,434
Our advisor has already urged us.

474
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:45,868
There’s a serious lack of responsibility. I think we need some measures.

475
00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:49,556
I understand what you’re saying.

476
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:53,061
Do you understand anything, Khun Suea? I haven’t finished speaking yet.

477
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:55,171
Khun Somchai, please, hold on.

478
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:55,732
Year 3

479
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,902
Year 3

480
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:00,047
Yes, yes, yes.

481
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:03,061
Stand up, 100 times practice.

482
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:06,400
Practice.

483
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,717
Practice.

484
00:35:08,717 --> 00:35:13,635
1, 2, make it ready.

485
00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:15,841
Pleum, you come out here.

486
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:21,388
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

487
00:35:21,388 --> 00:35:24,134
What’s up with you, Jess?

488
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:27,127
You can’t do this in front of your juniors, darn it.

489
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:31,200
That’s right. You shouldn’t punish your juniors.

490
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,991
There’s no need to punish each other over this matter.

491
00:35:34,991 --> 00:35:39,835
But they didn’t follow the rules. They have to be punished, right?

492
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:46,188
Just because they didn’t have the volunteer camp information, there’s no need to punish them. Let’s talk it out nicely.

493
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:53,937
Why should we talk nicely? It thinks I’m stupid. It thinks it can fool me.

494
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:57,187
No one thinks you’re stupid.

495
00:35:57,187 --> 00:36:01,317
They do. And they’ve fooled me into trusting them.

496
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:03,914
Who are you talking about?

497
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:06,505
The juniors, of course.

498
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:14,480
Oh, I see. You’re really something, aren’t you, Pleum?

499
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,067
47, 48, 49.

500
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,874
Hey, that’s enough.

501
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:37,551
What’s up?

502
00:36:37,997 --> 00:36:43,338
That’s enough. If anyone has anything, let’s discuss it separately.

503
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:45,568
Okay.

504
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:53,221
Wait.

505
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:59,210
Hay, Prod.

506
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:04,176
Pleum, time’s up. Let the juniors go.

507
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,520
I haven’t let them go yet.

508
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:11,578
You’re starting to get annoying, you know.

509
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:12,098
I’m not annoying.

510
00:37:12,098 --> 00:37:17,309
Hey, calm down. Let’s talk it out calmly.

511
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:21,833
I have something to discuss with them.

512
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:24,430
What’s the matter?

513
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:35,565
You’re the one who suggested the volunteer camp idea. If you can’t find a venue within 3 days, be prepared to return our gear.

514
00:37:35,565 --> 00:37:37,628
Hey, Pleum.

515
00:37:37,628 --> 00:37:42,207
Everyone, everyone, go home and rest.

516
00:37:42,207 --> 00:37:42,707
Yes.

517
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:43,365
Yes.

518
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,381
Yes.

519
00:38:21,277 --> 00:38:22,315
Yes.

520
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:26,870
Seriously, what’s up with Pleum?

521
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,667
Why are you picking a fight, just like that?

522
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,530
I don’t know, same as you.

523
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:36,499
And this morning, when you went to run errands for them, what was that about?

524
00:38:36,499 --> 00:38:38,242
What’s going on?

525
00:38:38,242 --> 00:38:42,280
Or is he mad at you for this?

526
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,708
I think this is real. Isn’t it?

527
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,193
It’s nothing, you’re just overthinking.

528
00:38:58,193 --> 00:39:01,092
I’ll go back now.

529
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:03,629
Um, see you.

530
00:39:03,629 --> 00:39:04,624
Go back safely.

531
00:39:04,624 --> 00:39:05,906
What’s up? Just sat down.

532
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,393
Is it good?

533
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,087
Mom thinks I’m going to work again.

534
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,947
I bought some rice for Mom first.

535
00:39:51,947 --> 00:39:55,017
Mom said, no matter what, call if you’re not free.

536
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,598
Mom can take care of herself.

537
00:39:56,598 --> 00:39:59,341
It’s okay, Mom. I’m off to work now.

538
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:01,176
Wait, let me change clothes first.

539
00:40:01,176 --> 00:40:05,398
Wait a moment, son. Do you want some sticky rice to fill your stomach?

540
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:07,614
Is it Auntie Ring’s?

541
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:13,301
Yes, son. Try it and see if it’s delicious.

542
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:17,674
Sure, just a little bit.
544

543
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:21,640
Alright, here you go.

544
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,633
Wow, it’s really delicious.

545
00:40:29,633 --> 00:40:37,960
Sticky, soft, sweet, just right. Wow, it’s coconut milk, ultimate.

546
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,170
Wow.
Delicious.

547
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,129
Let me change clothes first.

548
00:40:43,129 --> 00:40:44,877
Yes.

549
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:48,208
Um, alright.

550
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:50,119
Go ahead, son.

551
00:40:55,062 --> 00:40:58,680
Look.

552
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:04,453
Um.

553
00:41:09,124 --> 00:41:10,527
Enjoy your meal.

554
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:11,546
Yes.

555
00:41:11,546 --> 00:41:16,852
If you want to order anything else, just call.

556
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,208
I’m really sorry. I promise that I’ll do everything Sroi wants.

557
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:43,085
Don’t leave me.

558
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:47,039
Will there ever be a day when you’ll ask me to love you like this?

559
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,212
I think Sroi probably has a new boyfriend by now.

560
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:52,762
I feel sorry for you, Pleum.

561
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:55,076
What do you feel sorry for me about?

562
00:41:55,076 --> 00:41:59,528
Darn, your mouth is big enough, and you’re still complaining about me.

563
00:41:59,528 --> 00:42:03,882
Wait, I’ll make it happen.
