7
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:24,969

15
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,094
There's nothing.

16
00:01:58,094 --> 00:02:01,640

Or run after him?

31
00:03:03,494 --> 00:03:12,879
I can't decide for anyone else.
In matters like this, I have to decide for myself.

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,159

33
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,889

I can send it.

63
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:32,483

I just want to help Mom take care of Prod .

74
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:16,157

I'd better send it.

82
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:15,768
thank you

83
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:16,952
Where are you going?

84
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:20,418
My girlfriend was very drunk and wanted to take me home.

85
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:23,311
Are you sure? that this person is your boyfriend

86
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,816

87
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:25,771
My boyfriend

88
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:29,535
You're just a waitress. Why bother worrying about other people?

89
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:34,265
It turns out that this woman is a friend of my sister next door.

90
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:37,880
Release Brother Froi now.

91
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,442

What can happen?

97
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:56,797
Well, this boy is a waiter. It interferes with my business as well as my boyfriend.

98

00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:02,921
This woman is a friend of my friend's ex-girlfriend.

100
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:07,548
We know each other well. But why don't I know you?

101
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:11,196
You don't have to bother me anymore.

102
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:16,968
Do you know Phu Yai Nok Nok Ayutthaya?

103
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:23,591
Nok Ayutthaya ? I've only heard of Nakhon Pathom birds.

104
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:27,177
Is it crazy or not? It's you, huh?

105
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:29,688
I don't know which bird.

106
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:38,081
Hello, Mr. Police, would you mind coming to P'Guang shop ? Just in time, the customer has a problem.

107
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:41,385

P'Froi wakes up.

119
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:07,501
P'Froi

P'Froi Story

128
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:56,705
P'Froi is sorry for making P'Sroi feel bad.

129
00:10:56,705 --> 00:11:01,240
I understand enough.

130
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,064
Brother Sroi .

131
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:11,079
He loves you more than a friend.

132
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,959
Can you stay still?

133
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,839
Froi, can you give me my bearings?

134
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, what are you going to study?

135
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,085
I have to become a star in the Faculty of Humanities.

136
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,217
Yes...I'm very confident, Mom...

137
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:39,846
A beautiful person like me must be in this group.

138
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:41,517
Oh, and you?

139
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:44,684
Whichever faculty you take, I take the exam.

140
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:47,265
Please take the exam first.

141
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:51,320
I've already passed the exam. Wait and see.

142
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,871
Sroi Sroi I love Sroi

143
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:59,632

00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:02,061
I am sorry

145
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:04,310
I am sorry

146
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:10,839
It's okay, I'm sorry too.

00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:25,242
you

148
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:32,280
This time we will get a low score.

149
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:37,200
Next time we still have a chance to collect points during the finals.
I'm here.

150
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,680
If I get a grade lower than B+ in this subject
I have no right to be honored.

151
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,522
None of us are always perfect .

152
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:56,160
Even though you don't get honors But it doesn't mean you're not good at it, right?

153
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,229
The sound of the cock-headed Kong bird is lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.

154
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:16,413
You, I'm sad.

155
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:20,380
See, you're sad now.

156
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,566
Let's go find something delicious to eat.

157
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:26,041
Wait a minute.

158
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:31,040
What's coming? I'm hungry. Let's go. Go.

159
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Hmm.

160
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,786
Oh...

161
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,353
Ouch!

162
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:43,940
Oh!

163
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:49,848
with Froi ? Or is it a nightmare?

164
00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:52,649
nothing

165
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:54,321
I'm sorry.

166
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,920
I think we'd better go back first.

167
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,432
You are here

168
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,000
But...we've agreed on this.

169
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:20,160
You know, since you're gone I feel shocked and can't tell.

170
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,941
Froi

171
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:31,893
If I want you to be with me like this forever, is that okay?

172
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,199
Did you really say that?

173
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,986
Who would joke about something like this?

174
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:45,332
Please give me a hug.

175
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:48,319
thank you

176
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,013
Wait, wait.

177
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:24,013

dress

179
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:34,157
This one is right here.

180
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,482
It must be 5 of each.

181
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:44,019
Water

182
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,919
Thank you.

183
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,565
thank you

184
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:56,850
Thank you.

185
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,485
Nong Love

186
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:01,497
Arrange it now. Arrange it now.

187
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,389
What are you delighted about?

188
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,950
Just now, there was still a big smile on his face.

189
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,558
Why is your face now as crinkled as an ass?

190
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:27,686
I wonder if my hormones are going crazy.

191
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:32,520
Well, keep working.

192
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,940
In summary, can you choose yet?

193
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,154
What did you choose?

194
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:49,424
It's about moving on from P'Pleum to dating Jess .

195
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:51,352
What is it?

196
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:56,990
Oh, you see, right? How clear Jess is, but Prod doesn't seem to care.

197
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,749
agree with

198
00:18:57,749 --> 00:19:03,161
But just now, I saw P'Pleum's eyes . He was jealous of Prod. I don't know how.

199
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:09,400
Yep, I hope so. It will be fulfilled at some point.

200
00:19:27,827 --> 00:19:30,051
Hey, I'm delighted.

201
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:36,945
It's almost Freshy Night. Why are you acting so emotionless?

202
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,150
Why

203
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,025
I'm just saying this, pretending to make a face.

204
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:42,348
What the heck?

205
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:48,211
Well, when you work you seem distracted.

206
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:53,452
I think you'll appreciate the fact that you need to practice meditating before going to bed. Your mind will be calm.

207
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:55,636
What are you practicing now?

208
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:56,744
Enough for you.

209
00:19:56,744 --> 00:20:00,254
Are you still stressed about Sroi ?

210
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,005
nothing

211
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:03,949
Come on.

212
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:07,440
If not, what are you?

213
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,638
I said no.

214
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:12,554
There isn't any.

215
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:14,808
So what are you guys like? Come and expect me.

216
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:16,323
Huh?

217
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,310
collect

218
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:23,947
Get out of the way.

219
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,976
I think the symptoms were more serious than when Sroi told me.
Break up again

220
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,320
If you have something to say to me, don't keep it to yourself.

221
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,919
I don't know what my relationship with P'Pleum is like right now.

222
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,960
I've never seen you in any other state. Why are you stressed?

223
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,559
Now there is no distance between me and him.

224
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,170
It was you who tried to go find him.
I always contradict you.

225
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,073
In conclusion, will you choose P'Pleum or Jess?

226
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:44,807
I've tried opening up to Jess .

227
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:48,240
But the relationship did not develop.

228
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,754
It's the same.

229
00:21:49,754 --> 00:21:54,557
Then you tell P'Pleum so he doesn't get stuck like this.

230
00:21:54,557 --> 00:21:57,499
Oh yes, I agree.

231
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,429
Soon he will graduate.

232
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:01,895
You may not meet again.

233
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:10,763
Huh?

234
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:20,896
P'Pleum is an encouragement to me.

235
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,840
Hello P'Pleum.

236
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,651
P'Pleum have any problems?

237
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:05,240
Nothing, I just want to sleep with you.

238
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,363
thank you

239
00:23:09,363 --> 00:23:11,159
Huh?

240
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,480
What is this?

241
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,778
Why are you standing? You can enter the house now.

242
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:23,919
I'll close the door right now.

243
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,430
What is this?

244
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:33,000
Why didn't you say anything?

245
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:42,414
P'Pleum, the clothes I gave you to wear, are they okay?

246
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:44,408
good

247
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:51,653
So will you go to Freshy Night with me?

248
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,960
I told you a while ago.

249
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,159
I want to hear it from this mouth.

250
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:09,315
I can't take leave from work. There are few employees at the store.

251
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:25,490
But I have a song that I want you to listen to.

252
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:39,880
Then I can go, but I'll have to ask P'Guang to leave work early.

253
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:45,634
I made a promise, don't bend.

254
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:47,251
contract

255
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,755
Promise.

256
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,240
I think it's late and we're going to bed.

257
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:17,254
Uh

258
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:26,934
I am a person who is addicted to pillows.

259
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,000
Can I hug you?

260
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:47,445
If it's not convenient...

261
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:53,600
It's up to you. I didn't say anything.

262
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:02,918
Prod

263
00:27:06,221 --> 00:27:09,018
Prod wake up

264
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,440
Kon Prod... wake up...

265
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,159
I'm sorry.

266
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,628
Sorry about....

267
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:45,398
I accidentally hugged you.

268
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:51,260
I'm the one who hugs you. You didn't hug me.

269
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,465
I told you last night.

270
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:05,253
I remember now.

271
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:10,057
So, are you going to university with me?

272
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:15,106
nevermind I'll go myself.

273
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:16,133
yeah

274
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,778
Hmm.

275
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,778
Hoy!

276
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,513
You guys make it beautiful. Don't embarrass anyone.

277
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:13,664
There's no need to worry. I will dress to stand out better than you.

278
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,487
It doesn't have to be that much.

279
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,340
You let me show off my handsomeness.

280
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,499
Heh heh heh

281
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,664
Brother Seua .

282
00:29:45,664 --> 00:29:46,981
10 bags of cement

283
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:47,481
yes

284
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:49,295
Plus another 30 sheets of gypsum.

285
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:49,867
okay

286
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:51,287
Hoy!

287
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:53,722
What do you guys have?

288
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:56,587
I have something to discuss.

289
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,090
What's the matter?

290
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,429
About P'Pleum and Prod

291
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:04,033
So, what's the problem with these two people?

292
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:07,114
That is, they didn't have any problems.

293
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:13,296
Well...this morning Prod came to tell me that last night P'Pleum went to sleep with him at home.

294
00:30:13,296 --> 00:30:14,239
Hoy!

295
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,778
So what was he thinking when he went to sleep at Prod's house?

296
00:30:16,778 --> 00:30:19,029
I don't know either.

297
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:24,944
Prod doesn't know why P'Pleum went to sleep at his house last night.

298
00:30:24,944 --> 00:30:25,713
yeah

299
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:36,111
I've been wondering for a long time. I'm delighted to like Khun Long Prod. It's like he wants to be close to Prod.

300
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:38,811
Find an opportunity to even sleep at Kon Prod's house.

301
00:30:38,811 --> 00:30:42,206
And even more Jess declares that she likes Prod .

302
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:44,057
It acted like he was going to die.

303
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:50,082
As for the Pro , I think I like it too.

304
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:53,006
Why do you think like that?

305
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:55,255
I'm not stupid.

306
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:57,575
You guys said it well.

307
00:30:57,575 --> 00:30:59,112
Take it like this.

308
00:30:59,112 --> 00:31:02,426
What do you have? Tell me everything.

309
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:05,115
something We must work together.

310
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,015
Hmm.

311
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:07,167
What do you say?

312
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:07,816
Tell me now.

313
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:08,687
Yes!

314
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:11,219
Whatever you say, tell me.

315
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:16,119
If it really is like that, what will you do about Jess ?

316
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:20,709
You don't have to worry about that. I'll take care of it myself.

317
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:25,681
But... Is Prod truly in love?

318
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:27,944
It's true.

319
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:29,749
If it's not true, you won't come to study here.

320
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:34,545
And I think...this time might be his last chance.

321
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:36,412
yeah

322
00:31:36,412 --> 00:31:41,640
You don't have to worry about this. Seua is all there.

323
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,756
10 bags of cement

324
00:31:43,756 --> 00:31:45,447
30 gypsum sheets

325
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:46,439
Ha!

326
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:48,947
Yes, sir.

327
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:50,427
Oh...I'm relieved.

328
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:52,799
Yes, I'm comfortable.

329
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:25,240
Wake up early in the morning, eager to meet someone...

330
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,480
Well, my heart is tight, it misses me, I miss it until I keep it.
I can't take it.

331
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,763
From the end of the alley, my heart wanders out to find you far away.

332
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:44,062
If you're too slow, someone will overtake you. Who won't be able to compete in time?

333
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,986
I've seen you since yesterday, not long ago, not long ago.

334
00:32:47,986 --> 00:32:51,356
And so it went, many, many years.

335
00:32:51,356 --> 00:32:58,511
I saw you walk back and look at you again. Don't go ahead now. Someone will come and get you.

336
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:01,445
You are the girl from the alley, the alley, the alley.

337
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:08,372
Kid in the front of the alley, front of the alley, front of the alley, you are in front of the alley, front of the alley, front of the alley, front of the alley

338
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:15,000
Kid from the alley, front of the alley, front of the alley, and I'll be there to please you.

339
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:18,298
Why hasn't the Pro yet come?

340
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:19,828
The work started a long time ago.

341
00:33:19,828 --> 00:33:21,134
It will come soon.

342
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:22,371
It's still not finished yet.

343
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:24,358
Prod, he keeps his word.

344
00:33:24,358 --> 00:33:27,175
But it's about money. It's very annoying.

345
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:29,990
Ah...it's not there. So you came and poked fun at it?

346
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,572
If it comes, I'll tell you about it.

347
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:35,056
Like you never gossip about it.

348
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:35,938
never...

349
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:37,921
It's better to keep dancing.

350
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:44,896
If you're too slow, too late, someone will overtake you. Who won't be able to compete in time?

351
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:48,758
I've seen you since yesterday, not long ago, not long ago.

352
00:33:48,758 --> 00:33:59,304
And then we passed by together, many, many years, turning around, enjoying it, walking back and looking at you again, one more time, I won't go ahead now, someone will come and get me....

353
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:02,291
You are the girl from the alley, the alley, the alley.

354
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:05,684
Children in the alley, in the alley, in the alley

355
00:34:05,684 --> 00:34:09,891
You are in front of the alley, in front of the alley, in front of the alley.
In front of the alley

356
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:13,942
Kid from the alley, front of the alley, front of the alley, and I'll be there to please you.

357
00:34:13,942 --> 00:34:22,720
Alley, alley, alley, alley, alley, boy in front of the alley.....

358
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,303
Pro, why are you still here?

359
00:34:28,303 --> 00:34:28,944
Huh?

360
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:30,737
Is there something wrong?

361
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,614
What time is it?

362
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:35,712
it's 11:00 p.m.

363
00:34:35,712 --> 00:34:41,554
Oh, so you have an appointment today, don't you? Did you forget or you'll be late?

364
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:42,833
Gosh!

365
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:46,279
I forgot to look at the time, so as soon as I finish collecting here I'll hurry.

366
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:48,809
You don't have to. It's okay. I'll give it to Bombe this way.
It helps.

367
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:51,000
You hurry, you won't be in time.

368
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,288
thank you very much I'll go change clothes first.

369
00:34:53,288 --> 00:34:54,954
Okay, go, hurry.

370
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:57,483
Hey Bombe, can I borrow your motorbike?

371
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:58,708
We're afraid we won't make it in time.

372
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,944
always okay for Kon Prod.

373
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:02,598
thank you

374
00:35:02,598 --> 00:35:04,880
Bye bye

375
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:15,568
and songs from now on It will be a beautiful song.
Touching and touching from our guitarist.

376
00:35:15,568 --> 00:35:23,208
Invite everyone to meet P'Pleum .

377
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:33,079
This song is the song that I like the most.

378
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:39,810
And there is someone who likes this song as well as me.

379
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:49,417
I hope he's happy to hear this song from me.

380
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:54,076
P'Pleum ... P'Pleum .... P'Pleum ....

381
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,839
Let's try listening. This song is called...

382
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,351
Let the North Star guide you

383
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:06,539
Who do you think he's talking about?

384
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:11,200
I think speaking of Prod, I'd rather call it.

385
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:19,298
I don't accept it.

386
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:25,420
He was probably riding a motorcycle.

387
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:38,599
The night seemed dark and starless.
The path of love seems cold and far away.

388
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:44,319
Where must I walk?

389
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:59,079
Who, who, guide me?
And until one day she came in

390
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:06,319
You came to help guide the flickering light

391
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,119
Let there be light.

392
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:53,800
On a starless night

393
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:01,119
You are like a dream

394
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:14,599
It's like a good dream in real life.
She has love to shelter. Let me snuggle.

395
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:20,886
Happier than anyone else
is....

396
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:22,170
hello

397
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,767
Where are you now?

398
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:25,679
Oh, I'm here.

399
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,068
Well, you hurry up and come in.

400
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:29,075
Yes, yes.

401
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:46,480
Light the way, far away, on the days when I had no one. You help fill my heart with warm love. I love you.

402
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,920
The path that used to be dark without any light

403
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:31,880
Love is still bright because of faith.
Because you are the North Star

404
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:41,674
Standing above the heart, above time

405
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:45,280
You are like a dream

406
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,000
It's like a good dream in real life.

407
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:07,527
She has love to shelter. Let me snuggle.
Happier than anyone else

408
00:40:07,527 --> 00:40:13,725
It's like the northern star....

409
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:27,167
Even though it's dark, it shows the way far away.
The day I had no one She helps fill my heart.

410
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:33,079
With the warmth of my love for you

411
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:45,885
The day I had no one left She helps fill my heart.
With the warmth of my love for you....

412
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:27,149
Thank you for coming, North Star.

413
00:41:27,149 --> 00:41:30,000
Woo......

414
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,416
P'Pleum ... P'Pleum.... P'Pleum.....

415
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,807
Hey, what happened to you?

416
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:44,413
I crashed my car

417
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:45,519
Huh?

418
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:48,117
So why didn't you go to the hospital first?

419
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:51,982
I made a promise to him

420
00:41:51,982 --> 00:41:55,440
Who did you promise?

421
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:58,363
Prod

422
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,200
what happened

423
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,686
Even though I've never been with a man. It's not that I can't do it.

424
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:15,237
What? As soon as you're single, you suddenly have a new woman.

425
00:42:15,237 --> 00:42:16,238
It's beautiful too.

426
00:42:16,238 --> 00:42:19,277
Don't let anyone sue you. That he's a naughty child.
Do you have a heart?

427
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:20,603
I already know.

428
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:25,328
What is Prod ?

429
00:42:25,328 --> 00:42:27,904
Working but not conscious at all

430
00:42:27,904 --> 00:42:30,674
So who made you come? Why did you come?

431
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:33,356
Prod said he made a promise to someone.

432
00:42:33,356 --> 00:42:37,479
If the person in Prod 's heart was someone we knew and were close to, what would you do?

433
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:40,119
And you know who?
