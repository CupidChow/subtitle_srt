1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,644
Sroi!

2
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:06,847
Sroi!

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,000
Sroi!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,615
Sroi! Listen to me.

5
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:11,190
Sroi!

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,690
Pleum!

7
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,190
Sroi!

8
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:13,600
Stop holding me!

9
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,351
No!

10
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:14,895
Pleum!

11
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:15,872
Stop holding me!

12
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:18,976
Sroi!

13
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,472
Let me go now!

14
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,490
Plese!

15
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:31,271
Sroi! Listen to me, Please.

16
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:33,837
Let me go now!

17
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:39,114
Sroi!

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,069
I told you it's over, why are you still bothering me?

19
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:45,579
Sroi, Let's go.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,922
We are over!

21
00:00:57,922 --> 00:00:58,600
We are over!

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,205
We are over!

23
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:00,181
We are over!

24
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:00,681
We are over!

25
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,013
We are over!

26
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:07,071
The 20th person.

27
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:11,472
You have been staring for so long, why don't you just go over and talk to him?

28
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:15,504
Tum! You are being annoying to me.

29
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:17,905
Oh! Not again!

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,444
I'm giving you good advice.

31
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:21,330
Yes!

32
00:01:21,553 --> 00:01:23,865
This is a great opportunity for you.

33
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:29,257
I'm over him moving on a long time ago.

34
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,246
7 years ago.

35
00:03:57,246 --> 00:04:00,226
You should try stepping outside of your comfort zone.

36
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,449
I think your relationship has potential.

37
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,482
Yes!

38
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:05,276
Be brave, friend.

39
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:07,276
Just go and tell him you like him.

40
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:09,276
You never know, he might like you too.

41
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,160
Are you guys this serious about your studies?

42
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:13,417
Oh!

43
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:16,210
I think this is all just nonsense.

44
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,185
Don't worry about it.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,570
He'll find someone else soon.

46
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:25,453
He moves on so quickly.

47
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,706
It's unbelievable.

48
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:31,688
Don't you want to try to be a part of his life?

49
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:37,257
So what if I tried before?

50
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,560
It still didn't work.

51
00:04:56,113 --> 00:05:00,226
June 9, 2560

52
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:03,116
The first day we met.

53
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:24,287
Hey! Kick here!

54
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:30,236
Hey!

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,600
Brother!

56
00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:42,294
Brother! Are you Okay?

57
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:43,652
Brother!

58
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:45,341
Pleum! What are you doing?

59
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,189
You missed your kick and messed up your show!

60
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:49,047
Did I do it on purpose?

61
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,440
Let's go. Take him up and let him/her sit down. Go.

62
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:51,470
Go!

63
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:52,802
Be careful getting up, okay?

64
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:54,440
Go! Go! Go!

65
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:56,347
Get up slowly.

66
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:58,881
Can you help me put away the books?

67
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,792
Hold on here so you can lean on me.

68
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:16,027
Jess. Would you mind getting the towel from my bag for me?

69
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:25,059
Pleum! Where would you like us to put this?

70
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:25,990
Put it here.

71
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,040
See you.

72
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:39,400
Brother! I'm sorry.  I wasn't paying attention.

73
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:44,704
How are you doing? Are you Okey?

74
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,882
I'm Okey.

75
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:55,979
Wait a minute! Hold on a minute. Where are you going?

76
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:58,558
Please hand in this assignment to Professor Tom.

77
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:02,960
If the Professor leaves now, my friends might get in trouble.

78
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:05,877
Pleum! Here is the towel you requested.

79
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:06,541
Thank you.

80
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,205
See you later.

81
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,855
This is for you.

82
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:18,855
Don't worry about the assignment, I'll take care of it.

83
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:50,356
Prod, Who are you looking at, huh?

84
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:54,847
Hey, you've been sitting here staring for ages. What's up?

85
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:57,243
If I were him, I would be scared to death.

86
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,980
Is that tree haunting you again? Look at you, shaking like a chihuahua!

87
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:06,623
Is the ghost of my kick haunting you again? Look at you, shaking like a chihuahua!

88
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:22,081
Prod, Come on, fess up! Who's caught your eye?

89
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,750
I'm not hiding.

90
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,463
I'm just watching to see who's playing soccer over there.

91
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:32,135
I've been watching you the whole time, I think I can even recognize your whole family now

92
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,216
Don't act like you don't know what's going on.

93
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:37,200
You told me which 6th-grade senior you like.

94
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:39,528
For what?

95
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,840
Oh, this guy.

96
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Brother, brother.

97
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:46,909
It's quiet. It's quiet.

98
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:53,781
You tell me who you like. I'll shout and call him for you.

99
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,120
Just kidding, I'm just telling you who you like.

100
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,920
How difficult will it be?

101
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,835
Well, I don't know if I like him or not.

102
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,839
I just want to thank him for sending the work to me.

103
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,544
In conclusion, which brother do you secretly like on the field?

104
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,472
P'Pleum with Mathayom 6/2.

105
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:33,267
That favorite guy is at the top of the school.

106
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:40,245
Please, you're playing high school.

107
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,645
I just want to thank him.

108
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,645
How do you thank you?

109
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:50,293
I don't know.

110
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:53,089
I already know.

111
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:54,733
Just buy some water.

112
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:55,663
He's kicking the ball.

113
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:58,153
Whoever finishes kicking the ball must be thirsty.

114
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:58,683
yes

115
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:02,817
Will it be good?

116
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:07,930
Now there are a lot of people. If I buy water for them

117
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:09,852
Wouldn't it be strange?

118
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:11,274
How strange would it be?

119
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,040
I bought him water. I don't like him at all.

120
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,148
Take a break for a moment.

121
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:44,960
Hey, bring this.

122
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,730
Come here.

123
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm delighted. My friend has something to tell you.

124
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Is there something wrong?

125
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,040
Oh, you're the person you kicked the ball at on Friday, right?

126
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:02,876
yes

127
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:06,658
So how are you? Have you recovered yet?

128
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,415
It's gotten better.

129
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,760
So is there anything?

130
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:25,233
I brought water and milk.

131
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:30,608
But you're the one who's hurting.

132
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:36,928
And the injured person brought things to me, isn't this a little strange?

133
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,720
Wait a moment.

134
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:57,959
If you take it, it's considered an exchange.

135
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,480
What should I exchange?

136
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,573
In exchange for the things that the younger sibling bought for the older sibling?

137
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:16,360
Take it. I'll let you take what you're doing.
My sister is hurt. I feel guilty.

138
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:21,689
Okay

139
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:26,409
Let's trade.

140
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,733
You look sharp!

141
00:12:57,589 --> 00:12:58,925
go on

142
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,737
Can I have...?

143
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,039
Hey! do not!

144
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,160
Bring this, I'll punch you right away.

145
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:16,680
Looks like he's jealous.

146
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,679
Raise it as a child.

147
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:35,032
What did Auntie Taew's shop sell that day?

148
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:35,651
Khao Man Gai

149
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:36,537
Is that Khao Man Gai?

150
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:37,037
Are you going to Auntie Taew's shop?

151
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:37,537
Ha! Ha! (Chuckle)

152
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:38,037
Auntie taew's shop

153
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:38,943
Should we try another place?

154
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,443
Uhm!

155
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,730
Should we try another place?

156
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,240
There's nothing I like to eat here.
I'm looking for something with noodles.

157
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,580
Haven't you given it to him yet?

158
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:04,138
I don't dare.

159
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:07,920
He's already graduated.

160
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,120
In a little while, he will go to study at university.

161
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,854
Time passes so fast

162
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:18,727
I've secretly liked him for a long time now.

163
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:20,199
Fighting, my friend.

164
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,720
Don't let the opportunity slip away.

165
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,823
Come on, I'll give it to you.

166
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:32,107
Ha!

167
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:35,938
Human or dog?

168
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,071
Please write well.

169
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,269
Yes!

170
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,527
I'm delighted. Can I please have a shirt cutter?

171
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:55,389
yes

172
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:10,643
thank you

173
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:16,730
This is what I want.

174
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,730
Do you want to kick a ball?

175
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,171
We'd better go play the final ball.

176
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,349
Which team gets shot at doing 10 push-ups?

177
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:39,276
It's probably good to be in a situation like this.

178
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,196
I'm happy to wait for you too.

179
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:28,016
Mr. Jess, why are you delaying like this?

180
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:31,352
Oh, I'm here.

181
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:40,571
You still managed to bring me to meet his brother.

182
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
So why can't I meet him?

183
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:45,773
Oh, that red ant hiding in a bunch of mangoes.

184
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:47,621
It's something.

185
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,913
It means exactly that.

186
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:53,492
It's enough that the two of you don't have to argue.

187
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,240
Those two are the ones who followed me to study here.
Why

188
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,997
Is it the guys' fault?

189
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:12,157
I love my friends, I take care of my friends, and I want to be with them. Friend.

190
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:19,757
Aunt Tum, let's go resign. My friend won't.
I love you already.

191
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,971
Aren't you a little bent on me?

192
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,679
Oh, I'm confused.

193
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,320
Sigh, the two of you are playing too big.

194
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,120
It's been 7 years already?

195
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:14,489
21st boyfriend.

196
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,039
Take it, take it.

197
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,039
Take it, Sroi.

198
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,600
Hey, Pleum, you called until the teacher kicked you out.
You've come out of the room.

199
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,022
So what? I want to clear things up with the Sroi.

200
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:51,779
I won't give up.

201
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:54,002
Hey, am I asking?

202
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:58,126
Is there victory or loss in love?

203
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,746
I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life.
with Sroi

204
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:07,573
I don't want to start over with anyone else, do you understand?

205
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:13,650
I'm delighted. You're just 22 years old. You still have a lot of time left in your life.

206
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,630
Until you die, are you sure?

207
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:20,456
Well, I've chosen it.

208
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,960
You two don't understand. You two don't.
How can you understand me with this love?

209
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,677
Before, I said this.

210
00:22:30,677 --> 00:22:34,864
Hey, now you better go do your duties as your older brother.

211
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:36,926
There's a lot of work waiting for you.

212
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:41,598
No, I'd like to clear things up with the Sroi first.

213
00:22:42,716 --> 00:22:44,754
Hey, I'm asking for it.

214
00:22:45,645 --> 00:22:47,645
It's only been an hour.

215
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:49,645
Do your duty.

216
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:51,645
Let go. Where are you taking me?

217
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,600
Oh, until we can come together, you guys.

218
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,279
If you're delighted, he probably still can't accept it.
Please forgive him.

219
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:17,307
Don't come and preach to me, you jerk.

220
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:22,292
My name is Somchai. Please call in full.

221
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,797
Can you not argue with the younger generation's face?
I'm delighted to do my duty.

222
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:29,400
Let Jess handle it.

223
00:23:30,736 --> 00:23:34,640
Well, we won't have to waste time.

224
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,000
The one who called us to talk today will come.
Let's talk

225
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,003
Regarding activities to welcome children outside the venue

226
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:45,582
What ideas do you guys have?

227
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,005
What do you think? What do you think?

228
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,005
I'll go back.

229
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:58,083
Hey, you can't hurry back now.

230
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,603
If you're in a hurry, please think about it first.

231
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:10,600
Brother, I don't want any activities organized.
It is a base for receiving off-site students.

232
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,760
It violates human rights and is physically threatening.

233
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,313
What do you guys say?

234
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,628
I think that since it is the work of
We must give them the right to decide.

235
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:30,448
OK, then take what you want.

236
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:33,472
So what activities will you do?

237
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,560
Is it a good idea to take the younger generation out to a volunteer camp?

238
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,600
Volunteer camp, what do you do?

239
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,678
Would it be a good idea to help develop schools in remote areas? It will benefit the underprivileged.

240
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,150
A friend suggested this, what do you think?

241
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:06,976
Does anyone agree?

242
00:25:11,831 --> 00:25:13,763
I agree.

243
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:20,120
And what do other people say? The opinion is
Let's have some democracy.

244
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:23,844
I agree.

245
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,718
I'll go first.

246
00:25:49,718 --> 00:25:51,718
Where are you going?

247
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,342
Go find a Sroi at the faculty.

248
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
Hey, wait a minute, I'm delighted.

249
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,732
Khun Jess, please don't stop me. Separation from all things dear and pleasing is suffering.

250
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:04,377
amen

251
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:05,922
Anumodami

252
00:26:05,922 --> 00:26:06,675
Ha!

253
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:07,695
I'm not a monk.

254
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:10,000
Just a little more and you'll be covered in robes. Som!

255
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:14,128
Excuse me, please give me some directions.

256
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:14,944
Hey!

257
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:17,720
What's going on?

258
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:18,713
Hey!

259
00:26:18,713 --> 00:26:19,213
Hey!

260
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:19,713
Wait! Wait!

261
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:22,448
Yes, sir.

262
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:23,322
Where are you going?

263
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:24,970
My friend, where are you in such a hurry?

264
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,470
He hurries home.

265
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,470
But I have to continue working part-time.

266
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,934
Special work

267
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,000
Are you an Entertainer?

268
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
yes

269
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Went to be a waiter at P'Gnaung's restaurant.

270
00:26:36,646 --> 00:26:38,447
And where is the house?

271
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:40,224
It's in the Phatthanakan area.

272
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,000
Phatthanakan

273
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,760
This is a car ride back to Phatthanakan.

274
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,000
And then sat back here again.

275
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,555
yes

276
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:48,880
Please bring me the address.

277
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
okay

278
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,521
(Konprod House)

279
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:01,555
Cough! Cough!

280
00:27:04,495 --> 00:27:09,560
Cough! Cough! Cough! Cough! Cough!

281
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,960
Mom

282
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:20,851
Mom

283
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:25,980
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

284
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:31,252
I told my mother that I was staying still.

285
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,435
You don't have to do anything.

286
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:40,240
I'll stay still until I'm paralyzed.

287
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,195
Mom isn't easily lame.

288
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:49,160
But if you feel sick again, it's going to be bad.

289
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,440
Mom doesn't want to be a burden to her child.

290
00:27:55,181 --> 00:28:00,720
I am the one who must take care of my mom.

291
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:10,583
Mom, why are you crying?

292
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:24,480
Mom needs to get a lot of rest.
Take care of yourself as the Doctor ordered.

293
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,440
Mom will soon be strong again.

294
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:31,519
So, what did you buy for Mom to eat today?

295
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:36,229
Order from Aunt Noi at our original shop.

296
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:42,494
There was seaweed soup, tofu minced pork, and pork sausage salad, not too strong in flavor.

297
00:28:42,494 --> 00:28:47,436
Be careful standing there and supervising the cook like this every day.

298
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:50,000
The cook's spatula will fly in.

299
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,330
No, Little Auntie understands.

300
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:59,399
So mom made everyone suffer as well.

301
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:03,958
Mom, no one thinks like that.

302
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:07,120
Everyone wants a mother to be strong.

303
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:14,375
Well, Mom, I think I'm going to sell this house.

304
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,875
Then I saved up money to buy a new house.

305
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:20,835
The rest of the money will be used to treat my mother.

306
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:25,107
You can't, child.

307
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:33,571
This house is the last treasure that Father left to the two of us.

308
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,942
We use our money to save money.

309
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,480
Mom, I'm going to go change clothes.
First, I won't be able to go to work in time.

310
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,160
Good luck, child.

311
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,640
okay

312
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,355
Cough! Cough!

313
00:29:57,778 --> 00:29:59,497
Don't forget to take the medicine before meals.

314
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,096
yes

315
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:02,309
okay

316
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,100
Probably later.

317
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:11,638
Will it go to work in time?

318
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,279
P’Gnaung, Hello.

319
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:26,159
It's so sharp.
Don't you have a clock at home?

320
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,119
I was busy with work at the faculty.

321
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,119
You don't have to claim it.

322
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,266
I told you, that if you work here, you have to learn how to divide your time.

323
00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:38,888
Because at the shop there are rules and criteria.

324
00:31:38,888 --> 00:31:39,555
Favorite person

325
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:41,163
I'm sorry.

326
00:31:41,163 --> 00:31:42,200
Go, go to work.

327
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,720
Hey, hello, I'm the first customer.
Please come.

328
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,264
Konprod receives customers

329
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:03,987
yes

330
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:06,601
Please come to this table.

331
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:08,601
Bombe, please give me the menu.

332
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:20,679
Please choose the menu first.
I'll come pick up the order soon.

333
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:48,779
Are my breasts beautiful?

334
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:51,492
Which doctor?

335
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:56,509
It's real.

336
00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:59,489
Yes, in the afternoon.

337
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:01,489
That jerk came to see you at the group too.

338
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:04,165
I think it definitely won't give up.

339
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:08,637
Well, fuck him, if I quit, I would quit.

340
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,536
I'm sure you can make up your mind.

341
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:16,008
You probably know me well.

342
00:33:16,677 --> 00:33:19,084
I just want to be sure

343
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:22,198
Frey, I've been thinking about this for a long time.

344
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:28,607
I talked to him and gave him a chance to adjust. But he never did what I asked.

345
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:34,043
As the day progressed it became more and more uncomfortable. I really couldn't stand it.

346
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:39,163
Okay, okay, you've gotten over it, I believe.

347
00:33:39,163 --> 00:33:45,929
But if one day he comes and asks for a chance to improve himself, what will you say?

348
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,081
This morning I almost got hit by bird droppings again.

349
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:07,016
Bad luck today, let me tell you.

350
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:08,749
You believe something strange.

351
00:34:21,844 --> 00:34:22,406
Sroi!

352
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,800
We have something to talk about.

353
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
No, we're done talking.

354
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,020
No, it's not over yet.
Our story isn't over yet.

355
00:34:41,124 --> 00:34:42,400
avoid

356
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:45,469
no

357
00:34:46,182 --> 00:34:47,960
told to avoid

358
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:49,240
Well, no.

359
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,836
You want to get hit again, right?

360
00:34:53,577 --> 00:34:55,039
Sroi!

361
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:57,920
Let Sroi go.

362
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,147
No, we will never let Sroi go.

363
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:05,465
But, Sroi has no longer loved you. Do you know that?

364
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:07,591
Sroi will never stop loving us.

365
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:09,769
We will do everything in our power to bring Sroi back to us.

366
00:35:10,259 --> 00:35:12,445
We will be willing to change anything that Soi wants.

367
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:13,920
She's been watching.

368
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,543
Just changed? If you could change, this kind of thing wouldn't happen.

369
00:35:19,543 --> 00:35:25,800
We humans can't change our natures. Stop dreaming.

370
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,960
Well, just watch and see if it changes or doesn't change.

371
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,040
This time, I'm pleased.

372
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:21,600
I saw this and feel so sorry for you.

373
00:36:22,892 --> 00:36:24,892
And why are you guys going to tell me?

374
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:27,956
I told you not to speak.

375
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:33,079
I'd like to let him know. I've never seen you this pleased before.

376
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,079
Are you still going to say it?

377
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,558
I'm going to study.

378
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:51,296
It's not angry. It's likely to be disheartening. already.

379
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:56,102
If he can make up his mind, why does he sit and count how many boyfriends I'm proud of?

380
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:00,000
Let's go study.

381
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,976
wait a minute

382
00:37:00,976 --> 00:37:02,307
Why?

383
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:04,307
Take the rice off my face first.

384
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,743
Mom took me to buy some snacks. Have you eaten anything yet?

385
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,980
I've eaten.

386
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:36,532
No need to get up, no need to get up to eat in the afternoon. Traditional Thai desserts that my mother likes to eat.

387
00:37:36,532 --> 00:37:40,920
Thank you very much. I don't think so.
It's this difficult.

388
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,904
It's not difficult at all.

389
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:47,976
Has Soi ever returned home?

390
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:52,337
That person is too lazy to sit in the car. Not like your favorite

391
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:58,079
Go back and forth with the university in front of the alley.

392
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:05,240
But I don't know if you please meet the Sroi at
University or not, I don't know.

393
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,359
I didn't talk to my child at all. As soon as I arrived home, I immediately changed my clothes and went back to my part-time work.

394
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,550
I feel sorry for my child. What would you like to do to lighten your child's burden?

395
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,550
And what does Mae pha want to do?

396
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,924
I don't know, whatever little thing I have is enough.
Income comes to support children.

397
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,604
Can't think, but don't say, don't think too much.

398
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:49,350
please!
What do you guys have?

399
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,200
Where are you going in such a hurry? I just finished taking the quiz. I need to celebrate a bit.

400
00:38:57,734 --> 00:39:02,094
We want to liberate each other, let's go together.

401
00:39:02,094 --> 00:39:04,227
Without you, it's not fun.

402
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:09,440
It's not fun without me. Or if I'm gone and there's no one to take the two of you home?

403
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:17,629
Darn, we didn't think like that.
I just want you to take care of me while we're drunk.

404
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:22,896
But I have to go home and buy food for my mother first.

405
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:28,632
Oh, my favorite thing is just this. You call your mother and tell her to take care of it yourself first. Just one meal

406
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,880
If not, I have to go back.

407
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Well, that's fine.

408
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
no

409
00:39:35,661 --> 00:39:39,688
Now, I'll go back and take care of your mother for you.
finish

410
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:43,822
But you have to promise me that you will meet me at P'Gnaung's shop.

411
00:39:46,048 --> 00:39:48,662
Can I go to another store?

412
00:39:48,662 --> 00:39:52,993
Oh, this is the shop. Those of us who are too lazy to go somewhere far away.

413
00:39:53,251 --> 00:39:59,334
Besides, today is a holiday. You're going to travel and support him. You're not lingering from work to drink alcohol.

414
00:39:59,334 --> 00:40:00,480
He doesn't mind you.

415
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,000
Okay, well, then I'll finish my business, and then I'll hurry along.

416
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,673
It has to be like this, my friend. So let's go ahead and open the table and wait.

417
00:40:09,252 --> 00:40:12,904
Well, take it easy, guys. It's already a lot.

418
00:40:13,305 --> 00:40:17,216
See you.

419
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:46,840
What are you complaining about?

420
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,383
I'm not complaining. I'm looking for a way to reconcile the Sroi.

421
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:59,160
Look at all the barons and Pattani ladies. Two Husband and wife want to live together in that relationship...

422
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:05,640
Mr. Somchai, please help me get away from my feet.
Yes, I'm annoyed.

423
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:11,359
You're flattered, you're annoyed, you stick your fingers in your ears.
Keep it.

424
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,045
Do you want to get a tattoo?

425
00:41:15,045 --> 00:41:17,045
This jerk is playing near my feet.

426
00:41:17,045 --> 00:41:20,176
So, have you thought of this summary yet?

427
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:29,226
I think bending is the same as flirting again.

428
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:33,680
Eh, or maybe it's more difficult than flirting again.

429
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,175
Oh, Jet, he likes to raise sails and cause the boat to fail.
Keep going.

430
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:43,670
I don't like pulling leaves, but I like it.

431
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,646
Jerk off

432
00:41:45,225 --> 00:41:47,345
lewd

433
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,017
There's substance.

434
00:41:51,774 --> 00:41:53,701
But you're ridiculous.

435
00:41:55,997 --> 00:42:02,477
Hey you guys, if you don't help me figure out how to make a Sroi.

436
00:42:02,477 --> 00:42:06,920
Can you help me go far?

437
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:15,136
I think we'd better find a place to relax.
I'll think of something.

438
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,590
Where are you going?

439
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:22,639
I'd like to make a suggestion. Shouldn't we go to P'Gnaung's shop?

440
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,890
Go to the temple, and drink alcohol.

441
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yes, I'm in.

442
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,442
I agree. Go to P'Gnaung's shop.

443
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:42,215
Chet, I'll go pick you up at the condo.

444
00:42:42,215 --> 00:42:44,920
Well, it's up to you.

445
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,080
Oh, what about me?

446
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,699
Go yourself.

447
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:01,339
P'Sroi, Did you break up with P'Pleum?

448
00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:04,333
He's too jealous

449
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,769
If it doesn't mean anything to you, then I'm going to ask him out.

450
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:11,081
Something big has happened!

451
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:11,699
I want to talk to Sroi only.

452
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:12,477
Stop right there!

453
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:21,455
I'm going to give her flowers at her faculty and take a photo.

454
00:43:21,455 --> 00:43:23,104
Do you think those flowers are mine?

455
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:25,520
Prod

456
00:43:26,544 --> 00:43:27,140
Hey!
