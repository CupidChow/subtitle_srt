1
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,316
P'Sroi why did you break up with P'Pleum?

2
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:06,858
He's just too clingy, too worried.

3
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:12,165
If there's no meaning anymore, then I'll just go my separate way.

4
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:13,990
Something big happened.

5
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,959
We're going to talk to Sroi.

6
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,600
Stop right there.

7
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,094
Take these flowers to Sroi at the faculty and take pictures with her.

8
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:27,707
Are those flowers mine?

9
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:28,941
Kon Prod.

10
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:31,840
Hey.

11
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,052
Enjoy your meal.

12
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:36,932
Sure.

13
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:41,920
If you want to order anything else, just call.

14
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,246
Sroi, we're sorry.

15
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:00,246
We're really sorry.

16
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:04,999
We promise we'll do everything Soray wants.

17
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,360
It's over, Pleum.

18
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,663
It's not over, Sroi.

19
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,372
Sroi, don't play with us.

20
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:19,314
We're not playing at all. Just go back, Pleum.

21
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:27,162
No! We're not going back until Sroi agrees to reconcile with us. We won't go back.

22
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:29,376
Go, Froy.

23
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:30,201
Prod

24
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,973
Wait, I'll go count the money at the bar myself.

25
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:35,920
Where are you going, Sroi? Let's talk about it first.

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,200
That's the one who doesn't know what he's talking about.

27
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:08,932
Hey!

28
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:10,812
There.

29
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,454
Take him to sleep behind the store in the stockroom.

30
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:35,057
But it's a rule of the store that outsiders are not allowed to sleep inside.

31
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:39,482
But this is my store. It's my rule.

32
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:42,434
Or do you want to let him sleep like this?

33
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:47,781
Then how are we going to run the store? Prod, go.

34
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:49,287
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:53,172
Pleum, go sleep inside.

36
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:57,920
Hey, don't mess with me. Huh?

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,294
Um, I'll go sleep.

38
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:02,374
Hmm.

39
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,751
Hey!!!

40
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:08,060
What are you doing?

41
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,296
Haha, haha, haha.

42
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:11,296
Go on, go on.

43
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:13,494
Hey!

44
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,271
Hey!!!

45
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:19,870
Oh!

46
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,480
I said I can walk.

47
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,174
Why are you fussing? Huh?

48
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:28,124
Oh.

49
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:28,684
Um.

50
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:29,504
Get up.

51
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:30,461
Um.

52
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,303
Um.

53
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:32,954
Um.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,304
Just a little shove.

55
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,356
Hello, P'Jass.

56
00:04:52,356 --> 00:04:53,908
What's up, Kon Prod?

57
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:56,808
P'Pleum is really drunk right now.

58
00:04:56,808 --> 00:04:58,246
He probably can’t go back.

59
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,186
Jess, could you come and pick up Pleum, please?

60
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:02,558
Uh, sure.

61
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:03,958
I’ll go out right now.

62
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:04,758
Okay.

63
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:05,436
Just watch out for a moment.

64
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:07,910
Alright, see you soon.

65
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,428
Sroi, don’t leave us. Don’t go anywhere.

66
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:21,600
Oh, Pleum.

67
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,958
No, no.

68
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,720
Sroi, come back. Come back, please.

69
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,781
P' Pleum, I’m not…

70
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,494
Sroi.

71
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:57,341
Sroi, come back to love each other, please.

72
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:13,000
Will there be a day when I can ask for love like this?

73
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,764
Hoping that one day I will be a guiding star of love for you.

74
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,840
P' Pleum of Kon Prod.

75
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,405
Words of the night looking close to the starlight.

76
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:19,906
Love’s path seems cold and distant.

77
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:24,960
How far must we go?

78
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:32,592
Who will lead me?

79
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:40,097
And one day, when you came in,

80
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:46,689
You came in to help guide the flickering light.

81
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:51,560
Shining a bright spot.

82
00:08:51,640 --> 00:09:01,200
In the starless night.

83
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,959
You are like a dream.

84
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,240
A dream like a good dream in life…

85
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,279
I think Pleum wouldn’t just let go easily.

86
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,084
If we just stay silent, he’ll retreat on his own.

87
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:40,487
Looks like it’s going to be tough.
I think you have to do something.

88
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:41,645
Do what?

89
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:47,491
Find a new girlfriend.

90
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:51,065
I guarantee Pleum won’t be himself anymore.

91
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,246
I’m not ready for anyone yet. It’s tiring.

92
00:09:57,246 --> 00:10:00,536
Then find a fake girlfriend.

93
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:05,028
Where would a girl come from to pretend to be our girlfriend?

94
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:07,921
Guys, we want something real.

95
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:10,764
Also, we don’t want any problems later.

96
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:15,000
Then don’t pick guys. Just date girls together.

97
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,480
And where would girls come from to pretend to be our girlfriends?

98
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,429
It’s us.

99
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:25,836
What’s so hard about that?

100
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:32,573
The closer we are, the easier we understand each other. How about it?

101
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:37,577
Let me think about it.

102
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,290
I’m sleepy.

103
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,401
Sister, a friend asked me to give you this.

104
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:14,743
Thank you.

105
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:15,435
Sure.

106
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:20,989
Are you sure your friend asked me to give it to you?

107
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:23,958
She said she did, so she did.

108
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,363
I think it’s twisted.

109
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:32,583
Well, you do have charm with the same gender as well.

110
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:37,289
Of course, I’m not discriminatory about gender. Whatever works.

111
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:46,093
But the specifications are high: tall, handsome, fair-skinned, and comes from a wealthy family, and also studying engineering.

112
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:50,839
Your same-sex love is just as contradictory.

113
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:09,600
May Sroi follow our plan faithfully. Amen.

114
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,117
Hey, Jess.

115
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:42,760
Hey, Nick.

116
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,632
What's up?

117
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:50,969
Look.

118
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,932
I think Sroi might have a new girlfriend.

119
00:12:53,932 --> 00:13:02,106
Love, my friend, love. It can happen anytime and can fade away anytime too.

120
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:05,545
I can’t believe it.

121
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:09,723
But it’s a picture of two girls holding hands, man.

122
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,568
Well, then it’s even less surprising.

123
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:16,621
It’s not that strange for girls to date each other.

124
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,552
It’s strange.

125
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:22,752
Normally, Sroi dates guys, and now she’s dating a girl.

126
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:24,254
Your house isn’t strange.

127
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:28,255
Have you ever heard of sexual fluidity?

128
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:33,813
In this age, age is just a number, and gender is just a letter.

129
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:38,768
Whether they’re guys or girls, people date whoever they connect with.

130
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:42,409
So, who do you think they’re dating?

131
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:51,238
If I were to guess from the text, it might just be a close friend of hers.

132
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:57,816
Then it’s even less surprising, because they’re close, they know each other well.

133
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:04,025
All love for any man in the world is gone, seriously.

134
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:10,331
Everything in the world comes and goes, rises and falls.

135
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,481
I pity Pleum, man.

136
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,664
Hey.

137
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:21,280
He disappeared.

138
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,346
Hey.

139
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:24,911
What are you pitying me for?

140
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:26,539
Hey.

141
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,048
They don’t want me to say.

142
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:35,199
But Kon Sroi has a new girlfriend, and she’s a girl.

143
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,965
What are you guys oohing about?

144
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,399
Here it is.

145
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,800
Wait, where are you going?

146
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:53,921
I’m going to clear things up.

147
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,429
Idiot.

148
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,951
You, you pouty face.

149
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:02,188
What are you saying?

150
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:03,998
It’s your mouth.

151
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:07,180
What are you saying?

152
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:11,545
Shit.

153
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,282
What’s this?

154
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:28,714
No, Do you have any water?

155
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
Joking.

156
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,693
Spicy?

157
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:39,592
Thought you were mad earlier.

158
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:40,819
Aren't you eating?

159
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,328
Not hungry. Not tasty.

160
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:43,433
Not tasty.

161
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,654
Crazy. We said this place was the best.

162
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:50,544
Sroi, what does “IG” mean?

163
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:53,640
It means just that.

164
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,528
Go where you came from then.

165
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:57,901
It’s not about you.

166
00:15:57,901 --> 00:15:59,945
Why wouldn’t it be about me?

167
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:01,551
Whatever, Froy.

168
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:04,456
Sroi… he’s…

169
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:07,814
There’s no need to say anything more. The truth is the truth.

170
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:10,471
Whoever doesn’t accept it can deal with it.

171
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:13,740
But we ask for a chance, Sroi.

172
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,171
We’re ready to improve ourselves for Sroi, you know.

173
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:24,160
Pleum, the opportunity has passed. Sorry for not giving it to you.

174
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,519
And who is Sroi with now?

175
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,560
The two of us decided to be together.

176
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,987
So, what's your conclusion?

177
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,318
What right do you have to ask me?

178
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:54,060
Considering you, what right do you have to ask me?

179
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,784
Did I steal it?

180
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:56,382
Um...

181
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,629
Even though it said it broke up with you already.

182
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:06,522
Broke up with what? Do you know? It was still sleeping with me when you called, did you see?

183
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:08,464
Shit!

184
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:11,692
Hey, stop it.

185
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:12,363
Whoa!

186
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,874
What's up with you?

187
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,377
This is university. You guys have no right to fight here.

188
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:23,305
You talk too much.

189
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:24,829
Shit!

190
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,980
Hey!

191
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:28,980
Stop!

192
00:17:29,402 --> 00:17:30,324
What's wrong with you?

193
00:17:30,475 --> 00:17:31,999
Your mouth is already big enough, yet you're still barking.

194
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,084
What are you looking at? Mind your own business.

195
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:36,519
Mind your own business.

196
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:43,440
Stop it, just stop! I told you to stop, stop! Don't fight.

197
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:51,440
Suea, take them to see the teacher.

198
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,354
Go.

199
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:53,449
Suea.

200
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:57,061
Why are you following me?

201
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:00,971
Go ahead, go! Come here.

202
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,988
Hey.

203
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,779
No one taught you at home, huh?

204
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,247
Never block with your hands when dogs fight.

205
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:14,306
I thought I'd just help.

206
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:15,762
Help with what?

207
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,709
Help until your mouth breaks like this? Huh!

208
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:18,884
Hey, Pleum.

209
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:21,331
Why do you keep interfering with my brother?

210
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:25,033
Go! Kon Prod.

211
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,239
Take them to the nurse's office.

212
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,619
No need.

213
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:30,217
I'll take them myself.

214
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:35,000
You go see those two. See how the teacher handles them.

215
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,305
Go.

216
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,906
The nurse isn't here. You sit here and wait. I'll get the wound dressing supplies.

217
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:11,852
I'll do it myself better. Let me.

218
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:14,008
What did I say about sitting?

219
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,440
Bring your face closer.

220
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:56,218
Oh!

221
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,535
Um... I'll do it myself better.

222
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:02,115
Stop.

223
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:06,116
With your mouth like this, you still want to present?

224
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,422
Let me do it.

225
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:13,716
Your hand is heavy.

226
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:24,120
I won't say a word. And also, just stay still. I don't like it.

227
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,000
I apologize for the flower incident.

228
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,124
Sorry. Why are you sorry?

229
00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:40,111
Well, I apologize, alright?

230
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,672
Done.

231
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:48,857
You go home and rest.

232
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:52,481
I can't go home yet because I have a presentation about camp locations in the evening.

233
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:56,966
With your mouth like this, you still want to present again?

234
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,889
Your mouth is like this, and you still want to present?

235
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:01,981
Even if you argue, you can’t win.

236
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:06,135
It’s my duty to do it.

237
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:09,679
Whatever, I have to go.

238
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,640
Thank you very much for treating the wound.

239
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,939
Why are you being so stubborn?

240
00:21:26,622 --> 00:21:33,343
I won’t say a word if you want to go back and rest.

241
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:36,172
I have prepared for the work already.

242
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:40,000
I would like to finish, so that we can move forward.

243
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:48,980
If you want to resist, it’s your business.

244
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,409
Don’t be upset later for not listening to my warning.

245
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:58,336
And about the place you proposed.

246
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:04,159
Don’t think it’s easy for us to approve. Understand?

247
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,009
Understood.

248
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:56,154
Hey! Prod, I think you should rest first. I’ll present instead.

249
00:22:56,154 --> 00:23:00,633
Yes, we don’t want to see you stumble before finishing the presentation.

250
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:03,481
It’s okay, I can handle it.

251
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:07,812
Uh… as you wish.

252
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,116
Regarding this stubborn matter, I’ll let it go.

253
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:19,428
You just realized?

254
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,149
I knew first.

255
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:21,649
I knew first.

256
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:22,233
I knew first.

257
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,835
I knew long before.

258
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:24,520
I knew first, got it?

259
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,938
Okey,  I'll go get my friends first. Wait a moment.

260
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:37,204
Fine… you guys are all the same. The three of us together, ugh.

261
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,360
I want you all to know that your duty is important.

262
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,279
When we receive orders, we must do our best.

263
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:59,109
Even if you resist or feel tired sometimes,

264
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:04,048
You can’t refuse an assigned order.

265
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:12,984
Except if you can’t handle it. I won’t say anything more about it.

266
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:18,226
You can’t find help or ask others for assistance,

267
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:23,527
But you must be sure that you can’t handle it.

268
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:25,177
Understood?
Do you understand?

269
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:26,769
Understood, sir.
Understood, sir.

270
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:29,668
Good.

271
00:24:30,827 --> 00:24:36,517
Nick, Somchai, listen to the presentation from our younger brother.

272
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,599
About the campsite location.

273
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,690
Hey, you!

274
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,791
Just toss it to me.

275
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:46,720
Okay, I'll handle it.

276
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:57,220
Prod, it's super intense.

277
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,549
Even got punched and still rushing to present the location.

278
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:05,576
If it doesn't get done, the seniors will take over, you know?

279
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:07,980
Never heard of it, huh, Seua?

280
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,505
But it's trying its best. Shouldn't we reward it a bit?

281
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:17,193
A smooth talker like this shouldn't get anything.

282
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:20,200
That's enough, Pleum.

283
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,953
Don't see anything admirable about it.

284
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:28,700
Just a smooth-talking kid trying to win.

285
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,702
You're overthinking it, Pleum.

286
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:36,679
Prod, it's doing its best with its job as always.

287
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:38,826
I'm off.

288
00:25:38,826 --> 00:25:40,175
Where are you going?

289
00:25:40,175 --> 00:25:44,151
To buy water.

290
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:47,689
Oh, you just ate before coming here.

291
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:50,440
That's my business.

292
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:32,320
So, that's all the information I have to present.

293
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,286
Uh, thanks. Prod send all the data to the group chat later.

294
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:41,043
I'll go talk to the teacher myself.

295
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:42,652
Sure thing.

296
00:26:42,652 --> 00:26:48,115
Okay, does anyone want to add anything before I do?

297
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:51,513
Nope.

298
00:26:51,513 --> 00:26:54,005
Why are you so mean to your friends?

299
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:58,333
Because what it presented was perfect, that's why.

300
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:02,887
Okay, nothing else then.

301
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,124
What's next?

302
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:09,960
Then let's split and head home.

303
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,260
Huh? Huh!

304
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,836
Uh, where did Softie go to buy water?

305
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:23,114
To Mars, apparently.

306
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:26,360
Still not back.

307
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,919
Your's bag.

308
00:27:42,184 --> 00:27:43,807
What's up?

309
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:44,957
Huh?

310
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:48,679
Open it up, maybe there's something good.

311
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,100
What's up?

312
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,544
Can we?

313
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:55,127
Huh?

314
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,030
We don't drink chocolate milk.

315
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,348
You don't remember, huh?

316
00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:01,553
Then whose is it?

317
00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:04,954
Oh!!! It's in your bag, so it must be yours.

318
00:28:04,954 --> 00:28:07,355
But I didn't buy it.

319
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:09,822
Did you ask someone else to buy it?

320
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:13,679
Nope.

321
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,600
Then whose is it?

322
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,263
I know.

323
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:25,217
Whose?

324
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:26,980
Doraemon's.

325
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,196
Hey!

326
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:29,969
Don't blame me. I knew all along.

327
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,533
There's nothing here.

328
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:37,089
Hey, why don't you open your bag? Maybe someone left something for you.

329
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:37,759
Um...

330
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:47,613
The smooth talker ends up drinking chocolate milk too, to stop whining.

331
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:51,069
Is that so, Peepluem?

332
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,808
Um, you know who.

333
00:28:53,808 --> 00:28:55,024
Who?

334
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,704
Doraemon.

335
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,472
Just kidding.

336
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,216
Oh!

337
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,577
I remember! I used to eat my mom's handmade boiled rice packets.

338
00:29:31,577 --> 00:29:36,105
The taste was deliciously sweet and fragrant. Just talking about it makes my mouth water.

339
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:41,060
Mom, let's make boiled rice packets. I'll sell them at the shop.

340
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,824
Would that be good?

341
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,568
Delicious food like that, anyone would enjoy eating.

342
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:50,617
Mom doesn't have to make a lot. Just what she's capable of.

343
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:58,913
Um, but if I have to go to the market myself, please know, please don't be upset.

344
00:29:58,913 --> 00:30:03,114
Um, yes...

345
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:05,256
I'm worried about Mom.

346
00:30:05,256 --> 00:30:12,239
Mom doesn't have to worry. Right now, Win Motorsai Soi Paksoi goes to buy things for us.

347
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:17,381
Mom just makes a list, then he goes to buy things and brings them back for us.

348
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:19,891
Can it really be done like that?

349
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:21,327
Yes.

350
00:30:21,327 --> 00:30:22,810
In an instant.

351
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,480
Just like that.

352
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:38,080
Hello! Hey, Ad! Um, it's me, Ring. Come to my house for a bit.

353
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,580
Here.

354
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,485
At my sister's house.

355
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:41,713
Prapha's house.

356
00:30:41,713 --> 00:30:44,724
Um, come buy something for us.

357
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:48,080
Um, hurry up!

358
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,982
Mom, bring paper quickly.

359
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:55,987
Go get paper to make a list.

360
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,776
Then he'll go buy things.

361
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:03,189
We do what we can do. Just 20 or 30 is enough.

362
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:06,123
I'll give them out to people nearby.

363
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:10,000
I also want some.

364
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,836
See? Nowadays, nothing is too complicated.

365
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:19,336
Yeah.

366
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,361
If that’s the case, I’ll stir-fry the rice with coconut milk first.

367
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:25,250
Sure, I’ll help cut the pandan leaves.

368
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,639
Thank you so much.

369
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,368
Are you here, son?

370
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:41,994
Yes, Dad.

371
00:31:41,994 --> 00:31:44,635
Mom thinks you’re going to work again.

372
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:45,603
Is that so?

373
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:49,354
Here, bought this rice for Mom first.

374
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:54,421
Mom said that if you’re not busy, just call her and she’ll take care of herself.

375
00:31:54,421 --> 00:31:55,619
It’s okay, Dad.

376
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:57,290
I’m already at work.

377
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,690
Let me go change clothes first.

378
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,937
Wait, want to try some boiled rice? Test your appetite.

379
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:06,147
Is this from aunt's Waan?

380
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:12,919
Yes, it is. Try it, is it delicious?

381
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,320
Wow, it’s really delicious.

382
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:25,915
Sweet, soft, perfect in every way. It’s coconut milk at its finest.

383
00:32:25,915 --> 00:32:29,268
Let me go change clothes first.

384
00:32:29,268 --> 00:32:35,200
Um, uh, um, uh, the cost of boiled rice.

385
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,079
What does that mean, Mom?

386
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:19,863
Prod, what did you hit, son?

387
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:22,324
Mom still hasn’t answered my question.

388
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:25,035
Mom’s going to make boiled rice packets to sell.

389
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:27,006
What about you, son?

390
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:31,831
It’s just typical sibling squabbles. Then I stepped in to intervene, and got accidentally hit by my child.

391
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:34,492
Later on, I won’t do it like this again.

392
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:36,615
Yes, sir.

393
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:40,534
So, what does Mom think about making and selling boiled rice?

394
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:43,189
Well, I’ve already told you, Mom.

395
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:48,991
Mom doesn’t sell them herself, son. It’s aunt's Waan. She comes to pick them up and sells them at her shop.

396
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:51,390
But it might make Mom sick.

397
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,196
Mom’s not doing anything strenuous, son. She’s just doing a little.

398
00:33:55,196 --> 00:34:01,665
Prod, Mom just wants a small income to help with medication expenses.

399
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,938
Are you out of medicine already, Mom?

400
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:07,277
And when do you have to see the doctor again, Mom?

401
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:11,560
In another 3-4 days, son.

402
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,760
Prod, Mom apologizes for lying to you about the boiled rice.

403
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,496
But when Mom sees you enjoy it, she’s happy.

404
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:28,005
Mom just wants others to enjoy it and be happy like you, son.

405
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,579
Yes, Mom.

406
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:34,560
I’ve already told Mom about the household matter.

407
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,695
Mom said, “Mom’s still hanging in there.”

408
00:34:39,695 --> 00:34:50,040
Well, then Mom has to promise me that if she can’t handle it, she’ll stop.

409
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,302
Okay.

410
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:52,653
Yes, sir.

411
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:25,191
Oh.

412
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,800
Then where will you find money to treat Mom’s illness?

413
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,995
Walking around like this, when will I get a chance to tell… How?

414
00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:22,838
This zone is great.

415
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:26,018
I say I like you.

416
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,605
Hey, Prod.

417
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:30,635
Let me help clean up.

418
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:32,868
Hey! Jess.

419
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:37,687
Help your brother there. Will you share the wages with her?

420
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:41,029
I’ve got a heart, unlike you.

421
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:46,880
Um, I’ll just clean up myself. My hands might make a mess anyway.

422
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,150
Wait.

423
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:59,410
Are you not taking any orders? I have to go collect things behind the shop.

424
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:03,136
Then I’ll have a friend bring the menu and then come pick up the orders.

425
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:06,612
The customers are right there. They’re service staff, but they lack service, huh?

426
00:37:06,612 --> 00:37:14,430
Kun Pleum, where are you going to eat the dog?

427
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,669
Kun Pleum.

428
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:18,376
Where are you going to eat the dog?

429
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:20,688
Even if you lick someone else, you’re all over the place.

430
00:37:20,688 --> 00:37:21,927
Bite!

431
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:25,119
Uh, that’s it.

432
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,916
Um, Prod, take the stuff to store.

433
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:32,503
Okay, I’ll have a friend come pick up the orders.

434
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:33,975
Wait.

435
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:36,894
Take me to the bathroom.

436
00:37:36,894 --> 00:37:43,963
Pleum, are you crazy? You walked straight to the bar, then turned left. The bathroom is on the right.

437
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:50,061
You slipped and hit your head on the floor. You were so out of it.

438
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:54,065
I told you, then the dog’s spirit followed.

439
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:56,376
So it licked others all over like this.

440
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:57,896
Oh! Bite!

441
00:37:57,896 --> 00:38:00,116
Uh, bite. That’s it.

442
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:02,296
Don’t be cocky. Got it?

443
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:05,673
And why can’t you take me there?

444
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:13,767
Uh, or maybe we’re too close, so you didn’t see my head. Choose to act like that.

445
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:16,881
I didn’t say anything at all.

446
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:21,720
Whatever, just take me there, whichever way.

447
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,158
What’s with it?

448
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:36,631
Jess, why do you have to make a big deal out of it?

449
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:39,972
Well, I’m annoyed.

450
00:38:39,972 --> 00:38:43,199
Alright, where are we going then?

451
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,136
Uh…

452
00:38:44,136 --> 00:38:46,561
I’m tired.

453
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:50,040
Just sit here.

454
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,638
You can go straight ahead.

455
00:38:58,638 --> 00:39:01,060
Wait.

456
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,682
Who told you to go?

457
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:04,226
I didn’t say anything.

458
00:39:04,226 --> 00:39:10,195
I’m waiting here. Finish your business, then I’ll…

459
00:39:10,195 --> 00:39:11,570
For…

460
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,162
I have to go back to work.

461
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:15,816
Command.

462
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:27,897
Hey! Who said to go to the bathroom?

463
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,400
Put on a mask and breathe out, huh?

464
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,895
You can breathe normally. It’s not difficult.

465
00:39:44,895 --> 00:39:48,224
Are you done with your business, older brother? I have to get back to work.

466
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:53,187
I think you should take a break. Let it excel.

467
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:55,187
Come here.

468
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,204
If you’re going to tease me again, I won’t listen. I’ve argued with you a lot today.

469
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,693
I have to go to work.

470
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:10,955
I don’t have as much free time as you do.

471
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:14,199
And I hope I don’t have to take you to the table.

472
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:17,589
You should be able to find your own way back.

473
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:20,267
Get up here.

474
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:22,814
Go fast.

475
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,400
You’re a smooth talker.

476
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,896
Should get slapped twice.

477
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:37,368
Fine, but I’ll do it after work hours.

478
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:43,333
Or if you can’t wait, feel free to leave first.

479
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:48,629
Then we can reschedule for another time that suits you.

480
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:50,005
Oh!

481
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:53,498
What are you doing, older brother?

482
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:56,404
Don’t talk too much. Understand?

483
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:58,776
And if you want to go to work, go.

484
00:40:58,776 --> 00:41:04,429
But in the future, don’t make me pick you up again after you fall.

485
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,429
Brother… uh…

486
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,264
Terrible, aren’t you, Prod?

487
00:41:29,264 --> 00:41:32,068
Tae is not feeling well. It can’t sing.

488
00:41:32,068 --> 00:41:38,521
Oh, then you try calling that Moak, let it sing before the time.

489
00:41:38,521 --> 00:41:41,474
Moak, it’s singing at another store now.

490
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:43,156
What should we do?

491
00:41:43,156 --> 00:41:47,836
Hey! It’s your friend. Your twin.

492
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:52,268
Your twin, come help sing first.

493
00:41:52,268 --> 00:41:56,965
Your twin is too nervous. Do you want to risk it?

494
00:41:56,965 --> 00:42:00,494
Darn it, what should we do now?

495
00:42:00,494 --> 00:42:00,994
Oh.

496
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:06,956
What song, Brother? Kid from Sroi something.

497
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:09,317
This isn’t the time to joke. Are you messing with me?

498
00:42:09,317 --> 00:42:13,063
I’ll shoot, I’ll shoot. You talk, I’ll shoot.

499
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,132
I see. No singers available.

500
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,973
Don’t want it? You want all the guests to leave?

501
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:22,927
Alright, friends, this is your group.

502
00:42:27,828 --> 00:42:29,828
In the evening.

503
00:42:29,828 --> 00:42:31,420
The song we have to share.

504
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,880
Brother, what are you doing around here?

505
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,861
Why are you standing there? Come inside.

506
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:36,002
Huh?

507
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:39,411
I’m asking for real. Why did you follow me?

508
00:42:39,411 --> 00:42:43,280
I followed you because I wanted to ask something.

509
00:42:46,361 --> 00:42:49,708
I have something to talk to that Kon Prod.

510
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:52,337
You speak.

511
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:55,079
Private matters.
