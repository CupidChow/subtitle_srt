The tiger brought the gun. The tiger brought the gun.

that person.

49
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,720
Do you believe it or not? It's a saying that K engineers have been saying for a long time

50
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:19,000
. Believe it or not, because engineering gear is important. With many of us, if we don't have engineering gear, we would say

51
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,680
I can't say for sure that we are

52
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,240
engineers.

53
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440

87
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,720
Let's do it together for the final scene of the story. Let everyone get to know all of our actors.

88
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,880
Yes, I have a question. I have a question about the character. Let's go a little deeper into what this character is like.

89
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,959
How did it come about? What is the story like? What are the characters? Let's start from here, my favorite person first.

90
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:29,680
Yes, he will have an affair, which is called having a lot of problems. Having to live with two mothers is when we break up.

91
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,560
Go home and change into your child's work clothes. Serving at P'Nong's shop, and it is.

92
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,000
They are called seniors as well. The schedule also includes every activity in life.

93
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,720
That is, it will be chaotic, doing all this and that. You have to take care of this and that.

94
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,279
People who truly love and smile are hard to come by when Being with the person we love very much is a character that we have.

95
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,800
It's always been one love since childhood, that's right. It's that P'Pumpue has liked her since childhood.

96
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,720
So, I've always liked it. Is it a person who loves only one person? Personally, I'm delighted.

97
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,720
This is quite the opposite. What a neat, cute person.

98
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,399
I'm sorry, but I'm happy that he will have a sense of identity. The lead is a bit impulsive, his mouth doesn't quite match his heart.

99
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:25,360
Speaks like a dog, a bit teasing and like that he rarely expresses his own feelings

100
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,680
Will be a person who friends around you will feel that Like, this guy is very spoiled.

101
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,720
Maybe it's because of the background of the house that That he is a person who is a little like your child or something.

102
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,839
My parents let me live alone and have a house. Living alone, living alone all the time.

103
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,399
So it's like taking care of yourself all the time. If this type of personality was really born

104
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,639
People watching will be able to feel that the character of I'm really impressed. I've had feelings for my favorite person for a long time.

105
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,480
But he's stubborn and has that style. Yes, I made it a mess.

106
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:07,600
Between being delighted with my favorite person. Brother Jet is better for Jet's character.

107
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:15,199
Yes, Jett will be a person with a quiet personality. I always hope for the best with my favorite person. If asked about my intentions.

108
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,120
No matter what the background is, Jay seems like he's happy at home. I have quite a bit of status. I was trained to

109
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,600
be a little bit Skyy. I saw that his character Jade is very happy and connected.

110
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,240
Why is this? Why? Because The character Jet is Pleum Tang's close friend.

111
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:40,040
But when I was in high school, I just happened to like my favorite person. The same people, when they are pleased, bully people who are hurting us.

112
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Will always come out to protect and take care of you, to the point where You can take a chance and be delighted with us.

113
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,680
I'm really worried about people who are in pain and tend to fight each other. Many rounds later, we met the twins.

114
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,240
Our character, who initially played his role What is it called? It's already a fading cap.

115
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,000
Taking on the role of twins in this story is a must. Like Pan and Pong, I'm playing the role.

116
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,679
It's the year I'm going to be your friend. Mr. Ek is like being a friend of your favorite person.

117
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,880
What my favorite person said is that my favorite person is like a person who has problems. I mean, I'm a quiet person and I'm quiet.

118
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,760
You have to wait like an entertainer. Dramas that are going to promote something like that, just wait and see.

119
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:27,280
Sculpt and wait like a matchmaker for Our hero is also a matchmaker for

120
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,160
these two people, which is more than last year. Our characters will be fun characters.

121
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,320
And then kept encouraging No to get along with P'Pleum. Whatever you get, don't be silly, it's all about cheering.

122
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,440
The story and characters are like this. At the end of this character's ending, he will

123
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,120
Where do you go? Actually, I have a secret crush. There is one senior who has a crush on each other.

124
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,679
In the end, we ended up with P'Suea and they didn't end up together. So we ended the pair too. It's like there's a crab there, right?

125
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,520
There was no crab at all, so later it was ok. Well, if there is a model in the story, there will be a model.

126
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:11,840
Secretly having a crush on each other, why don't you go sit and send a tiktok? Which pose, hello, the spa will be a little spa.

127
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,840
How are you? Brother Suea, my character. This one is of a tiger. It's also a character.

128
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,440
People who might watch him call him not very meaningful, but Actually, this is a person who keeps details.

129
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,840
of friends and are observant, whether Is it a pleasure or is it the intention itself? We will wait like this.

130
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,320
I always look at him to see if he has any behavior. It's strange, why is there a problem?

131
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,120
What kind of sound does the mouth make? It will be the same thing. It's like we're waiting to work together. Sometimes we secretly do it.

132
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,919
It's like collaborating with these two people as well. Make everything feel better.

133
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,080
We can coordinate with each other better, even though It's like he's the clown in the group, but there are.

134
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,840
The truth is, I saw that my younger sister said that in the end, How do you really like each other as well?

135
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,799
Oh, I've been secretly looking for this for a long time, but hey. Will it work? In the end, it's like tying a bundle.

136
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,440
Gather it together. Gather it together. Gather it tight. Yes, right at once. Oh, let's do 2, or do 2?

137
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:14,679
Wow, that's amazing. It's not normal. Brother Suea, what's going on? Oh, we, we chased the gang, we chased the gang, it's been a good year.

138
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:20,360
It's better to go over there, Brother George. We are also friends in the group.

139
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:27,880
I'm delighted that it's a group of heroes. In the story, it's more like secretly liking and secretly liking.

140
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,400
I secretly like friends in the same group. There was a little bit of resentment but I kept it in mind.

141
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,799
I feel it and act like I'm cheerful. In general, who is this person I secretly like?

142
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:50,880
This should be right there. I secretly like you. It's Chet, the funny character of Year 4, P'Somsongme.

143
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:59,159
My name is Chai. Hello, I'm Ice. I also play. It's Somchai in the drama.

144
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,919
He's a funny jokester who has a lot of great lines. This is cool for the audience to follow.

145
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,000
I will come in and be a character and be a person. Be still. I'm a little small. And then I'll be.

146
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,520
I am a Dhamma fan. I go to the temple and drink alcohol. It's about that, to me, that's important.

147
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,000
The character of Somchai will come out clearly. Yes, in terms of dressing.

148
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,880
Other people don't wear shirts under pants. I'm 4 years old and neat like this. Oh wow.

149
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,200
I've never seen it before, just saw it in Somchai's role. This is what I consider to be a character.

150
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,799
Which is quite similar to myself as well. The story of Mr. Somchai's character.

151
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:44,320
And then I'll crack jokes with Khun Suea and P'Not. It's amazing, I had fun too.

152
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,400
Yes, I try to follow and see what the viewers see through. Come until the end and you will feel like you have Somchai.

153
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,000
The characters are quite clear. Girls' mode would be better, starting with that.

154
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,360
Our little lady has come to start. Hello. Yes, Pure. I play the role of Pie in the series.

155
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:11,320
Nia Pie will be a child-like character. I secretly like it. So, do I secretly like it or not?

156
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:18,240
I'm pleased, I like it, and I flirt with it. Do you like or admire the person you admire? Do you like the person whose name you admire?

157
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,960
Oh, I like people named Pleum. I flirt with Pleum like that. What do you buy? What do you give? It's like this.

158
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,360
It's like Sai Pei too. Well, it's Sai Pei and it's like that. It's been a while since I liked the story.

159
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,080
And then suddenly go to a point that makes you feel like I have to stop, that's enough.

160
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:47,120
When I saw that I was impressed, he followed my favorite person. We're not in their sight.

161
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:55,480
And so I retreated myself, so I had to give in. Like this, we're confused, so we're willing to back off.

162
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:03,600
It's like a beautiful heroine. Coming to the story. This couple is beautiful, our Yuri couple.

163
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,720
Who should I start with? Let's start with Bom before Bom. Yes, Bom, and the role is Foy.

164
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:23,360
Yes, yes, bom bom, fighting as a foy, it's for me. Foye means that he will always be by Soi's side.

165
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,559
And when the necklace is sad or stressed? Whatever happens from Pum, we will be ready to go.

166
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:37,600
Ready to scold, ready to slap, ready to hit everything. No matter how sad the necklace is, we will wait for it.

167
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,159
What is it like to be a consultant and always be there for you? It's like this: I twisted it into a necklace.

168
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,840
Yes, actually the character, Er Soi, will be a person. A woman who is very feminine, don't be fooled.

169
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,159
It's clear that I was an ex-boyfriend before. Playing an ex-girlfriend, yes, but I feel like I am.

170
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,400
Not happy with this love at all I want you to stop fighting with us for once.

171
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,480
Oh, and there's Foy who is a close friend. Like giving advice and staying by my side until the end.

172
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:12,720
That is, I have come to like him too. I think that this couple, these two people, Soi and Foy, is love.

173
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,720
What caused this to happen? Well, if you ask the character of Soi, Bam thinks it's cute.

174
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,360
It will be because of the way he understands us. And he cared more about us than Ken.

175
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,880
It requires understanding and not. What do you really want? What is it?

176
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,200
with us in every situation, whether we break up with Pleum quarreled with Pleum or was there any kind of problem?

177
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,960
Like, he would just be next to me, so I thought. that love should come from understanding it

178
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,679
It's like the thing that I'm delighted about is the necklace. It's not right, it's like we really want it.

179
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:51,360
I'm sorry, but if I can let it go, I consider it a matter. Like love from another perspective.

180
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,600
Our story would like to be presented and told. which we can see in real life a lot, love

181
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,200
that arises from closeness, from understanding From a love relationship that started with friends

182
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,400
Before, there were many things in society in our lives. It is another representative of love that

183
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:15,039
Very good. Let's get into the game. Ours is the name "Peum Favorite Person".

184
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:24,400
Therefore, we will let everyone answer. For each question, who do you admire and which scenes do you like the most?

185
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,360
Finally, give me time to think, give me time to think about who I'm missing. This is the character who loves the drama. Who are you excited about?

186
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,399
Where can we go and look at the things we enter? The scene itself, well, who should I start with? Let's start with it.

187
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:45,440
Pee Suea is better than Tiger's if If you ask me who you admire, it means I admire you. I'm

188
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:53,039
already 1 point, viewers. Yes, I have. Her favorite person and her favorite person is the hero.

189
00:24:53,039 --> 00:25:00,159
That's like, why, why, why do my favorite people have to get lost? I love him even though he looks mean. Don't be.

190
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:07,840
That it's mean-spirited and charming if you ask. Which scene do you like? What is your favorite scene?

191
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,440
Which scene was a surprise to me? I didn't think so. I'm impressed. He'll be able to play like he really does.

192
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,600
That size is IEE type.

193
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:25,919
Like bringing water and giving it a discount, everyone is confused. Really shocked at the scene where water was poured on the face of the scene where water was poured on the face.

194
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,760
This water in the face makes everyone say it's a shame. It's true. I'm really pleased with this scene.

195
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:39,320
Later, when I make it, Pump will be delighted with you. Suea and Phi are two people I'm impressed with.

196
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,320
Kanpae is an actor who's really good at acting. When the hypothetical model is good at playing, we enter the scene as well.

197
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,880
I feel like it's easy and it's all fun. So I'm delighted with these two. As for the scene,

198
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,399
Which is probably the scene that was stolen by Brother Suea? The pants go straight to the waterfall, so we can

199
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:02,200
Playing in the water too, that scene I never thought would happen. I had to wear a small pair of pants and they disappeared.

200
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,600
And this is holding up here.

201
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:16,320
These pants are here. That is, please, please. It's the best. I'll continue if I'm really pleased.

202
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,240
Many people are delighted with the story, but if you like it the most That's the way I like P' Suea.

203
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Because Brother Suea is like in the story, he is a person. Who keeps other people's details, is it someone who cares?

204
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,360
A real-life friend, Brother Suea is as well. If you see my eyes are dry, what do you want me to give you with eye drops?

205
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,080
Don't be confused, it means you feel impressed. My heart is with P' Suea the most, but I'm happy for everyone.

206
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,799
Yes, my favorite part is the scene that I like the most. I like the scene. I'm glad I got slapped. I really liked it. I got slapped a lot.

207
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:52,799
There are a lot of them. I like when the waterfall falls. Hey, when it rains. OK, let me be your favorite.

208
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,480
She saw that both her brothers were delighted to be slapped and saw Burned and wet with water. I like it a lot. I'll like option 2

209
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:07,520
more. I like you. I like you. I take you for granted. I'm saying, OK, skate for me, please.

210
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:16,679
In short, if you were to be the favorite person, ask for the favorite person. It must be good. This one, this one, is very strong,

211
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:23,200
very strong, so it means that it's your favorite person. That's right, it's your favorite person.

212
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,840
It's not a game, it's a game of pleasing people. Please, please, please, please.

213
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:41,679
And if you ask me which scene is your favourite? Well, I like every scene where I get along with the protagonist.

214
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:53,039
Gundam, this guy refuses to get out of character. It inherited that character and came to Mr. Ek.

215
00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:01,760
We are very cute. Who do you admire? You must be delighted. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

216
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:08,320
I'm delighted because I feel that When I have a scene with him or something like that.

217
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,360
Hey, it feels like it's good. It's good. In this way, we don't feel like we are cut.

218
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,559
We really feel like we're the favorites and you know. I feel like this is what I'm really pleased about.

219
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:25,320
Hey, what's your favorite part about the scene? I like every scene that Khun Somchai has played.

220
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:34,320
because I like his gayness in What is the matter of character speech that normal people have?

221
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,960
He did it. Khun Somchai won't do it and will break out again. On the one hand, there is no one who likes to buy clothes from any store.

222
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,799
Like, if you put it in your pants, it's not there anymore. Like it's Dharma Dhamma, I feel like I like him.

223
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:52,519
Yes, it's really great. What a great character. Taken from the director, the design director is

224
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,640
This character is very special. Hey Mr. MVP, you too have come to me.

225
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,559
Yes, what am I pleased with? Actually, I am very pleased. Show everyone here because I know.

226
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:09,279
I feel like many people are still new to this show. This is the first time. Some people already have work.

227
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,679
It has come down to the style of shooting the series. I've never encountered someone like this before.

228
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,720
Difficult filming techniques, but everything It came through and I felt impressed.

229
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,760
I feel like we see development only in queues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. I see a lot of development.

230
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,640
It's been going up every day for the past month. I feel like everyone is very busy with everyone's work.

231
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,640
Developed and saw very clear growth. Yes, but if I had to choose 1 person, it would be my game.

232
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:43,240
I have to choose my favorite person. Her favorite and she is Napoleon because of the scene.

233
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,640
I often go with my younger sister and there are scenes that are impressive. There were many scenes where we participated and felt

234
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,799
I think Ye Nong sent it very well. Please send it. Whichever scene is the scene after rehearsal ends.

235
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:02,919
So let's stop playing. Just when we went there, a car crashed and left us everywhere.

236
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:09,679
It is the story of a favorite person whose car overturned. He came to know that with a promise he came.

237
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,440
What are you looking for at me? You're like an inner. It's very full because it's like you said yes.

238
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,440
It is about our promise with real life. It is a person who says any word, that word, whatever.

239
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,919
Nah, but more like sticking to the promise. And when I'm a favorite person, if a normal person sprinkles the wind,

240
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:30,159
I went to the hospital before going to the doctor but my favorite person didn't. Yes, it was a promise, so I had to take it myself.

241
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,039
I came to see Pleum at the event and she acted in that scene. I mean, you sent me a lot of emotion.

242
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:42,360
That is, when I first intended to play, I thought Well, according to the mood, it's really enough to play.

243
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,519
And then the fusion was broken because the younger one was able to send emotion. It's very pitiful, so I'm impressed by that.

244
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,080
It flows a lot. Many people who like it should join in. Feel the sadness and fierceness of

245
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,679
The thing that I'm delighted about that comes out of this is that You delivered well. This is the scene where I released it.

246
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,720
The next person, our Nong Soi, also likes it. That is, I'm pleased first, I'm pleased first, I'm pleased, right? I'm pleased.

247
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
That is, I like the characters.

248
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:17,039
Yes, it's a character that everyone sees. I felt that it was cute and then he smiled.

249
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,000
You can do it by being yourself. Like this, we still feel like this.

250
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,519
Oh, I see how cute this is. Wait, if the director still has time

251
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:33,960
Because there is still 1 day of shooting left, change pairs. Is it okay at the end to change from Foy to Somchai?

252
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,120
I don't think at all. No, I don't think at all. This question is not finished. I'm just delighted. But if you like it, you must.

253
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:47,000
I like Poi already. That's right. And uh. As for any podak, my favorite scene is probably the first one.

254
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,039
It was raining and I got slapped in the face and forgot that's why. I feel like it's something I've never taken before.

255
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:01,200
I had never filmed a scene before, or I had never filmed a scene before. Both of these things made me feel like we weren't.

256
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,399
Know how to play and what not to do. Nah, but when it seems like I get along with Kimmon,

257
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,080
Oh, okay, he taught me many things that, yes, it must It's like this. What should I play?

258
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,480
Like, I really like the attitude of everyone on the team. He's full of work because it's raining.

259
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,720
For whatever reason, don't be fooled. That scene is really a slap. The sound was loud. The rain didn't make the sound of the rain.

260
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,840
Yes, the sound of the rain can't take care of it. It hit very hard so I liked

261
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
it.

262
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:40,600
Next, it's for Poi. I'm very pleased with Lev Scene and necklace because at first I didn't think I would

263
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:47,039
Plays like a cute Peleph Scene. To or like there's a smoothness or something like that.

264
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,200
This is to look at the pictures when we finished taking them. Yes, but that's what I knew, right?

265
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:59,760
Isn't this so great? Or will he not be smooth? Is that a little bit? Why don't we know the same thing?

266
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:07,480
Well, we know another way, so it's okay if you ask, "Who do you have a crush on?"

267
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:16,639
Yes, I am. Actually, I have a crush on everyone.

268
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:23,720
But Brother Suea is It's like a very cute personality, taking care of everyone, taking care of

269
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,639
everyone, that is, giving advice to everyone, please give me a scene.

270
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:37,480
Somchai jumped into the water very recently today. So how is it? I haven't seen A. It's his older brother.

271
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:44,720
Really slippery, yes slippery Really, truly, I feel like I've put in a good effort.

272
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,200
Let's go find

273
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:58,240
Somchai, and it's Somchai's. Well, when I looked at it, I was delighted with it.

274
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,240
I'm also a character and I'm quiet too. A little silly, I'm pleased with P'Note.

275
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:12,679
Yes, because jokes will be thrown around. It was fun and I was pleased with Brother George. We threw it together.

276
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:18,760
There were 3 of us together. We couldn't go anywhere so we just looked. Let's stop stealing each other's faces. Let's stop stealing each other.

277
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,240
I have to thank P'Not for this one. Brother George, for sending me your emotions.

278
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,720
My character is very clear. Up, please, please, Nong Pie's scene.

279
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,359
I went to pull on my shoe and it almost hit me in the face. Pato fell on his back and was not prepared for it at all.
