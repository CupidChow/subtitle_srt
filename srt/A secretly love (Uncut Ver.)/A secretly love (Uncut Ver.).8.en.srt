00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,440
Last night, Brother Pleum went to sleep with him at home.

2
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,251
So what did he think of going to sleep at Prod 's house?

3
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,827
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:07,850
Sorry about...

5
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,142
I accidentally hugged you.

6
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:12,965
I want to try walking slowly with someone .

7
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:13,628
Huh ...

8
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:14,971
Where are you going?

9
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:18,756
My girlfriend, you're just a waitress. Why interfere in other people's affairs?

10
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:19,343
How? Prod.

11
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:22,052
Froi , can you give me my bearings first?

12
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:24,160
In conclusion, have you made a choice yet?

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,453
What do you choose?

14
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:29,896
So I chose to move on from Pleum and go with Jess .

15
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:32,876
Hoy! What happened to you?

16
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:35,496
I crashed my car

17
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:36,328
Ha !

18
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,865
So why don't you go to the hospital?

19
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:42,738
I made a promise to him.

20
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:46,256
Promise with whom?

21
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,127
Prod

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,229
what happened

23
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,717
Damn Prod, his car crashed.

24
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:01,384
So who let You come ? Why did You come?

25
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:06,104
Well, Prod says it was promised to someone, I don't know.

26
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:14,738
Didn't I tell you that I don't like people who force themselves?

27
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:21,411
I didn't force it. I just wanted to arrive on time.

28
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:26,879
I have fulfilled my promise.

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,589
Prod, let's go to the hospital.

30
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:34,567
stop
( go)

31
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:35,393
You guys don't have to be busy.

32
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:41,253
are you going to do ?

33
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:45,517
Be quiet now.

34
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:47,487
I'm angry.

35
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:50,850
go

36
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,596
walk together

37
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:56,627
Hoy! Pleum
Where will you take your Pro ?

38
00:02:56,627 --> 00:03:02,260
Wherever I go is my business. You don't have to be busy.

39
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,021
You go home now.

40
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:09,680
There is no issue where you have to reach out and help.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,640
Jess lets Pleum take Prod .

42
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,720
Hand over

43
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,984
yes

44
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:42,215
I told you to give me your hand. I won't hurt you .
I'm just going to hold it.

45
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:45,378
Then why are you holding my hand?

46
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:54,640
If I don't get caught, I'm afraid I myself will go on a rampage.
And then take you to die?

47
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,800
Oh.... Jee

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,959
Oh ...I should go pick you up at the store.

49
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,266
Take it easy.
Please don't be angry.

50
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,303
I'm driving, it's dangerous.

51
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:26,240
Look at what you 've done, it hurts like this, and you'll still come to me.

52
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,657
Well, I made a promise to you. I have to come find it.

53
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:41,919
If I knew You were this stubborn, I wouldn't have promised You anything . Why do I have to do this?

54
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,199
Don't be mad at me , okay? I'm sorry.

55
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:54,759
yeah

56
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,319
Sit down, I'll find some clothes to change into.

57
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,240
I'll just wipe myself off.

58
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,840
It's okay. I'll wipe it myself.

59
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,180
Don't be considerate.

60
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:01,639
My arm hurts like this. How can I wipe it myself?
Get up

61
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,248
Hoy!
I'd better take it off myself.

62
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,055
No, I'll take it off for you.

63
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,889
If you're embarrassed, you can close your eyes.

64
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,444
Who will close their eyes?

65
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:55,603
Ouch!

66
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:58,171
excuse me

67
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,581
What's wrong?

68
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,000
The cloth is cool.

69
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,228
Why do you have to stand so stiffly?

70
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:05,720
There was a tingling sensation in the lower abdomen.

71
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,832
It's so thrilling.

72
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:13,818
Would you like me to try it for you? You'll know if it's really exciting or not.

73
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:22,280
You can try it out. But don't cry later.

74
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,831
What's wrong with you crying?

75
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:34,640
I don't know, what kind of thrill do you think?

76
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:49,279
Thrilling like normal people , that is.

77
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:57,720
Even though I've never been with a man, it doesn't mean I can't do it.

78
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,291
Hello , Mom.

79
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:19,363
Last night, I got off work late. So I asked to come stay at Brother Pleum 's house.

80
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:23,473
And another thing: I have to prepare for going to a different volunteer camp.
province as well

81
00:09:23,473 --> 00:09:26,975
Mom, you don't have to worry.

82
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,959
Mother must take care of herself too.

83
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,360
OK, yes, yes.

84
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,588
As soon as I'm done with my business, I'll hurry back.

85
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:38,399

86
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:50,560
Oh ! What did you buy?

87
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,400
Afraid You are not satisfied

88
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,926
And what about the scar?

89
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:57,605
Has your arm healed yet?

90
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:59,680
It's gone.

91
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,080
Eat rice so you can take medicine.

92
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,399

93
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,889

00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:17,406
Pe Pe

102
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:33,690
Oh, what's so sweet about you?

103
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,515
Don't eat

104
00:11:37,515 --> 00:11:39,036
No need to enter.

105
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:41,351
Please allow me.

106
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:43,797
I didn't order it.

107
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:45,788
This one I give to you.

108
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,452
Thank you, but I can't accept it.

109
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:53,680
can I have your LINE phone number ?

110
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,117
cannot

111
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:59,154
So, can I have yours instead?

112
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:01,344
It's not the same.

113
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:05,054
Or do you both have boyfriends?

114
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:08,992
Yes, the two of us are lovers.

115
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:15,240
You two , it's better not to play around.

116
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,654
So, can we be friends like this or not?

117
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:29,485
yes

118
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,399

Pe Pe What I mean is a dog?

122
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:47,864
do you think it is ?

123
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:49,747
I don't think so.

124
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:53,619
Hey , come and get to know him a little.

125
00:14:53,619 --> 00:15:00,000
Pe Pe hello

126
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,319
Normal Pe Pe I don't get along with people this easily.

127
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,809
Well, where did you buy it from?

128
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:13,839
I didn't buy it. It's a stray dog since I was in high school.

129
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:26,833
Hoy!

130
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,679
Are you hungry?

131
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,040
Are you hungry? Hmm.

132
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,715
Where has your owner gone ?

133
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:59,915
Where has the dog owner gone?

134
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,523
It doesn't have an owner.

135
00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:04,574
Uncle is afraid that he will poop at school. Uncle tied it up.

136
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:06,253
thank you

137
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:11,040
Don't you have an owner?

138
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,842
Oh, out, not out, out, not out.

139
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,611
Hey Uncle, what are you doing?

140
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:19,810
Oh...just couldn't open the bottle .

141
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,299
I'm totally shocked.

142
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:24,289
Well, Uncle, where did that stray dog go?

143
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:26,559
Oh, this morning, a Mathayom 6 student took it to treat.

144
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,920
So?

145
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,944
This is Pe. Pe Meet someone new and forget the old one. Huh ...

146
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:52,027
Well, the new person is brighter and cuter than the old one, right? Pe Pe

147
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,360
Where is it bright?

148
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,374
The most stubborn

149
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:58,050
Pe Pe

150
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,076
Do you have chocolate milk?

151
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:04,063
There's it in the refrigerator .

00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:13,118
Come here quickly. Let's sit. Let's go quickly. Very good.
( Kon Prod : I'll come soon)

153
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:15,118

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,781
arrived

155
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:36,891
What will Pro do?

156
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,685
Then give Pe chocolate milk. Pe eat

157
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:44,243
No, dogs can't eat chocolate.

158
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:47,337
If it's eaten It's life-threatening.

159
00:17:47,337 --> 00:17:53,320
Sorry, I can't eat .

160
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,240
Where is your owner ?

161
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,960
Are you hungry?

162
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,960
Do you have pain to pee?

163
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:36,323
Why is it so familiar?

164
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:43,947

Is it your boyfriend?

169
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:11,029
My guy is really cool too. Now it's difficult and I'm distraught.

170
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:13,551
It's not.

171
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:18,517
We just wanted to get to know Pleum , so Mr. Somchai brought us here.

172
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:22,572
Is there something wrong?

173
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:27,303
My name is Pie and we'd like to get to know Pleum.

174
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:32,840
Ah, the snacks we bought as souvenirs from Japan.

Let's sit together.

178
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:44,232
Beautiful and also kind.

179
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:57,437
What? As soon as you're single, you immediately have a new woman.

180
00:19:57,437 --> 00:20:01,159
My mouth isn't good anymore.

181
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,527

182
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:13,532
Bye bye, I'm free. I'm here again.

183
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,568
Beautiful too

184
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:23,480
Hey Prod, let's sit together.

185
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,640
nevermind I'd rather go sit with a friend.

186
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,072
Good stuff

187
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:47,917
Interesting.

188
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:49,667
okay Then come review with the teacher.

189
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,729
Okay, okay .

190
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,190
What do you like more?

191
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,760
Okay, go back and think about it again.

192
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,987
Ah. Ah. Oh, come on.
Pie, come sit here.

193
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:03,446
Three people are sitting here.

194
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:04,378
hello

195
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:07,080
Hello..

196
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:15,609
It's all here. First of all, the teacher recommends
Miss Parima Prasertruadwichai At the Faculty of Business Administration

197
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:19,505
Oh, we already know each other.

198
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:26,320
Well, it just happened that Pie came to consult with the teacher about wanting to join the volunteer camp for freshmen with us.

199
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,775
otherwise Pie , please allow me to explain, teacher.
( Uh huh)

200
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:40,397
Our father's company has a CSR budget . Then we heard that the Faculty of Engineering Will organize a volunteer camp

201
00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:45,186
So we consulted with Father about bringing this budget.
Support

202
00:21:45,186 --> 00:21:49,047
And our father has given permission.
So we came to consult with the teacher.

203
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:53,173
So the teacher called them in to talk today.

204
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:57,411
Kon Prod as project owner
What is our opinion?

205
00:21:57,411 --> 00:22:03,995
All right, teacher.
Someone came to support me. The work will go more smoothly.

206
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:07,944
What are your opinions about the two of you ?

207
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:11,690
I don't have a problem.

208
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,254
Anyway.

209
00:22:13,254 --> 00:22:16,025
Oh, if that's the case then let's do it this way.
( yes)

210
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:19,864
Pie continues talking with friends. The teacher will ask me to continue working first.

211
00:22:19,864 --> 00:22:20,364
Yes/Yes

212
00:22:20,364 --> 00:22:21,120
Okay .

213
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,892
Thank you, teacher.
( Hello.)

214
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,023
Then we would like to work with Pleum directly.
It should be more convenient.

215
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:32,666
I got it.

216
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,436
Well, you can talk to Pleum now.

217
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:44,583
Oh, by the way, this project is a Kon Prod project . Can we ask Kon Prod to help us?

218
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,259
Because all the documents are with you.

219
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,362
okay, no problem

220
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:52,679
So, please give her a Line .

221
00:23:10,144 --> 00:23:13,559
Prod has been going on for a long time.

222
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,253
How are you

223
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:24,268
Why did the teacher call you?

224
00:23:24,268 --> 00:23:31,159
Is there a problem with the volunteer camp accepting new students?

225
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,390
There's no problem. There are people who come as sponsors.

226
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,317
that 's good. In Year 1 , I won't have to solicit donations.

227
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:44,256
Who comes as a sponsor?

228
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:51,417
you remember the beautiful white woman who came to talk to Pleum in the cafeteria that morning?

229
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:53,097
Yes, I remember, why?

230
00:23:53,097 --> 00:24:01,200
That person came to be our sponsor. His name is Pie and comes from the Faculty of Business Administration.

231
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,799
I think that's not normal.

232
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,519
Are you going to speak bitterly about your father?

233
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,478
My father is your father .

234
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:15,107
Take your father and fight with my mother?

235
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:18,758
Your mother is my mother.

236
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:29,628
Hey!

237
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:31,574
What's up with you?

238
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:35,676
I want to talk about Prod with you.

239
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:40,288
I really ask you Hey, do you really like Prod ?

240
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:44,842
Well, I really like it.

241
00:24:44,842 --> 00:24:54,960
But you know that you already have someone in mind. Are you sure?
That you can take the place of the person in your little one's heart.

242
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:03,642
I'll tell you something. Where there is effort, there is success.

243
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:11,120
Damn Jess , this is love.
It's not a matter of trying or winning.

244
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,039
It's a story of two people who click.
Do you understand ?

245
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,399
You will tell me to....

246
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:29,280
If the person in Prod 's heart was someone we knew and were close to, what would you do?

247
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:32,554
And you know who?

248
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:45,279
I'm still not sure But I'm keeping an eye on it.
And then I think the people who were into Prod 's hearts started to like Prod .

249
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:51,796
It's just that it doesn't know yet. Or it may still not be accepted here.

250
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:55,956
Can you tell me who you are?

251
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:04,828
If you want to know You can try to flirt with Kon Prod to the fullest.

252
00:26:04,828 --> 00:26:11,520
In order to accelerate
React to let it show its true expression.

253
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,338
And that person you're talking about? How important must it be to you?

254
00:26:17,338 --> 00:26:19,818
you bring this matter up with me?

255
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,240
It's important to me and to you.

256
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:33,800
can

257
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,389
I will be the catalyst.

258
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:44,044
If that person is yours Don't reveal your feelings.

259
00:26:44,044 --> 00:26:45,889
I , too, will not be disrespectful.

260
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:53,200
No matter how important it is to you Or how big I am

261
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,450

262
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,049

Don't let me get you. You'll just cut your hand.

264
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,470
Is this something ?

265
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,020
I've seen Prod be confused since the evening.

266
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,490
No, it's nothing.

267
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:01,417
Hey... Why don't you keep it?

268
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:04,443
Someone will step on it. It will be dangerous.

269
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:10,591
with Prod ? He's acting unconsciously.

270
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:14,677

So bad

289
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:44,761

00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:07,064
Just Pleum sends us the location .

We mean Pleum's personal belongings . What do you want?

297
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:26,837

00:30:26,837 --> 00:30:31,973
We'll go shopping together anyway. How about we go buy it all at once?

Hey!

305
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:08,940
Sroi , do you know this yet? They talk all over the university.

306
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,057
What's up?

307
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:17,296
A person named Pie from the management team said that they flirted with Pleum very hard.

308
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:22,287
Pie , who is the star of the administration team?

309
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:23,197

00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:25,642
he invest in wooing Pleum himself?

311
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:28,566
That's right , they're all mousers everywhere.

312
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:34,185
But it's also good, let Pleum get a new girlfriend. There won't be any need to deal with chaos again .

313
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:36,697
Who are you going to call ?

314
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:38,611
Call Pleum

315
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:40,091
Why don't you call ?

316
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:41,917
Haven't you gotten over it yet?

317
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:47,320
Not like that. Well , we have something to discuss with Pleum.

318
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,232
Hello Pleum , we have something important to discuss with you.

Will you return , Mr. Pleum ?

323
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:12,640
If so, Mr. Pleum must have eaten the rice in the alms bowl.

324
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,660
What's yours? Rice in the bowl.

325
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,289

326
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:24,613
Oh, it's Khun Pie plus Khun Sroi. Put it together with the baht and take it in at once.

327
00:32:24,613 --> 00:32:34,492
Well, I think Mr. Pie has a good profile. His looks, figure, and status are suitable for you . Aren't you interested?

328
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:37,821
Oh... Mr. Jess, don't...

00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:48,759
why are you guys interfering with my life ?

331
00:32:48,759 --> 00:33:00,738
Well ... well, I want you to move on and move forward. And here 's a good, beautiful woman like Ms. Pie coming along. If you don't grab it, you'd be stupid.

332
00:33:00,738 --> 00:33:03,303
Oh ... Miss Suea, please don't.

333
00:33:03,303 --> 00:33:04,614

334
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:05,455
That's right.

335
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:07,838
I still don't want anyone.

336
00:33:07,838 --> 00:33:08,965
clear

337
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:14,552
Well, let's keep it true like you said.

338
00:33:14,552 --> 00:33:16,940
Don't swallow your saliva.

339
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:22,159
Spit now, spit now, no need to swallow.

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,253
thank you

341
00:33:32,253 --> 00:33:36,710
And from now on, do n't let anyone accuse you of being a naughty child. Do you understand?

342
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,180
I already know.

343
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,524
Go home safely.

344
00:33:39,524 --> 00:33:41,960

00:33:56,735 --> 00:34:00,919
What is it?

347
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,766
Aren't you going to answer the phone ?

348
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:37,871
Huh?

349
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:39,161
Take it.

350
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,147
It's loud, I'm annoyed.

351
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:45,366
Working time, I'm not available.

352
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:50,679

353

Everyone go quickly.

378

Hello brothers and sisters.

379
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:26,805
Hello, fellow engineers.

380
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:29,947
We, Pha Nang Dam School, welcome you.

00:40:29,947 --> 00:40:34,003
hello

382
00:40:34,003 --> 00:40:35,249
Sigh!

383
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:38,371
Today we leave it to you, teacher.

384
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:39,138
pleased

385
00:40:39,138 --> 00:40:40,552
Please come inside.

386
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:47,494
Do children study here, teacher?

387
00:40:47,494 --> 00:40:48,180
yes

388
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,746
Our school is a small school. There are about 15-16 students and there is only one teacher.

389
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:58,878
Most of the children here I am an ethnic child of the village in this area.

390
00:40:58,878 --> 00:41:02,715
This is really difficult, teacher.

391
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:07,379
Asked if it's difficult, you have to be patient.
Every Thai child must receive a good education.

392
00:41:07,379 --> 00:41:09,912
Is there anything missing here ?

393
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:13,446
Asked if there was a shortage of anything , they lacked almost everything.

394
00:41:13,446 --> 00:41:16,355
But we will try our best to teach and teach.

395
00:41:16,355 --> 00:41:21,654
Anyway, I'll present this matter to the government.
My father's company gave it to me.

396
00:41:21,654 --> 00:41:22,638
Thank you very much.

397
00:41:22,638 --> 00:41:27,805
One thing that this school can survive is because of
Support from outsiders

398
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:30,258
Actually, it is the duty of the government.

399
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:32,357
It is not the duty of the people to take care of each other.

400
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:45,301
How can I do it? When it's like this If there is anything we can do to help the children who are the future of the nation. I will do my best.

401
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:46,369
You're very welcome.

402
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:49,240
I'm sorry.

403
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,145
The children are already waiting to receive snacks and toys.

404
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:56,252

405
00:41:56,252 --> 00:42:00,796

Prod

407
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:12,299
Is there any problem?

408
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:15,210
Why do you have to act like you don't even exist?

409
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:20,400
There isn't any problem here.

410
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,359
You don't have to lie to me.

411
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:32,040
I think you'd better hurry. Wait, P'Pie. will wait

412
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,207

415
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:54,726
Pleum, come help Pie and give it out.

416
00:42:54,726 --> 00:42:57,428
Pleum, come help Pie and give some away.

417
00:42:57,428 --> 00:43:01,129
( Go ahead and walk out there.)

418
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:02,610
( Bag ? A new bag just arrived.)

419
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,142
Hey, kids!
Oh, choose a color too.

420
00:43:05,142 --> 00:43:07,230
you want a bag ?

421
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,904
Ah, the bag.

422
00:43:09,904 --> 00:43:11,245
Where is Kon Prod ?

423
00:43:11,245 --> 00:43:12,729
I don't know either.

424
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm going to go after Pleum and P'Pie. And then I don't know where I disappeared to.

425
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Nice, could you give it for me?

426
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:33,160
Anything, anything is me.
( Here, ball.)

427
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,640
Being the project leader acts like this .
How can you be a good example to the younger generation?

428
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,126
You must have confessed your love to Kon Prod .

429
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,195
Kon Prod is thinking of letting go of you.

430
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:52,197
Good luck to you.

431
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:55,072
Anyway, please take care of my friend.

432
00:43:55,072 --> 00:43:58,099
Prod, listen to me first.

433
00:43:58,099 --> 00:43:59,425
Prod: Don't abandon the person in your heart.

434
00:43:59,425 --> 00:44:03,920
Mother, mother, what is wrong with you?
