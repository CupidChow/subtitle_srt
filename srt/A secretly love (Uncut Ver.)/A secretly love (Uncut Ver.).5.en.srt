1
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:05,321
This is the song I just share.

2
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:07,406
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:08,921
What are you just standing there for? Go inside!

4
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:09,961
What?

5
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:13,687
I'm serious, why are you following me?

6
00:01:13,687 --> 00:01:16,191
"I'm following you because I have a question for you about...

7
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,308
I have something to say to Kon Prod

8
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:25,599
Speak up if you have something to say.

9
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:36,839
Private matter

10
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,835
P'Pleum

11
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:44,898
Blasted, What happened?

12
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,974
P'Pleum

13
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,799
P'Pleum, Krub.

14
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:15,462
P'Pleum,

15
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,281
Are you awake ? Kon Prod.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,702
Did you take me up to my room last night?

17
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:34,633
Sure.

18
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:40,000
If it wasn't me, Who else could it have been?

19
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,188
Why are you here? Bro.

20
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:47,801
Bro.

21
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:58,598
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

22
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:00,452
It's okay.

23
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:05,746
This is difficult. I mean, I can't leave Kon Prod's room

24
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:10,040
Can't leave my room?

25
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,159
What?

26
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,212
Look for yourself.

27
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:20,478
Uhm!!

28
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,251
The doorknob is damaged.

29
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:43,997
I'll call my mom and ask her to find someone to open the door.

30
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:56,963
Hello...Mom

31
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:58,088
What's up, son?

32
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,184
I'm stuck in my room because the doorknob is broken.

33
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,561
Oh, really?

34
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:05,613
Mom was released from the hospital today.

35
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:08,777
I'll call Aunt Wan and ask her to help you with the doorknob.

36
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:10,768
Okay, I'll do it as soon as possible.

37
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:14,337
Thank you.

38
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,519
Mom will call Aunt Waen to have the technician come and open the door for you.

39
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,419
Don't you have classes?

40
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:32,199
I do, but I don't think it'll be of any use anymore.

41
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

42
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,322
"Uh"

43
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:50,006
I've already told my mom to hurry up. Give her a few minutes.

44
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:54,467
Hmm...

45
00:04:54,467 --> 00:05:00,920
Do you clean your own room?

46
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,191
Yes .

47
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:12,035
Hmm!

48
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:17,536
Can't call

49
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:18,690
Erm

50
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,367
Why will it shut down?

51
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:26,217
Or that Khun Pleum will be in a damp place?

52
00:05:26,217 --> 00:05:28,815
Ah!! Bad signal

53
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:34,151
Chai, his house is not in the forest, how can he have no signal?

54
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,644
Or the battery is dead.

55
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:39,810
The electricity authority probably won't come to cut off the power to his house today.
Maybe?

56
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,806
So it means he must be with someone.

57
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:48,000
Or will it be with...

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,704
stay at home

59
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:57,551
Khun Pleum 's father and mother came to visit the house. Then invite each other to meditate. So I turned off the machine.

60
00:05:57,551 --> 00:06:01,086
Don't want to disturb anyone?

61
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,885
I think it's with a woman.

62
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:05,822
That's it.

63
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:11,910
They ordered Ent' kids and probably got many of them already.
Maybe

64
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,349
Somchai !...

65
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,767
Oh! Somchai! So you don't know anything about your friends?

66
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:22,800
If I knew, I wouldn't have asked.

67
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,769
shit !

68
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,440
The call is connected.

69
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:46,142
Khon Prod, Where is he?

70
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,827
Hello.

71
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:13,122
Hello. Where are you?

72
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:15,374
what's up?

73
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:19,176
Where are you? We're at the canteen already.

74
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,799
I'm at home.

75
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:24,725
You haven't left your house yet?

76
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:26,472
Yeah, something came up.

77
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:31,231
What happened?

78
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:33,619
My door is broken.

79
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,445
Oh, that's all?

80
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:38,298
I'm stuck with P'Pleum.

81
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:41,848
Huh, stuck with P'Pleum.

82
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,278
What's the noise all about?!

83
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:54,493
Last night, he offered to drive me home, but I fell asleep, so he ended up bringing me to my room.

84
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:59,388
When he was about to leave, the door broke, so he was stuck here all night.

85
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:02,575
Where's he now?

86
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:05,749
He's on bed.

87
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:10,436
Don't tell anyone about this, especially his friends.

88
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:13,960
What do you mean 'my chance'? You mean I should just snatch him up?

89
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,267
Snatch who up?

90
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:20,280
P'Pleum is stuck in Prod's bedroom.

91
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,883
Prod, just handle it. Don't worry about us. I'll take responsibility for everything.

92
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,401
his is all your guys' idea.

93
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:32,368
Oh my gosh !

94
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:34,229
Isn't it good?

95
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,826
I'm not talking to you guys anymore.

96
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:42,206
This is confidential! You must keep this to yourself.

97
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:45,839
Got it.

98
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,865
If you need anything, just call us.

99
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:55,259
Do you have condoms?

100
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:01,440
That's it. I'm not talking to you anymore. Okay.

101
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,988
I bet he must be over the moon.

102
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:13,692
I hope that P' Pleum will Sleepwalking and force Kon Prod.

103
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:17,040
If everything goes well, we won't have to worry about it.

104
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,347
I'm already worried.

105
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:38,556
I don't think I'm with a woman anymore.

106
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:42,875
Or should we go to Khun Pleum's house?

107
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,368
What should I do?

108
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:46,670
It's up to you guys.

109
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,480
Are you going now or around noon?

110
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Brother, hello.

111
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,912
Oh, and my favorite person?

112
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:02,724
Oh, Kon Prod is addictive...

113
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,366
Kon Prod is stuck with his mother at the hospital.

114
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:24,399
Please go study first.

115
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,405
hello

116
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:31,596
Almost there

117
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,040
How do you figure this out?

118
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,142
Jess, you can come with me now.

119
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:44,566
Just the two of you will go with me . You guys will go to class as usual.

120
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:45,092
oh

121
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,496
The teacher will not be suspicious.

122
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:49,981
I'm a thinker.

123
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:54,236
Let's all go together.

124
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,614
Go at noon.

125
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:02,440
And what if something happened to Khun Pleum ?

126
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:08,760
It doesn't hurt.

127
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,943
It doesn't hurt.

128
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:14,814
This one feels hurt.

129
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:17,942
Oh somchai, your words are not auspicious at all.

130
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:20,052
Why are you cursing your friends?

131
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:21,088
Ouch...

132
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:22,444
Even more worried

133
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:25,001
Come on, I'm going to study.

134
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,798
Hey Jess, wait for me.

135
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:29,544
oh! So you're not going?

136
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:32,633
I feel numb

137
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,183
What kind of tea?

138
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:35,836
It's numb to my face.

139
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,593
I'm gone.

140
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:42,869
Jess, please wait.

141
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,672
What are you looking at?

142
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:12,232
No.

143
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:18,054
Well, I was just thinking about whether or not I should wake you up. Because now it's noon.

144
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,345
Oh?

145
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,649
Mom already called Auntie Waen for me.
After a while, there will probably be a technician coming to open the door.

146
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,549
yeah

147
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:38,944
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

148
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:42,190
A little bit, but I can bear it.

149
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,135
P' Pleum, are you hungry?

150
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:53,399
Why, if I'm hungry, will Kon Prod let you eat Kon Prod ?

151
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,320
As soon as the technician comes, I'll take you out to eat.

152
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,120
You keep your money.

153
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,320
I'm not trying to insult Kon Prod 's money , I mean you can pay for it yourself.

154
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,491
So what's your mother's illness?

155
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:25,839
My mother has an incurable disease. I have to keep looking for a doctor.

156
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,839
Sit.

157
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,959
And where is your father?

158
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:54,880
My father passed away a long time ago. Since I was in elementary school

159
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,360
I would like to express my condolences.

160
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,399
So you try to be the head of the family instead of your father.

161
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:21,120
I don't want mom to be in trouble. I want mom to stay.
with me for a long time

162
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:29,680
Because of this, you have to work hard.

163
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:38,852
So why did you become Headgear ?
If it happens that someone else does it instead. Probably have more time for myself.

164
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:44,639
I'm sorry I acted inappropriately as Headgear.

165
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,411
I don't blame Kon Prod for that.

166
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:56,824
But if it happens that someone else does this work instead. You will have more time to take care of your mother.

167
00:14:56,824 --> 00:14:59,824
P' Pleum

168
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:19,240
But now you're really good at it.

169
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,720
Well done.

170
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,646
I thank you very much.

171
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:32,519
I'm glad you supported me.

172
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,610
What's wrong with Srio ?

173
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,901
I saw you have a tense face since yesterday.

174
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:51,392
Yesterday when we returned home We are delighted to meet you.

175
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:53,456
Does this follow you home?

176
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:58,195
We didn't know, he suddenly walked towards us when we were talking to Prod .

177
00:15:58,195 --> 00:15:59,947
But we didn't care.

178
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:05,684
This must be the reason why Sroi came back to sleep in the room, right?

179
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:12,090
That's part of it.
But he might come to Kon Prod .

180
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:18,091
Why would you come? Are you at the university and can't meet each other?

181
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:19,786
We don't know.

182
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:25,809
Just assumed. But what we suspect is Why do they know where our house is?

183
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:28,130
We don't want him to see us at home again.

184
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,120
Why doesn't it just end?

185
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:42,079
Is it good to take it like this? You announced it to the faculty. I broke up with him. And now there's a new lover, so he goes and announces to the faculty that
We broke up and now have a new boyfriend, is that good?

186
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,410
I don't want it.

187
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:49,669
Why? If you don't do it, the matter won't be resolved. He won't stop pestering you.

188
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:51,892
Well, let it be.

189
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:56,292
Or does Sroi want to reconcile with him?

190
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:59,873
Froi , why can't you talk like this?

191
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:08,079
I told you, I don't want to get back together with anyone.
And I don't want to drag on with anyone. It won't end soon.

192
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,959
Sroi

193
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,120
A moment later, Auntie arrived.

194
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,633
It's been a long time.

195
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:30,164
How long has it been? It's only been 15 minutes .

196
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:36,767
I'm afraid of you.

197
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,104
Come sit on this bed.

198
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:44,160
Are you deaf?

199
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,480
I told you to come quickly.

200
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:14,652
Later, be careful.

201
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:17,518
It's not small.

202
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:21,975
And if you fall, you'll break a bone. I'm too lazy to carry it to the bar.

203
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,990
I'm sorry.

204
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,447
And will you go to Freshy night ?

205
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:34,416
Jess must have told you that you guys had a show there too.

206
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:38,835
I heard P'Jess talking to the teacher.

207
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:41,204
P'Pleum also plays guitar, right?

208
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,062
yes

209
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:47,456
I'll have my friend take a clip for you to see.
yes

210
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:49,982
Why don't you go to work?

211
00:18:49,982 --> 00:18:53,080
Just an hour is good.

212
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,623
I really wanted to go, but I couldn't take the day off work.

213
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:06,127
Besides, it's 1st year work and I'm in 3rd year . What's the matter?

214
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:09,401
I'll go as Headgear .

215
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:14,650
Then I can leave it to you. Because I'm the same way.

216
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:25,202
I'm sorry, I just don't like accepting deposits. Besides, for fun events like this, you have to go yourself.

217
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:27,887
I have my duties.

218
00:19:27,887 --> 00:19:33,151
But I don't want my wages to be deducted.

219
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:41,041
All right, then I'll raise some money for you. I'll bring it to you, okay?

220
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,087
P'Pleum

221
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:49,982
Why? Or you can leave it yourself. How much do you get paid? Tell me.

222
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:53,679
Why did you say that you wouldn't look down on money?

223
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,799
Facebook live .

224
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:14,080
What fun would it be to watch on a mobile phone? It's much better to look at the real thing.

225
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:25,240
Is that an invitation? Do you really want me to go see you perform?

226
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:47,415
I didn't say that at all. I said I'd invite you.

227
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm just saying that the real thing is fun.
You will regret it if you don't go.

228
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:04,996
It's up to you. If you go, that's fine. If you don't, no one can stop you. And I don't like to force anyone.

229
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:14,459
Sigh...that's so bad. If you say you want me to go
I'm probably looking for a holiday.

230
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:26,120
And if I told you I invited you, would you go?

231
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,082
Prod! Prod!
Auntie brought a technician here.

232
00:21:37,082 --> 00:21:43,886
Yes, Aunt Waen, let the technician unlock the doorknob.

233
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:49,400
You can.
What a deal!

234
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,007
Yes!
You came out just fine.

235
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:11,826
I feel sorry for P'Pleum .

236
00:22:11,826 --> 00:22:16,383
oh! You mentioned him, has he returned?

237
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:19,120
Haven't returned yet. He went to the bathroom.

238
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,919
Huh!! Hee hee hee

239
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,287
Your chance has arrived. You hurry up and score some points.

240
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:28,012
You don't have to tease me, and don't forget my sheet .

241
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:34,039
Well, don't worry, I'll take care of it for you.

242
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,628
How are you Pro ?

243
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:49,640
Stay safe, don't lose yourself.

244
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,333
Sure, definitely.

245
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,710
Hey! Twin

246
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,452
Chit! What!

247
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:02,853
hello

248
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:05,004
What happened to Kon Prod ?

249
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:07,243
No, nothing.

250
00:23:07,243 --> 00:23:11,544
Okay, then I'll call Kon Prod .

251
00:23:11,544 --> 00:23:13,080
Hey ! It's okay. I used to.

252
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,262
Kon Prod just stuck in a room with.....

253
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:19,522
I'm stuck with myself. Just then, the child closed the door. So I couldn't come out.

254
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:20,022
Uh huh.

255
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:24,491
So why didn't you tell me? So I can go help bring Kon Prod out.

256
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:26,900
Uh, it's okay. It's...

257
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,887
The aunt next door called a technician to do it for her.

258
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:32,416
It's safe.

259
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:35,936
Well, then that's good.

260
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:41,919
So I'm going to study first.
Hello (Hello)

261
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,907
You make a delicious omelet.

262
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:25,600
I think you're probably hungry. It's said to be delicious.

263
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,840
Why can't I eat all the rice?

264
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,049
Well, I'm not very hungry.

265
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:48,080
If you're not hungry, you have to eat. Did you know that your body needs nutrients? If it's time to eat, you must eat, do you understand?

266
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,080
If you understand, just eat.

267
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,200
What are you talking about, young men?

268
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,015
What does the doctor say, Mom?

269
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:06,957
It's the same as before, child. Take medicine as usual
I bought some snacks because I thought my child must be hungry.

270
00:25:06,957 --> 00:25:15,899
It's good, Auntie, because Prod won't eat all the food.

271
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,936
I'm really not hungry, Mom.

272
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:26,279
If you're not hungry, eat a snack.

273
00:25:27,716 --> 00:25:29,993
yes

274
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,226
Thank you very much to Pleum for taking good care of Prod .

275
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:42,100
It doesn't matter at all.

276
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,513
Come visit our house often, I allow it.

277
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:48,063
mother

278
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:53,047
Why don't you want him to come to our house?

279
00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:57,134
It's not like that.

280
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:59,226
I want mom to rest.

281
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,516
I don't want anyone to disturb me.

282
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:07,175
This is when he came looking for me. He came to find a child. He didn't come to see his mother.

283
00:26:07,175 --> 00:26:09,713
Yes, Auntie.

284
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:15,059
Let's just say that I'm asking for permission first.
Let's talk first.

285
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,090
This is a snack.

286
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,463
Eat a lot.

287
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:24,320
Hello, mother.

288
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,852
Mom, this person, P'Jess, is a friend of P'Pleum .

289
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:35,063
yes

290
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:37,696
So how did P'Jess get in?

291
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,684
Oh, I saw the gate was left open. So I walked in.

292
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,776
I must have forgotten to turn it off, child. I'm sorry.

293
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:48,109
okay

294
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:48,637
Let's talk comfortably.

295
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:49,141
yes

296
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,141
Excuse me first.

297
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:02,224
Hey! My Frind, why did you turn off your phone?

298
00:27:02,224 --> 00:27:08,801
You know, other friends are worried about you. Afraid that something will happen to you

299
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,450
The battery is dead.

300
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,235
So why are you here?

301
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:19,557
So why are you here?

302
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:23,647
I'll ask you first. Don't bother me.

303
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:32,363
Wherever I go is my business.
Why do I have to report you? Where did I go? Huh..

304
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:35,712
Oh, I'll remember that.

305
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:41,919
Uh... Is... P'Jess something to do with me?

306
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,880
I heard that Prod is stuck in the room. I'm worried.

307
00:27:49,620 --> 00:28:00,120
But Prod has come out and I'm relieved.

308
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:11,120
Well, tomorrow I have something to do around here.
I'll stop by to take Prod to university together.

309
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:19,279
okay

310
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:27,120
I'll be back first and say goodbye to you.

311
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,080
Bro , P'Pleum

312
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,673
Suea , don't you guys have class?

313
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:16,108
Why can Jess go outside?

314
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:20,148
Wait, are you still alive?

315
00:29:20,148 --> 00:29:23,051
I called you many times. But turn off the machine

316
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:26,193
My battery died and I just charged it in the car.

317
00:29:26,193 --> 00:29:35,960
It charges in your car, meaning you're not at home. Just returned from outside Where have you been ?

318
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:43,150
I went to Prod 's house.
Go talk about Sroi

319
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,406
Jess goes to Prod's house.

320
00:29:45,406 --> 00:29:50,748
Then Jess interrupted me.

321
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:57,541
Wait, this morning the twins said Prod sent their mother to the hospital.

322
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,927
So what? I don't understand.

323
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:05,725
You don't have to know. And how did you guys let it come? Ha!

324
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:13,912
What's wrong with you? Jess called to tell us that she had urgent business to attend to. Who knows where he went?
Prod house

325
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:21,440
Hey Pleum, are you upset about Jess going to Prod ?

326
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:29,804
Well, I already told you that it interrupted the conversation.
My business

327
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:33,218
Call and tell me that's it. That's all for now.

328
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:37,895
Auh! Pluem

329
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:41,261
Pleum , why?

330
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:48,261
I don't understand. But it seems like he's complaining about Jess going to see Prod.

331
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:50,536
And he himself was there too.

332
00:30:50,536 --> 00:31:02,095
Is it? Or...
The reason we can't contact Khun Pleum is because Khum Pleum has been with Khun Prod since morning.

333
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:02,657
Kiss

334
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:05,017
Kisses, is it your father?

335
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:06,492
Ouch!

336
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:07,194
yes

337
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:11,156
Nick , I think Khun Pleum is strange.

338
00:31:11,156 --> 00:31:12,321
Kiss kiss

339
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:19,760
Kisses, another one of your dads? You guys didn't help me at all.

340
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,825
Hello, P' Gnaung.

341
00:31:45,825 --> 00:31:50,578
oh! Hello, what's up, handsome gang? Where has everyone gone?

342
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:52,461
Today I came alone.

343
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:54,858
Ah, yes, yes, have you got a table yet?

344
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:59,840
Today I didn't come to travel. P' Gnaung

345
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:03,429
Today I will come to apply for a job at the shop.

346
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:05,334
apply for work

347
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:09,786
But I would like to not receive a salary.

348
00:32:09,786 --> 00:32:18,323
I don't get a salary. Hey, it's free. Oh, you're handsome like this. It's free.

349
00:32:18,323 --> 00:32:22,120
P' Gnaung likes it

350
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,369
I told you to come.

351
00:32:48,495 --> 00:32:56,840
Is that an invitation? You want me to go see you perform like that.

352
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,703
I didn't tell you. I said I'd invite you.

353
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:16,179
I'm just saying that the real thing is fun, you'll regret it.
If you didn't go

354
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:25,387
But it's up to you. If you go, it's good. If you don't go, no one will stop you.

355
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:27,410
I also don't like to force anyone.

356
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:38,859
Sigh...that's so bad.
If you told me you wanted me to go, I would probably find a day off.

357
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:49,504
And if I told you I invited you, would you go?

358
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,520
Today I came very early.

359
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,330
I usually come this morning.
Prod comes this morning too.

360
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:34,949
I have morning class.

361
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,249
Hello, what's going on?

362
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:52,547
Have you arrived at the university yet?

363
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:54,547
Well, I've arrived.

364
00:34:54,547 --> 00:35:03,228
Good, then would you please go buy some rice, some water, some snacks? Please bring a lot. I'm waiting at
Practice room

365
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:06,597
Hey! Wait, wait, wait.

366
00:35:06,597 --> 00:35:09,234
Is there something wrong?

367
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:19,473
Pleum ordered the elders to buy rice, snacks, and water and take them to the music practice room.

368
00:35:19,473 --> 00:35:25,440
I'll go help carry it now.

369
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,640
Really?

370
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,680
Is there anything else missing?

371
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,891
Garlic pork and fried egg are fine.

372
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:04,001
Kon Prod be eaten?

373
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:08,880
No, I think my friend might have someone who wants to eat.

374
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:12,420
Like that?

375
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,539
yes

376
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,160
You can go to a restaurant to order.

377
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,359
Hey! Jess, what are you doing?

378
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:35,681
He'll come soon.

379
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:40,279
How did Khun Pleum know that Khun Jess would come soon?

380
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:43,865
What time is the appointment?

381
00:36:43,865 --> 00:36:49,887
Oh, yes, it's time for our appointment.

382
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:58,681
Jess is usually never late. Even though I called, she didn't answer. What will he be like?

383
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:00,503
It's worrisome.

384
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:07,560
You guys don't have to worry about him. He'll come soon.

385
00:37:15,223 --> 00:37:20,960
Where is Kon Prod ?

386
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,161
That's it, or he hasn't come yet.

387
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:29,520
Please try calling.

388
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:39,123
hello

389
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,784
Have you arrived at university?

390
00:37:41,784 --> 00:37:44,034
Well, where are you?

391
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:48,389
I'm with P'Jess , helping him carry things to his room.
Practice music

392
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:51,117
Then why did you go help him carry it?

393
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:54,463
Hey! I'm just helping him carry his things.

394
00:37:54,463 --> 00:37:58,481
Do you want to help him carry things? Or do you really want to meet someone?

395
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:05,079
[ _ _ ] That's it. See you later. Well... Bye.

396
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,457
Who called?

397
00:38:08,457 --> 00:38:11,051
those two Fads .

398
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:12,161
oh

399
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:36,155
Come on, eat. Eat quickly and practice quickly.

400
00:38:36,155 --> 00:38:39,766
Come on, take the rice.

401
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:43,656
Oh, you guys are hungry, aren't you? Eat.

402
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:47,961
Who told you? We're waiting for you to come practice.

403
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:51,568
Hey! Well, Pleum called and ordered me to buy rice and water.

404
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:57,879
Why am I hungry?

405
00:38:57,879 --> 00:39:06,404
You guys should thank me. Because I know You guys will be hungry soon.

406
00:39:06,404 --> 00:39:08,754
which

407
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,319
Mmm, Garlic Pork and Fried Egg on Rice.

408
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Looks delicious.

409
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,359
Come on, rice.

410
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:37,560
Looks delicious.

411
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:55,685
Eat rice.

412
00:39:55,685 --> 00:40:00,560
I'm not hungry. I'm going to eat with friends.

413
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,741
Why eat with friends? Share it with me.

414
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:09,331
Ha!!!

415
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,046
Yea

416
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:20,440
eat together

417
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,000
It's okay. Let's eat.

418
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,404
Don't be considerate.

419
00:40:28,404 --> 00:40:29,580
Uh huh.

420
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:35,557
I'm eating it. I will go quickly to practice music.

421
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,880
I'm sorry

422
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,440
I didn't do anything wrong. Why are you apologizing?

423
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:12,109
One more thing. It's fine if you don't eat. Sigh...

424
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:15,624
Because I really want to eat, I'm very hungry.

425
00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:21,202
And I'm tuning the strings. My hands are busy. Please give me some input.

426
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:22,831
Ha!

427
00:41:22,831 --> 00:41:30,708
Well, let me feed you. I'm late. I'm very hungry. Don't you have sympathy for me? Huh.

428
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:35,094
Then you can finish tuning the strings first. Then eat some rice.

429
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:39,850
Did you see that? that these people are waiting

430
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:44,372
Want to waste time? Tell him to enter, then enter.

431
00:41:44,372 --> 00:41:48,488
Khun Pleum, since when were you handicapped?

432
00:41:48,488 --> 00:41:54,240
Khun Somchai, don't interrupt me.

433
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,503
Take medicine without shaking the bottle.

434
00:42:04,503 --> 00:42:11,880
Hey! I think we're wasting too much Kon Pro time.

435
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,664
I'll send it out right away.

436
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:24,960
One more thing, this guitar. You just tuned in too late, didn't you? Why are you still tuning in?

437
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,640
I tuned it to make it sound good.

438
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,782
Jess reveals her boyfriend? Who?

439
00:42:42,782 --> 00:42:45,213
You take a look on IG and you will be shocked.

440
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:50,825
I'll be the first to tell you. Then I will take someone's place.

441
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:54,912
P'Pleum . I want to be P'Pleum 's Kon Prod. Can I?

442
00:42:54,912 --> 00:42:56,958
two of us have come to an understanding.

443
00:42:56,958 --> 00:43:01,258
For your comfort I'd like to move out of the room.

444
00:43:01,258 --> 00:43:05,309
Jess says she likes Kon Prod .

445
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:07,869
Huh!!

446
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:12,863
Yes, I'll investigate for you.
