1
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:03,635
Even though I've never been with a man, it's not like I'm not good at it.

2
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:06,375
What? As soon as you're single, you suddenly have a new woman.

3
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,740
It's beautiful too.

4
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,660
Don't let anyone accuse you of being a naughty child. Do you understand?

5
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,396
I already know.

6
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:19,473
with Prod ? He's not conscious at work.

7
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,782
Why did you come?

8
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:24,353
Prod said that Prod made a promise to whom, I don't know.

9
00:01:24,353 --> 00:01:28,689
If the person in Khon Prod 's heart is someone we know and are close to, What are you going to do?

10
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,920
So you know who?

11
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:16,159
Oh, Khon Prod is here.

12
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:23,948
I just came to explore the school. So I found it here.

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,388
Very beautiful

14
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:31,097
Oh, it's beautiful.

15
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:37,213
It's been a while since I've been out in such clear weather.
That's good too.

16
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:41,767
But Khon Prod doesn't seem clear at all.

17
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:44,365
I've seen Khon Prod stressed since morning.

18
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,011
There's nothing here.

19
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:51,584
Maybe my face is stressed. It's already normal here.
yes

20
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:57,159
Still as good at lying as ever.

21
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,239
Sigh, I secretly missed work and came to sit here.

22
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,102
Pleum , are you done giving out candy to the kids?

23
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:07,848
finished

24
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:13,337
But some people fled from work. No responsibility

25
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:17,548
Oh, I'm sorry.

26
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:20,447
I didn't say that to you.

27
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:27,217
We are seniors. Their duty is to take care of the younger generation.

28
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:35,338
But someone left the job. irresponsible

29
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:42,377
As a project leader , how can acting like this be a good example to younger generations?

30
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:47,959
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,150
Pleum spoke too harshly to his younger sibling.

32
00:03:56,616 --> 00:04:05,226
You are the one who likes to take his side, so he gets his heart.

33
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:09,439
Hey, separate personal and work matters.

34
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,428
Doing something like this is a waste of the governance system.

35
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:19,846
I never hold back. And I never mix personal matters with work.

36
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:22,690
It's only you who has a problem.

37
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,517
What's wrong with you?

38
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:28,807
Waiting for it to hurt him all the time.

39
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:31,290
You're looking for something that's comfortable. Won't you come talk to your younger sister?

40
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,203
Why is it?

41
00:04:33,203 --> 00:04:41,280
If one day you don't see your head rise, you will feel it.

42
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:28,922
How was the ride?

43
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:33,113
No problem, this is fun.

44
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:37,560
So who are you sitting with?

45
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,759
Oh, I forgot to think about it. Maybe I'm sitting with Jett.

46
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,039
No, I'm sitting with Pee.
[ song]

47
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,171
already......

48
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:02,847
Pleum water has arrived.

49
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:06,031
Ah.

50
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:11,070
water

51
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,760
Pleum is sweating. Pie wipe it for me.

52
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,248
Thank you.

53
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:28,243
Okay, the weather is nice.

54
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,723
And are we okay?

55
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,626
I'm okay.

56
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,539
Okay, that's a little difficult .

57
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,919
nevermind

58
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,207
Wait a minute, Khun Pie.

59
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:13,278
How is it going?

60
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:17,033
I would like to talk with Khun Pie about Pleum .

61
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:21,998
Khun Pie is flirting with Pleum , right ?

62
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:28,469
Pleum doesn't have anyone right now , right? Pie has the right to flirt. Because I didn't do anything wrong.

63
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:32,802
And how does Khun Pie know that Pleum doesn't have anyone?

64
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:38,459
Maybe Pleum already has someone in mind. But I still don't dare tell anyone.

65
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:47,889
I just came to tell Khun Pie first.

66
00:07:52,440 --> 00:08:00,000
Help, everyone, help me. My name is Pleum. I was captured by an evil cat.

67
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,937
( Laughter ) Ha. Ha Ha Haha

68
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:07,361
My name is Pie. I 'm a mean cat, everyone. Haha.

69
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:17,680
Tung Thu Thu Thu Walk back, walk back, walk back. Ouch .
Falling behind me, come up, come up, come up . Ja, Ja , Ja.

70
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,520
So what must I do to make you let me go?

71
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:44,490
How does Pie know that Pleum doesn't have anyone?
Maybe Pleum already has someone in mind.

72
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,138
come

73
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:06,146
pour water in

74
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,573
Let's try it. Who will be further away?

75
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:31,360
Well, come on .

76
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,019
( Sounds of chatter, competition)

77
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,360
Hey, what the hell are you playing at ?

78
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,600
What is this? It's bitter in my throat.

79
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,200
Have you ever swept the floor ?

80
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,349
Can you use a broom? You must sweep the floor to keep it clean. Not just sweeping, do you understand?

81
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:15,717
Huh?

82
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:18,720
And like this will....

83
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:30,279
What are you looking at? Doing work. Hey!

84
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,950
These people are here to volunteer, not to play.
you mind? I'll go to work and sweep the floor for you.

85
00:10:40,948 --> 00:10:45,720
Here, the guitar chords will just keep going around here.

86
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,827
4 chords in total.

87
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:48,290
Want to try it?

88
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,790
It's not difficult, right?

89
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,629
It's not difficult.

90
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,762
Start with G first.

91
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:51,293
G

92
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:52,544
you try it? G

93
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:53,196
This one.

94
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,374
No, no, ah, hey, okay.
Peep !!!

95
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:58,735
Top string, last string, try strumming it to see if it snaps.

96
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:00,473
How will it be done?

97
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:08,882
Miss Suea , I think someone must have confessed their love today because the atmosphere is very romantic.

98
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,253
Prod

99
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:20,455
Everyone can tell that you and P'Pleum are dating each other, and right now, you guys are flirting with each other.

100
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:25,050
They thought too far away.

101
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,950
Wow ....no one thought of this themselves. You see.

102
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,959
P'Pleum He's so infatuated with you.

103
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:42,221
I think he has feelings for you. Especially on the day your motorcycle crashed, it was clear that he was very worried about you.

104
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:50,207
Have you guys forgotten that P'Pleum doesn't like men? If you forget, turn around and look.

105
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,224
Stop thinking about it yourself.

106
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:57,676
You stop fooling yourself.

107
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:05,135
He came towards you like this. It's a signal to let you know. I want you to say something to him. Not for you to sit and be afraid like this.

108
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:14,220
The more the day you brought the bags together, the clearer it became.
If he doesn't have feelings for you If he doesn't like you No one does that to you.

109
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,443
I already told you that he doesn't like men.

110
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:20,594
I know he doesn't like men.

111
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:24,839
But I'm sure he likes you.

112
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,952
Can't stay

113
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:32,881
Oh ... Prod
Where are you going?

114
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,134
Hey Jet!
Where will you go?

115
00:12:46,134 --> 00:12:48,241
That's it. That's it.

116
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:57,843
Is there something important?

117
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:01,445
It's not important to the two of us .

118
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:03,131
But it's about Khon Prod.

119
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:05,755
Khon Prod

120
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:08,454
Pro, why?

121
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,565
I'm delighted. I really don't know that Prod likes you.

122
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:18,991
When we broke up, Prod came and said to me,
If we break up, Prod , can I be your new girlfriend ?

123
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:26,440
At first I thought he was joking. But when we look at it, we see that he is telling the truth.

124
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,399
Pleum if you think Khon Prod is the right person for you.

125
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,160
Hurry and decide. Don't let good things go unnoticed. This kind of thing got out of hand.

126
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,309
Thank you.

127
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,079
No matter how you feel, tell him.

128
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,000
um

129
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,662
We are the same. Don't let anyone sue you.
That you're not being nice.

130
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:01,023
I already know.

131
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:03,359
You can go now.

132
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,440
bye bye

133
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,160
Oh, Prod , I'll send you.....

134
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,941
Pleum going?

135
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,206
Khun Pie , please let Pleum go.

136
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:23,870
Where is he going?

137
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,266
Just like I told Khun Pie earlier in the day.

138
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,941
Is the person he likes here too?

139
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:31,033
Who is he?

140
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:38,440
We have to wait and see whether Pleum will accept the launch or not.

141
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:43,588
spirit

142
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:50,861
Where is Khon Prod ?

143
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,551
stay on top

144
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,040
You must have confessed your love to Khon Prod .

145
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:05,968
wait a minute

146
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:09,645
Is this what you really want to know?

147
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:43,855
Khon Prod

148
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,497
yes

149
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:54,000
Can I be your girlfriend ?

150
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,160
I know that Prod may not have forgotten someone yet.

151
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,160
But can you let me go in instead of that person ?

152
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,544
Phi Sanya

153
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,451
I promise that I will....

154
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,839
Brother Jet

155
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,363
I've decided.
It's time for me to accept the truth.

156
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,440
I will break my heart from him.

157
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:48,320
But before I give up Can I tell him all of my feelings first ?

158
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,680
No matter what happens I will accept it

159
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,106
I will move on

160
00:16:56,106 --> 00:16:58,694
For Brother Jet

161
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:06,880
I have good feelings for you, only my brother.

162
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:17,066
I've already opened up to you.
But my heart tells me that Brother Jet is the best older brother.

163
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,919
I'm sorry

164
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:44,240
It's okay. I understand Khon Prod .

165
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:56,080
But Prod , can you please tell me who the person in your heart is ?

166
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,880
P'Pleum .

167
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,263
He has been in my heart for 7 years.

168
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:09,435
Pleum

169
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:13,343
Khon Prod is thinking of letting go of you.

170
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,960
Khon Prod, please wait for me.

171
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,760
I wish you good luck.

172
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:36,068
Khon Prod

173
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,657
Prod, listen to me first.

174
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:48,831
What's the matter?

175
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:56,815
Prod: Don't abandon the person in your heart.

176
00:18:56,815 --> 00:19:00,720
That is...he doesn't know.

177
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,378
I never knew.

178
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:11,440
By now he knows. But he didn't dare.

179
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:19,679
I didn't dare to ask because he was afraid that...

180
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,360
He will be disappointed again.

181
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,400
you know?

182
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:42,520
7 years, I only looked at him. I've been looking at him since he brought the workbook to the teacher for me.

183
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,142
Until one day I came into his life.

184
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:53,833
I'm totally confused that this might not be true.

185
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,334
But it's true.

186
00:19:56,334 --> 00:20:03,840
The true story that I want Khon Prod to become a part of my life.

187
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,984
Can I get it ?

188
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:48,600
Then P'Sroi with P'Pie All right.
What will P'Pleum do?

189
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,466
Why do you have to take it?

190
00:20:53,466 --> 00:21:00,600
I saw P'Pleum join hands with P'Sroi. at the parking lot

191
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,378
Prod was angry at me from then on.

192
00:21:07,378 --> 00:21:11,600
There's also the matter of P'Pie. Again

193
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,960
P'Pie Flirting with P'Pleum
And besides, I like women too.

194
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:26,400
Yes, I like women.

195
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:33,320
But now I like Khon Prod.

196
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:43,591
Did you hear that? I like Khon Prod.

197
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,727
I like Khon Prod only.

198
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,004
elder sibling

199
00:21:54,825 --> 00:22:00,138
Did you hear it clearly?

200
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:09,109
My Khon Prod

201
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,395
Congratulation Congratulation

202
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:32,098
Pleum is not single anymore.

203
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:37,520
Our Prod has come true.

204
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,720
I'm totally shocked.

205
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,440
I thought I was going to jump down.

206
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:23,279
Are you ready?

207
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,619
yes

208
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:34,559
What can I do? They were born for each other.

209
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:57,602
Hmmmm.

210
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:14,349
( gasping sound)

211
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:23,310
Ouch!

212
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,849

226
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,799
Khon Prod 's mother .

227
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:30,320

I thank you very much.
Thank you for everything.

231
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:39,779
Don't worry.

232
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:45,401
For Khon Prod, I'm ready to do anything.

233
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:48,357
Let me sleep with you tonight.

234
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:57,589
I'm afraid P'Pleum has been tired all day.
Should have slept in a better place than this.

235
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:03,320
You can sleep anywhere.

236
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,148
Just have Khon Prod next to you.

237
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:14,706
P'Pleum Do you know why I'm so close to Pe ? Pe

238
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:16,740
I'm wondering the same thing.

239
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,792
I met Pe Pe At school, and I was the one who gave Pe chocolate milk. Pe eat

240
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:25,410
Prod is that kid?

241
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:33,399
When I found out that P'Pleum was the one who took Pe Pe I came to treat you. I am very happy.

242
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,880
I'm happy too.

243
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,120
Sit slowly.

244
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:44,841
Pleum

245
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:47,545
Mom, thank you very much.

246
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:54,698
Auntie is Khon Prod 's mother , just like my mother.

247
00:28:54,698 --> 00:29:00,593
Khon Prod , are you happy ?

248
00:29:00,593 --> 00:29:05,481
Mother came out of the hospital. I must be happy.

249
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:12,168
Pleum , I'll give you Khon Prod too.

250
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:23,127
I promise you, auntie, that I will take care of Khon Prod forever.

251
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,390
If there's anything, just say it, Jet.

252
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,000
I want to talk to you about Khon Prod.

253
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,115
Have you stopped liking your younger sister yet?

254
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:14,600
People like this kind of thing and cannot be banned.

255
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:24,421
What I will tell you is If the day of leaving the camp
If that day you didn't show seriousness to your younger sibling

256
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:28,880
I will not spare you.

257
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:37,120
In fact, Suea suspected that you liked Khon Prod , so she came to ask me.

258
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:45,000
If that day you don't confess your love to Khon Prod
I won't let you go either.

259
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,600
Because at that time, he was thinking of moving on with you as well.

260
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,120
I thank you.

261
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:12,240
Thank you all for allowing me to see the world more broadly.

262
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,159
I didn't know when I fell in love with Khon Prod .

263
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:26,919
I'm jealous when someone comes near me. Talk to your younger sibling.

264
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,240
Especially you

265
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:40,799
As for the thing that I like to tease my younger sibling about? I just want to get closer to it and talk to it more.

266
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:52,480
Sometimes I wonder why I like this boy.

267
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,540
Even though I've been with 10 women already.

268
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:11,839
My pure heart Because he never thought of hurting me.

269
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,279
It might make you feel better.

270
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:19,960
Even me

271
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:29,720
I've liked you since I don't know when.
I want you to keep this heart safe.

272
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,919
Don't think of harming it at all.

273
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,077
Because if you hurt me
I'll make you hurt more.

274
00:32:40,077 --> 00:32:46,797
Hey Jet, hey! You don't have to worry.
You know me well. Someone like me really loves someone.

275
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:58,399
If you're worried about anyone, even someone like you, don't get close to them.
you understand ?

276
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,840
Oh hey
My friend was not spared.

277
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:10,039
You go find your own thing, friend. This person is mine.

278
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:19,159
Yes, I can definitely find no less than you.
But right now, I'd like to come to terms with it first. I've just been heartbroken.

279
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,279
Let's do this , my friend.
Nong Khon Prod has 2 friends .

280
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,873
Why don't you try flirting? In case you're interested

281
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:32,228
You mean that damn thing ?

282
00:33:32,228 --> 00:33:34,498
agree with
Give it a try.

283
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:39,103
Leave it to Suea .

284
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:47,000
Suea Suea Why? Who does Suea like?

285
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:59,360
I can walk by myself.

286
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,360
In the end, the two of us turned into bitches.

287
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,800
How are you guys?

288
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,480
Do you still remember that we were friends?

289
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,820
Tum, my friend has something to talk to you about.

290
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,879
What's wrong?

291
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:41,079
Don't tell me you want me to be Hey Dwak instead of Khon Prod. I don't want it.

292
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:46,079
It's not that matter. It's a matter of the heart.

293
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,599
Chip and Tum

294
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:59,640
Sigh. In any case, please take care of my friend.

295
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,800
Tum , I'm a person who likes to speak frankly.

296
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,240
Don't like to be indirect.

297
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,200
I'd like to get to the point.

298
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,640
I'm a lover.

299
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,963
Why?

300
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,062
I'm about to fall off the chair.

301
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:36,830
Are you smiling at your father?

302
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:40,520
Your father is my father.

303
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:51,601
Mother asked me to come visit Auntie Pra. Yes, during this time the shop is very busy.

304
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:53,521
Mother doesn't have time to come visit.

305
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:59,352
Thank you very much. Please tell Waan. Thank you very much. that we always miss each other

306
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,620
The water has come.

307
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,217
Drink some cold water first, ladies.

308
00:36:07,217 --> 00:36:09,839
Thank you.

309
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,627
Thank you.

310
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:18,200
This one is a snack.

311
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,800
Mother's customers ask a lot about Khao Tom Mud.
When will it be sold again?

312
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,593
Wait for mother's condition to get better a little more.

313
00:36:29,593 --> 00:36:30,865
No.

314
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:33,572
Anyway, I would like to prohibit it first.

315
00:36:33,572 --> 00:36:39,160
Prod, delicious food, difficult to eat.

316
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,061
But it will affect my mother's health.

317
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:44,482
Anyway, I won't accept it.

318
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:45,857
yes

319
00:36:45,857 --> 00:36:49,242
Let's just say that for now, let's just follow Khon Prod .

320
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:51,563
After that, let's talk about it.

321
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:53,553
mother

322
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:59,520
Yes!

323
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:04,440
Sroi We have something to talk about.

324
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,640
Okay, I'll come soon.

325
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,520
What's the matter, Pleum ?

326
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,373
We would like to thank Sroi That tells us about Khon Prod.

327
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:42,130
It allows us to meet the right person.

328
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:45,524
We are glad that Pleum has found someone who is just like us.

329
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:48,054
Love is all around us .

330
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:54,546
Maybe you just need to step back and look at it a bit?
I need to find someone to help me.

331
00:37:54,546 --> 00:37:58,096
Keep this love for a long time.

332
00:37:58,096 --> 00:38:02,341
Sroi It's the same.

333
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:12,537
Well, we'll soon go to a volunteer camp in another province.
There are many beautiful tourist attractions there.

334
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:18,473
So we planned to surprise Khon Prod on his birthday.

335
00:38:18,473 --> 00:38:23,800
Sroi Come along , shall we ? Invite Froi. You can come too.

336
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:31,839
Looks fun, Dew.

337
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:43,319
Sigh, the weather is nice. Weather like this, I miss Khun Jet and Khun Nick.

338
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:44,998
Really, it's similar.

339
00:39:44,998 --> 00:39:55,000
Well, the loser has to take care of himself first. But I don't understand why Jet and Nick didn't come with us.

340
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,442
If it were you Nick , no, but if it were you.
Jet, I'm not sure.

341
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,109
You really like [ __ ] other people's stories.

342
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:11,839
So, who will volunteer to be a chef this year?
the cook making barbecue ?

343
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:19,079
Oh, if you don't have any, let's boil noodles and eat them ourselves.

344
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,168
I volunteer/volunteer

345
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:26,727
