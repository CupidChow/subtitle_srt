1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,460
Closer, sexy

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,920
Come on

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,200
Francisco!

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,920
Why are you so late? We are waiting for our client.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,340
these are the tickets

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,120
This is a total dinner.

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,140
Teresa

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,180
Have you seen Wally yet?

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,240
he hasn't called us

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,580
Hurry up

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,580
Let's go to the director.

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,110
It will be over soon!

13
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,370
Wait a minute

14
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,810
We haven't seen each other for a long time

15
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,550
You said you were going to see me last week.

16
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:48,930
Baby

17
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,810
I don't see anyone anymore

18
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,810
Who is it?

19
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,890
Garo, are you okay?

20
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,410
No

21
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,470
I'm not well.

22
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,230
Wait, you promised me!

23
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,070
Did you say you would take a day off today?

24
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,450
But now it's too early for that...

25
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,630
Why am I so late?!

26
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,970
Just follow my example later

27
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,070
See you

28
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,250
Tell the guard to put this away.

29
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,630
Hey what happened to you??

30
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,750
It was last night.

31
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,470
Oh, so it's time for you to be lazy again?

32
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,310
Yeah!

33
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,390
I already checked in

34
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:43,610
You are too late

35
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,650
What are you doing here

36
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,150
Let me remind you that your boyfriend is in the Philippines.

37
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,810
Thank

38
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,270
Bye

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,340
Our shoot tomorrow is cancelled.

40
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,380
Go home and finish

41
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,180
Bye

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,480
Take care

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,140
That's why you only have time to see Arthur.

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,960
It's true, but sometimes I think

45
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,880
Maybe it would be better if Arthur left while he was on the ship.

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,940
because it looks like a disaster

47
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,300
Did you know? He feels like

48
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,680
he lacks practice

49
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,030
And then when they leave

50
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,850
you will be angry

51
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,090
Of course

52
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,150
My appearance must look good.

53
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,910
You are not crazy?

54
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,730
Maybe

55
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,950
Because when she's not around

56
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,810
I miss him and look for him all the time.

57
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,550
But when he's here

58
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,050
He makes me angry everything he says

59
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,470
This is how LDR works

60
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,480
That's why so many people fall in love with their work.

61
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,120
because that person approaches you

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,440
So who are you falling in love with?

63
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,930
Oh I'm sorry

64
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,630
You have no feelings towards your ex-boyfriend.

65
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,230
Your ex left you suddenly.

66
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,490
It's no big deal!

67
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,420
you need to eat something

68
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,170
I'm like that, right?

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,920
Everything's fine

70
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,410
Even if I don't have family

71
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,070
everything will be fine

72
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,750
A good job

73
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,140
Friends

74
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,630
Sometimes there is stress

75
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,120
But everything will be fine

76
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,120
I have no other desires in my life.

77
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,140
My life is so simple,

78
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,400
and yet only 26 years have passed...

79
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,000
But because I?

80
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,970
Crazy! It scares me to death

81
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,650
What are you saying?!

82
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,870
And yet I'm not ready for this

83
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,650
There are still many things to do

84
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,570
What do you mean by that?

85
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,770
The doctor said

86
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,810
Not all MDS patients return home with leukemia

87
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,530
You have a patient

88
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,750
and it took him 15 years to diagnose it.

89
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,270
And he has a patient who only lasted 3 months!

90
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,470
And that's not you, the doctor said: wait and see.

91
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,790
take your medicine

92
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,950
Blood count every three months.

93
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,670
You will live normally

94
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,360
Stay with me tonight

95
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,890
Of course

96
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,440
It's in this column

97
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,080
Drink it early in the morning

98
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,780
Then the other

99
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,740
after dinner

100
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,740
I'll leave this here. Sign it so we can refund you later

101
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,220
You know, I thought if I was going to die

102
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,620
It would be better for me to enjoy my life.

103
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,150
What's up dude?

104
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,790
You're not dying yet

105
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,990
What do you want from your life?

106
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,230
Do you want to share gao when you are good enough?

107
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,950
I feel sorry for Arthur.

108
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,650
You've wasted your time with him.

109
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,230
What are you talking about?

110
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,390
Leave it to me

111
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,050
Know,

112
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,430
one day I thought about what you said

113
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,950
could be

114
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,530
Jimmy and my relationship is not over yet.

115
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,190
So... I want proof

116
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:42,870
Proof ?

117
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,230
Like an IQ test

118
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,430
I love us

119
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,590
to date again

120
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,690
and have sex

121
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,310
Know

122
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,590
Do you know how many times I've experienced sex at 26 years old?

123
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,950
There are so many things that still need to be done.

124
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,690
Are you serious?!

125
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,330
It's me time, Maddy!

126
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,770
This is weird but this is what you really have to do.

127
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,450
Don't judge my feelings

128
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,170
Simply love and value the person.

129
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,430
But I love you

130
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,410
I know that. That's why you look for me

131
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,170
Because I need some distraction so that

132
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,430
This pain won't bother me anymore

133
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,370
So please challenge your friends.

134
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,010
What are you talking about?

135
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,230
You already know that I have a degree in this kind of thing.

136
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,290
And all the people around my father are just bastards

137
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,680
But it's okay

138
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,420
If that's what I really want to do

139
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,040
just promise

140
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,840
Drink those medicines

141
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,220
And I'll take you for a checkup.

142
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,380
Ready to move in!

143
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,920
No snacks?

144
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,100
You can't eat French fries because they are salty and oily.

145
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,040
Here two fruits

146
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,700
Well

147
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,300
Thank you

148
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,600
Safely

149
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,060
Oh

150
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,040
she is so cool

151
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,240
That's what Jimmy used to do before.

152
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,540
You know Jimmy is my first girlfriend and he is mine too.

153
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,720
We both know nothing about each other.

154
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,300
Wait a minute! I'll go have some drinks

155
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:38,780
Well

156
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,990
You should try anyone

157
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,450
Because you're in your comfort zone

158
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,310
Try to get out of your comfort zone

159
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,420
good game

160
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:56,920
I dare you

161
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,660
It's Luigi, the computer scientist.

162
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,380
Because the?

163
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,420
You're crazy?! Don't you see that he likes you a lot?

164
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,360
He just can't form himself because it seems like something is going on between us.

165
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,760
So, do you want me to be his boyfriend now?

166
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,740
Boyfriend my ass

167
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,360
Of course just sex

168
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,620
to relax

169
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,180
Deal

170
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,620
Come on, let us look.

171
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,000
Come on.

172
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,450
Luigi?

173
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:41,750
Yeah

174
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,090
I checked, my laptop has a virus.

175
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,190
What is the problem

176
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,690
She said it was for you to take care of

177
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,520
We'll finish this while they're gone.

178
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,140
I am so tired

179
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,320
Did you enjoy it?

180
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,580
Of course!

181
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,060
You're lying

182
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,340
I dare you to play with Aris.

183
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,700
she is very good at it

184
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,710
Do not look at me like that.

185
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,110
Because?

186
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,210
I'm just a Harrods girl!

187
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,000
You are so cute when you smile

188
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,700
Hello Teresa, how are you?

189
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,240
I didn't know your place is here too.

190
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,000
What surprised you about being here?

191
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
It's the first time I see your face.

192
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,690
We know each other

193
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,750
You're stupid

194
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,670
We were talking

195
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,650
Teresa

196
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,890
Sorry, this is not important.

197
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:47,510
Well.

198
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,330
I forgot to tell you,

199
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,010
don't have sex with a guy more than once

200
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,630
or he could fall in love with you

201
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,590
It's an exhibition

202
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,510
if it's casual

203
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,570
so just be casual

204
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,310
except if you want

205
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,450
See?

206
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,790
Right now I'm in the practice space.

207
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,600
Are you OK ?

208
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,680
Yeah

209
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,460
Oh Lord!

210
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,240
It's getting late. Where you come from?

211
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,960
I'm a taxi driver and Teres's nose is bleeding.

212
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,880
So I took him to his house and waited for him to sleep.

213
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,600
Didn't you think I'm waiting for you?

214
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,020
You know it will only take me a month.

215
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,320
No problem

216
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,060
And also for the time

217
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,000
you left so early

218
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,480
Then he came home late

219
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,540
Please, Terese is sick and has no family or boyfriend.

220
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,380
Of course I tried to find one but it shouldn't be with that idiot.

221
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,440
That's your job

222
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,010
Did you know?

223
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,020
So

224
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,220
So, Maddy said you just got back from a breakup?

225
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,820
It's been a while. almost a year now

226
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,340
Why did you break up with him then?

227
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,820
you are so jealous

228
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,460
I'm just being serious

229
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,720
Well okay

230
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
We had our pregnancy scale.

231
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,500
She suddenly broke it when she thought she was pregnant.

232
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,560
The good thing is that it doesn't

233
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,100
Because I'm too scared to trust a single guy.

234
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,900
Health

235
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,060
Health!

236
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,880
Free.

237
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,140
But I'm just asking...

238
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,760
What are you looking for?

239
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,000
Fubu or rebound?

240
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,100
You need a new person

241
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,440
but

242
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,740
you are good at whatever

243
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,500
Your hands are cold

244
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,580
just relax

245
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:20,750
I'm sorry

246
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,790
It's not possible

247
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,360
We don't have to rush.

248
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,080
I'm interested in getting to know you better,

249
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,740
but if that's what you want

250
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,020
we can have a date here

251
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,400
and then meet at the condo

252
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,330
Maybe next time

253
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,070
Sure

254
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,030
Next time

255
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,050
Where do you want to have lunch?

256
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,610
Sorry, Aris and I are meeting.

257
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,430
Now

258
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,330
Wow! Afternoon pleasure. Why did you not tell me?

259
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,390
It's okay, enjoy and take care of yourself, okay?

260
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,650
Yes ma'am

261
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,010
Sometimes she is so insistent

262
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,630
Learn to say no

263
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,810
If it's been an hour

264
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,370
you are not here yet

265
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,170
Then I'll come see you

266
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,610
Well

267
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,910
It was a good reminder.

268
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,510
But why did you challenge her?

269
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,470
When you have less confidence than him.

270
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:24,970
let's accompany

271
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,470
I will call you later.

272
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,330
It's okay, take care!

273
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,170
Are you sure?

274
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,690
Wait a minute...

275
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,510
You can do it now

276
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,360
Room 1603

277
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,180
It's okay lady

278
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,160
Let me check the system

279
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,550
Alright

280
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,790
Thank you

281
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,320
Just text him if there's ever a problem.

282
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,280
If you say we don't remind you

283
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,480
Can be domineering at times.

284
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,250
Okay, I'll text you later.

285
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,380
Your condom is beautiful

286
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,300
No way

287
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,090
How much does it cost?

288
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,370
It is not allowed for me

289
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,130
But you know what

290
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,240
Why not

291
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,320
Take it

292
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,500
Thank you

293
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,390
Health!

294
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,980
Hi Aris, what did you do to Terese?

295
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,860
What is your problem?! Why are you making so much noise and why are you here?

296
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,980
Where is Teresa? What have you done with her!!

297
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,320
Are you OK??

298
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,690
Yes... Why are you here? I don't have any plans.

299
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,070
Are you OK? Did this idiot do something to you?

300
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,510
You're so full of shit.

301
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,350
Want some Pancit Canton too, Todd?

302
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,600
It is done?

303
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,060
Bye bye! Do you want me to take you home with me again soon?

304
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,460
Wait... aren't we getting back together now that I'm your manager?

305
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,920
I'm sorry... I was just worried about Terese.

306
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,820
Why should I care about him when he is my best friend?

307
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,800
He still looks like an old man.

308
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,020
You're still here?

309
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,980
Sorry, I received a text message.

310
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,940
He says you are silent.

311
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,860
Why do you want to stay here?

312
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,580
of

313
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,800
we are going to eat something

314
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,820
Good day

315
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,900
How are you

316
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:12,920
Good

317
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,000
Arthur and I will have dinner later.

318
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,940
Do you want to come with us?

319
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:18,900
There is no need

320
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,640
that's your date

321
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,820
With Aris?

322
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,500
No, with someone else.

323
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,340
Who ?

324
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,940
Secret! I'll tell you when it's successful.

325
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,160
Okay now let me share

326
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,670
What happened

327
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,090
I thought there was an emergency.

328
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,580
Wait

329
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,600
Alicia

330
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,600
Wait wait

331
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,540
What are these

332
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,100
Alicia

333
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,060
What do you think

334
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,640
I have a girlfriend.

335
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,190
You're not changing at all,

336
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,630
it's just that i miss you

337
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:18,890
Wait

338
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,860
That?

339
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,280
I'm sorry jamie

340
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,160
Why are you so late?

341
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,100
because there is no one else

342
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,720
Are you serious

343
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,070
Please go

344
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,270
Here you have.

345
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,060
Why did I order that, sir?

346
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,590
sorry jimmy

347
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,760
Her steak is delicious

348
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
yes he is delicious

349
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,560
Why did you decide to bring me here anyway?

350
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,780
Is there any special occasion?

351
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,000
Can't we eat something more delicious?

352
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,720
AND...

353
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,260
We haven't been able to have dates since the day

354
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,500
When I left my bar

355
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,550
that was cris

356
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,500
I don't want to go see him.

357
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,140
We can not?

358
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,330
It's okay, just come home early, okay?

359
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,260
Thank you

360
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,230
What's going through your mind Terese?

361
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,170
I don't know

362
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,400
Maybe my body is looking for the moments when he was with me.

363
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,880
But he seems like a different person.

364
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,480
I realized that he doesn't like me anymore.

365
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,500
It's okay, at least now you know what he likes.

366
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,360
That?

367
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,860
Don't think I took advantage of your situation before.

368
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,780
Can not explain

369
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,100
But

370
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,940
This is for you

371
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,920
Thank you

372
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:15,780
So that?

373
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,720
for making me feel comfortable

374
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,950
What is this

375
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,570
I wanted to do it on my own

376
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,170
But,

377
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,810
It's a little weird

378
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,480
maddy

379
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,360
Will you marry me

380
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,500
Yeah

381
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,780
Are you OK?

382
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,890
Wait, is there a problem?

383
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,820
I called you

384
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,300
Is there something bothering you?

385
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm doing the right thing

386
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,670
Of course

387
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,300
This has been on my mind

388
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,360
All this time

389
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,180
Until today

390
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,760
to get to the point

391
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,340
That's when it all started

392
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,500
We have been together for a year

393
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,100
and we only got married twice.

394
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,390
And sometimes in a month

395
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,110
I can talk to you only once when you are abroad.

396
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,990
but when you are here

397
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,610
It's more than enough time for me

398
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,030
What does it mean?

399
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:50,840
don't say that

400
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,810
They forced you before

401
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,190
if you get married

402
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,690
How is it possible

403
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,920
It's not going to change, I'll still leave anyway.

404
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,130
You do not love me anymore?

405
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:19,780
We've been waiting for each other and we're used to having each other there all the time.

406
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,050
So when is the wedding?

407
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,880
There's a new guy coming.

408
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,400
Are you OK?

409
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,300
I have to leave early for a checkup.

410
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,920
Correct! Okay, then let me go with you.

411
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:27,720
There is no need

412
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,060
What's wrong with you

413
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,340
Let's fix it

414
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,440
Very interesting result of bone marrow extraction.

415
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,840
It seems that

416
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,660
Your platelets have improved and your blast count has decreased.

417
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,420
What do you mean, doctor?

418
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,920
You're still in the wait and see stage

419
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,650
We are monitoring you

420
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,760
And this is a big improvement over your previous tests.

421
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,260
If improvement continues

422
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
we can say that

423
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,060
our diagnosis was wrong before

424
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:16,860
and

425
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,040
you really don't have myelodysplastic syndrome

426
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,620
and will not continue with leukemia.

427
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,950
Is that true, doctor?

428
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,110
Yeah! But then again, you're still waiting and you'll see

429
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,880
What I can say is that this is very rare.

430
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,870
but this is a good sign

431
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,250
Do not worry about me

432
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,090
You can do this Teresa.

433
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,250
If you want we will celebrate it tomorrow.

434
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:51,660
Wait

435
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,240
You've been quiet for a while.

436
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,600
Is something wrong, Maddy?

437
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,670
I don't know...

438
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,570
It's like he's no longer sure what it feels like to be with Arthur.

439
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,790
as if he was no longer happy

440
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,750
he doesn't think about me

441
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,090
I'm not looking for it anymore

442
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,900
While this engagement ring is on

443
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,840
It's getting more and more confusing

444
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,540
Maybe you'll just be surprised by what's happening.

445
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,810
You need to sit down and tell me how you feel.

446
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,690
Do you want us to talk more?

447
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,690
Come sleep here...

448
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,390
Wait a minute!

449
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:46,950
Confused…

450
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,180
But why do I feel like this is the right place for everything?

451
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,120
I love you Madi, but just like you said.

452
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,820
You love Arturo too.

453
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,810
And I won't put you in a dangerous situation

454
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,570
What should we do?

455
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,080
we haven't lost yet

456
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,540
Your mind is confused

457
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,820
and I'm sure you're not ready

458
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,200
It will hurt

459
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,240
I do not want to hurt you.

460
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,490
I'm wrong?

461
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,430
No, it's not your fault

462
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,690
thanks for knowing

463
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,070
it is not my intention

464
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,970
Losing feelings of love.

465
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:51,890
but still here

466
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,230
Supporting you

467
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,430
There are so many things on mind

468
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:59,110
And even if only I existed

469
00:43:59,110 --> 00:43:59,630
I don't want to get involved.

470
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:03,010
Do you really have no feelings for me?

471
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:10,450
We are only talking about our bodies, not those of others.

472
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,430
You know it

473
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:14,970
don't be unfair

474
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,180
But I understand

475
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,980
Last chance

476
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:56,530
I hope you are happy with your decision.

477
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:59,850
And that you will also be happy

478
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:01,330
As?

479
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,930
Teresa is a good person

480
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,940
She will ensure your happiness.

481
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,840
and take care

482
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:14,700
Thank you

483
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,420
I am so hungry.

484
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:31,070
Francisco!

485
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,410
can you eat now

486
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,090
Guys, lunch break

487
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:37,610
Well well

488
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,270
I've arrived late?

489
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,740
You are not going to join this project properly.

490
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,980
Are you already tired of loving me?

491
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,160
your cheesy

492
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:01,710
I'm ready

493
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,450
No more fear

494
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,750
I'm not ashamed.

495
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,970
What are you saying?

496
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:10,950
If you don't answer me,

497
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,470
maybe my love for you will never bite your lips again

498
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,530
That's your last chance

499
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,070
And now that...

500
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,410
Are you ready for us?
