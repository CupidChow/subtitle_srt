It's not something to decide, is it?

74
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:13,128
But with someone I don't like

75
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:13,128
To do that is ➡

76
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,194
About yourself

Don't push it against me.

89

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,699
I thought yesterday too, but it's a bit

91
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,699
That's what I'm particular about.

92
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:01,293
When I was in elementary school

93
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:01,293
"You should cherish your first love" ➡

94
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:03,633
That's what I was told

95
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:03,633
It left an impression on me ➡

96
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:07,699
I just want to protect it.

97
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,359
Hmm

98
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,359
So that first love has come true.

99
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,392
Of course it was good.

100
00:05:14,392 --> 00:05:16,963
No, it's not fruitful.

101
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:19,732
Huh?

102
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:23,194

00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:25,699
no

104
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:25,699
That's not the case though.

105
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,864
After that

106
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,864
I just can't find someone I like.

107

What is it?

379
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,227
Ah, no...

380
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:04,359
Oh, right? Do you like the sea?

381
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,359
Huh?

382
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,359
There were a lot of sea books there.

383
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,392
Sorry, I'm looking at it without permission.

384
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:14,161
Ah

385
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:14,161
I'm a graduate school major.

386
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:17,260
Wow. Do you like fish?

387
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,600
Yes, since I was little.

388
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,227
On the way home from school

389
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,227
There's a big river ➡

390
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:25,524
I've been watching fish there for a long time.

391
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:30,293
Hehe I can imagine something.

392
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:34,062
Oh, come to think of it

393
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:34,062
I was on my way home from elementary school too.

394
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:37,029
There was a big river.

395
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:40,359
I moved in middle school

396
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:40,359
I don't remember very well though.

397
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,392
Wow.

398
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:48,194
Ah, come to think of it...

399
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,699
Maybe you're interested in something like this?

400
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,260
here

401
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,260
I'm doing a project I wanted to go to.

402
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,524
Is that so? Then I'll give it to you.

403
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:06,392
Oh, then

404
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:06,392
Is it okay if it's next Sunday?

405
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:10,260

406
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:10,260
yeah? Is it inconvenient?

407
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:17,359
Maybe you're going with me?

408
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,227
Huh?

409
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:23,128
Ah... ah

410
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:23,128

What kind of miracle will be next?

00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:20,666
Are you waiting?
