00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,457
(Kyoko) Imperial capital and the aquarium?

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,457
(Imai Karen) Well, it's going to happen.

3
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:12,533
(Kyoko) It's a date.

4
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:12,533
It's not a date.

5
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,566
at least

6
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,566
The other side doesn't mean that.

7
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,127
So, what are you planning on Karen?

8
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:21,599
I don't know but oh well

9
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:21,599
It's the Imperial Major majoring ➡

10
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:24,566
I was a little curious.

11
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:24,566
Hahaha, that's how Karen is like ➡

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,665
That's rare.

13
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,665
That's not true, though.

14
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:31,929
Are you going to date?

15
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:31,929
No way.

16
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:36,665
(Kyoko) What?

17
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:36,665
He's younger, a student, and a strict person.

18
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:40,127
A veteran love for the veteran

19
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:40,127
Are you worried about that now?

20
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:43,797
Already~ People

21
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:43,797
Like Cleopatra in Reiwa.

22
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:45,830
I'm not saying that much.

23
00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:51,325
but

24
00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:51,325
I'm not interested in finding a boyfriend.

25
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:54,424
(Kyoko) Your

26
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:54,424
The one who doesn't make the main one ➡

27
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,863
It's deep-rooted. ➡

28
00:00:56,863 --> 00:01:01,127
Well, that's all

29
00:00:56,863 --> 00:01:01,127
That senior was terrible.

30
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:07,325
(Kyoko)

31
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:07,325
But, if it's not a date ➡

32
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:09,358
Usually

33
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:09,358
Shouldn't you just have fun?

34
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:12,533
A man who can't get it in his handbag

35
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:12,533
It's fresh, isn't it?

36
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:15,325
Well, that's true.

37
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,533
Conversely, the more you love

38
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,533
I was at the mercy of it.
