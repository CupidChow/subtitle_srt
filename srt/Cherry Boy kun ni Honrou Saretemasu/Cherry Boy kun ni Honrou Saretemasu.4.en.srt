"My cold has completely improved!

thanks so much~!

Thank you somewhere next time! ”

8
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:25,061
｟I cherish my first love｠

00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:27,391
(Sakura) ｟Yes, it's definitely it ｠

10
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:33,632
Whew.

11
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,424
Hmm...

00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,325
♬〜

13
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,830
Jan!

14
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,830
(Airi) Oh, it feels good!

15
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,863
(Suzuki) I think so too. Especially ➡

16
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:53,061
The phrase "color that will make you feel like you are"

17
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:53,061
That's good.

18
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:56,391
(Airi) Yes. Somehow

19
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:56,391
I don't think it's like Karen-chan ➡

20
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:58,457
It's fresh.

21
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:58,457
What?

22
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:01,566
(Airi) Yes.

23
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:01,566
A catch that feels like "self-affirmation!" ➡

24
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,896
Until now

25
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,896
I don't think it was much.

26
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:07,500
Ah, is that so?

27
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:07,500
Maybe it was unconscious.

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,533
(Suzuki)

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,533
Your own personality is important. ➡

30
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,863
Even if I'm lying

31
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,863
I mean it's getting tired.

32
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:14,896
ah~.

33
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:18,665
｟The one who spoke naturally

34
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:18,665
What do you mean? ➡

35
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:20,863
I think it's cute

36
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:22,896
That's certainly true.

38
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,797
Maybe

39
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,797
Was there a change in your feelings?

40
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,028
Ahh...➡

41
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:37,094
There was... maybe?

42
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:42,094
(Airi) What? what?

43
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:42,094
(Suzuki) What is it?

44
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:44,127
(Sugimoto)

45
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:44,127
What happened with Karen after that?

46
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:46,391
What... nothing in particular.

47
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:49,698
What is it boring?

48
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:49,698
I want you to follow me.

49
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:52,457
Do you want to emulate it?

50
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:52,457
(Sugimoto) Actually, me➡

51
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:55,160
I met Kyoko!

52
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,193
Huh?

53
00:01:57,193 --> 00:02:01,061
(Sugimoto) That's what that reaction is.

54
00:01:57,193 --> 00:02:01,061
No... No, isn't it too early?

55
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:03,764
This kind of thing

56
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:03,764
It's a speedy life.

57
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:06,358
It's no use taking the time, right?

58
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:06,358
No ➡

59
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:09,424
Finding speed in answers is

60
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:09,424
This is the cause of careless mistakes.

61
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:12,665
That's why science-oriented men are good.

62
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:12,665
Ahh.

63
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,391
Even if a science guy says it.

64
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,391
(Sugimoto) Shut up.

65
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,929
Hahaha.

66
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,929
(Sugimoto)

67
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,929
There is good news for such a shy Imperial capital.

68
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:23,632
Are you really cheerful?

69
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:23,632
Me and Kyoko ➡

70
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:27,193
Plan your trip.

71
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:27,193
Would you like to go with me?

72
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:30,325
I don't like it. Why am I

73
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:30,325
A freshly-made couple ➡

74
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:32,424
I have to follow the trip

75
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:32,424
Is it not okay?

76
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:35,566
You're not the only one.

77
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:35,566
Karen-san also invited me.

78
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,731
What... Why Imai-san?

79
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:40,863
(Sugimoto) That's fine. A trip with the four of us.

80
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:40,863
Let's go!

81
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:42,896
To Kyoko

82
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:42,896
I'll have it set up.

83
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,632
Please wait a minute! recently

84
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,632
A report that needs to be finished.

85
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,665
(Sugimoto) That's good. That's good.

86
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,665
Because it's not good!

87
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:50,797

After all, Imperial Capital

103
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:24,325
Wasn't he not interested?

104
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:27,259
(Kyoko) Is that so?

105
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:27,259
This trip ➡

Wasn't you half-forced?

108
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,929
Hmm... I was pretty enthusiastic

109
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,929
Kouki said that though.

110
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:36,599
I don't see it as a hit, but...

111
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,226
Oh, the Imperial Capital! Because I'm sleep-deprived

112
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,226
Don't look like that!

113
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:43,259
What? Are you lacking sleep?

114
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,863
Yesterday I was going to compile a research report

115
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,863
Stay all night...

116
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:50,127
Oh, is it okay?

117
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:50,127
At such a difficult time ➡

118
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:53,665
He came to travel.

119
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:53,665
Well, it's okay.

120
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:57,226
No no, actually, before travel

121
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:57,226
Because I wanted to finish it.

122
00:03:57,226 --> 00:04:00,226
You were really looking forward to it, right?

123
00:03:57,226 --> 00:04:00,226
Aaaah...it's fine now!

124
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:03,325
Let's go, seriously.

Let's go, yes.

(Sugimoto) Kyoko-chan, look.

137
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:59,665
There's a soft serve ice cream shop over there.

Imperial capital is here

00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:14,896
Apparently there are a lot of shops.

148

Something

149
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:16,929
Maybe I want to go somewhere...

Ah, no.

153

Imai-san please watch as you like.

154
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:35,226
I'm going for a walk a little.

155

Drunk

157
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:46,160

161
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:58,061

Huh?

00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:06,896
Even after getting drunk ➡

167
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:10,160
Because it seems to work. Is it true that Imperial Capital too?

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,358
Ah... Yes.

169
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,599

I'd like to go around other places too...

179
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,457
Yeah…

180
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,457
I'm tired from the long journey ➡

181
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:48,457
Also, when you arrive at the inn, you can find a hot spring or something.

182
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:48,457
There's some delicious food. ➡

183

"You're a kind person"

186
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:57,962

(Sakura)｟No way! ➡

191
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:09,632
Don't say something that people like, weird! ｠

<<The truth is

193
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:13,424
Maybe it's not changed ➡

194
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:15,533
Ever since then≫

195
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:18,533
Wow, it's warm!

196
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,863
oh~.

197
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:23,325
Ah, it's pretty hot.

198
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:23,325
Huh?

199
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:28,358
Ah, it's warm.

200
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:28,358
Yeah. nice.

201
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:33,698
Come to think of it

202
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:33,698
In a duo room with Sugimoto ➡

203
00:07:33,698 --> 00:07:36,028
What are you talking about at night?

204
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:39,665
Ah...

205
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:39,665
I think I'll sleep normally though.

206
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:43,292
What? Are you not going to do something like Love Banana?

207
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,325
Love Banana?

208
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:49,830
Shouldn't you do that? What about pillow fights?

209
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:54,995
Um~ Imai-san about us

210
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:54,995
How many do you think it is?

211
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:57,533
Yeah~

212
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:57,533
Because it's a two-person room, right?

213
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:01,160
You'll definitely play.

214
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:01,160
I won't.

215
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,292
Even though I said that...

216
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,325
(Kyoko) Because this is the room for two.

217
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:08,731
Why the same room?

218
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:11,698
(Kyoko)

219
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:11,698
I would like a room with Kouki.

220
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:14,731
Of course that's true!

221
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:14,731
I haven't heard of it though.

222
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:17,094
Well, well

223
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:17,094
We'll eat rice together.

224
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:19,160
Well then

225
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:19,160
Please call me when you're ready for the bath!

226
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,193
bye bye.

227
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:31,061
It's the same room again.

228
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:33,094
I agree.

229
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:36,259
<What are you nervous?>

230
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,896
≪Although already

00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,325
Teito-kun, do you want to drink tea?

236
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,566
Ha... Yes I'll drink it.

237

238
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:01,127
Whew. Calm down Calm down. ➡

I'm a flounder. ➡

A golden sea shark...

244
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,797
(Sugimoto) Is the Imperial Capital still angry?

245
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm not angry.

246
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm just angry.

247
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,193
synonym~!

248
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:35,292
But it felt good

249
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:35,292
With Karen-san.

250
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,896
It's not like that other people

251
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,896
I think so though.

252
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:41,028
(Sugimoto) Why? It's Hanakoi

253
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:41,028
If you're not interested in you ➡

254
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:43,292
He didn't come even on this trip.

The Imperial Capital

256
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:52,259
You think it's fine, right?

257
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,160

I'm close to people other than me.

(Kyoko)

264
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:15,566
Something like this has changed, isn't it?

265
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:18,160
What?

266
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:18,160
Yeah.

267
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,391
Until now, I've been with a man

268
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,391
Iron mask-like mask➡

269
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:24,094
He was wearing it.

270
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:24,094
What? Was it that big?

271
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:29,325
In front of the Imperial Capital

272
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:29,325
I was impressed that I was able to speak naturally.

273
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:34,160
Well, there are a lot

274
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:34,160
He was said to be harsh and damn damn.

275
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,226
Two-person structure

276
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,226
I think it's a good atmosphere though.

How's your feelings?

282

Huh?

283
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:57,193
(Sugimoto) I've been there for a long time

284
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:57,193
You were only interested in fish ➡

285
00:10:57,193 --> 00:10:59,863
Do this

286
00:10:57,193 --> 00:10:59,863
He accompanied me on trips ➡

287

I'm quite happy. ➡

Finally

289
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:06,325
I feel like I've become more human.

290
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:08,929
Eh, it's human-like...

291
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:14,566
Various things for Hanaren-san too

Maybe there is but ➡

293

What?

299
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:35,863
With the Imperial Capital

300
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:35,863
How should I face it?

301
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,896
Yeah. Hehe.

302
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:44,160
If you think about it

303
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:44,160
Until now, like the Imperial Capital ➡

304
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,358
You'll get seriously angry

305
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,358
Someone who cares➡

306
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:50,830
It's not there at all. Well, we'll meet ➡

307
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,896
I was just a random sex friend

308
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,896
That's what.

309
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:55,325
Ahh, I see.

310
00:11:57,962 --> 00:12:01,665
So now

311
00:11:57,962 --> 00:12:01,665
How should I face it? ➡

312
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:03,698
I don't know at all.

313
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,358
(Kyoko) Hehehe.

314
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,543
What was the most delicious?

315
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,543
It's a flounder.

316
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,926
Hehe. Eating too

317
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,926
I love fish the most.

318
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:18,830
Hehe, that's right.

319
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:18,830
Ah, you're full.

320
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,094
It was an incredible amount, isn't it?

321
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,094
Yeah.

322
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:23,764
But Teito eats quite a bit.

323
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:23,764
I was surprised.

324
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:25,797
No, Imai-san too

325
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:25,797
I was eating quite a lot.

326
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:29,292
As expected, large portions of green onions mentaiko mayo

327
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:29,292
Queen of warm egg toppings.

328
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:32,094
Hey, stop that title.

329
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:35,457
I can't believe it's in the backyard

330
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:35,457
I guess he wasn't calling it that way.

331
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:39,391
Hahaha, what do you think?

332
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,424

What will you do when you graduate?

336
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:54,929
Ah, at the Marine Biology Research Institute

337
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:54,929
I will work as a researcher.

338
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:57,830
Hmm. Is that a shark?

339
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,896
Ah, it's not just sharks

340
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,896
But I guess I'm talking about sharks after all.

341
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:03,160
I want to keep researching

342
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:03,160
I'm thinking.

343
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,962
Hmm, that's right.

344
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,962
yes.

345
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:08,929
What do you like so much?

346
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:08,929
Hmm...➡

347
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:11,358
Looks like

348
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:11,358
I also like the cool side.

349
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,764
Not only is it fierce

350
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,764
Maybe he's timid ➡

351
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:17,500
There are some cute parts too.

352
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:17,500
And there are many different ways to create them...

353
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,533
How to be born?

354
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,533
yes.

355
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,566
Sharks are rare among fish.

356
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:25,226
Intrabody fertilization through mating

357
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:25,226
There are many species that are breeded.

358
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,292
It's called a viviparous life.

359
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:30,358
Wow, that's right.

360
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:30,358
I didn't know.

361
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:32,797
In fact, there are few sharks.

362
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:36,500
Meet the same individual

363
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:36,500
I value it very much.

364
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,259
Something

365
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,259
I think that kind of thing is good.

366
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,797
So I'll meet people too

367
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,797
I want to cherish it ➡

368
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:44,830
I'm thinking about it.

369
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:49,292
I see. So the Imperial Capital is

370
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,457
You can deal with people properly.

371
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:55,665
Ah... sorry.

372
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:57,962
I've talked about this again.

373
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:02,160
Yes. Also

374
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:02,160
I'm happy to hear about the Imperial Capital.

375
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,061

00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:02,028
⚞(East) Ahhhh, well, certainly.

566
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:02,028
But for a limited time only ➡

567
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:04,731
Isn't eels coming out?

568
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:04,731

569
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:08,731
<The Imperial Capital

570
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:08,731
Are you talking to a girl laughing?≫

571
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:13,127
Hehe.

572
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:16,028
Ah, are you going?

573
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:16,028
(East) Yes. ➡

574
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,424
Well then

575
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,424
Senpai: We met in front of the aquarium.

576
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:22,358
Because I understand. Ah, look forward.

577
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:22,358
Look forward properly.

578
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:24,391
(East) See you later!

579
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:30,028
♬〜

580
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:32,391
Aquarium...

581
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:37,896
Isn't you going with me?

582
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,061
The Imperial Cape and that child...

583
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,061
What do you mean? ➡

584
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:47,160
He's a straight and good girl.

585
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:47,160
It was a great match!

586
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,500
It was really fun.

587
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,500
That was good.

588
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,797
That ex was the worst.

589
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,395
But

590
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,395
Isn't the Imperial Capital different?
