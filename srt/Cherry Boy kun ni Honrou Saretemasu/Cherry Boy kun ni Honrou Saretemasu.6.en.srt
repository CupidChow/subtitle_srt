Ahhh, that happened.

34
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:59,929
Is there a hanger?

35
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:59,929

193
00:08:57,698 --> 00:09:01,962
Ahhh haha. That's what it is.

194
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,160
Hahaha.

195
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:12,929
What is it?

196
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:12,929
(Yuto) Whew. No ➡

197
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,797
He's a little boy.

198
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:18,995
Huh?

199
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:18,995
(Yuto) is Karen-chan's sex friend too?

200
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:23,226
It's not that.

201
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:26,292
Ah, that's right.

202
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:26,292
Does that mean seriously?

203
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:32,830
It has nothing to do with you, does it?

204
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,830
(Yuto)

205
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,830
Well, that's right, it has nothing to do with me.

206
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,358
But that child

207
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,358
I won't make a real person, but is it okay?

208
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:42,995
Huh?

209
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:42,995
Whew.

I'll teach you something good.

213
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,995
Thank you for keeping me waiting.

214
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:59,028

Karen Channel My ears are weak.

218
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,457
(Yuto) Haha.

219
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:27,896
Imperial House-kun, what's wrong?

220
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:33,424
Huh?

221
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:33,424
(Yuto) Ah, Karen-chan. ➡

222
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,830
Please let me know when I've finished drinking.

223
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,830
I'll boil the bath and wait.

225
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:42,028
(Yuto) Well then.

Rattle... Pattern (the sound of the door)

227
00:10:56,358 --> 00:11:00,325
Imperial Capital Um...

228
00:10:56,358 --> 00:11:00,325
There's a continuation ➡

229
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,457
Did you come to me?

230
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:07,632
Huh? No, that's a misunderstanding!

231
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:10,632
I wonder if Yuto will come...

232
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:10,632
"Yuto"...

233
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,160
Hmm.

234
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,160
Is he someone who plays, not his boyfriend?

235
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:27,863
it is….

236
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:27,863
As expected ➡

237
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:31,028
Imai-san is light.

238
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:38,391
Even the Imperial Capital ➡

239
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:40,797
He was playing with a girl other than me.

240
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,500
What are you talking about?

241
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Aquarium ➡

242
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,292
You weren't there, just two with a girl.

243
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,127
What? How do you know?

244
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,632
I happened to see it on my way home from work.

245
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,962
Was it bad to see?

246
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,962
Higashi is just a junior.

247
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:02,391
But everyone in the seminar went together

248
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:02,391
I was saying that ➡

249
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,424
We were alone!

250
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,533
That's the other people, everyone

251
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,533
I've caught a cold...

252
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,566
Is there such a coincidence?

253
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,863
Girls too

254
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,863
It looked like it was so much fun.

255
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,962
perhaps

256
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,962
Don't you like Imperial Court?

257
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:15,995
Huh?

258
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:19,160
Even the Imperial Capital is a bit

259
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:19,160
Didn't you have ulterior motives?

260
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,896
She's just a junior.

261
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,160
With Imai's light yardstick

262
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,160
Even about my juniors➡

263
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,457
Stop doubting something strange!

264
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:39,259
Please go back now.

265
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,127
Yuto will probably be waiting for you too.

266
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:51,731
I understand.

267
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,665
The Imperial Capital too

268
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,665
Just be friends with your juniors.

(Yuto)

275
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,533
Welcome home. It was early.

276
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:30,929
Why were you talking to the Imperial City?

277
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,929
Why

278
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,929
The first thing I spoke to was ➡

279
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:36,259
It's the Imperial Capital.

280
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:40,632
That's why

281
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:40,632
Something that would be misunderstood...

282
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:43,896
Misunderstanding? No, isn't it a misunderstanding?

283
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:47,193
Because we're sex friends, right?

284
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:47,193
it is….

285
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,830
(Yuto) Hey, what are you serious about?

286
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,830
For such a child.

287
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,863

That's fine. ➡

292
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:21,061
I think so

293
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:21,061
We've been together up until now.

294
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,094
Go home!

295
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:26,500
Yes, yes.

297
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:33,160

It's impossible to have a normal love affair.

Huh?

307
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:10,424
The courage to face people

308
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:10,424
Because I don't have the spirit.

309
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:13,259

(Suzuki) What?

340
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,127
(Air) Before that, there was a change in my feelings

341
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,127
I was talking about something like that ➡

342
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:35,797
Maybe they're getting married soon

343
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:35,797
We were talking to Suzuki-chan too.

344
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,830

345
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,424

Hehehe.

382
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:16,226
Ah, sorry ➡

383
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,358
Something

384
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,358
I got excited without my permission.

385
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,523
Yes. Something like that ➡

386
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:23,226
Something like the Imperial capital

387
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:23,226
I think I'm saying that.

388
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:26,523
What about Imperial Capital Senior

389
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:26,523
Do you know?

390
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:31,061
Umm...

391
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:31,061
I often go to that beef bowl restaurant too.

392
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:35,665
Ah, that's right.

393
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:35,665
Amazing coincidence.

394
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:37,698

(Higashi) Senpai

396
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:40,490
I'm also extremely busy with research.

397
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,929
I'm working part-time and paying for tuition fees too

398
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,929
I really respect it.

399
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,797
What is that so.

400
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:48,830
I myself

401
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:48,830
Because I decided I wanted to do it ➡

402
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,457
I want to study on my own

403
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,457
Tell me. ➡

404
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,830
That's what I admire.

405
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:59,292
You're looking at Imperial House carefully.

406
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,424
Ah yes. Because I like it.

407
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:06,259
Huh?

408
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:06,259
From when I entered the same seminar ➡

409
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:08,292
I've always liked it.

410
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:14,698
That's amazing.

411
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:14,698
That's what I can say clearly.

412
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:19,665
Oh, me too

413
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:19,665
I can't cheat or anything.

414
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:23,391
It's embarrassing

415
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:23,391
It's my first love.

419
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:36,424
This was my first time falling in love with someone.

420
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:38,457
Seniors are more hard work than anyone else ➡

421
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:40,995
For anyone

422
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:40,995
It will face you straight. ➡

423
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:43,061
The opposite sex and same-sex will not change their attitude ➡

424
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:45,929
Well, sometimes the way I say it

425
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:45,929
Sometimes it gets tough though ➡

426
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:48,094
But I'm not wrong.

427
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:50,962
It's so cool I like it

428
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:50,962
I think so.

429
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:55,731
