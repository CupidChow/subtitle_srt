00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:52,491
It feels strange, don't turn back.

195
00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:52,491
it's okay.

196
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:56,732
♬〜

197
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:58,765
Because I like it.

198

199

200
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:12,260
(Kyoko) Really

201
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:12,260
I found a good girl Hanakoi.

202
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,633
Once again, it's an endangered species.

203
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,996
What is it?

204
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,996
(Sugimoto) But ➡

205
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:22,095
you

206
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:22,095
Now, towards a master's thesis ➡

207
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:24,930
Will you be seriously busy?

208
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,128
yes.

209
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,128
It's an unimaginable schedule.

210
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,897
(Kyoko) Karen is getting busy with work too

211
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,897
Didn't you say that?

212
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,425
Yeah. Our company's new brand

213
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,425
I'll start it up ➡

214
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,600
I think I'll be in charge of that.

215
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,666
(Kyoko) They're both busy ➡

216
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,524
There are many opportunities to meet

217
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,524
Isn't it going to disappear?

218
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:44,963
Yes... that's right.

219
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:47,963
(Sugimoto) What are you going to do?

220
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:47,963
Is this the peak of lovey-dovey?

221
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:50,293
(Kyoko) Yes.

222
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:50,293
Certainly ➡

223
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:53,227
If you say you're not lonely

224
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:53,227
That's a lie, but ➡

225
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,425
Karen's favorite job

226
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,425
I want you to do your best.

227
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:03,161
I too, the Imperial Capital

228
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:03,161
If you think you're trying hard ➡

229
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:06,062
I can do my best too.

230
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:09,227
(Kyoko)

231
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:09,227
People change so much.

232
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:11,798
(Sugimoto) The Imperial Capital too. It looks like a different person.

233
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:13,963
Hehe.

234
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:18,128
I'll try to get over it. That's love!

235
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,095
That's love.

236
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:27,798
Though I said that...

237
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:31,227
I don't think I'll get over it at all!

238
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:34,161
(Suzuki)

239
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:34,161
Events are pushing in.

240
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:39,699
It's tough because there are a lot of business trips.

241
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,359
(Airi) Karen-chan, you know you've got a boyfriend

242
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,359
I said that, is it okay?

243
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:48,227
It's not good.

244
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:48,227
I thought it was okay but ➡

245
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:51,260
I don't think I'll get over it at all!

246
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,293
(Suzuki) It's tough. ➡

247
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:56,732
When is your next date?

248
00:11:56,732 --> 00:12:00,128
Haha. Date schedule ➡

249
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:03,029
I don't have time to pinch.

250
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,458
(Airi) Certainly

251
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,458
This may not be possible on this schedule.

252
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:13,524
already

253
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:13,524
I haven't seen my face for about two weeks.

254
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,633
(Suzuki) I have to meet that

255
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,633
Don't you feel anxious?

256
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:20,930
Honesty….

257
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,732
It will become.

258
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:31,029
While we couldn't meet, a cute junior was

259
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,062
on second thoughts

260
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,062
Say you can't give up ➡

261
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:35,260
If you're doing a fierce attack

262
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:35,260
What should I do?➡

263
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,897
A sexy woman comes to my part-time job

264
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,897
What if I seduce you? ➡

265
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:42,161
With the celebrities I passed by

266
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:42,161
What if you fall in love?

267
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,194
(Airi) I'm really fantasizing about it.

268
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:47,897
(Suzuki) What if I can't sleep at night

269
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:47,897
That's what you think about.

270
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:50,029
(Airi) If you're that worried ➡

271
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,062
Even if you do too hard

272
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,062
Shouldn't we meet?

273
00:12:56,425 --> 00:13:00,699
Yes. Because the other side is doing their best too.

274
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:02,732
And...

275
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:08,491
Because I believe in him.

276
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:14,227
(Suzuki) Kuuu! That's love! ➡

277
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,029
Until then

278
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,029
Dark circles and rough skin I have to get rid of them.

279
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,524
Everything is solved by vitamins.

280
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:22,732
You can drink it with the original solution now!

281
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:22,732

282
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:24,765

289
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:39,699
Ah, East.

290
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:39,699
(East) Research is in its climax. ➡

291
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,930
Are you staying overnight today?

292
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,765
Yeah. It's really tiring.

293
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:47,392
(Higashi) Are you taking a good rest?

294
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:50,524
Just sleep

295
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:50,524
I'm thinking of securing it.

296
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:53,699
(East) That's tough. ➡

297
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,666
Have you met her?

298
00:13:56,666 --> 00:14:00,326
Ah... I haven't seen them much.

299
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:03,930
(East) That's right

300
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:03,930
I'm so busy. ➡

301
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,557
Ah, sorry

302
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,557
I heard something strange.

303
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:09,996
Ah, no, while we haven't seen you➡

304
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:13,491
I'm thinking about a lot of things.

305
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:13,491
(East) What?

306
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:17,062
Someone with another man

307
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:17,062
What if we meet? ➡

308
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:19,996
How to use your time like this

309
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:19,996
I don't like the ones who do it ➡

310
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:22,963
What if I get rejected?

311
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:22,963
(Higashi) That's not it...

312
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:32,600
but

313
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:32,600
Because I have no choice but to trust her.

314

(East)

315
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:39,128
If you're a senior at Teito, it's definitely fine.

Write the best paper

317

We had a long time when we couldn't meet.

Finally, with Hanakoi

358

00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,524
Please stop

381
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,524
I don't have a face I can show right now.

382
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:15,854
Or... is it cute?

383
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:21,382
What is it? that.

384
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:21,382
Hey, it's unfair.

385
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:24,448
More than me

386
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:24,448
Don't be blunt or cute.

387
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,557
yes?

388
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,557
I mean, it's working.

389
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:30,854
When I first pub

390
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:30,854
It didn't work that much though.

391
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:33,349
Of course, it wasn't like that time...

393
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:40,656
Now is my girlfriend.

00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,788
No way...

395
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,656
Destructive power is amazing!

396
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:59,415
Come on, let's go.

397
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:01,656
What, where?

398
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:05,250
Where are you

399
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:05,250
I'm coming to my room, right?

400
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,283
Vacuunt!

401
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:14,590
Huh?

402
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,052

403
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,052

Hmm~ After all, Imperial capital's meal

409
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:40,250
It's incredibly tasty.

410
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,986
That's good.

411
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,986
When was the paper written?

412
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:46,722
I couldn't cook for myself too much

413
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:46,722
I practiced a little.

414
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:49,316
yeah? That's right.

415
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:53,481
I'm sure Karen will be happy

416
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:53,481
That's what I thought ➡

417
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:55,524

Hehe. Hmm!

421
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:12,250
Ah... such a decent romance

422
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:12,250
I didn't think I could do it.

423
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,118
Decent?

424
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,118
I think it's normal though.

425
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:20,557
I couldn't do normal things.

426
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:22,656
Be prepared to avoid getting hurt ➡

427
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:26,019
Snack only the fun parts.

428
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:29,821
To the point of tormenting the other person

429
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:29,821
I thought it was just right but ➡

430
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:35,821
Meet the Imperial Capital

431
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:35,821
I realized that wasn't the case.

432
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:38,184
Thank you very much.

433
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:41,448
That's the same feeling too.

434
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,184
Meet Karen again

435

If you really like someone...

441
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:16,448
Is it okay to do that?

May I?

453

Do you want to hear it here now?

454
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:08,722
of course. Properly

455
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:08,722
If we don't have a fixed mindset for each other.

Because I don't want to hurt him.

If you don't like it, I'll stop right away.

459
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:21,623
Yes... I don't like it

460
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:21,623
It's decided, isn't it?

461
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:24,283
Hehe, that's good.
