00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,558
actual

381
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,558
He didn't cherish it at all.

382
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:25,129
A cool boyfriend

383
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:25,129
Because it was done ➡

384
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:27,898
I have to hold back that much

385
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:27,898
Be told.

386
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:30,898

(Sho)｟Break up. That

388
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,964
It's a problem if you get serious

389
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:37,525
I myself

390
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:37,525
Not as a person ➡

391
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:40,898
"It's so cute, you can do it right away

392
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:40,898
Just as "Karen-chan" ➡

393
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:44,393
I thought I wasn't seen

394
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:44,393
I realized it.

395
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:46,426
So...

396
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:51,931
For love

397
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:51,931
I don't think you should get serious.

398
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,129
This is the one who holds the lead ➡

399
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,327
Being at a good distance

400
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,327
It's the best ➡

401
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,459
That's what I believed.

403

Imai-san ➡

404
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,162
I wasn't playing ➡

405
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:18,832
Don't get hurt in love anymore

406
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:18,832
You were protecting yourself.

407
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:26,261
Even if that's the case

408
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:26,261
What I've done ➡

409
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:28,294
It's not adorable thing.

410
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:32,492
For me ➡

411
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,063
I don't have the courage or spirit to face people.

412
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:39,195
So ➡

413
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:41,723
From now on

414
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:41,723
I want to live on my own.

415
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:48,327
Please wait.

416
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:56,393
Emperor Capital ➡

417
00:21:56,393 --> 00:22:00,657
Forget about me now.

418
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:05,030
Huh?

419
00:22:08,657 --> 00:22:10,690
Imai-san.

420
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,525
still

421
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,525
I have something I want to tell you.

423
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:21,393
I'd like to leave it alone now!

425
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:44,898
I like it.

429

I'll never again

430
00:23:26,964 --> 00:23:29,964
Karen-san...➡

431
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:32,766
I don't want to let go of my first love.

432
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:44,063
It's love.

433
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:44,063
I like Karen now.

434
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:46,096
Isn't it okay already?

435
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:46,096
Huh?

436
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:49,657
If you really like someone

437
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:49,657
It's okay to do that.

438
00:23:49,657 --> 00:23:53,657
Because I won't hold it anymore.

439
00:23:49,657 --> 00:23:53,657
But it's scary.
