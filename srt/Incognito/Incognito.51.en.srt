Andres still isn't picking up my calls.

67
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,103
Maybe he's just busy or something.

68
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,274
Could you try to reach him for me?

69
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,903
I've been trying
since earlier to call Andres,

70
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,321
but he isn't answering either.

71
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,783
Oh, what's this kid up to?

<i>"Dear, think of yourself too."</i>

82

<i>and be in danger…</i>

88
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:05,073
than let others suffer.

Yes, General.

Mr. Bonifacio?

112
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,831
We're here to investigate
what happened to the victim.

113
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,958
We just have a few questions.

114
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,672
Do you have any idea
who could've done this to your father?

115
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,051
Did he have any enemies,

116
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,221
or perhaps issues from past operations?

117
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,479
Sir, you need to cooperate
if we are to solve this case.

118
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,898
I don't know.

119
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,152
Sir, can't you see his
father's in critical condition?

120
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,197
Can't this wait?

121
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,700
Okay.

00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,619
- We'll go now.

Team, the General will wire me the money,

125
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,010
then I'll send it on to you.

126
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,012
Let's call it a day. Get some rest.

127
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,847
Okay, see you, Contractor.

128
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,224
See you, guys.

129
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,560
Thank you, sir.

130
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,314
Contractor, can I have a word?

131
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,735
Have a seat.

[ominous music playing]

133
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,748
I don’t know where to start,

134
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,251
but I know I should've told
you this a long time ago.

135
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,715
The reason Andres had
the hard drive is because…

136
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,596
JB, Andres, and I broke
into the Escalera's safe house.

137
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,935
But we only did it to
find Andres's brother.

138

[ominous music continues]

139
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,028

[ominous music continues]

141
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,366
But I wanted it…

142
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,286
to come from you.

143
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:24,415
I wanted you to tell me the truth,
but you didn't,

144
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,292
and now we’re here.

145
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:32,506
[ominous music continues]

146
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,801
I could've done so much more
if you hadn't kept it from me.

00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,182
[Greg sighs]

148
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,266
Sorry, sir.

149
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,894
I'll go ahead.

Sir.

156
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,101
[Greg] <i>JB.</i>

157
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,685
We need to talk. Where are you?

158
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,187
Is your emergency over?

159
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,398
<i>Sir, I can't make it right now.</i>

160
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,649
It's urgent.

161
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,152
Sir, my dad's in critical condition.

162
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,071
He was shot.

163
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,701
- How--
- <i>He's on the master list.</i>

164
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,747
[ominous music continues]

165
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,751
General Bonifacio is on the master list?

166
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,796
He used to be a government spy…

167
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,341
assigned to bring down Timor's group.

168
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,513
I believe that, sir.

171
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,783
I called you all back here…

172
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,245
because I wanted to tell you personally.

173
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,208
JB’s father is in critical condition.

174
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,710
- [dramatic music sting]
- He was shot.

175
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,921
- What?
- [Tomas] Who shot him, sir?

176
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,299
What was the motive?

177
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,844
Well, we still don't have all the details.

178
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,183
So much is happening right now.

179
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,768
What about Andres, sir?
Any updates on him?

180
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,569
What? Nothing.

181
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,239
We don’t even know if
Andres is dead or alive.

182
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,452
Tomas, didn't I already explain?

183
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,078
Sir… No, sir, I'm sorry.

184
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,206
I don't understand.
What do you mean, sir?

185
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,166
We're going to leave Andres behind?
Is that it?

186
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,336
But we went back for
Max in Cerdova, didn't we?

187
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,087
Why can't we do the same for Andres?

188
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,507
- Right?
- Tomas…

189
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,927
- Max, no. No.
- Calm down, bro.

190
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,845
Max did not break the protocol,

191
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,389
Andres did, okay?

192
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:32,102
And first of all,
Isabel Escalera isn't our contract.

193
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,521
So what now?

194
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,192
Andres is one of us too, right?
Shouldn't we…

195
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:38,901
Uh…

Okay.

200
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,911
Yeah, you know…

201
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,540
if any of us were in Andres's position,

202
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,416
he'd definitely come back for us.

Aren't you going to go inside?

212
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,834
You should be with your father.

213
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,461
I'll stay here.

214
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,967
He's safe now.

215
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,429
The doctors said he'll survive.

[exhales sharply]

217
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,809
Because you showed up,

218
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,812
you were able to save him.

219
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,777
Well then, I'll call you when he wakes up.

220

Hey, what are you doing?

232
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,944
Tomas, I'm speaking to you.

233
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,529
Talk about bad luck.

234
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,325
Tomas, what are you doing?

235
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,496
- Tell me!
- What's it to you?

236
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,164
What are you--

237
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,167
Are you going against
Contractor's decision?

238
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,669
Where are you going, huh?

239
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,253
Okay. [scoffs]

240
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,797
Do you even know where to find Andres?

241
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,800
- Answer it, Andres.

Uh…

246
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,560
I'm looking for Javier Magpantay.

247
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,728
I'm his friend.

248
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,314
<i>Javier? Oh, so that's his name.</i>

249
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,525
It's a good thing you called, ma'am.

250
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,443
He's here at the hospital.

251
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,447
<i>His phone has a passcode</i>
<i>so I couldn't unlock it.</i>

252
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,241
He didn't have an ID on him either.

253
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,119
Uh, hospital? What happened to him?

254
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,162
He got caught in a shootout.

255
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,540
[dramatic music sting]

256
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,582

[suspenseful music playing]

258
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,462
Kalayaan Medical Center?

259
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,839
Okay, I'm on my way.

Hang on. Didn't I say
I don't want to talk to you?

263
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,891
Why? Because you're
being nosy like me?

264
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,352
- If the situation calls for it.
- What a hypocrite.

265
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,312
- Wow. [scoffs]
- Just listen to Contractor!

266
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,731
What are you thinking?

267
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,650
You want to know where Andres is
and why JB's father got shot?

268
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,444
Hold on, why are you yapping at me?

269
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,403
This is personal, okay?

270
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,322
The contract is over,
now we all go our separate ways.

271
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,323
So just leave.

272
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,451
Oh, alright. Wow!
Aren't you just the best.

273
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,578
Of course, I'm the best.

274
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,662
Okay.

275
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,206
I still can't book a ride.
What's the deal? Tsk.

276
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,751
[Tomas clicks tongue]
Why now, of all times?

277
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,962
[sighs] Forget it. Just get in the car.

278

You're paying, alright?

279
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,923
I'll only pay for gas.

- Where?

He's in surgery right now.
He's in critical condition.
