And we will be working…

366
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,260
incognito.

367
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:57,347
["LIWANAG SA DILIM"
INSTRUMENTAL CONTINUES]

368
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,822
["LIWANAG SA DILIM"
INSTRUMENTAL CONTINUES]

369
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,795
She's the victim. Takako Rai.

370
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,464
Our mission is to abduct
someone of equal value.

371
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,133
And that's Donato Escalera.

372
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,718
Only son of Timor Escalera.

373
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,177
But it's not that easy.

374
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,180
Because he and his cousins
are influential in Delgado.

375
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,348
Let's go!

376
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,559
Every hour and minute is important.

377
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,727
How long do we have?

378
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,061
Twenty-four hours.

379
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,855
It's a death trap.

380
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,023
Maybe you have some tips, idol.

381
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,525
No civilians should be harmed.

382
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,985
Hey, who are you?

383
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,113
It's impossible
to get out alive from Azur Island.
