That's right!

21
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,014
[Max] Only take what we can carry, okay?

22
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,058
[Tomas] I got this! Relax!

23
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,394
Tomas, it's a long walk.
Are you sure you can carry that?

24
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,938
Of course, I can! [chuckles]

25
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,190
No worries, we'll figure it out.

Alright.

00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,163
We're taking the same route,
we'll meet you there.

32

- Are you sure?
- [Andres] Yeah.

33
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,874
We can wait for you.

00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,167
[Tomas groans] Why?

35
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,585
You need my help, just admit it.

[chuckles]

37
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,880
You really think I need help?

38
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,882
Yeah. I mean, your bag is bigger than you.

39
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,509
Just look at it.

40
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,010
You're so annoying.

41
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,387
[Gab] Let's go, Eagle.

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,722
See you at the exit point,

[Andres] I see it!

49
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,320
A little piece of advice…

50
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,614
You joke about everything.

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,243
How do you expect women
to take you seriously,

52
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,995
if you're never serious?

53
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,581
W-what? Why are we talking
about women now?

54
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,625
This--this is what's important
right now, okay?

55
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,669
And besides, I'm not attracted to her.

56
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,753

00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,979
All good.

00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,148
Quiet.

The rain's stopped.

63
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,278
What about the shipment?

[Benjie] <i>We're unloading more.</i>

Let's go.

[ominous music continues]

72
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,140
[Gab] Ugh, Tomas is so annoying.

73
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,518
You know, "Monkey" suits him
because he literally looks like an ape.

[Max giggles]

75
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,731
Why do you always seem
so worked up over Tomas?

76
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,024
I mean, just look… [scoffs]

77
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,568
just looking at his face is irritating.

78
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,238
He's like a living nightmare.

- My god!

81
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,659
The things he says, right?

82
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,078
He's so loud! Such a show-off.

83
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,498
Okay. [chuckles] Sure.

84
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,833
What's that?

85
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,128
Nothing.

86
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,130
What do you mean "nothing"?

87
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,133
You guys seem to really repel each other.

88
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,178
If I didn't know you…

89
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,180
I'd think you actually liked each other.

90
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,265
Yuck!

91
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,766
Yuck, Max!

92
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,934
- Ew!
- Overacting!

93
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,769
Gross.

94
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,856
But that's how it is sometimes, right?

95
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,818
At first, you think
you don't like someone…

96
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,778
then you realize you actually do--

97
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,947
Max, you really don't know me yet.

98
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,074
Guys like that? Not my type!

99
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,451
And they never will be, ever.

100
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,245
He's the worst.

101
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,038
Okay.

102
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,124
If you say so.

103
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,417
I really do.

Alright, your turn.

113
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,899
- Give me your bag.
- Okay.

114
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,026
Alright.

- Aah!

Yes.

- Nice.
- Shoot.

The path collapsed.

123

- We got this.
- You sure?

124

- Of course.
- Be careful.

125
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,474

127
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854
What?

128
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,981
I mean, I can do it by myself,

129
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,525
but it'd be a waste
to leave the money behind.

130

That way.

136
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,333

- There has to be.

Uh, we're good to go.

Alright, you guys go ahead.

- Yes, sir.
- That's enough. Come on!

It's so heavy!

185

[JB] Hurry up, Tomas!

186
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,452
- Come on!
- [Tomas grunts]

187
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,871
Give me a second, sir. It's really heavy.

188
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,082
But I've got this. [grunts]

189

192
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,507
Enemies! They're here!

- Hey!

- [ominous music playing]
- I told you to fix your stance!

196
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,350
Sir, enemies attacked…

197
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,144
They attacked Sir Sameo's house!

198
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:26,315
[breathing rapidly] Sir.

199
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,650

We're under attack.

202
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,156
Move, goddammit!

203
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,326
- Sir…
- Come on!

204
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,454

- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yup!

212
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,941
Shark, meet you at the exit point.

213
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,776
We'll get there first!

215
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,948

Hi!

219
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,751
We're your friends.

220
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,503
It's okay.

- [horse snorts]
- He's a good horse!

222

It's okay, it's okay.

223
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,926
It's okay.

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,011
[horse snorts]

225
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,682
- Okay. Hey, you.
- [horse snorts softly]

226
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,522
- We hit the jackpot!
- Yes!

227
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,817
- [Gab] Okay, calm down.
- [Max] It's okay. It's okay.

228
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,069
[Max] It's okay.

[Max sighs loudly]

230
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:01,160
Boss, what if Emer is just high?

[suspenseful music playing]

232
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:13,923

[Tomas grunts]

240
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,340
Don't worry about me, sir.

241
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,343
I'm fine.

242
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,430
Just a bit sore, but I'm fine.

[JB grunts]

249
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,725
All units…

- [pants] Listen up.
- [suspenseful music crescendos]

251

[JB] <i>We can't take the same track back.</i>

<i>Stick to the GPS.</i>

253
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,237
Copy that.

254
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,492
[JB] <i>I repeat, stick to the GPS.</i>

255
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,620
Especially since the loot
is slowing us down.

256
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,249
That's what they think.

257
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,753
It's slowing you down, but not us!

258
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,425
If we lose comms,

259
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,138
everyone proceed to the exit point.

Eagle, Sparrow, do you copy?

265
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,077
- Copy.
- Copy that.

- [Gab giggles]
- [hooves clattering]

267
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,543
I can't wait to see Tomas'
face when he sees this.

268
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,127
[laughs]

269
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,837
We outsmarted him.

270
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,090
They underestimate how smart we are.

271
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,301
They didn't see this coming.

272
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,223
Right, Horsey?

273
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,766
[both chuckle]

274
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,352
- You're right.
- Yeah.

276
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,529
Let's move, Tomas.

279
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,583
[Gab] Come here.
Come here. [clicking tongue]

280
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,460
There you go.
He came to me right away.

281
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,006
The horse we got is so obedient.

282
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,549
So cute!

283
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,594
You know, I'll take you to my
and my mommy's rest house.

284
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,304
- The one I will buy.
- [Max] Wow.

285
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,598
- [Max] You'll buy a rest house?
- Yes. [laughs]

286
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,477
[Gab] Actually,
the money we got isn't enough.

287
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,813
But it's enough for the down payment.

288
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,444
Are you still bothered because
we took the money?

289
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,948
I'm just wondering
if you'd like to take my share, too.

290
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,491
Huh? Your share?

291
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,535
That's yours! I mean, with this money.

292
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,621
- Our lives will change with this money.

00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,248
That's true.

[hooves clopping]

296
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,338
What will we do first when we get home?
Hm? What will we do?

297
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,341
When we get home, do you want to…

298
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,926
Do you want to…

299
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,427
share the horse with me?

300
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,930
Borrow him. Who knows?
He might make your dad happy

301
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,514
when you get home.

302
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,849
- Right?
- [horse pants heavily]

303

304
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,602
[Max] Aah.

305
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,104
I don't know if he'll be happy.

306
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,189
[Gab scoffs] Why?

307
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,609
Because I don't know him.

308
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,653
Oh, shit.

309
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,405
I actually don't know who
my biological parents are.

310
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,077
I was still a baby when Mama
and Mommy adopted me.

311
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,706
Soldiers saved me during
a military operation.

312
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,250
Shit.

313
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,337
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

314
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,256
So you've been through a lot too, huh?

315
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,134
We all have.

316
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,681
Damn, you have two moms?

317
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,225
- Yeah. [laughs]
- That's cool!

318
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,143
- They're the best.
- So do it for them instead.

319
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,770
I'm sure they'll like Champ.

320
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,438
- Right, Champ?
- Wow, Champ.

321
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,399
- Yeah. I already named him.
- [laughs]

322
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,943
Right? Champ suits him. Am I right?

323
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,487
[laugh] That's cool. Champ.

324
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,449
- [Max] I like that.
- [Gab] Champ.

[hurried footsteps]

327
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,092
They killed him.

The house was attacked.
Sir Patel is dead.

[suspenseful music continues]

336

We were screwed over, Raul.

Damn it! We were ransacked, boss.

[radio beeps]

345
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,442

00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,207
Surround all the mountains exit points.
