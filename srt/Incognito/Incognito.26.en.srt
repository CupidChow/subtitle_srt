<i>I'll kill him!</i>

365
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,317
<i>Stay away from my family!</i>

366
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,902
<i>You have no right</i>
<i>to see my family.</i>

367
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,404
<i>Max, status.</i>

368
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,531
<i>Andres is in the</i>
<i>hard drive room.</i>

369
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,116
<i>Esang didn't want you to know,</i>

370
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,910
<i>but I think you need</i>
<i>to know.</i>

371
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,828
<i>Emil and his group</i>
<i>keep bothering her.</i>

372
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,704
<i>You're too arrogant.</i>

373
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,623
<i>You murdered my cousin,</i>
<i>you have no remorse.</i>

374
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,999
<i>I already paid for my sin!</i>

375
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,209
<i>That's not enough!</i>

376
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,710
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>Let's end this.</i>

377
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,295
<i>Tomorrow afternoon, 6pm.</i>
