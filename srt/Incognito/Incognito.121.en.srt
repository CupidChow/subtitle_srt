Exact location?

231
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,214
300 meters away from the exit point!

[sniffs] I'm good, Noah.

240
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,866
Still fighting.

Shark, Jaguar,

245
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,214
<i>proceed here now.</i>

246
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,677
Be careful.
They might be waiting at the end.

247
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,430
Copy.

248
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,016
Today, that bastard will die.

249
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:41,106
[suspenseful music continues]

250
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,117
Wolf, how are the kids?

251
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,579
[Andres] Sir, we've secured one.

252
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,581
I'm taking him to the exit point.

253
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,084
[Pio] I'm still alive?

254
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,170
You're still alive, and you're going home.

255
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,254
I promise.

256
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,007
Thank you so much, sir.

257
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,719
We'll go out now, okay?

258
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,262
Hold on to me.

259
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,347
Okay.

260
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,848
- You ready?
- Yes.

[suspenseful music continues]

262
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,448
It's the two of us
versus a whole battalion.

[breathing heavily]

266
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,836
They're not firing at us.

267
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,713
They must be conserving their ammo.

268
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,173
No, they're waiting for us to fire first

269
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,717
so they can pinpoint our location

270
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,884
and how many of us there are.

271
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,263
They're so lame.

272
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,348
Monkey.

273
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,309

[tense music continues]

276
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,482
Just in case…

277
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,444
What do you mean, just in case?
I know what you're going to say.

278
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,320
Just in case, my dad…

281
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,627
Visit him.

282
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,466
Just in case, look after my uncle.

Sorry…

293
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,958
I'm sorry for everything.

294
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,544
For lying to you.

[ominous music playing]

296
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,924
Don't worry about it.

297
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,594
I understand why you had to do it.

298
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,931
Monkey.

299
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,142
I won't die holding a grudge against you.
