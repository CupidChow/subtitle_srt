Sir Sameo was so good to you,

You blinded us with your money!

It was your job
to keep an eye on Champ.

134

I did secure it.

135
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,368

because you brought up

We're going to find him and get the money.

You know what?
It's over. We've lost our comms.

163

We won't be able
to contact them anymore.

164
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,424
What about the money, Max?

165
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,468
Are we just going to let it go?

166
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,638
I need the money, Max. Please!

I'm sure he's just around here.

Didn't I tell you to go home?

Why are you still here?

172
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,826
I'm not going home.

He works for Sameo.

175
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,212
And you?

176
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,880
Who are you guys?

177
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,801
Are you police? Soldiers?

178
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,853
Whoever you guys are,

179
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,314
I'm guessing you're enemies of Sameo.

180
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,776
You should get out of here.

181
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,695
Come on.

182
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,196

He's my brother.

186
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,589
If I'm right, that you're after Sameo,

187
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,800
did you go up to their hideout?

188
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,346
Did you see my brother?

189
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,682
Did you see him? Is he still alive?

190
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,933
[sobs]

191
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,604
Your brother's still too young.

192
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,897
He is.

193
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,567
[crying]

194
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,902
They poisoned his mind.

195
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,534
No.

196
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,078
We haven't encountered any kids.

197
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,041
So, for your own safety,
I suggest you go home.

198
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,917
Just go, okay?

199
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,342
It'd be dangerous if you kept going.

200
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,853
[Tomas]
I'm giving the money to my uncle, sir.

201
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,147
Those bastards won't take
this money from me.

202
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,317
[grunting]

203
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,321
[Tomas] You okay, sir?

204
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,825
[JB exhales heavily]

208
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,130
Drop your guns!

[foreboding music playing]

210
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,259
Drop them!

211
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,930
[Tomas chuckles]

212
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,891
Do we believe him, sir?

213
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,684
Drop them, or I'll blow your heads off!

214
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,228
Whoa, calm down!

215
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,604
Drop those bags, too!

216
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,022
Why, do you own these bags?

217
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,065
Just drop them!

218
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,400
- Whoa!
- I'll shoot you!

219
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,527
Calm down, kid.
Do you even know how to use that?

220
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,445
- You might hurt yourself.
- Drop them now!

221
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,198
Now, chill out, kid! I'll drop them.

222
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,658
Don't push me, or I'll kill you!

223
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,451
[Tomas]
Where do you live? How old are you?

224
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,078
- Mind your own business!
- Whoa.

225
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,498
What happened back at Sameo's hideout?

226
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,585
You two are here, which means…

227
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,295
you fought him and his men.

228
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,713
Did you kill him?

229
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,924
[breath shaking]

230
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,511
I'll assume you did.

231
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,221
In that case, you have my thanks.

232
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,932
This world is rid of one more villain.

233
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,726
[somber music playing]

234
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,979
And if you can't help me,

235
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,523
I understand.

236
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,361

[sighs]

240
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,248
Andres, let her be.

241
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,041
[somber music continues]

242
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,252
You know exactly what it's like
to lose a brother.

243
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,336
Right?

244
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,673
[exhales]

245
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,384
I hope she finds her brother.

246
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:47,391
[somber music continues]

247
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,560
I'm going to kill you!

248
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,769
Drop those bags!

249
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,730
Calm down!
Do you even know how to fire that?

250
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,648
- Just do it!
- Don't shoot yourself.

251
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,610
Dude, just relax!
I'm going to drop them down.

252
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,069
- This kid…
- Do it now!

253
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,613
I'm going to kill you!

254
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,906
You think I'm afraid of you?

255
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,699
Alright, I'll drop everything I have.

256
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,284
- Tomas…
- I'll shoot you!

257
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,369
Just do as he says.

258
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,829
- Look.
- Get this over with.

259
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,457
One wrong move, and you're dead!

260
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,458
Look at me-- Whoa!

261
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,417

264
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,297
- Help!
- [Tomas] Quiet!

265
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,466
- [JB] Tomas--
- Argh!

266
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,134
- You stupid kid!
- They're here--

267
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,302
Stop being so stubborn!

268
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,887
- You're making this difficult!
- [muffled] Ouch!

269
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,347
- Hold him down, Tomas!
- [blows landing]

270
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,389
- You--
- Let me--

271
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,225
- Restrain him!
- I don't have the rope.

272
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,976
[JB] Stop hitting his head,
and restrain him.

273
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,604
You punk! How dare you point a gun at us?!

274
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,814
- Think you're brave, huh?!
- Tomas, just tie him up!

275
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,650
Think--Think we're scared of you?!

276
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,276

- Go, I'll handle him.

[Emer muffled] Help!

278
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,946
- Just go!
- Let me go!

279
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,364
- Stop--
- I said, let--

- [blow lands]
- [groans]

281
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,242
Tomas, I'll take it from here. Now, go!

282
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,618
- Patrol the area.
- [coughing]

283
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,453
- See if his group is there.
- You--

- Stop talking.

[breathing heavily]

292
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,891
Just do what we tell you,
and you won't get hurt.

00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,726
- Understand?
- Let go of--

Help!

[Emer breathing heavily]

297
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,239
[Max] Look.

298
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,075
We'll find the exit point down this way.

299
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,369
- Let's go.
- No, Max.

300
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,872
Let's find those bags.

301
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,709
Gab, we won't find them again.
Just let it go.

302
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,336
No, Max. We need to find them, come on.

[foreboding music playing]

304

[sighs] We heard gunshots, remember?

305
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,386
I'm sure they're following our trail.

306
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,929
Well, where are they?

307
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,681
Because I don't see anyone.

308
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,810
Max, if you don't need the money, I do.

309
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,022
It's easy for you to leave it
because you don't need it.

310
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,276
Gab, look. Our comms are down.

311
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,111
We lost contact with the group.

312
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,655
If we don't get moving,
we'll be left behind.

313

[foreboding music continues]

314
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,994
Well Max, I'm going to find those bags.

315
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,621
[Max] Gab!

[JB exhales heavily]

317
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,505
[Tomas] Shark, the area's clear.

318
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,674
I looked everywhere, and I found no one.

319
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,385
Good.

325
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,355
We split up to find your group.

326
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,523
When the others find you,
they'll kill you.

327
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,275
Want me to break your face?

328
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,610
Want me to kill you?

How old are you, kid?

334
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,542
Seventeen?

335
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,878
Eighteen?

00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:13,263
[somber music playing]

337
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,015
[exhales deeply] Sixteen.

338
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,772
You can still do
many things with your life.

339
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,775
Stay away from your group.

340
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,363
Why? Who do you think you are, huh?

341
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,910
What do you want me to do?

342
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,706
And for what?

343
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,874
To make things worse?

344
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,252
For those rich bastards
to keep stepping on me?

345
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,880
If I'm with my group, I can earn money.

346
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,632
I can achieve something.

347
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,467
And I'll be able to fight.

00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,512
[somber music continues]

349
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,556
I know that you need money.

350
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,561
We also need money. We're all the same.

351
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,605
But you're still young.

352
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,525
Leave that group.

353
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,944
Before it kills you.

Shall we go, sir?

You're leaving me?

Do you think you can get out
of this place alive?

363
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,685
[Emer] We will kill you. Especially you.

- I'll blow your brains out!

365
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,276
Bye, bye.

366
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,447
Bye. [laughing]

367
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,700
[labored breathing]

368
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,372
[dramatic music continues]

369
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,708
The path down the back
is slippery because of the rain.

370
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,337
The only way they can get out
is through Sitio Magdalo.

371
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,798
[dramatic music crescendos]

372
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:15,177
[woman] They will give us 5,000 pesos
if we finish this.

373
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,264
Maybe Sameo is really
running in this election.

374
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,226
I hope he wins
so we can get more financial aid.

375
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,645
He'll just steal money
and you want him to win?

376
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,689
Well, we'll have money
if he wins so why not?

377
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,483
You know what?

378
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,819
Your mind has been consumed by money.

379
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,989
Do you not care about the lives
of the people who got ruined by drugs?

380
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,201
Amado, your son decided
to ruin his life with drugs.

381
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,494
Why are you blaming Sameo?

382
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,412
What did you say, you bastard?

383
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,956
- Huh?!
- [grunts]

384
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,251
People like Sameo only exist
because of bastards like you!

385
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,419
Say it again. Say it again!

386
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,630
Amado. Pokyo.

387
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,257
Stop it.

388
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,592
We shouldn't be fighting.

389
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,844
- He started it.
- Oh.

390
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:57,886
Benjie's here.

391
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,305
Please, let's just keep our mouths shut.

392
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,226
Good day.

393
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,772
We need your help.

394
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,109
Uh, sir, anything for you.

395
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:19,199
[dramatic music playing]

396
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,916
Andres.

397
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,420
When we reach the community,

398
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,840
we can't let them see these bags.

399
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,012
But we can't leave them
no matter what happens.

400
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,264
Because this…

401
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,183
is for my son.

402
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,312
And yours is for your grandmother, right?

403
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,149
So we need to be careful.

404
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,279
Outsiders?

405
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,656
No one's passed here, Benjie.

406
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,747
[dramatic music continues]

407
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,299
We'll stay here for now.

408
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,884
We need to wait for something.

409
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:25,974
[dramatic music continues]

410
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,149
[dramatic music crescendos]

411
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,447
<i>All of us make our own decisions in life.</i>

412
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,407
<i>It's up to you whether it's</i>
<i>right or wrong.</i>

413
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,784
<i>It depends on your principles.</i>

414
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,577
<i>I hope she finds her brother.</i>

415
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,080
<i>You know, Andres,</i>
<i>you can't save everybody.</i>

416
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,540
<i>You're blaming yourself for</i>
<i>what happened to your brother.</i>

417
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,792
<i>I wonder where they are now.</i>

418
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,335
<i>We're near the exit point.</i>

419
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,920
<i>Let's just rest here, Tomas.</i>

420
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,088
<i>Tell your men</i>

421
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,673
<i>to block all the exits</i>
<i>around the mountain.</i>

422
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,508
<i>We'll go there. Let's meet.</i>

423
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,680
[yelps]

424
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,014
<i>- Gab!</i>
- [screams]
