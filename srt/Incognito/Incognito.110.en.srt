00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,210
<i>Is Andres home?</i>

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:03,253
<i>I'm his colleague.</i>

3
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,212
<i>He's not here.</i>

4
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:07,632
<i>I don't want him to have</i>
<i>connections with you anymore.</i>

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,175
<i>What disease do you have?</i>

6
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,344
<i>It doesn't concern you, Max.</i>

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,722
<i>Why can't you just tell me the truth?</i>

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,099
<i>Just leave me alone for now, Max.</i>

9
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,230
[door slams]

10
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,274
<i>Here's a copy of the document.</i>

11
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,360
<i>I bribed someone</i>
<i>inside to get your dad out.</i>

12
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,239
<i>All I want for you</i>

13
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,241
<i>is for you to be happy.</i>

14
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,582
<i>This is just a small part of the land.</i>

15
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,751
<i>But it's enough for us to start over</i>

16
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,294
<i>along with the other tribe members.</i>

17
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,880
<i>I've been waiting</i>
<i>a long time for this day to come.</i>

18
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,673
[chuckling]

19
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:55,930
[theme music playing]

20
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,764
[Andres grunts]

21
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,516
- Let me.
- Okay.

22
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,725
[Andres] Get the other bag.

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,519
[grunts]

24
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,812
Here.

25
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,397
Go get in the car.

26
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,325
Andres.

27
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,662
We're leaving this house now.

28
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,291
I hope you also leave all your anger here.

29
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,337
Or throw it in
the cliff along the highway.

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,382
[melancholy music playing]

31
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,050
You're doing the right thing, dear.

32
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,848
And I hope when we get back to our land,

33
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,936
you'll be back to the old Andres we know.

34
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,814
The one who's full of hope

35
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,817
and never gives up

36
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,403
no matter what challenges he faces.

37
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:39,868
[melancholy music continues]

38
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,411
I'll try, Grandma.

39
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,210
On our land,

40
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,714
we'll have a peaceful life.

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,480
There's only one document
left that needs to be signed, Dad.

42
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,941
You'll get out of here soon.

43
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,070
I really don't know how to thank you, son.

44
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,992
You're innocent, Dad.

45
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,330
You should've gotten out a long time ago.

46
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,626
How are you, JB?

47
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,715
Uh… [breathes deeply]

48
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,383
I just fought some battles, Dad.

49
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,387
[somber music playing]

50
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,931
How did the fight go?

51
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,770
Some decisions…

52
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,940
had to be made.

53
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,237
Even if you don't want it to,

54
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,783
your decision might hurt some people.

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,372
All my life, I've learned to stand

56
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,124
by my decisions.

57
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,962
There are no right or wrong decisions.

58
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,631
JB,

59
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,510
you cannot fix everything by choosing.

60
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,929
All we can do

61
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:29,560
is to choose
which pain we're willing to endure.

62
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:36,150
[somber music continues, fades]

63
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:40,154
[traffic noise]

64
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,824
[Tomas sighs sharply]

65
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,204
- [man] Good morning, sir.
- I'm with Sir Philip.

66
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,206
- Yes. This way.
- Okay.

67
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,130
Hey, Tomas. Have a seat.

68
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,506
Good morning, sir.

69
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,636
What's the occasion
this early in the morning?

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,097
Eat up. I ordered for you.

71
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,518
Is there a reason why
you made me come here?

72
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,273
Nothing. I just wanted
to have breakfast with you.

73
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,899
[Tomas] No way.

74
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,280
Just kidding, sir.

75
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,282
Let's eat.

76
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,244
Um… [clears throat] Okay.

77
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,914
- [utensils clanking]
- [diners chatting indistinctly]

78
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,209
- [cup clinks]
- [slurps]

79
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,964
Hmm…

80
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,263
Is there anything
you want to ask or talk about?

81
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,725
- No.
- Are you sure?

82
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,313
- I said no.
- You don't want to talk?

83
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,065
We're just really going to eat here?

84
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,484
Yeah, we'll just eat.

85
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,070
That's a shame.

86
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,405
I wanted to tell you something.

87
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,366
What is it?

88
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,243
[light-hearted music playing]

89
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,953
It's about Gab, sir.

90
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,207
She's doing okay,

91
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,752
but sometimes she gets sad.

92
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,796
Because she misses someone.

93
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,048
Who is it?

94
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,382
[utensils clink]

95
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,509
Here, sir.

96
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,593
[clears throat]

97
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,389
[light-hearted music continues]

98
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,891
[Tomas laughs]

99
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,435
You're happy, aren't you? [gushes, laughs]

100
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,521
You're playing with me, aren't you?

101
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,981
No, it's true.

102
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,276
She misses you sometimes.

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,030
- [phone ringing]
- Oh. Speak of the angel.

104
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,365
[ringing continues]

105
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,742
- [whispers] Don't tell her we're together.
- Of course.

106
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,870
Hello? Miss me already?

107
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,289
You're being crazy again.

108
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,750
What's with you? Where are you?

109
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,544
I'm here--

110
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,380
I'm at home.

111
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,882
I'll go there.

112
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:05,842
No!

113
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,301
Don't come. Please.

114
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,720
I-It's messy right now.

115
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,724
Why are you so dramatic?

116
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,061
Fine, let's just meet up.
I need to tell you something.

117
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,188
Okay, okay.

118
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,315
Alright, take care.

119
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,859
Bye.

120
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,278
[phone beeps]

121
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,990
[Tomas chuckles]

122
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,241
What else did she say?

123
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,078
Sometimes,
she mentions your name while sleeping.

124
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,538
- Really?
- Yeah.

125
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,623
- For real?
- I don't know.

126
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,918
I mean, we don't
sleep beside each other, sir.

127
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,715
Keep going. Tell me more.

128
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:53,264
- [engine humming]
- [door bell dings]

129
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:13,534
[unsettling music playing]

130
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:37,433
[unsettling music continues]

131
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,938
You're really going
to give me my share now?

132
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,064
Yeah.

133
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,484
Like I said,
I already got my inheritance from Dad.

134
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,736
- So, I'll give it now.
- Hmm…

135
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:53,074
But wait, our deal's not over
yet since we're still married.

136
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,620
That's why I'll have
our annulment processed.

137
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,832
[sniffles]

138
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,627
Is that what you really want?

139
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,672
To annul our wedding? Yes.

140
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,595
Wait. [chuckles]

141
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,598
[giggles]

142
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,100
You want to stay married?

143
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,352
- W-Wait--
- [Gab] What?

144
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,812
- Hey--
- I mean--

145
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,397
Wait. Let me finish first.

146
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:29,235
I mean, do you really want to…

147
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,574
cut off your dad from your life?

148
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,077
[Gab scoffs]

149
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,161
[Tomas] Because…

150
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,959
you said once you'd get your inheritance,

151
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,711
it'd be the last time
you'd see each other?

152
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,297
[sighs] Whatever.

153
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,759
I'll call my lawyer right
away to settle everything.

154
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,473
[pensive music playing]

155
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,892
Besides, I don't want
to keep you tied to me.

156
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,605
I may be like this,
but I know I've troubled you a lot.

157
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,898
[mumbling] She's just like her father.

158
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,318
- Huh?
- [Tomas] Nothing.

159
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,612
So, when's your lawyer available?

160
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,614
[Gab] Okay.

161
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,576
[pensive music continues]

162
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,911
There. I sent it to you.

163
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,829
[phone chimes]

164
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,249
[Mickey] <i>Papa, I have a new school!</i>

165
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,127
<i>It's near the house. And I walk alone.</i>

166
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,795
[Miguel] Wow!

167
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,257
My baby boy is amazing! [chuckles]

168
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,928
Are you sure you'll be okay walking alone?

169
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,930
<i>Of course, Papa.</i>

170
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,601
<i>Have you forgotten? I'm a big boy now!</i>

171
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,896
[laughs] Right.

172
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,983
Your Papa has become forgetful.

173
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,028
Mickey, my boy…

174
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,157
Could you pass the phone to your mom?

175
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,241
Uh…

176
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,203
I just want to talk to her.

177
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,079
<i>Okay.</i>

178
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,289
<i>Bye, Papa!</i>

179
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>Call again tomorrow, okay?</i>

180
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,169
Yeah, sure. Bye!

181
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,046
I miss you.

182
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,298

Uh…

188

[clicks tongue] It's been ninety days…

189
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,195
and I've been,

190
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,738
sober.

191
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,033
Really sober this time.

192
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,661

193

It's confirmed.

213
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,688
He's connected to El Cano.

How'd they know?

216
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,779
They were recruiting
children to work at a mine…

217
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,033
and then they would eventually go missing.

218
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,118
Do they bring them abroad?

He reminded me,
I need to finish his mission.

226

As long as El Cano exists…

227
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,366
there'll be more victims.

228
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,744

We'll continue this mission,
with or without a contract.

233
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,186
I've arranged
everything to secure the mine.

234

I followed your orders.

235
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,527
We're preparing
everything for you to get that seat.

Once you become the president,

237

253

It seems he's really cutting ties with us.

254

I wish he'd give me
a chance to talk to him.
