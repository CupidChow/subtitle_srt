<i>Me too.</i>

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,005
<i>I apologize.</i>

4
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,673
<i>Just don't let it happen again.</i>

5
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,133
<i>It won't happen again, Miguel.</i>

6
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,551
<i>That was my last contract.</i>

7
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,469
<i>I'm leaving the group.</i>

8
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,012
<i>We'll still see each other.</i>

00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,433

10
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- We'll be more relaxed.</i>

<i>JB, do you know the details</i>

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,109
<i>No.</i>

13
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,570
<i>Let's wait for the Contractor.</i>
<i>He'll tell us all about it.</i>

14
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,448
<i>I miss Andres.</i>

15
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,451
<i>I sent them to a shipping vessel.</i>

16
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,286
<i>Marina Pacifica.</i>

17
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,789
<i>It's nice to imagine a life</i>

18

[theme music playing]

22
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,183
[Greg] Andres.

23
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,436
Sir?

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,813
What brings you here?

25
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,358
There's a new contract.

26
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,275
I want you in.

27
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,112
[dramatic music sting]

28
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,283
Sir, I left the group
because of what I did.

29
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,661
I haven't agreed to your leaving.

30
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,082
Sir.

31
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,044
But I already told you.

32
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,923
[Greg] Let's go.

33
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,758
We'll talk as I drive.

34
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,434
[engine revving]

35
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,396
This is Mt. Talimba,

36
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,815
it's a very steep mountain.

37
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,861
That's where Sameo Patel's
hideout is located.

38
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,404
He's a drug lord.

39
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,032
Supplier of drugs in Asia.

40
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,492
Patel?

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,828
A foreigner?

42
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,707
His father is a foreigner,
his mother is Filipino.

43
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,167
He said he grew up in the Philippines.

44
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,171
But I think he only came here

45
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,716
to smuggle drugs.

46
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,510
Mayor, aside from drugs,

47
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,388
is he involved in other illegal
activities in your area?

48
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,975
There's a chance they're also
involved in human trafficking

49
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,645
and exploitation of local workers.

50
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:15,111
You mean there are people
living on that mountain?

51
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:21,868
He brought them in to use and sell drugs,

52
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,496
which caused an increase in crime rates.

53
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,084
Do you think he has
connections with other groups

54
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,794
in and out of the country?

55
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,089
I'm sure he has.

56
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,218
But I don't know which group.

57
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,056
Is there a way for us to identify them?

58
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,436
Like tattoos or any form
of identification?

59
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,397
He uses his wealth
to manipulate everyone.

60
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,818
He makes donations left and
right here in our province.

61
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,117
In fact, most people see him
as a philanthropist.

62
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,122
Aren't your people
capable of dealing with him?

63
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,916
Or even the local police?

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,962
Our forces are no match against him.

65
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,925
We don't have enough arms
and manpower to take them on.

66
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,844
We've tried many times,

67
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,223
but each attempt had the same outcome.

68
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,518
Bodies of our men found lifeless
at the foot of the mountain.

69

[foreboding music playing]

70
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,317
[man] Sir Benjie.

71
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:40,363
I'm sure Sir Sameo's win
in the upcoming election

72
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,865
will further widen the scale
of our operations.

73
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,829
We must give out more money
to influence voters

74
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,664
especially in the neighboring towns.

75
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:54,168
Sir Sameo will soon file
his candidacy for governor.

76
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,255
[foreboding music intensifies]

77
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,464

That's why I need you and your team.

I need your help.

- [Gab] Contractor's here!

[Tomas] Contractor!

88
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,724
- [Greg] Team.
- [Miguel] Sir.

89
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,684
[Tomas] Oh!

90
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,811
You're back!

91
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,521
- Andres!

92
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,814
My boy!

93
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,567
Is that really you?!

94
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,194
Oh my god!

95
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,614
It's like I'm looking in the mirror!

96
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,240
[Tomas, Andres chuckle]

97
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,576
Thank you, sir.
I didn't know you had a heart.

98
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,786
Come here.

[Tomas] The band's back together!

00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,631
We're complete! Let's go!

104
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,389
- I got you something, dude.
- All that?

105
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,393
Of course! We have here
<i>pan de coco </i>and <i>pan de regla.</i>

106
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:39,357
We also have different flavors of <i>hopia,</i>
<i>mongo, baboy </i>and<i> ube</i>

special <i>ensaymada,</i>

and your favorite, strawberry cake.

You think it's my favorite?

110
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,367
- It's not?
- No.

111
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,744
Damn, who said that was your favorite?

112
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,288
- I'll take the coffee.
- Okay. Sorry, dude.

113
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,124
I got it wrong.

114
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,793
Honestly, dude?

I'm so happy you're back.

I feel whole again.

117
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,049
And…

118
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,385
What made you come back anyway?

119
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:12,056
Wait. Maybe I should ask,
why did you come back?

120
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,269
Wow. [chuckles]

121
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,021
I see.
You're a man of few words, aren't you?

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,154
But seriously. Come on, dude!
Stop acting so nonchalant.

00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,823
I know you're just acting strong.

125
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:33,494
But deep, deep down inside you,
I know you missed me.

[chuckling]

127
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,999
You missed us, didn't you?

[makes radio static sound]

135

[imitating Greg] You're on your own.

136
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,897
And then he'll arrive
once the enemies are down.

137
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,273
[both chuckle]

138
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,650
He only shows up
when the mission is over, right?

139
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,863
How about Miguelito's confusing commands.

140
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,073
- Hey.
- I'm not shaming him for it.

141
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,284
Sometimes it's funny.

142
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,036
[imitating Miguel] Stand! Down! Soldiers!

143
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,372
Does he want me to stand up or stay down?

144
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,500
Didn't you miss those?

145
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,669
How about Max's octopus bangs?

146
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,004
[chuckles]

147
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,423
[imitating Max]
Enemy on your left. Enemy on your right.

148
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,010
- It sure is distracting.
- [chuckling softly]

149
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,305
How about Gab's curls?
Didn't you miss them?

150
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:38,559
And how about my style?
I've got one heck of a mullet.

151
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,186
What? "Mullet"?

152
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,771
- Yeah.
- What's that?

153
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,856
A mullet that's curly.

[both laugh]

155
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,569
But you know what?

156
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:53,991
If I were to leave, I'll miss you dearly.

157
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,411
Because you're like my second family.

158
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,914
I mean, can you imagine?

159
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:04,293
I gained two sisters,
three brothers, and…

160
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,338
And an uncle.

161
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,882
[both laugh]

162
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,509
What if they hear you?

163
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,844
I don't care. I can say it out loud.

164
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,180
[laughs]

165
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,266
But I'm really excited.

166
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,309
And, come to think of it,

167
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,021
in your search to find your brother,

168
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,482
you found six cool siblings.

169
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,151
You found six incredible siblings.

170
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,904
Sorry, I meant five siblings
and one uncle.

00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,410
Eat up.

174
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,288
Go ahead. You can take this.

175
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,041
- Looks like you want it.
- Actually, it's my favorite.

176
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,919
- I knew it.
- [both laughing]

177
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,129
It's my favorite.

178
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,173
You can have it.

179
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,426
Mm!

180
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,677
It's good!

181
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,723
The uncle is busy.

182
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,892
He's managing his kids.

183
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,812
[both chuckling]

184
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:10,276
[pensive music playing, fades]

185
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,654
This is where you're going.

186
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,906
The summit of Mt. Talimba.

187
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:21,704
[suspenseful music playing]

188
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,795
From the last stop,

189
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,839
it's a 50-kilometer trek.

190
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,216
It's going to take you
around two days to get there.

191
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,392
That's where you'll find Sameo Patel.

192
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,269
A notorious druglord.

193
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,939
[trilling]

194
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:58,616
[suspenseful music continues]

195
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,201
[Greg] And this is Benjie Alcazar,

196
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,495
the right-hand man of Sameo.

197
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,040
[trilling]

198
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:11,045
[suspenseful music continues]

199
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,463
And lastly, Monching Santiago.

200
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,382
He's the head of security
at Sameo's place.

201
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,218
[trilling]

202
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,678
A few hundred meters
away from his house,

203
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,890
is where the hideout
of Sameo's men is located.

204
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,187
There is a meth lab on-site.

205
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,939
[trills, pings]

206
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,862
And according to intel,

207
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,117
Sameo Patel is often alone.

208
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,829
Very reclusive and mysterious.

209
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,750
The people know him only by name

210
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,752
because of his donations.

211
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,088
They've never met him in person,

212
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:58,008
which means he uses money
to get whatever he wants.

213
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,136
[JB] Sir.

214
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:00,970
Yes, JB?

215
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,763
Do we have a local asset there?

216
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,351
No.

217
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,937
According to the mayor,
all the undercover cops he's sent

218
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,273
have been found dead
at the foot of the mountain.

219
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,025
So we have no assets at the moment.

220
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,322
Now, there's a community near them.

221
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,367
In Sitio Mandalo.

222
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,289
All of the people there
are loyal to Sameo.

223
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,460
Because of all the food supplies,

224
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,378
donations, and favors
he's been giving them.

225
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,755
Clearly, it's just a strategy

226
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,050
to get the locals to cover up
his illegal operations.

227
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,636
Wow. Manipulative.

228
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,221
I know a person.

229
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,185
[Greg] That's why we can't
trust anyone in that place.

230
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,397
The goal is to eliminate Sameo Patel.

231
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,482
Are you in?

232
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,943
- Definitely, sir.
- Yes, sir.

233
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,987
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,532
[Greg] Good. We will do this
clean and quiet.

235
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,744
For now, take care of any
unfinished business you have.

236
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,206
I don't want anything getting
in the way of this mission.

237
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:17,296
[suspenseful music continues]

238
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,969
We leave tomorrow at 0400 hours.
Any questions?

239
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,387
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

240
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,226
[suspenseful music fades]

241
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:36,398
[dramatic music stings]

- [faucet running]
- [plates clinking]

244
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,779
Leave it to me, Grandma.

245
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,953
Did Mister Domeng say how much
the land is selling for?

246
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:54,041
[Esang]
Oh, it only costs 20 million pesos!

247
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,835
Where on earth will we
get that kind of money?

248
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,379
Twenty million?

249
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,630
How is that possible?

250
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,965
[Esang] I don't know!

251
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:05,052
My god, even if we all
chip in and work together,

252
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,097
we'll never be able to afford it.

253
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,099
[water splashing]

254
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,517
[plate clinks]

255
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,604
What are you thinking, Andres?

256
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,982
Don't tell me you have 20 million pesos?

257
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,988
And where would he get that huge amount?

258
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,409
[Esang] Gosh, this kid.

259
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:35,416
[uneasy music playing]

260
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:40,421

[somber music continues]

269

Fifty million?

277

Isn't that too much?

278
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,732
There are plenty of people we need to pay

279
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,609
in order to pull some strings.

280
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,362
Bro.

281

If you really want them
to release your father,

282
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,825
it can be arranged.

[man] <i>We have a lead on Agno.</i>

293
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,347

<i>Yes. There's no doubt about it.</i>
