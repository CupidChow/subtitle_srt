I have no idea what he was doing there.

22

Maybe he's after us
because of Timor's death?

the hard drive has a tracker?

I'll handle it.

I'll figure out a way to make a copy.

43
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,226
So you're going to make a replica
of the hard drive?

It's going to take hours.

to get tracked if you do that.

There was only a few of them too.

Could they be the ones
who stole the hard drive?

they're going to swarm him.

113

did you see any crucial information?

Because Senator La Costa

185
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,906
was Muñoz's protector.

186
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,411
He wanted Muñoz dead
so he could silence him,

187
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,787
before he is exposed.

188
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,583
And you're an accomplice, am I right?

189
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,086
I don't know what you're talking about.

190
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,173

Where did you get
the money to buy all of this?

203
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,801
From my job. I poured my blood,
sweat, and tears into this.

204
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,220
Hmm…

205
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,934

- I'll call you, Grandma.
- As always.

212
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,416
Yes.

213
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,127
Luis, you know where
the bus terminal is, right?

214
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,336
Take everything there.

215
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,421
Yeah, I will.

216
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,423
We'll just ration everything out

217
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,716
then I'll take the boxes
to the terminal tonight.

218
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,717
Okay, very good.

219
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,137
Yeah, we'll take care of it.

220

Mm, y-yes. Um… What can I do for you?

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,189
I just wanted to ask
if you know where Tomas is?

255

Uh…

256
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,111
Why? Is Tomas missing?

He hasn't come home for several days now.

No texts or chats from him either.

I'll let you know if he calls me.

<i>I hope I'm wrong.</i>

368
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,906
<i>I heard the news that</i>
<i>Jake Dela Cuesta was murdered.</i>

369
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,616
<i>Everything is under control.</i>

370
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,202
<i>General, do you have a contract</i>
<i>for the group?</i>

371
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,704
<i>They're not new to you.</i>

372
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,415
<i>We need to find that hard drive.</i>

373
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,916
<i>Wait, wait, wait. Rewind that.</i>

374
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,127
<i>Bingo!</i>

375
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,920
<i>It's dangerous</i>
<i>carrying that hard drive around.</i>

376
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,131
<i>We may have been compromised</i>
<i>without me knowing.</i>

377
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,799
<i>I just want to protect my team.</i>

378
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,637
[beeping]

379
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,598
<i>- They've connected it!</i>
<i>- Hurry, check the location!</i>

380
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,100
<i>Tell him to send our men there ASAP!</i>

381
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:50,105
[grunting]

382
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,190
[gunshots]
