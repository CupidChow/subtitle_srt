Only if she finds out.

182
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,745
I'm not as bad as you think.

183
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,789
She will never know.

184
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:29,211
[stirring music continues]

185
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,839
Go on with the fake wedding.

186
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,841
And…

187
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,137
this conversation never happened.

188
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:44,935
[stirring music continues]

189
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,646
[Tomas breathes deeply]

190
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:54,487
[foreboding music playing]

191
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,494
Sir.

192
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,792
[dramatic music sting]

193
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,836
[dramatic music sting]

194
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,007
[foreboding music continues]

195
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,636
[sighs deeply]

196
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,720
Thank you.

197
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,765
I was right about giving you that job.

198
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,558
Thank you, sir.

199
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,810
[chuckles]

200
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,186
[Enrique] Let's have some coffee, okay?

201
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,148
[cup clinks]

202
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,318
[cup clinks]

203
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:39,073
[foreboding music continues]

204
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,366
[cup clinks]

205
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,202
[Enrique exhales loudly]

206
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,915
It's confirmed.
Greg Paterno is the Contractor.

207
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,252
General Mariano has him
on call for off-the-book missions.

208
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,255
He has an excellent team.

209
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,384
I know Greg.

210
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,637
I worked with him before.

211
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,889
You worked with Greg?

212
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,974
[exhales sharply]

213
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:10,271
We parted ways during our last contract.

214
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,481
Greg has skills.

215
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,484
But he doesn't think big.

216
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,573
He doesn't see things the way I see them.

217
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,742
And I'm sure…

218
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,497
he keeps taking
contracts to go against the El Cano.

219
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,833
Why?

220
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,918
[music turns suspenseful]

221
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,840
[suspenseful music continues]

222
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,135
[Greg huffs]

223
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,387
[Greg sighs]

224
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,100
The license plate of the motorcycle
I saw at the cemetery was fake.

225
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,853
We don't have any new leads, Greg.

226
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,272
Manuel is really cunning.

227
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,319
[sighs sharply]

228
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:04,116
[suspenseful music continues]

229
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,870
He has stirred up
a lot of trouble for El Cano.

230
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,623
- Timor, the masterlist.
- [music turns foreboding]

231
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,917
He also had Muñoz killed.

232
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,340
I'm sure he didn't take
those contracts for money.

233
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,675
[foreboding music continues]

234
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,427
What do you want me to do, sir?

235
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,803
[chuckles]

236
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,764
Nothing.

237
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,683
You've done your job.

238
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,311
I'll handle Greg.

239
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,234
Sir, you know
that I'll do anything for you.

240
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,320
That's the least I can do
to thank you for helping me

241
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,572
ever since I became an orphan.

242
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,284
[foreboding music continues]

243
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,452
I know.

244
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,205
[chuckles] I know.

245
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:53,999
Sit.

246
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,210
[chuckles]

247
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,174
[foreboding music builds, fades]

248
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,009
- [clamoring]
- Thank you.

249
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,427
You can count on me.

250
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:10,266
[chanting] Gov.
Selo! Gov. Selo! Gov. Selo!

251
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,600
Hello!

252
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,520
[chanting] Gov.
Selo! Gov. Selo! Gov. Selo!

253
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,563
At your service.

254
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:19,066
[clamoring]

255
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,442
Gov! Gov!

256
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:27,533
[clamoring continues]

257
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,744
- [Andres] Gov!
- Thank you.

258
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,246
Number 2 on the ballot.

259
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,330
[panting] Sir.

260
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,124
It's okay.

261
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,254
How are you?

262
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,922
How can I help you?

263
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,051
Sir, I know that you remember me.

264
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,637
I want to know.

265
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,932
Who were you talking to at
the restaurant the other day?

266
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,226
[dramatic music playing]

267
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,394
Were you following me?

268
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,022
That was my brother, right?

269
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,608
I repeat.

270
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,902
- Were you following me?
- Am I right or wrong?

271
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,487
Was he my brother?

272
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,909
[dramatic music builds]

273
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,077
[Tomas exhales loudly]

274
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,039
Tom, wait. Relax, okay? Calm down.

275
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,707
Calm down, okay?

276
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,334
You're being dramatic.

277
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,336
You don't know how
Gab's father can be, Uncle.

278
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,630
Don't mind him. It doesn't matter.

279
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,049
He's not going to be
your real father-in-law anyway.

280
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,926
Yes, I know but…

281
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,553
- Just relax.
- They're here. They're here.

282
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,680
- That's her father?
- Yes. Be nice, okay?

283
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,059
Sir, this is my uncle.

284
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,644
- Hi.
- Hi.

285
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,520
- [quirky music playing]
- [both chuckle]

286
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,066
Oh, I didn't know
Gab's mother is so young.

287
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,360
I'm not her mom.

288
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,528
- [Tomas chuckles awkwardly]
- Is that so?

289
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,740
- [inhales deeply] Sir.
- Well, I have to say,

290
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,534
you have great taste.

291
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,702
[breathes deeply]

292
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,870
You've still got game.

293
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,664
Uncle, okay, that's enough.

294
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,832
- Why?
- Sir, I'm sorry.

295
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,709
- He's just--
- Tomas.

296
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,380
Sir, can we talk privately again?

297
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,674
- Talk privately again?
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,884
Why? Have we ever talked privately before?

299
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,594
[chuckles awkwardly]

300
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,180
- Sir, it's about…
