Does this mean he won't join our mission?

We can try again later

Yes.

So, Kenji is a jerk.

We need to know who ordered
him to kill Benicio Avila.

That is only, if we capture him alive,

186

Why? At least I'm concerned about him.

187
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,465
Right?

188
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,343
Or maybe you want me
to miss you instead…

189
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,638
Maybe he just wants to spend
some quality time with his kid.

190

Whatever it is,
I'm sure he has a valid reason.

What?

The supposedly
silent infiltrator to the server

218

that triggered the alarm
within the first five minutes.

219

Hey, that wasn't me.
That was the damn firewall.

You know what, Enzo?

That's just your nostalgia talking.

Hmm…

229
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,105
Actually, no.

230
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,567
I've seen you work.

231
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,197
So, I spoke to some people.

232

- Okay…
- Your case?

233
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,620
It's being looked into.

234

Are you serious, Enzo?

235
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,712
Max, look. There's still a way.

237
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,344
Yeah, I remember Pao.

238
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,637
What about him?

239
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,973
He's part of the review board now.

240

- It can be convened.

Wait.

243
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,694
So, Enzo, you're telling me…

244
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,823
there's a possibility I can be reinstated?

That's a tricky case.

248

I know. That's why I'm here, sir.

249
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,879
For now, he's filing for bail.

250
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:45,092
We're hoping you can speed up the process.

251
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,348
I can make some calls.

252
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,393
But I'll only do this because you asked.

253
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,814

But Max, if this pushes through,
you need to prepare.

Because it can be dirty.

260
