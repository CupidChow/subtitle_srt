13

You want to talk to my mother?

Yes.

33
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,419
I have something important to ask her.

34
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,965
Can I ask what it is about?

35
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,926
It's about an adoption
certificate that was sent to me.

36
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,929
About the boy Manuel Aguinaldo adopted.

[unsettling music continues]

38
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,394
Interesting.

00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,814
People usually come here to look for work,

40
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:32,110
apply for scholarships,
or seek assistance.

41
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,155
Not to inquire
about adoption certificates.

Don't worry.

Okay.

Alright. Prepare the car.

Yes.

Secretary Ella Barrios of BENR?

00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,187
She needs protection.

96
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,319
No, she reached out to me herself.

97
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,363
So…

00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,823
VIP protection?

00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,076
Covert VIP protection.

100
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,369
Even her security
detail mustn't know about it.

101
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,498
Secretary Barrios
has made a lot of enemies.

102
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,375
This has become bigger
than her environmental advocacy.

103
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,588
She's challenging
long-standing industries.

104
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:29,097
Mining corporations,
logging firms, energy companies.

105
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,308
Which means,
she's made enemies out of big names.

106
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,228
Including the Velasco Mining Corporation.

107
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,440
They have a pending
case for mercury contamination.

108
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,692
- They're also facing complaints
- [dramatic music playing]

109

for hiring minors to work in mines.

110
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:51,369
Secretary Barrios is
ordering for their shut down,

111
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,163
so Velasco retaliated with a libel case.

112
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,625
And yet, she's still standing.

113
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:04,423
Yes, and not only has
she upset private businessmen.

114
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,343
She has also caught
the ire of some government officials.

[dramatic music continues]

116
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,472
People like her are rare.

Bribery and threats don't work on her.

118
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,605
That's why she's a target.

00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,548
It depends. Sometimes, I wake up in pain

at level seven, eight, or nine?

130

[doctor] Your muscles are stiff

131
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,598
and you have a limited range of motion.

While Doc Trina is away,

133
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,019
maybe you can visit me more often.

Injectable?

140
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,459
[doctor]
Yes, but it's for emergency use only.

141
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,171
I don't want you to rely on it
because this is addictive.

Don't worry, doc.

143
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,304
I won't be dependent on it.

144
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,225
Should we go with… I'm thinking either

145
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,187
smoked salmon crostini's
or truffle quiches? What do you think?

146
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,149
I think quiche is good,
but salmon is better.

147
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,609
That's true. It's much lighter, right?

148
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,610
- Okay.
- Yeah.

149

- Salmon it is.
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,656
And for dessert,
should we go with panna cotta

151
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,450

I want you to understand.

175
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,177
I did.

00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,306
I fully got it.

00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,955
How?

186
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,709
Teach me how to accept your relationship.

187
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,422
The two of you are happy together.

188
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,133
But my mom is dead!

189
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,970
- [Gab sniffles] She's dead!
- Dear…

190
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,016
- [Gab cries]
- I can't bring her back.

191
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,185
I know! Exactly!

192
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,897
And it's been eight years,
but I'm still hurting every day!

[cries, exhales]

194
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,822

202
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:24,100
This father-daughter
shitty thing that we have.

203
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,104
I'm done.

204
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,149
[sobs] Just give me her rest house.

205
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,946
Give me her house, all of her things.

206
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,490
I want her memories with me.

207
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,076
Just forget about me.

208
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,037
You'll never hear
anything from me ever again.

209
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,914
Just pretend like I never existed.

210
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,666

You better be telling the truth.

When can you get the papers done?

245
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,728
You'll only get it…

246
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,983
once you're married.

247
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,987

- Success!
- Yeah! [laughing]

263
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,537
Now, you can start, cooking.

264
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,122
Oh, I thought you meant get married.

265

- Alright then.
- You're too much!

266
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,585
- [Luis] Just joking, Grandma.
- [Esang] It's done now.

267
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,129
[Luis] Perfect timing,
the <i>sinigang's</i> ready.

268

[Esang] Oh, you're here already.

Oh…

270
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,594
- So, how did it go?
- [exhales heavily]

271
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,306
Did you talk to Secretary Marquez?

272

[Andres sighs deeply]

273
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,519
No.

Oh.

275
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,150
I ended up talking to his son, Marcelo.

276
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,736
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you know what I noticed?

277
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,031
He has a cigarette burn here.

[dramatic music playing]

279
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,243
Do you mean the same kind as Vincent,

280
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,454
<i>The one who went missing with Junjun?</i>

281
00:15:55,537 --> 00:16:00,668
Yes. Didn't Vincent say
everyone he was with had the same mark?

282
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:06,256
[dramatic music continues]

283
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,341
Mm!

284
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,511
It feels like,

285
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,015
something's really off here.

286
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,351
With everything happening, it's like…

287
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,646
Could it be…

288
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,317
the BSWP people are messing with us?

289
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,569
After everything…

290
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:33,993
Was Secretary Marquez
the one who adopted Junjun?

291
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,162
And Marcelo?

292
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:42,418
Could he actually be your brother, Junjun?

293
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,505
[dramatic music continues]

294
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,798
Let's meet ASAP.

295
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,259
This is it.

297
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,764

00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:01,562
[dramatic music continues]

300
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,605
- I'll call you.
- Oh, son!

301
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,691
- Ma!
- Oh, you're here already.

302
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,402
How are you? Hmm? [smooches]

303
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,196
Come on, let's eat, I'm starving.

304
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,824
Ah, Ma, I just had
to take care of something.

305
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,495
Enough with work, son. Let's eat first.

306
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,959
Oh, by the way,
Lyn said someone came by looking for me?

307
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,882
Ma, people are always looking for you.
Nothing new there.

308
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:34,386
Well, you're right, but who was it?

309
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,556
[dramatic music intensifies]

310
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,600
No one, just someone asking for aid.

[dramatic music crescendos]

312
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,025
Maybe he sent his people to trick us,

313
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:52,029
making it seem like Junjun's gone so…

314
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,699
they wouldn't have to return your brother.

315
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:01,121
[pots clattering]

316
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,374
I really don't know, Grandma.

317
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,087
But if you think about it…

318
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,091
Marcelo should be around Junjun's age?

319
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,302
Oh!

320
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,514
So, did you see…

321
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,642
Does he look like your brother?
Is there any resemblance?

322
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,897
They were fair-skinned like Jun.

323
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,981
[Esang grunts acknowledging]

324
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,568
and by now, he would be
about the same height too.

325
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:38,659
But doesn't a person's
appearance change as they grow up?

326
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,203
- Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.

327
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,039
Wait, did you introduce yourself?

328
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,919
Did he… did he recognize you?

329
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,218
Well,

330
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,263
he was young when he disappeared,

331
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,765
so maybe he doesn't remember.

332
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,351
[breathes deeply]

[foreboding music playing]

334
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,023
But Andres,

335
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:15,404
why were you sent
that adoption certificate?

336
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,032
It feels like, it was intentional.

337
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,451

339
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,788
I don't know.

340
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:33,088
Maybe someone from
BSWP with a conscience sent it?

341
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,632
Maybe…

342
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:41,013
they know Manuel Aguinaldo
adopted someone else, right?

343
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:46,101
And maybe Secretary Marquez
is giving us a hint.

344
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,897
Who would care that much,

345
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,901
and how would they even know about Jun?

346
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,779
[foreboding music continues]

347
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,742
I really don't know anymore.
This whole situation is so confusing.

348
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:08,040
The more unanswered questions we have,

349
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:13,712
the more it feels like
we're losing Junjun all over again.
