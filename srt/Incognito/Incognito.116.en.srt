00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,245
We've all lost someone.

[unsettling music playing]

189
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,290
A father, a mother…

[unsettling music continues]

191
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,175
A brother…

192
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,349
A friend…

193
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,813
They were people
who weren't part of the fight.

194
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,483
People we promised…

195
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,069
to protect.

196
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,033
And that's not the only thing we lost.

197
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,745
We also lost a piece of ourselves.

198
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:36,584
[unsettling music continues]

199
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,171
This is all Manuel Aguinaldo's doing.

200
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,510
And to think…

201
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,514
he was once one of us.

202
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,852
Wait, hold on. "One of us?"

203
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,106
You've worked with him before?

204
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,109
Yes.

205
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,446
I trusted him.

206
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,700
But he betrayed the group

207
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,244
because we have different beliefs.

208
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,289
What do you mean?

209
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,959
To him, everything is rotten.

210
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,296
The system, the government, and justice.

211
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,299
He believes the freedom we're fighting for

212
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,426
is just all an illusion.

213
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,723
[unsettling music continues]

214
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,728
He believes that if
the masses have the power to speak,

215
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,522
everything will be
plunged into further chaos.

216

[unsettling music continues]

217
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,489
So what does he want to happen?

218
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,076
He wants to abolish everything.

219
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,748
[unsettling music continues]

220
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,127
He wants discipline and blind obedience.

221
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,132
He wants respect that comes from fear.

222
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:12,513
[unsettling music continues]

223
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,765
Ultimately,

224
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,976
he wants control.

226
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,160
I'm in.

227
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,747
Me too.

228
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,043
I'll kill all of them.

229
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,587
I'm going to make them all pay.

[unsettling music continues]

231
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,021
That being said,

232
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,606
I have a plan.

233
