00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,633
<i>I'm alcohol-free!</i>

00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,636
<i>Oh, really? Until when?</i>
<i>Until when?!</i>

00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,722
<i>How long are we going</i>

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,597
<i>Forever?!</i>

00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,307

12
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,397

13
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:27,402

<i>Give me the phone--</i>

16
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>Who do you want to call?</i>

17
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,202
<i>An assistant to get my list.</i>

18
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,330
<i>The list of those</i>

You're right.

25
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,021
My family is important to me.

26
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,903

[tense music playing]

28
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,203
Are you an idiot, Andres?

29
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,498
I'm so disappointed.

30
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,918
I'm disappointed that
you don't care

31
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,380
about your brother anymore,
and I promise you…

32
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,510
if something bad
happens to me…

33
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:20,306
you'll never see your
beloved brother again.

34
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,602
So, think about
what you're doing.

35
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,937
Andres…

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,438
think real hard.

37
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,315
But don't take too long, okay?

38
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,820
Just like you told me
when you held my son…

39
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,115

How's Max?

[sighs] She's fine.

49
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:12,901
Andres, what happened
in Cerdova…

50
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,112
now I understand
why you did that.

51
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,114
Because of your brother.

52
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,117
I get it now.

53
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,912
[breathes deeply]

54
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,581
Next time, when you have
a problem, tell me.

55
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,792
So we can avoid
the trouble, right?

56
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,296
We're a team here, brother.

57
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,715
Sure, JB.

58
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,300

[spits]

71
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,636
I'll face my end

72
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,304
once you bring me
to the person

73
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,515
who put a bounty on my head!

75
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,520
How much is my worth
right now, huh?

76

Fifty million?

77
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,691
One hundred million?

78
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,694
Tell me.

79
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,989
I'll give you a higher amount.

80
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,994
I can make it worth your while.

81
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,581
You can't solve everything
with money, Timor.

82
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,085
Is that so?

83
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,630
Well then…

84
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,300
what could be the reason
for someone like you

85
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,718
to be here?

86
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,180
Based on your appearance,
you look rich.

87
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,226
It seems like you
have everything.

88
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,603
A strong man.

89
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,481
You could get
any woman you want.

90
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,609
But you're here.

91
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,904
What is it
that you don't have, huh?

92
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,993
Everyone, all of them…

93
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,787
are worth a certain price.

94
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,708
[Timor] It may not be money.

95
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,294
Like…

96
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:42,008
your stupid companion,
was it Andres?

[inhales sharply]

00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,306
I just want to know.

100
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,308
Tell me.

101
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,518
What…

102
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,104
is your price?

103
00:05:55,438 --> 00:06:02,195
[tense music playing]

104
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,617
You look familiar.

105
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,995
Have we met before?

106
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,500
Wait. Hold on. Let me think.

107
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,503
I keep…

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,381

[tense music continues]

111
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,529
What's wrong, JB?

112
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,114
- What did he say?
- [exhales sharply]

113
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,616
That Timor sure is crazy.

114
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,786
He even tried to bribe me.

115
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,622
Just ignore him.

116
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,499
He's evil to the core.

117
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,336
I can't wait to hand him
over to our client

118
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,382
so I can get reinstated
as promised.

119
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,510
Hm.

120
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,891
Andres.

121
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,271
You know you can
tell me anything, right?

122
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,862
He tried to bribe you too,
didn't he?

123
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,408
Yeah.

124
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,202
[Andres chuckles]

125
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,704
[scoffs]

126
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,582
What did he offer you
besides money?

127
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,713
Information.

128
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,801
Information about
my missing brother.

129
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,388
But I don't know if
I should believe him.

130
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,307
Why?

131
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,559
What did he say?

132
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,190
He mentioned a master list

133
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,402
which contains records of…

134
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,322
…their syndicate's human
trafficking operations.

135

[sighs deeply]

137
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,293
You know, Andres…

138
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,589
There are other ways
to find your brother.

139
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,509
You don't need Timor.

140
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
I know.

141
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,058
Don't worry. I won't sell
my soul to that bastard.

142
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:45,399
[grim music continues]

00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,580
- Tom G.
- [Tomas] <i>What's up?</i>

146
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,583
Let's talk.

147
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,419
Switch to channel 11.

148
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,091
What is it?

149
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,512
I'm so bored.

150
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,725
What do you want me to do?
Entertain you?

151
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,811
<i>Yes, that's why I radioed you.</i>

152
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,688
Because…

153
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,107
Compared to the others,
you're mildly entertaining.

154
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,400
Just mildly.

155
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,528
Great.

156
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,613
I'm glad someone here can see
how entertaining I am.

157
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,032
[chuckles softly]

158
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,826
Go on. Tell me a story.

159
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,035
<i>A story?</i>

160
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,120
Yeah.

161
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,914
<i>Tell me anything.</i>

162
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,624
It can be personal or whatever.

163
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,419
What are your views on life?
Anything on your mind right now?

164
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,129
Any intrusive thoughts?

165
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,297
Anything. Please.

166
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,507
I can't think of anything.

167
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,302
Just tell me something.

168
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm about to fall asleep…

169
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,306
- …out of boredom.
<i>- Why? Is my voice arousing?</i>

170
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,726
No.

171
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,728
I just want background noise.

172
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,521
Can't handle a little peace?

173
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
Because I was trained
to be quiet.

174
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,316
So, please…

175
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,693
Yeah, right! [chuckles]

176
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,613
Okay, fine. Um…

177
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,157
How about a joke?

178
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,200
A joke?

179
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,744
I don't have any.

180
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,496
Come on. Not even one?

181
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,083
Well, my whole life is a joke.
[chuckles]

182
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,835
You're so dramatic.

183
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,296
Fine. Tell me why
you think that way.

184
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,798
Nah, it will only bore you.

185
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,009
<i>Okay.</i>

186
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,888
Alright. Get back to me
once you've thought of a joke.

187
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,266
Alright, sure.

188
