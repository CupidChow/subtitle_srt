There's a bomb here.

C-4.

[suspenseful music continues]

202
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,324
They must have planted
bombs at all the exits.

203
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,909
There is no other way out of the hotel

204
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,077
except the tunnel.

205
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,581
I'll meet the hostages.

206
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,917
You'll have to move fast.
Stick to the plan.

207
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,294
I'll cover the exit.

208
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,421
I'll handle the third floor.

209
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,505
Hold on!

210
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,340
There are two other hostages.

Why does it look like they're sleeping?

213
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,602
I'm guessing they still
don't know what is going on.

[Max] JB!

220
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,298
Be careful.

221
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,928
Muñoz's men are all over the building.

[Greg] <i>Sparrow, what's your status?</i>

234
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:38,706
I'm on the move to locate
of the group of four Max mentioned.

235
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,082
There aren't many guards here.

236
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,709
Good.

them out of the hotel.

00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,196
Is that clear?

00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,824
Yes, sir.

Sir! Sir!

We found Clover's phone.

Finally!

279
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,286
It sent an alert that someone
tried to open the hard drive.

00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,707
Okay. Where is that?

281
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,084
Somewhere in the south,
200 kilometers away.

We need to get that hard drive back.

286
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,895
It has all the vital information
of all our operations, okay?

287
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:52,107
Including the officials we bribe
and everything. Alright?

288
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,902
It's in the hands of the enemy.

289
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,072
It's like a bullet aimed right at us.
