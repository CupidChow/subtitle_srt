00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,305
you were never by myside.

184
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,016
Never on my side.

185
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:35,820
[melancholy music continues]

186
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:40,616
[footsteps retreating]

187
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,996
[sighs deeply]

188
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,252
[door opens]

189
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,922
- [door closes]
- [rooster crows]

190
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,341
[door opens]

191
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,426
[Christine] Miguel…

192
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,637
Miguel, are you leaving us here?

193
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,598
There's no other way, Christine.

194
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,394
They will kill me.

195
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,564
Unless I give them the money.

196
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,315
You don't know that.

197
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,109
There's still another way.

198
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,610
I know you.

199
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,863
You'll think of something else.

200
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,739
- Please.
- [rooster crows]

201
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,742
There's no other way, Christine.

202
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:30,708
[melancholy music continues]

203
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,334
Take care of Mickey.

204
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,129
Take care of my son, okay?

205
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,215
Miguel. [breath quivers]

206
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,554
Miguel! [sniffles]

207
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,139
[breath quivers]

208
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,976
[car door opens]

209
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:55,983
[melancholy music continues]

210
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,818
[car door closes, engine starts]

211
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:04,325
[car revving]

212
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,828
[in Japanese]
I don't know who they are.

213
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,623
But they're surely after Kenji, too.

214
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,042
[foreboding music playing]

215
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,503
Kenji's head carries
a price too great to ignore.

216
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,256
That's what we want.

217
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,258
Find him.

218
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,011
Otherwise, no one can leave.

219
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,680
I'll eliminate everyone.

220
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,725
Understood.

221
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:35,189
[foreboding music continues]

222
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,192
[foreboding music crescendos]

223
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,195
[Gab] Ouch! Ouch!

224
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,698
There's nothing suspicious
around here, right?

225
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,868
[Max] They probably,

226
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,247
won't expect the target to show up here.

227
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,208
Isn't that the first thing
you're supposed to do?

228
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,877
Go to the place no one would suspect?

229
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,381
Well, that's what we would do.

230
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,592
But maybe, they might not think the same?

231
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,594
Yeah, agree.

232
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,346
[chuckles]

233
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,559
Who'd expect a target
to just be relaxing somewhere?

234
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,019
[Tomas] It's so nice here, right, sir?

235
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,896
It's like a movie.

236
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,983
This is just like what I see in films.

237
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,150
I can't believe it.

238
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,528
[sighs]

239
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,197
And to be fair, sir,

240
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,032
what we're drinking really warms me up.

241
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,118
You know, sir, just a little longer

242
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,203
and I think I'll start
to feel like a local here.

243
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,247
My skin's getting tougher, I think.

244
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,166
But my face?
That's always been thick.

245
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,251
[laughs]

246
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,919
[sighs heavily]

247
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,008
[indistinct background chatter]

248
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,760
Do you have a problem?

249
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,139
It's not really a problem, sir.

250
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,434
Oh, okay.

251
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,269
Wow, just like that?

252
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,938
That was supposed to be my segue
into asking you for advice.

253
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,107
And that's your answer, "okay"? [chuckles]

254
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,191
Okay, but what is it?

255
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,068
[quirky music playing]

256
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,530
It's about a girl, sir.

257
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,948
[both laughing softly]

258
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,618
You know, like you--

259
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,537
I just wanted to ask for your advice.

260
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,497
How do you get girls, sir?

261
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,625
The kind who get addicted to you.

262
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,335
I haven't had a girlfriend in a while.

263
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,128
- Addicted to you?
- Yeah, sir.

264
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,088
Well, that's a different story.

265
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,215
Sir! Don't go there!

266
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,676
We're keeping it wholesome here.

267
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,720
You went straight somewhere else.

268
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,765
But really, maybe you've got
some real advice?

269
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,683
Something that realistically works?

270
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,395
- So a girl will like me.
- Okay, fine.

271
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,480
Tomas…

272
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,943
learn to shut up.

273
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,737
[quirky music continues]

274
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,530
Be a little mysterious.

275
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,574
- Mysterious?
- Yes!

276
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,284
[grunts softly]

277
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,496
Ugh! How many bullets
have gone through me, Max?

278
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,914
- Really? How many?
- [Max laughs]

279
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,207
This is nothing.

280
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,250
[laughs]

281
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,961
Ow!

282
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,755
- You're so mean, Max!
- Ouch.

283
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,008
Come on, I was just checking it.

284
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,261
- That hurts!
- So, you're not numb?

285
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,847
Actually, no, I can't feel anything.

286
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,226
I'm just saying. You do feel things.

287
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,979
Of course, I really felt that.

288
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,149
So, can you also feel that
Tomas really likes you?

289
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,234
Huh?

290
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,861
What do you mean?

291
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,990
- What are you talking about?
- What I mean is…

292
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:36,328
Yes. I can really feel
how much he likes pushing my buttons.

293
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,496
[Max laughs]

294
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,624
No, what I mean is [inhales deeply]

295
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,043
I think he's attracted to you.

296
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,503
Huh?

297
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,590
If only you could've seen
how concerned he was while you were gone.

298
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,093
No way.

299
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,554
- [Gab laughs]
- It's true.

300
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,724
No. Disgusting. [scoffs]

301
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,561
- Okay, fine. Fine, fine.
- Just thinking about it… Ugh.

302
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,563
- I'll stop.
- [scoffs] Okay.

303
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,231
- But it's true. But I'll stop.
- It's not!

304
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,315
But it's true.

305
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:12,281
Max, you know,
I don't have room for feelings anymore.

306
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,783
My heart has run out of feelings.
Don't worry.

307
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,871
You know, I never said you
have feelings for Tomas.

308
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,540
- Are you dumb?
- That came from you.

309
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,168
- Are you joking?
- I didn't say that. You did.

310
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,170
- Okay. I'll get you back.
- You seem okay now.

311
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,130
[stutters, laughs]

312
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,341
- I'll get you back someday.
- Come on, let's go.

313
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,635
So, you are feeling better now.

314
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,097
Sir, I want my vibe to be like
a suspense-thriller film.

315
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,809
But, if we're going for mysterious,
sir, don't I…

316
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,312
Don't I fit the bill?
Just look at me, sir.

317
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,773
Like a rosary full of mystery.

318
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,149
[laughing]

319
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,276
- Not like that.
- Oh, not like that? [laughs]

320
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,986
But, sir, it's like…

321
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,281
You know, I've noticed that…

322
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,494
- Gab looks intensely at you.
- Really, sir?

323
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,954
Yes, just based on what I've seen.

324
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,916
No. I wasn't talking about Gab, sir.
Come on.

325
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,545
Gab? There are lots of girls around.
I don't care about Gab.

326
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:13,217
I care about how all the other
girls look at me. Right?

327
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,136
- I mean… I want to be like you, sir.
- [quirky music continues]

328
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,432
It seems girls fall for you
the moment they see you.

329
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,017
[laughing]

330
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,938
Like you can get them pregnant
just by walking by.

331
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,731
[Tomas laughs]

332
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,276
Tell me, sir, how many
firstborns do you have?

333
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,071
[Tomas laughs]

334
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,949
Sir, I want to date multiple girls.

335
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,369
Not Gab. Why would you bring up Gab?

336
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,454
[sighs]

337
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:48,836
[tense music playing]

<i>Miguel.</i>

341
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,349
Let's stop the chase.

342
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,978
Meet with me.

343
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,647
I have the money.

344
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,441
<i>Where?</i>

345
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:18,448
[tense music continues]

[engine revving]

347
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,877
<i>So, you want money?</i>

348
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,670
<i>You're a scumbag!</i>

349
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,131
<i>I was told my brother's dead,</i>

350
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,591
<i>but I don't believe it.</i>

351
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,593
<i>I spoke to social welfare.</i>

352
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,219
<i>Is it possible to go there?</i>

353
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,221
<i>- That's Kenji.</i>
<i>- Don't let him get away.</i>

354
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,472
<i>- I'm coming.</i>
<i>- Ow!</i>

355
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,892
[in Japanese]
<i>I'm sorry. Are you okay?</i>

356
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,936
<i>Target is mobile. We've got eyes on him.</i>

357
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,771
<i>Stay on him. Don't lose sight.</i>

358
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,276
<i>- Someone's after me!</i>
<i>- JB, where are you?</i>
