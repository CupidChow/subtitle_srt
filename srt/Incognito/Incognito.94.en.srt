40
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,608
To convince me not to leave the group?

41

- No!
- Andres, calm down.

Come to think of it.

48
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,090
Shouldn't you team up
with me and Contractor?

49
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,886
Let me get this straight.

50
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,055
You want us to use my brother,

51
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,558
to find Manuel?

52
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,688
JB, we're not talking
about some random person here.

53
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,857
Jun is my brother.

You know that.

But think about this, Andres.

63
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,010
Manuel betrayed the people

64
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:43,389
who fought with him
and risked their life for him.

65
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,682
He's the reason they're dead.

66
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,020
He can betray anyone, even your brother.

67
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,234
Manuel works for El Cano,

the organization that took your brother.

69
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,786
Jun's life will be in danger
as long as he's with that group.

70
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,705
Let's get him out of that group, Andres.

Sir, I'll do this for my brother…

76
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,032
and what's best for him.

77
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,375
But he can't know about our job.

78
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,006
No one should also know
that we're working together.

79
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,466
So, be careful, Andres.

80
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,093
Don't raise any suspicions.

that Jun won't get hurt.

Pa, I didn't tell
you about them right away

96
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,690
because I wanted
to think about it carefully.

97
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,402
Besides, I just met them.

98
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,325
Your brother is impressive. He found you.

99
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,453
You said he was a former soldier, right?

100
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,538
He was fired from service

101
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,583
because he killed our dad's murderer.

[unsettling music playing]

103
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,379

He wants to meet you, Pa.

105

What did you tell him?

106
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,179
I agreed.

107
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,014
But I only said that

108
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,683
because he'll get suspicious if I say no.

[unsettling music continues]

110
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,941

186
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,709
Hi, Jun. You can park over there.

187
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,586
No need. Get in.

188
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,755
Why? I thought
we were supposed to meet here?

189
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,841
Papa said we'd meet somewhere else.

190
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,009
Where?

191
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,385
Just get in.

192
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:48,392

[Diego] Pa.

197
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,302
[Manuel] Diego, son.

198
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,309
Are you Andres?

199
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,310
Sir.

200
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm Manuel Aguinaldo, Diego's father.

201
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,191
Andres, sir.

202
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,568
[unsettling music playing]

203
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,153
I heard you wanted to meet me.

204
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,033
I just wanted to personally thank you
for taking my brother in.

205
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,244
[chuckles] It's my pleasure.

206
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,746
You know, he used to cry a lot.

207
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,707
But he'd stop whenever I'd
bring him to somewhere like this.

208
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,168
[unsettling music continues]

209
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,795
Maybe it's because…

210
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,464
this place is similar
to where we used to live

211
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,550
when Jun was still young.

212
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,718
Maybe.

213
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,681
I just want you to know,
even though you didn't grow up together,

214
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,016
you're part of who he is.

215
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,312
[unsettling music continues]

216
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,022
Thank you for your kindness, sir.

217
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,984
Let's have a seat.

218
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:25,573
[unsettling music continues]

219
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,410
[Manuel grunts]

220
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:45,926
[unsettling music continues]

221
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,061
Your brother is a good kid.

222
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,314
He's smart.

223
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,025
He never gave me
a hard time taking care of him.

224
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:06,280
[unsettling music continues]

225
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,615
And now that he's all grown up,

226
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,284
he's been helping me with a lot of things.

227
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,332
That's good to hear.

228
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,877
As you can see,

229
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,422
all the years of sending him to school
and taking care of him finally paid off.

230
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,218
In exchange, he became a good son to me.

231
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:35,309
[unsettling music continues]

232
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,813
Oh, well, Pa,
I know you're busy today, so…

233
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,231
It's okay, son.

234
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,275
I've still got time.

235
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,860
Don't worry.

236
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:51,075
[unsettling music continues]

00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,839
The last position
where Andres was detected.

240
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,676
That means they're up there.

241
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,220
[foreboding music playing]

242
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,555
It's the same car,
with the same plate number.

243
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,267
They've been on the lookout from
Andres and Jun's original meeting place.

244
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,729
Which means,

245
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,272
Manuel's men are there.

246
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,359
But they changed the meeting place.

247
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,029
They're playing safe.

248
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,657
They're being careful, just like us.

249
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,871
[foreboding music intensifies]

250
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,085
[foreboding music fades]

251
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,169
Andres.

252
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,504
Sir.

253
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,672
Tell me…

254
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,009
What's keeping you busy now…

255
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,637
now that you're no longer a soldier?

256
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,102
Sir, how did you know
that I used to be a soldier?

257
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,107
Uh, Andres, I told him.

258
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,900
Oh.

259
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,280
Well, I've been busy working hard.

260
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,951
To be honest,
I devoted all my time to finding him.

261
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,912
Is that so?

262
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,415
Now that you've found him,

263
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,294
are you looking for something else to do?

264
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:31,341
[somber music playing]

265
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,552
Sir, I'm hoping…

266
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,346
to get closer to Jun.

267
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,392
Especially since we have
a lot of lost time to make up for

268
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,061
because we grew up separately.

269
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,439
You're right about that.

270
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,108
You're both different
from how you used to be

271
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:53,197
before you were separated.
You're now busy with new things.

272
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,494
That's why I want us
to make some time for each other.

273
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,206
Oh, why not.

274
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,083
That's okay.

275
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,167
Right, son?

276
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,669
Yes, Pa.

277
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,964
But your time will be limited

278
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,592
because Diego is
doing some errands for me.

279
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:20,015
[somber music continues]

280
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,893
Sir, if you don't mind, I have a question.

00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,685
[Manuel] Hmm?

282
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,023
What do you do for a living?

[chuckles]

284
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,657
I just want to know
what Jun has been busy with.

285
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,952
My line of work won't interest you.

287
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,085
How about you?

288
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,046
Are you having a hard time adjusting?

289
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,049
You used to be a soldier.

290
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,553
What do you do for a living now?

[unsettling music continues]

292
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,350
I work as a security personnel,

293
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,978
butcher, plumber, and many more.

294
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,105
I'm not picky with jobs.

295
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,777
You know what?

296
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,779
I know what you're doing.

[unsettling music continues]

298
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,579
I know why you're here,

299
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,582
and what your motive is.
