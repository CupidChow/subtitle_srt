[unsettling music continues]

180
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,896
I'll go check.

181
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,939
[MAX] <i>It's from one of the rooms here.</i>

[suspenseful music playing]

187
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,539
Men, high alert.

188
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,086
The package is now in the secure zone.

189
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,130
But stay alert.

190
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,674
They're probably just
using Monkey to distract us.

191
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,261
Yes, because they know we're here.

192
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,348
That's why they can attack any time.

193
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,267
There's only one thing I'm sure of.

194
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,686
They're watching Monkey's every move.

195
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:38,817
[suspenseful music continues]

196
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,330

[suspenseful music continues]

198
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,466
Shark, permission to cut the CCTV.

199
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,555
We move cleaner and we stay hidden.

200
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,306
Negative.

201
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,852
It will alert them if we do that.

202
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,730
But it's our only
way to stay off their radar.

203
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,692
That will also mean
we won't know what they're up to.

204
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,944
But if we don't do that,

205
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,446
even you and Wolf won't be able to move.

206
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,574
Shark, it will blow our cover.

207
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,373
It's either we lose eyes
on them or we're exposed.

[suspenseful music fades]

212
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,057
Cut the CCTV.

213

[dramatic music playing]

214
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,894

Feed is out.

219
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,121
We lost the CCTV connection.

220
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,915
Get it back now.

221
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,126

Negative.

225
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,522
They shut down the whole system.

226
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,607
We're blind.

227
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,651
How did that happen?

228
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,819
[Tres] I bet it's
the second layer of protection.

229
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,154
They're up to something.

230
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,823
[keyboard continues clacking]

231
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,158
I like this.

232
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,370
They're not afraid.

233
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,666
If they want to do this face-to-face,

234
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,875
so be it.

235
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,754
[tense music continues]

236
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,922
You're going back in there?

237
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,799
You're going to show yourself again?

238
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,886
I can't watch my
masterpiece on the monitor.

239
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,597
I want to see everything with my own eyes.

240
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,182
Your brother might get suspicious of you.

241
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,308
I know.

242
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,018
[tense music continues]

243
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,436
But if he's involved in this,

244
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,563
I'll be his distraction.

245
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,566
- Execute phase three now.
- [dramatic music sting]

246

Are you still there, Tomas?

257
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,824
Did you miss me?

258
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,119
<i>Just be on standby.</i>

259
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081

Except for this dummy phone.

265
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,370
Don't take it. If it's in your possession,

266
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,372
they can use it to trace us back.

267

[breathes deeply]
I've got a bad feeling about this.

270
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,096
They're trying to mislead us.

271
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,939
Jaguar, back to the main sector.

272
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,649
Copy.

[suspenseful music continues]

274
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,989
Eagle, status?

[Max] <i>Right now,</i>
<i>he's still talking to Monkey.</i>

276

Take a good look at
people who are using their phones.

277
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,954
Anyone can be a suspect right now.

Monkey, listen to me.

We won't abandon your uncle.

[tense music continues]

284
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,109
Is it a guy who's talking to you?

285
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,529
If your answer is yes, look to your right.

- [indistinct chatter]
- [tense music continues]

287

Do you know the whereabouts
of the guy who's talking to you?

00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,794
If your answer is yes, look to your left.

[tense music continues]

290
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,691
[Andres] <i>It's a guy.</i>

Whoever the mastermind is…

293
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,373
he wants to confuse us.

[JB] <i>Eagle.</i>

Yes, Shark.

[tense music continues]

298
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,603
[host] Ladies and gentlemen,
how are you doing so far?

299
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,313
Are you enjoying the event?

300
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,691
I think that's a yes.

301
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,860
We prepared a lot for you today.

302
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,654
- And later on,
- [Max] Someone's on the phone.

303
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,781
[host] we'll be joined
by our guest speaker…

304
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,742
[Max] I see one here, but she's a woman.

305
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,036
[host] …thank you
once again for coming over

306
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,831
and for supporting
the cause of this charity event.

307
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,584
- A round of applause, please.
- [applause]

308
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,212
Monkey said it's
a guy who's talking to him.

309
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,717
Now, before
we welcome our guest speaker today,

310
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,804
our BENR Secretary,
Ms. Josephine Ella Barrios,

311
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:51,226
let's take a moment
to recognize some of our honorary donors.

…don't let her finish her speech.

315

Go near her, aim at her,
and shoot her in the head.

[dramatic music sting]

317
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,166
Once she steps on stage,

318
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,046
I'll go near her and
shoot her in the head.

319

<i>One wrong move, and they will kill Monkey.</i>

322
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,327
<i>I won't let that happen.</i>

323
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,537
<i>- Have you found the van?</i>
<i>- It's somewhere around here.</i>

324
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,538
<i>I'll find it soon.</i>

325
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,040
<i>Once the package steps on stage,</i>

326
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,375
<i>I'm sure they'll</i>
<i>order Monkey to shoot her.</i>

327
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,877
<i>We can still do something about this.</i>

328
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,128
<i>Monkey has been compromised.</i>

329
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,964
<i>You know how this works.</i>
<i>If you can help Monkey, then good.</i>

330
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,175
<i>But if you can't,</i>
<i>then the mission comes first.</i>

331
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,095
<i>You don't have to do it, Monkey.</i>
