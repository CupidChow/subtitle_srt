He was spotted at the charity ball.

186
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,602
Same location as the group's live ops.

187
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,024
You said Barrios's enemy
was involved in human trafficking.

188
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,779
El Cano's main business.

189
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,700
[sighs sharply] I wouldn't be surprised

190
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,496
if Manuel's group
is there to kill Barrios.

191
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,831
What's your plan?

192
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:11,295
[dramatic music continues]

193
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,767
[sinister music playing]

194
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,025
Sir.

195
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,945
I should've gone with you.

196
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,739
I could've killed Paterno.

197
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,368
I'm more worried about you, Kenji.

198
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,456
I'm afraid he was able to follow me

199
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,875
because he already knows about you.

200
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,587
Sorry, sir.

201
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,466
If that's the case,
he won't just be after me.

202
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,677
You'll be targeted too.

203
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,224
I don't want you to get any more involved.

204
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,604
What can I do, sir?

205
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,152
Be careful.

206
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:23,909
[sinister music continues]

207
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,999
- [music ends]
- Tell the guests to go to their seats.

208
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,376
The program is about to start, okay?

209
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,466
[panicked breathing]

210
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:43,846
[unsettling music playing]

211

- [inhales deeply]
- [phone beeps]

212
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,069
[sniffles]

213
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,696
Tomas got disconnected.

214
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,449
Damn it, he hung up?

215
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,742
[Tomas sniffles]

216
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:10,414
[unsettling music continues]

217
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,834
[phone buzzes]

218
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:29,016
[unsettling music continues]

219
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,977
Call him again.

220
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:37,733
[suspenseful music playing]

221
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,904
[phone buzzing]

222
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,827
[Diego] <i>Why did you hang up, Tomas?</i>

223
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,664
Are you messing with me?

224
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,960
I-I didn't hang up.
It just got disconnected.

225
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,461
<i>Don't lie.</i>

226
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:07,346
[sniffles, breathes heavily]

227
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:12,851
[suspenseful music continues]

228
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,524
- [Lisa sighs]
- [Gab] Hey!

229
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,067
You're Lisa, right?

230
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,658
Are you okay?

231
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:33,998
[suspenseful music continues]

232
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,256
Hey.

233
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:53,601
[suspenseful music continues]

234
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,065
[suspenseful music crescendos]

235
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,320
- [Rolando grunting]

[panting]

240
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,997
Hey!

241
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,750
Hey, you bastards!

242
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,794
Let me go!

243
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,713
[grunts, groans]

244
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,298
Let me go!

245
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,425
You bastards!

246
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,470
[unsettling music continues]

247
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,014
- Who are you?
- Shh.

248
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,307
What do you want from me?

249
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,184
Who are you?!

250
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,186
You should fight fair!

251
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,812
You bastard!

252
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,858
You think I'm scared of that?

253
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,234
I'm not scared of that, bastard!

254
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,820
- [man laughs]
- Go on! Stab me!

255
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,614
Kill me! Do it!

256
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,074
- Shut up!
- Aah!

257
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,827
- [Rolando groans]
- [man laughs]

258
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:58,707
- Shh!
- [Rolando groans]

259
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,877
[groaning continues]

260
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:06,507
You won't die as long
as Tomas does as he's told.

261
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,217
- Don't hurt Tomas.
- [man] Shh.

262
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,803
- [Rolando groans]
- Shh!

263
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,430
[Rolando] You bastard! Don't hurt him!

264
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,557
- [man laughs]
- [unsettling music builds]

265
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,809
Moron!

266
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,560

[Diego] <i>Didn't I tell you…</i>

272
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,712
not to do anything I don't like, Tomas?

273
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,925
<i>Do you think I don't</i>
<i>know what you're doing?</i>

274
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,177
Wait, I didn't do anything.

275
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,307
I'm not playing with you, Tomas.

276
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01,145
[foreboding music continues]

277
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,397
[Diego] I know you're in the ballroom.

278
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,359
<i>In front of you…</i>

279
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,989
<i>is a woman wearing a floral green dress.</i>

280
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:17,369
[foreboding music continues]

281
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,542
<i>You're holding a phone,</i>

282
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,712
<i>and your right hand is in your pocket.</i>

283
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:33,594
[foreboding music continues]

284
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,929
We're watching you, Tomas Guerrero.

285
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,647
Excuse me.

286
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:52,696
[foreboding music continues]

287
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,205
[chattering indistinctly]

288
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,708
I got eyes on the subject.

289
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:12,382
[foreboding music continues]

290
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,479
Are you testing me, Tomas?

291
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,109
That lady in red…

292
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:35,656
[foreboding music continues]

293
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,583
<i>She's still young, right?</i>

294
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,420
<i>She's only 30 years old.</i>

295
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:55,592
[foreboding music continues]

296
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,554
I'm going to kill
her because of what you did.

297
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,352
Wait. [breathes heavily]

298
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,229
I said look at her!

299
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,567

Sir… Sir…

302
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,913
[host] Good morning, everyone.

303
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,248
How are you?

304
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,877
I am so glad to see
each and everyone here today.

305
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,381
Welcome to the Annual
Rosales Foundation Charity Ball!

Help me…

310
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:15,297
[music turns suspenseful]

311
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:24,473
[breathing heavily]

312
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,480
Ma'am?

313
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,399
What happened? Okay, calm down everyone!

314
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,151
Give her some space!

315
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,403
- [Gab] Space, please!
- Excuse me.

316
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,738
[Gab] Ma'am?

317
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,864
What happened? Is she okay?

318
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,324
[woman breathes heavily]

319
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,159
[Gab] Ma'am, we're here.

320
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,661
Shit.

321
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,579
Is there a doctor here?!

[suspenseful music crescendos]

323
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,293
[Gab] Ushers, take care of the guests!

[suspenseful music resumes]

326
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,385
- Can we take a picture?
- Sure.

327
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,804
[Gab] Give her some space, please!

328
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,683
Space, space!
Ushers, take care of the guests, please!

329
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,519
Is there a doctor here?

330
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,021
- Hey, help her.
- [Gab] Doctor, please!

331
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,691
- Let's help her.
- We need to keep you safe.

338
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,174
<i>I'm guessing you'll take</i>
<i>me seriously now, Tomas.</i>

339
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,635
<i>Just do as I say.</i>

340
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,220
<i>It's not that hard, right?</i>
