What happened? Are you okay?

186

Yes.

187
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,129

Hi, guys.

192
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,934
[Gab] Did you miss me?

193
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:02,935
What?

194
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,312
I said, did you miss me?

195
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,396
No.

197
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,536
Team.

198
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,917
It's good to see all of you.

199
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,004
We have a new contract.

[ominous music playing]

201
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,717
The mission is about…

202
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,011
the cult leader, Rema Muñoz.

203
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:43,100
[ominous music continues playing]

204

He's holding the staff members
and guests

205

of La Vida Royale Hotel
as hostages.

206
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,611
Our job is to secure
the hostages.

207
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,407
And then…

208
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,909
eliminate Muñoz.

Can I ride with you guys?

218
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,711
Why?

219
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,130
Can you just let me come
with you?

220
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,131
Go to the other car.

221
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,715
We're good here, Tomas.

222
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,633
Are you sure?

223
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,301
- Yeah, it's full here.
- Go.

224
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,220
There's still space.

Max, did you get it?

I'm not sure yet, but I'll try.

238
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,892
We need to unlock
this hard drive.

239

00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,897

They won't leave us alone.

They almost wiped out
the whole group

249
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,016
just to get that hard drive.

250
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,601
Let them try.

251
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,522
Once they unlock the hard drive,

252
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,982
we'll know where they are.

253
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,318
We will find them,

254
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,612

How?

266
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,193
The hard drive has a tracker.

267
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,154
The moment I cracked it,
it sent our location to them.

[suspenseful music playing]

269

Where's Clover's phone?

That's where the notification
would've been sent.

There's nothing we can do now.

No, sir.
We just found him now.

00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,608
you couldn't handle
just three people?!

347
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,111
They were highly trained.

the location pin was sent.

371
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,645
We left almost nothing standing
when we hit that safe house--

372
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,813
We don't know that.

373
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,609
Max…

374
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,487
can we just focus
on the mission for now?

375
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,701
- Huh?
- [hammering]

376
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,495
So?
Are we telling the Contractor?

377
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,914
- No.
- No.

378
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:12,419
[pensive music playing]

379
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,428
<i>Guys, I think we left</i>
<i>the med kit in the van.</i>

380
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,013
<i>Can you be professional?</i>

381
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:23,931
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- It's right there.</i>

382
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,098
<i>Focus on the contract first.</i>

383
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,558
<i>Maybe you should</i>
<i>use your damn eyes--</i>

384
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,517
<i>Oh. </i>[giggles]

385
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,937
<i>Are you guys talking about me?</i>

386
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,480
<i>No, tell me the truth.</i>

387
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,899
<i>Here's the blueprint</i>
<i>of the hotel.</i>

388
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,818
<i>Our mission objective is</i>
<i>to secure all the hostages.</i>

389
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,612
<i>- I'll wait for Abel.</i>
<i>- Grandma, please.</i>

390
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,280
<i>Oh, Abel's back.</i>

391
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,700
<i>Every enemy you have…</i>
<i>is an enemy of God.</i>
