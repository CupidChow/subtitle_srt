1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,127
Their masterlist.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,628
That is now the contract.

3
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:07,215
Our goal is to cleanse
the military and the government.

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,427
And that hard drive
can be a huge help with that.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,303
His name is Jun. He's my brother.

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,722
He's one of the kids you sold.

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,723
Where did you get that?

8
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,934
I took a good look at the guy
with Ma'am Isabel earlier.

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,019
Isn't that him?

10
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,229
He's one of the guys
who stole the hard drive.

11
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,398
Auntie played us!

12
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,316
Where is the hard drive?

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,236
If you don't want us all to die…

14
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,904
give it to me now!

15
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,323
If you have the masterlist bring it to me.

16
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,702
Or else you lose your chance
to find your brother.

17
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,204
Andres, you can't give her
that hard drive.

18
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,291
There's no other way
for me to find my brother.

19
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:51,509
[theme music playing]

20
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,384
She wants the hard drive…

21
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,596
in exchange for information
about my brother.

22
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,724
Andres, you can't give her
that hard drive.

23
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,311
[tense music continues]

24
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,687
[breathes deeply]

25
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,484
Three days.

26
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,904
That's all I need. Just give me that.

27
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,115
After that…

28
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,284
we'll turn the hard drive over
to the contractor.

29
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,871
[sighs deeply]

30
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,498
JB.

31
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,586
I'm this close to finding out
what happened to my brother.

32
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:13,508
[tense music continues]

33
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,010
What if we just tell
the contractor everything?

34
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,721
No way. What if he doesn't agree?

35
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,015
I can't lose that hard drive.

36
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,604
I'll make sure Isabel
doesn't get her hands on it.

37
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,981
What's your plan?

38
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,317
Don't tell me you're going
to double-cross Isabel Escalera?

39
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:39,117
All she needs are
the files to track down Jun.

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,118
That's it.

41
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,912
Andres, how can you be sure
she won't screw you over?

42
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,583
That won't happen. I won't let it.

43
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:51,254
[tense music continues]

44
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,380
Three days.

45
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,593
Three days, Andres.

46
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,013
That hard drive cannot go missing.

47
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,223
If it ends up in someone else's hands,

48
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,100
we're all in trouble.

49
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,810
Including your family.

50
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:13,234
[tense music continues]

51
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,402
Three days.

52
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,905
Then we'll surrender it.

53
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,782
I already signed the contract.

54
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,579
I understand.

55
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,999
Now, there's nothing I can do

56
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,501
but delay everything I know.

57
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,714
Make sure you don't mess up.

58
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,299
I won't.

59
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,891
The contractor will tell you
all the details.

60
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,394
It's up to you if you want
to take the new contract.

61
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,606
Alright.

62
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:58,696

[tense music swells, crescendos]

66
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,718
[Luis] Grandma, why are you so quiet?

67
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,097
I was just thinking…

68
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,809
Now that Emil's gone…

69
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,898
it's like a sword's been
pulled out of my chest.

70
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,317
Really? A sword?

71
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,486
Grandma, isn't it just a thorn?

72
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:45,201
That's how heavy of a blow they dealt me.

73
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:50,331
[pensive music playing]

74
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,791
But there's…

75
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,173
still one thorn I can't pull out.

76
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,596
It's Jun.

77
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,603
[pensive music continues]

78
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,689
[Esang] Sometimes I'm scared…

79
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,320
I'll die without ever seeing him again.

[JB] Why aren't you asleep yet?

85
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,109
Dad.

86
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,155
About what happened last night.

87
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,533
[ominous music playing]

88
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,993
At my age,

89
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,580
there's nothing left to fear.

90
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,001
I've long outgrown my worries
about the Escaleras.

91
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,297
Yes. My name was there,

92
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,301
to protect innocent people.

93
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,305
As a soldier,

94
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,683
there were missions I couldn't finish.

95
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,521
But what matters son,

96
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,819
is you do what you think is right.

97

- [Christine] Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,090
Alright, thank you.

101
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,716
Christine.

102

[huffs]

103
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,971
What are you doing here again?

[sombre music playing]

105
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,809
I just want to see Mickey.

106
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,978
Leave us alone, Miguel!

107
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,982
Is that what you want, huh?

108
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,819
Christine, you want me
to end up in jail.

109
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,197
That's why you turned me in
to the cops, isn't it?

110
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,533
[dramatic music sting]

111
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,034
Ma'am, do you know anyone

112
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,911
who could've done this to the victim?

113
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,499
My ex-husband.

114
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,419
[Christine] They got into
a fight the other day.

115

- [grunts]
- [blow lands]

116
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,006
He even threatened to kill Jake.

117
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,717
- I'll kill you!
- Get out of here!

118
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,218
[officer] What's his name?

119
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,511
[Christine] Miguel Tecson.

120

Christine.

121
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,725
You threatened Jake in front of me!

122
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,602
What do you expect me to think?!

123
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,521
I'm still Mickey's father.

124
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,482
He needs me.

125
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,317
You know that.

126
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,027
And I need him, too.

127
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,612
Please.

128
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,197
What?

129
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,408
Do you think it's easy for me?

130
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,786
I want someone to be
held accountable, Miguel!

131
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,498
Christine, come on. Please.

132
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,209
Papa! Mama!

133
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,336
I'm scared!

134
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,712
Don't be scared.

135
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,088
Papa's here.

136
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,715
You'll be fine.

He fell asleep already.

Um…

144
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,515
I'll go now.

145
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,393
See you.

How are you?

149
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,992
I'm alright.

150
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,079
How's the search for your brother going?

151
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,417
I'm still looking, sir.

152
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,586
Do you have a lead?

[suspenseful music playing]

154
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,090
Sort of.

155
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,845
I was wondering…

[suspenseful music continues]

157
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,185
Did Timor mention
anything about a masterlist?

158
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,401
[clears throat] What kind of masterlist?

159
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,781
A masterlist of all their activities.

160
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,869
I wouldn't be surprised
if human trafficking was on it.

161
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,499
Your brother may be on the list, too.

[suspenseful music intensifies]

163
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,379
That's true.

Look.

165
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,718
I've been offered a contract.

166
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,305
The job is to retrieve a hard drive.

167
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,891
It contains the Escalera's masterlist.

168
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,103
Now,

169
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,982
if you take part in this contract,

170
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,818
you know how it goes.

171

Don’t let personal feelings
interfere with the mission.

172
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,616
I know, sir.

173
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,285
Exactly.

174
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,622
The mission always comes first.

When the time comes,

182
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,301
are you willing to surrender
something you hold dear?

Andres, this won't be easy for you.

186
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,115
Be honest with me.

187
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,909
Are you in?

188
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:31,333

[exhales loudly]

192
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,718
Coffee.

193
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,223
What's that?

194
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,266
Um…

195
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,767
Peace offering.

196
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,186
Of course.

197
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,146
Just try it. It's good--

198
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,024
I don't know. It's like…
It seems to lack water.

199
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,527
Too much sugar and a lack of cream.

200
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,656
Oh, sorry. Was I too nosy?

201
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,701
Come on. I haven't made
coffee in a while.

202
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,119
So don't make it anymore.

203
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,706
[cup thuds]

204
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,999
So…

205
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,501
- are you still mad at me?
- What's this? Huh?

206
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,419
Why are you getting close to me? Huh?

207
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,504
What's this?

208
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,881
You're still mad. Okay.

209
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,716
Coffee-that.

210
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,385
[laughing]

211
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:25,971
[exhales]

212
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,473
Hey.

213
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,807
- Migs, what's up?
- What's up?

214
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,726
Are JB and Andres not back yet?

215
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,187
- [Gab] Hi, Miguel.
- Let's wait for them. Hey.

216
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,147
- [Miguel] Bangs is here.
- Bangs!

217
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,733
- How are you?
- I'm okay. You?

218
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,109
[Tomas] Where did those guys go?

219
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,820
- You okay, Max?
- Bangs on point, ay!

220
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,114
[Tomas laughing]

221
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,116
- Where's Sir JB?
- There.

222
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,743
- Oh! There he is.
- [Miguel] Sir.

223
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,869
- Only Andres is missing.
- [Gab] Hi, JB.

224
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,995
We're almost complete.

225
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,539
- JB!
- Right?

226
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,207
The question is…

227
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,460
Did he accept the contract?

228
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,922
Why wouldn't he?
Isn't this about the Escaleras?

229
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,132
If I were him, I would have
been here earlier.

230
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:08,097
[unsettling music playing]

231
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,015
Is he coming?

232
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,311
I don't know.

[thudding]

235
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,490
Boss, someone left this outside.

236
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,159
- Who's it from?
- It doesn't say.

237
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,036
Idiots!

238
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,455
Why did you accept it?
What if there's a bomb inside?

239
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,832
Go check it out!

240
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,001
Go on. Open it.

241
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,713

[suspenseful music continues]

- [Tomas] Hey, sir.
- [Miguel] Sir.

249
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,114
[Max] Sir.

[Greg clears throat]

251
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,992
This is awkward, isn't it?

252
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,829
[Gab] Hey.

253
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,916
There. We have complete
attendance. I'm ready.

254
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,710
Team… Briefing room. Now.

255
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,090
We need to call Auntie Isabel.

256
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,636
She has to let them know that
we still have the hard drive.

257
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,931
Or… Or else…

258
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,891
[sinister music playing]

259
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,684
They're going to kill us.

260

[breathing heavily]

261
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,023
All of our lives depend on Auntie Isabel!

262
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,692
Go on! Get that out of here!

263
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,069
Disgusting!

[music crescendos]

267
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,295
As you all know,

268
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,508
our contract is to secure
the Escalera's hard drive,

269
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,968
which contains intel

270
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,971
about important persons of interest.

271
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:19,520

[computer whirring]

273
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,526
This intel is important for
our government to secure

274
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,987
so they can cleanse of corrupt people.

275
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:33,784
[ominous music fades]

276
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,704
Sir.

277
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,331
Who is the contract from?

278
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,876
It was commissioned by General Novilla.

279
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,670
Priority Level Three.

280
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,464
How long, sir?

281
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,342
We're going to use multiple strategies

282
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,053
to make sure we obtain that hard drive.

283
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:59,393
[ominous music continues]

284
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,312
Sir, uh, where are we stealing it from?

285
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,404
Three people broke into
the Escalera's safehouse.

286
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:17,411
[music becomes suspenseful]

287
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,706
This is the Escalera's safehouse.

288
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,208
It's in an isolated area.

289
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,588
Sir, with how many enemies
the Escaleras have,

290
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,467
how are we supposed to know who
among them are the three thieves?

291
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,684
Tracers.

292
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,567
I'm sure they left something
behind in that safehouse.

293
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,735
Really?

294
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,197
That's why I want to go to the safehouse.

295
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,950
So that we can look it over
with our own eyes.

296
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,619
JB, what do you think?

297
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,332
I think…

298
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,335
the Escaleras will have already
wiped all the evidence clean

299
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,503
in their safehouse.

300
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:12,007
[suspenseful music continues]

301
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,258
It might be too late.

302
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,557
But the thieves might not
have done the same.

303
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,019
I still think it's a good idea.

304
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,857
Let's go there, scout the area,
and see what we can find.

305
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:36,323
[suspenseful music continues]

306
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,495
Sir, what about Diamond Escalera.

307
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,873
Did you find out why he was at the hotel?

308
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,126
Hotel?

309
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,838
- Yeah.
- You mean La Vida Royale Hotel?

310
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,339
What were they doing there?

311
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,260
We're missing something.

312
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,595
But don't worry.

313
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,682
Eventually, we will find out why.

314
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,394
Max.

315
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,481
Trace Diamond's whereabouts.

316
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,316
Yes, sir.

317
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:19,199
[suspenseful music continues]

318
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:38,010
[suspenseful music intensifies]

319
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,723
Are we really going tobetray
the Contractor?

320
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,308
Max, how do you do that?

321
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,934
Only three people
seemed to have been involved.

322
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,437
His reason was personal.
He's looking for information.

323
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,314
Or he's covering for somebody.

324
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,316
I only need three days.

325
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,734
I need to get to Isabel.

326
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,110
Go to Isabel next time.

327
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,528
She might suddenlybetray you.

328
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,905
Did you bring what I'm looking for?

329
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,908
[rock music playing]

330
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,034
JB, where are you?

331
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,828
We're heading to Isabel
Escalera'scondo right now.
