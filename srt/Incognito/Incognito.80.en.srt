187
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,373
[ominous music fades]

188
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,335
[footsteps approaching]

189
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,212
When can we move?

190
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,215
We need to wait out the snowstorm

191
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,133
so the chopper can land at the exit point.

192
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,385
But we need to move fast

193
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,347
'cause at any moment,
someone could come for the target.

194
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,057
[JB sighs]

195
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,194
[knocking]

196

197
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,405
[Tomas huffs]

198
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,490
- Sir.
- Tomas.

199
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,909
How are you?

200
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,327
[Tomas exhales sharply]

201
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,204
I'm okay, sir. I'm still alive.

202
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,583
We'll leave in a few hours.

203
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,294
You can get proper treatment then.

204
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,379
Get some rest.

205
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,217
Okay, sir. Thank you.

206
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,594
- [JB] Alright.
- I want to ask something.

207
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,850
About what happened earlier.

208
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,980
Was that just cramps, sir?

209
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,153
Because I don't think so.

210
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,406
The same happened on the mountain.

211
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,539
Are you okay, sir?

212
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,166
- Are you sick?
- I'm fine, Tomas.

213
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,336
I'm fine.

214
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,966
[pensive music playing]

215
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,050
I'll go now.

216
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,554
Sir, um…

217
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,683
Don't worry, sir.

218
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,021
Whatever it is, it will stay between us.

219
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,401
And sir… [clears throat]

220
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,903
Thank you.

221
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,114
You were having a hard time,

222
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,657
but you didn't abandon me.

223
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:14,622
[pensive music continues]

224
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,457
You did the same for me.

225
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,417
Thank you.

226
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,257
- Go get some rest.
- Thank you, sir.

227
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,511
[pensive music continues]

228
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,348
[door slides]

229
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:41,815
[pensive music continues]

230
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,779
[pensive music fades]

231
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,994
[footsteps approaching]

232
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,270
I didn't kill him.

233
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,318
I was set up

234
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,572
They got me a contract because they said

235
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,534
someone will assassinate Senator Avila

236
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,369
to prevent him from running for president.

237
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,372
So, they asked me…

238
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,084
what I would do if it were me.

239
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,505
I helped them, but it turned
out to be a setup.

240
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:51,677
[unsettling music playing]

241
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,637
Someone else killed the senator.

242
00:16:55,931 --> 00:17:01,186
[unsettling music continues]

243
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,897
So, if you're taking
me back to the Philippines…

244
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,317
they will kill me.

245
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,280
[unsettling music continues]

246
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,491
Who do you think were the
people trying to kill me?

247
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,287
Who do you think hired them?

248
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:31,717
[unsettling music continues]

249
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,931
[unsettling music fades]

250
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,936
General Nocum, the package is secured.

251
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,523
We will leave the extraction
point in a few hours, weather permitting.

252
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,358
- That's good news, Greg.
- [unsettling music playing]

253
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,153
I'll inform General Mariano right away

254
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,739
and meet you when you arrive.

255
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,909
[unsettling music builds, fades]

256
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,747
Contractor.

257
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,876
Kenji has something to say.

258
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,093
[unsettling music playing]

259
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,137
They'll kill me if you take me
back to the Philippines.

260
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,099
What makes you say that?

261
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,977
Who hired you to capture me?

262
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,147
That's confidential.

263
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,982
It's General Nocum, right?

264
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,985
What did he say?

265
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,073
Why does he want me?

266
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:41,495
[unsettling music continues]

267
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,375
I did the job they gave me.

268
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,545
But what did I get in return?

269
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,215
They betrayed me.

270
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,885
[unsettling music builds]

271
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,012
Now they want me dead.

272
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:05,936
[unsettling music continues]

273
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,147
They made you believe all their lies.

274
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,232
[dramatic music sting]

275
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:17,990
[unsettling music intensifies]

276
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:28,792
[unsettling music continues to build]

277
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,049
<i>General Mariano,</i>
<i>how well do you know Nocum?</i>

278
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,135
<i>Are you sure he can be trusted?</i>

279
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,511
<i>What is this about, Greg?</i>

280
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,389
<i>Well, according to the target,</i>
<i>Nocum wants him dead.</i>

281
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,016
<i>I don't trust Kenji.</i>

282
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,893
<i>- He's highly trained.</i>
<i>- He wouldn't just surrender.</i>

283
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,769
<i>He was cornered, so he has no choice</i>

284
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,271
<i>but to cooperate with us.</i>

285
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,024
<i>I know the mission comes first,</i>

286
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,318
<i>but we both know there's</i>
<i>corruption in the government.</i>

287
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,403
<i>Are you saying you believe Kenji?</i>

288
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,031
<i>I'm just thinking that</i>
<i>it can happen to others</i>

289
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,533
<i>because it happened to my father.</i>

290
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,577
<i>The job order was to bring him home.</i>

291
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,829
<i>Any conspiracy regarding the matter</i>

292
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,247
<i>is beyond this job order.</i>

293
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,999
<i>What if he's telling the truth?</i>

294
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,959
<i>What if General Nocum is just using us?</i>

295
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,794
<i>It's like we became his tool to do bad.</i>

296
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,588
<i>We can't just believe what he says.</i>

297
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,882
<i>We don't know if he's telling the truth.</i>

298
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,303
<i>I once got in trouble</i>
<i>because of someone bad.</i>

299
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,056
<i>You know I hate being used.</i>
