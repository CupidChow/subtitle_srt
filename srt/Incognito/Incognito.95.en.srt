00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:27,355
You want to know what kind
of person adopted your brother,

00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,357
the people who have influence on him,

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,317
and the environment he grew up in.

35

- [Manuel] Mm-hmm.

What's good for you,

I just want what's best

Oh.

183
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,706
You look sad, all frowny. You good?

184
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,127
- I'm fine.
- Oh? Oh, really?

185
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,796
Alright. Hold on…

186
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,716
You're stressed again,
you'll end up even balder at this rate.

187
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,385
- You testing me?!
- Okay, okay. Chill…

188
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,221
Come on, I'm just joking.

189
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,430
It's my birthday, isn't it?

190
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:30,809
Bir--Birthday?
It's tomorrow! You're too early.

191
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,770
- Why not celebrate now?
- Wait, my hotdog!

192
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,272
- Are you coming?
- I can't.

193
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,107
I've got work.

194
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,276
But I'll try, I'll really try to come.

195
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,196
It's your 70th birthday.
Of course, I have to be there.

196
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,116
Remember, if you don't show up,
forget about…

197
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,826
Forget about what?

198
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,662
- The money I owe you.
- Wow, nice try!

199
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,955
- Huh?
- Yeah.

200
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,124
[muffled] Hey, that's not fair! Come on…

201
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,335
Make sure to bring Gab, okay?

202
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,923
I'm not even sure if they'll allow her.

203
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,342
- Why not?
- Not sure if she'll be allowed.

204
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,511
But you said you'd bring her?

205
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:10,224
I just want the whole
family there for my birthday.

206
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,518
You just want Gab and
me to treat you, don't you?

207
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,479
What do you want as a gift?
Just tell me already.

208
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,356
- What?
- What else? Obviously…

209
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,025
- [laughing]
- You already know what I want.

210
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,193
- Let's go?
- Alright.

211
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,278
Miss, keep the change.

212
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,446
- Let's go, let's go. Let's go.
- Okay, okay.
