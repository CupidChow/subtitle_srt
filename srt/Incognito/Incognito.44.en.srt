00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,627
If he was part of the DPA
like you mentioned,

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,422
he'll know lots about
the Escaleras' operations.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,007
You won't get anything from him.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,425
But I have to try.

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,136
Even I struggle to get close to him.

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,137
What more do you want?

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,099
The masterlist should never
see the light of day.

8
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,434
The Escaleras again?

9
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,602
You need to retrieve something from them.

10
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,020
Their masterlist.

11
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,605
That is now the contract.

12
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,108
Only three people
infiltrated the safe house.

13
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,110

15
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,324
They've opened it!

16
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,118
My brother's name was there.

17
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,203
It's pointing towards Isabel Escalera.

18
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,205
New contract.

19
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,124
A masterlist?

20
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,584
It's in a hard drive.

It's in a hard drive.

24
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,311
That masterlist contains…

25
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,814
all their contacts,

26
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,317
everyone involved
in their illegal activities.

27
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,113
So for us, it's not just an
ordinary mission.

28
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,532
As you know, it's all
about leverage and…

29
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,117
This kind of leverage…

30
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,496
This is the kind that can
bring down governments.

Ma'am, your deliveries are here.

47
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,510
Shall they bring them up?

48
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,430
Yes, please. I've been
waiting for them.

49
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,890

Let's go.

52

Wait, wait. There isn't
supposed to be five of you.

53
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,198
There is only four names listed here?

54
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,492
This one, sir, is with Ma'am Isabel.

55
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,830
Mister, don't you remember me?
I'm with Ma’am Isabel.

56

Ma'am Isabel just moved here recently.

57
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,419
Oh, right. Anyway,
she's waiting for me upstairs.

58
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,838
I just started my shift. Okay.

59
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,632

Oh, my son's painting.
Please be careful with that.

78
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,980
Slowly now.

Your brother, who never
cared for you and is so selfish.

00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,125
Wow, imagine that.

91
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,627
You should've slapped
some money on that…

money-hungry brother of yours.

93
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,009
Remember that one time you went to him?

94
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,719
What did he do to you?

95
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,931
You know, you're comfortable
living under my roof.

96
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,726
Why did you even ask him
for help in the first place?

97
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,812
I don't know.
It just slipped out of my mouth.

98
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,606
I guess I got nervous.

99
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,736
I don't know why you're still
keeping tabs on that guy.

100
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,072
He assumes you're just after his money.

101

Good thing Attorney
gave him a piece of her mind.

102

Uncle, can you stop defending that woman?

103
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,206
She's in the wrong, isn't she?

104
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,334
She shouldn't be meddling
in someone else's family.

105
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,336
You're really something else.

106
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,713
She's helping you,
yet you're still picking a fight with her.

107

Uncle… Uncle, I'm not fighting with her.

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,636
I'm just saying she shouldn't
be meddling, right?

109
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,304
Ouch, Uncle! What was that for?!

110

It's like you're a fool.

111
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,893
Maybe it'll knock some
sense into you, you fool.

You're such an idiot.

- Yes! Yeah.

even if she’s not your type,

Uh…

119
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,291
Now, you're making me feel guilty.

Fine, I'll apologize and
make it up to her.

court a girl anymore.

about the new contract?

Yes, why?

128
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,483

of the mission?

187
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,490
We'll get the hard drive.

188
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,118
Then we'll surrender it
to the authorities.

189
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,621
That's what we should do.

190
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,705
Yeah.

191
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,914
I know, Max.

192
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,126
[breathes deeply]

193
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,003
But what about your father?

194
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,379
His name is on the list.

195
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,715
Max…

196
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,011
He was part of a
covert operations back then.

197
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,013
I believe him.

198
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,306
But what if he's lying?

199
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,977
[suspenseful music playing]

200
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,896
I believe him, Max.

201
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,691
[sighs deeply]

202
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,278
But, JB, not everyone
will believe your father.

203
00:10:54,904 --> 00:11:01,786
[suspenseful music continues]

204
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,921
[uneasy music playing]

205
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,089
His name is Jun.

206
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,591
He's my brother.

207
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,388
He disappeared on October 4, 2004.

208
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,890
He's part of Batch 2004.

209
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,184
From Bugias.

210
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,397
He's one of the kids you sold.

211
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,233
- Sold?
- It's there.

212
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:38,322
[uneasy music continues]

213
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,698
Where did you get that?

214
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,617
It doesn't matter.

215
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,288
You come in here

216
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,708
accusing me of something.

217
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,379
Who are you?

218
00:11:55,423 --> 00:12:00,428
[music turns suspenseful]

219
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,221
You know my family.

220
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,180
You know me.

221
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,308
You know what my family…

222
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,102
- …is hiding.
- It doesn't matter, ma'am.

223
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,897
I just want to find my brother.

224
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,902
I can't help you.

225
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,199
[music fades]

226
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,246
[pensive music playing]

227
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,122
Sir.

228
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,916
Miguel.

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,084
Have a seat.

230
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,378
Orange juice, please.

231
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,006
[Miguel sighs deeply]

232
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,215
How are you, Miguel?

233
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,428
I'm good, sir.

234
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,679
As I've said,

235
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,724
I need to constantly
get contracts from you,

236
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,100
if possible.

237
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,810
That way,

238
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,563
I can take my mind off the feud
I have with Christine,

239
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,190
sir.

240
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,484
Have they found

241
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,111
the person who attacked the victim?

242
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,282
Sir, could we…

243
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,535
not talk about it?

244
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,996
He might haunt us. [chuckles]

245
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,208
I just want to make sure
that you can focus on the job.

246
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,796
Contractor, I told you.

247
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,882
I'm your soldier.

248
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,134
I'm focused.

249
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,219
I can do it.

250
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,180
Sir.

251
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,309
Are we going to discuss the contract now?

252
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,897
No, we'll do that another day.

253
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,815
Right now, there's something
I want to ask you.

254
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,401
What is it, sir?

255
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,490
Have you noticed anything amiss
in the past few days?

256
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,909
What do you mean?

257
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,205
Have you noticed anyone following you?

258
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:59,838
[uneasy music playing]

259
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:07,596
[line ringing]

260
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,233
We need to talk about the hard drive.

261
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,609
I'm on my way to your place.

262
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:31,287
[tense music playing]

263
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,927
Hmm… No, sir.

264
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,596
Why? What happened?

265
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,310
I saw the Escaleras
at La Vida Royale Hotel.

266
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,898
What were they doing there?

267
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,983
That's what I'm trying to find out.

268
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,987
Are you trying to say that…

269
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,990
we've been…

270
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,784
We've been compromised?

271
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,079
No, I don't think so.

272
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,500
I'm just trying to make sense of things.

273
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:29,303
[uneasy music continues]

274
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,600
- [line ringing]
- [Teddy] Lorena?

275
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,102
I can't find my phone. Where is it?

276
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,813
- [line ringing]
- Wait, I might've left it at-- Huh?

277
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,398
What?

278
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,608
- [line rings, disconnects]
- My phone--

279
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,610
What's wrong?

280
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,112
[Lorena whispering] It's our daughter.

281
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,200
[Teddy] Macaria, can you keep still?

282
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,702
You're making me dizzy. [Teddy chuckles]

283
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,498
It looks like she and JB had a fight.
That's why.

284
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,709
JB and I didn't fight.

285
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,214
You think I don't know you're
trying to push us together?

286
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,800
We're just friends.

287
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,011
Okay! [chuckles awkwardly]

288
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,513
Sorry.

289
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:19,228
Look, dear.
All we want is for you to move on.

290
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,689
There's nothing wrong with that.

291
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,233
Whether it's JB, someone else,

292
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,027
or something else helps you do that,

293
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,196
it really doesn't matter to us.

294
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,284
We just wish you'd finally
let Sevi rest in peace.

295
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:41,583
[morose music playing]

296
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,715
I'll be in my room.

297
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,217
Wait. [sighs deeply] Baby…

298
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,011
- Dear--
- Excuse me.

299
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,810
Sir, can I help you?

300
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,896
Is Aunt Isabelle upstairs?

301
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,856
Yes, sir.

302
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:08,736
[suspenseful music playing]

303
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,488
You just lost your son, didn't you?

304
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,995
You'd probably do anything
to get his life back.

305
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,790
My brother?

306
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,501
I don't know if he's still alive.

307
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,380
But there's still a chance
for us to get him back.

308
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,509
So, I'm begging you, ma'am.

309
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,596
Tell me where my brother is.

310
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,685
[suspenseful music continues]

[suspenseful music continues]

313
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,918
You expect me to remember
something from many years ago?

314
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,503
I can't remember.

315
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:19,598
[suspenseful music continues]

316
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,392
I know you're not a bad person.

317
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,687
Neither you or your son.

318
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,698
[doorbell chimes]

319
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,619
[doorbell chimes]

320
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,500
You better go.

00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,504
[doorbell chimes]

322
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,880
[Andres] Call me.

323
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,929
[suspenseful music continues]

324
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,806
[Diamond] Auntie!

325
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,017
We need to talk.

326
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:14,153
[suspenseful music intensifies]

[door rattling]

330
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,001
How dare you break
into my home, Diamond?!

331
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,836
Where's the hard drive?

332
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,630
You don't want all of us to die, do you?

333
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,090
Give it to me!

334
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,301
- Ma'am.
- I'll help you.

335
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,429
I'll probably remember more
about your brother

336
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,099
if we can access the records
in the masterlist.

337
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,312
You already got the information you need.

338
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,688
What's the problem this time?

339
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,899
- Andres!
- Emil?!

340
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,317
- Where's Andres? Tell me!
- Wait!

341
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,526
What are you doing here?!

342
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,028
- He's not here!
- Go away!

343
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:56,904
- Move!
- Ah!

344
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,905
Tell me where Andres is!

345
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,198
I'll go home now.
