[Tomas exhales sharply]

35
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,908
I got this. It's nothing I can't handle.

36
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,494
Although I almost died.

37
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,578
[Tomas huffs]

38
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,831
Okay, look.

39
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,041
The contract is to surrender the target

40
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,751
because he's a wanted fugitive.

41
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,712
But what if he's telling the truth?

[unsettling music playing]

00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,343

[unsettling music continues]

[Tomas sniffles]

46
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,227
What if General Nocum is just using us?

47
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,355
It's like we became his tool to do bad.

48
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,108
He didn't just use us. He manipulated us.

49
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,694
To think I almost died
because of this mission.

50
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:36,072
But what if he's telling lies
about General Nocum so we'll let him go?

51
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,662
We can't just believe what he says.

52
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,998
We don't know if he's telling the truth.

53
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,460
I'd rather just wait
for Contractor's decision.

54
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,088
I don't want to stress myself
thinking about it.

General Mariano.

60
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,280
Are you with General Nocum?

61
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,242
We haven't seen or spoken
to each other yet.

62
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,037
Any update on the contract he gave you?

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,497
[unsettling music continues]

64
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,749
It's done.

65
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,336
But, General Mariano…

66
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,965
I only trust you and General Novilla.

[unsettling music continues]

68
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,347
What is this about, Greg?

69
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,142
How well do you know General Nocum?

70
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,478
Are you sure he can be trusted?

71
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,316
Well, the truth is,

72
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,735
I trust you more, than him.

73
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,072
[music turns sinister]

74
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,949
Well, according to the target…

75
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,246
Nocum is involved in the crime
being pinned on him.

76
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,084
He said that Nocum wants him dead.

77
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,670
[sighs sharply]

78
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,755
You know me, Greg.

<i>I won't tolerate corruption in our ranks.</i>

80
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,096
Leave Kenji Lee to me.

81
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:27,558
I'll make sure that justice
and truth will prevail.

82
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,523
I'll hold you to that, General.

83
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,735
I once got in trouble
because of someone bad.

84
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,032
You know I hate being used.

Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

104
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,629
- Everything is okay.
- [Mickey] Are you sure?

00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,547
Papa?

106
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,299
Yes. Yes, son.

It's all over now. Everything is okay.

110

So…

111
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,602
should I drive you to the airport now?

112
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:58,107
Papa, can the three of us
eat together first?

113
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,567
I'm hungry.

115
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,488
Sure.

He's just trying to get into our heads.

127
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,166
We were also trained to do that.

[breathes deeply]

129
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,382
I don't trust that Kenji.

130
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,261
You saw how he fought, right?

131
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,846
[foreboding music playing]

132
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,013
He's highly trained.

133
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,015
Elite.

134
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,143
Yes, he's slick as ice.

135
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,855
But he suddenly surrendered.

136
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,231
He was cornered.

137
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,609
So, he had no choice but to follow us.

138
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,694
I don't know.

139
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,779
How about you, Max?

140
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,322
If you got cornered…

141
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,700
and you know they would kill you,

142
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,868
what would you do?

143
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,287
I would fight…

144
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,371
- until death.
- Yeah.

145
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,956
Exactly.

146
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,792
But the job order was to bring him home.

147
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,004
And any conspiracy regarding the matter…

148
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,548
is beyond this job order.

Hey you…

152
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,564
Be a good boy there, okay?

153
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,815
Don't be naughty.

154
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,985
- Alright?
- Yes, Papa!

155
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,487
And don't worry,

156
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,657
I'll take care of Mama
because I'm a big boy now.

158

Good.

159
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,664
Thank you, son.

160
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,374
You have to eat a bunch.

161
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,002
And drink lots of water.

162
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,712
Sleep early.

163
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,465
So when Papa visits you there,

164
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,969
you'll be tall, strong, and healthy.

165
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,804
And brave.

166
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,723
Just like you, Papa.

167
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,308
A brave soldier.

[chuckling]

169
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,394
I love you, son.

170
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,105
- I love you too, Papa.
- Mm… [smooches]

[pensive music playing]

172
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,070
You should be a good boy, too.

173
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,364
Huh? [chuckling]

174
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,615
Of course.

175
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,283
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

176
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,952
Eat up.

177
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,495
- Thanks.
- Dig in, Mickey.

178
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,621
- Thank you.
- Sit down now.

[Mickey] Okay.

182
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,587
Show me how brave soldiers eat.

183
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,922
Brave and strong.

184
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,967
[Christine] Oh, wow.

[exhales sharply]

187
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,023
Be careful there.

188
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,652
You, Christine…

189
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,322
Take care of yourself.

190
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,241
Alright?

191
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,160
You're right, Miguel.

192
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,789
I did a lot of wrong things, too.

193
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,210
And I'm really sorry
that I deprived you of Mickey.

194
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,423
I'm sorry if I became your enemy.

195

[pensive music continues]

196
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,682
You're not my enemy, Christine.

197
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,687
I just said that because…

198
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:10,401
[pensive music continues]

199
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,861
…because I was hurt.

200
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,365
But, Mickey…

201
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,536
and you.

202
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,788
You two…

203
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,293
you are the ones I fought for.

204
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,337

[pensive music continues]

206
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,762
Be careful.

207
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,812
I will.

208
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:52,234
[pensive music continues]

209
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,988
Let's go. You can't be late.

210
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,823
- Let's go.
- Come on.

211
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,451
[Miguel exhales loudly]

212
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,497
[Christine] Let's go, baby.

213
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,666
Careful.

214
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:12,171

00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:37,405
[Gab] Stop moving around.

220
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,825
Here.

221
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,703
It's tea. Warm yourself up.

222
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,455
Thank you.

223
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,209
You didn't have to.

I'm saying this, but…

226
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,389
I miss the scorching weather
back in Recto.

227
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,307
I can't stay here any longer.

228
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,271
Didn't you say let it go, let it snow…
What was that again?

229
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,065
I have no one to cuddle with.

230
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:15,985
Tch.

231
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,490
[Tomas chuckles]

232
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,245
- Yuck.
- [Tomas] Why?

233
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,455
What do you mean yuck?

234
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,707
- What's with that?
- What?

235
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,334
- Why are you smiling?
- Well…

236
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,336
I'm just happy

237
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,882
because finally we agreed
on something for once.

238
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,884
You didn't criticize
my opinion about Kenji.

239
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,261
That's an improvement.

240
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,554
Huh?

241
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,181
Yeah.

242
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,726
It doesn't mean anything.

243
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,019
- I didn't say--
- Look.

244
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,313
We just coincidentally
had the same opinion.

245
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,440
I didn't say anything.

- [Gab] Stop it.

248
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,155
- What?
- Cut it out.

249
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,240
- Why?
- You're gross.

250
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,159
- I just--
- We're under contract.

251
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,577
We're still working.

252
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,205
Okay. Then after the contract?

253
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,582
[chuckles]

254
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,710
Kidding aside, I'm just glad

255
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,046
that your personality's
not that hopeless after all.

256
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,797
Um, what?

257
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,843
I mean, I'm glad we can still get along.

[Gab scoffs]

259
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,347
High-five.

It hurts!

[Greg] JB.

267
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,330
We stick to the plan.

268
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,957
We'll deliver the package.

271
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,056
What's wrong?

272
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,104
I can't stop thinking
about what Kenji said.

273
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,567
Sir, I know the mission comes first.

274
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,445
But we also know there's
corruption in the government.

275
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,323
My father was also a victim.

276
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,577

00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,251
it could happen to others

280
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,129
since it also happened to my father.

[foreboding music continues]

282
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,469
Don't worry.
I'm taking necessary precautions.

283
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,306
We'll hand him over to General Mariano.

284
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,685
Prepare to move out.
We'll leave in 30 minutes.

327

It's probably about his dad.

Or maybe he had
a fight with his girlfriend.

my brother is gone.
