[Tomas chuckles]

189
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,151
The team requested permission
to secure the loot.

190
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,903
And I said yes.

191
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,363
Sir, we would've gotten more

192
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,573
if the people didn't
come after me and Sir JB.

193
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,200

[upbeat music playing]

195
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,828
Well, in that case…

196
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,373
Okay, you can keep it.

197
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,832
Aside from that,

198
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,543
you'll get your salary from the contract.

199
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,587
Alright! [chuckles]

200
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,506
- Thank you, sir.
- [Max] Thank you, sir.

201
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,673
Team…

202
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,217
Congratulations.

203
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,593
Mission accomplished.

204
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,470
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

205
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,638

[taps money]

209
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,402
We brought back 20 million, Tomas.

210
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,112
We get 10 million each.

211
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,697
Nice one, sir! [laughs]

212
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,699
Too bad, we could've gotten more money

213
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,284
if we were able to bring everything home.

214
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,162
But I'm not complaining!
I'm all good! Happy birthday to me!

215
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,039
Happy Christmas, Happy New Year,
Happy Feast Day.

216
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,875
Plus, my uncle won't
have to go to jail anymore.

217
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,254
Six, seven, eight.

218
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,548
- Eight. [exhales]
- A total of eight million.

219
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,551
[sighs sharply]

220
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,178
As promised, we'll split it equally.

221
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,347
We both get four million each.

222
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,766
[chuckles softly]

223
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,017

224
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,228
That was crazy.

227
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,819
[Miguel] 15 million.

228
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,280
So we get 7.5 million each, Andres.

229
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,073
Equal share, brother.

230
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,494

232
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,916
Nice one.

233
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,668
[Tomas] This is mine.

Three.

Hello, Uncle?

00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,005
Uncle!

249
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,300
I can't understand you.
Why are you whispering?

250
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,468
Hello, Unc--

251
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,096
Let's talk later. I'm on my way home.
I've got a surprise for you. Don't worry.

252
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,891
Your hair will finally grow back.

- Hey.
- Don't talk to me.

255
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,814
Hey, come here. Let's talk real quick.

256
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,942
What do you want? Hmm?

257
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,361
I noticed earlier, you don't seem happy

258
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,196
with the amount you got.

259
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,697
Don't worry.

260
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,033
I'll give you some.

261
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,910
- [bag unzipping]
- Wait, stay there.

262
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,329
Here, for you.

263
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,665
- You can keep it.
- [scoffs] Are you serious?

264
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,458
You really think I'll accept that money?

265
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,793
What's wrong with it?

266
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,295
I'm kindly giving you some of my share.

267
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,797
- I don't need it.
- You sure?

268
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,132
- Yeah.
- I'm just making it up to you.

269
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,884
Huh? You don't have to do that.

270
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,761
Besides, I don't need money.

271
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,513
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!

272
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,597
Fine.

273
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,644
Okay.

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,701
- Andres.
- Are you holding up okay?

280
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,704
Yeah, uh…

281
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,915
I'm just setting aside
some money for my son

282
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:41,630
from our haul and our
pay from the contract.

283
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,426
Is it still not enough?

284
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,762
I'm afraid so.

285
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,514
It's still not enough.

286
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,433
But it's fine.

287
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:56,270
I mean, I'll just figure it out.

288
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,485
About the…

289
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,655
That thing you did? What's your plan?

290
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,241
[Miguel sighs deeply]

291
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,077
Yeah, well…

292
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,248
I'm sorry I dumped that on you.

[somber music playing]

294
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,210
I'll take care of it, Andres.

295
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:21,962
Okay?

296
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,590
Don't worry about me.

297
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,008
I've got it covered.

298
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,012
Okay.

299
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,140
But if you need any help, I'm a call away.

300
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,434
Thank you, Andres.

301
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,311
Alright.

302
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,897
- Take care of your money.
- Yeah, I will.

303
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,482
- You too.
- Be careful.

304
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,652

Hey.

311
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,147
Looks like you're beat.

312
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,484
Yeah, we almost didn't have
time to rest at work.

313
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,862
Good thing you found time
to come home and rest.

314
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,824
- I'll get that.
- It's fine. I got it.

315
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,950
- Huh?
- I got it.

316
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,536
Wait, why don't you eat first?

317
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,246
Wow, that's my favorite.

318
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,455
- Yeah.
- Hold on.

319
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,166
I'll just put away my stuff.
I'll be right out.

Fifty million.

[JB] Just like we discussed.

323
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,446
This should be enough.

324
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,406
I'll do what I can with it.

Hey, man.

327
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:23,125
Do everything you can
to get my father out.

328
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,212
When have I ever let you down, buddy?

329
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,714
Leave it to me.

330
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,383
Once I slap their faces with this money,

331
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,886
they'll let your father go.

332
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,514
After all, money makes the mare go.

00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:24,932
[suspenseful music continues]

371
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:35,734
[breathes deeply]

372
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,659
[suspenseful music continues]

373
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,160
Twenty million.

374
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,330
For my son.

375
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,041
You bastards.

376
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,631
<i>Son, how are things outside?</i>

377
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,841
<i>I'll buy the house.</i>

378
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,177
<i>I already have a buyer.</i>
<i>I can't cancel the deal.</i>

379
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,680
<i>Am I talking to you?</i>
<i>You want money? Eat this.</i>

380
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,889
<i>I'm still in hiding.</i>

381
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,100
<i>I'll settle your debt</i>
<i>no matter how much it is.</i>

382
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,184
<i>Aah!</i>

383
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,270
<i>I'm planning to take Mickey to the UK.</i>

384
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,646
<i>We'll be staying there for good.</i>

385
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,022
<i>Be honest with me, Andres.</i>

386
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,857
<i>You disappear for days</i>

387
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,027
<i>and then come home covered</i>
<i>in bruises and wounds</i>

388
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,529
<i>hauling bags of cash.</i>

389
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,614
<i>What do you expect me to think?!</i>
