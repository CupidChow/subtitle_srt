00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,752
<i>Tomas, you're my ride-or-die.</i>

00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>I'm here because I chose to do this.</i>

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,507
<i>All I want is for you to be happy.</i>

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,883
<i>- Congratulations!</i>
- [clapping]

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,719
[Shari] <i>Oh my god! Kiss!</i>

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,179
[JB] <i>That's Manuel Aguinaldo.</i>

7
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,223
<i>- </i>[Max]<i> JB, the target is moving.</i>
<i>- Copy.</i>

8
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,266

[gunshots]

11
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,604
<i>We almost had him.</i>

12
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,982
- [gunshots]
- <i>Goddammit!</i>

13
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,192
<i>At least now,</i>
<i>we know that Manuel Aguinaldo's the key</i>

14
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,819
<i>that will lead us to El Cano.</i>

15
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,612
[Kenji] <i>We heard you were followed.</i>

16
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,656
<i>But let's not dwell on it anymore.</i>

17
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,408
<i>I want you all to remember</i>

18
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,828
<i>that our mission is bigger than all of us.</i>

19
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,204
<i>Let's focus on that.</i>

20
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,125
<i>Didn't I tell you you'd see him again?</i>

21
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,878
[chuckles gleefully] <i>My grandson, Jun!</i>

22

[Esang chuckles]

25
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,558
Oh, come in.

26
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,728
- Thank you, dear!
- You're welcome, Grandma.

27
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,854
[chuckles]

28
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,273
- Come on, let's go inside.
- Yeah, go in.

29
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,275
- [Esang] Come on.
- Okay.

30
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,111
- [soft music playing]
- [Esang chuckles gleefully]

31
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,863
- Come on in.
- [Andres] Go on.

32
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,032
[chuckles] Come in, come in.

33
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,575
Hey, look at this.

34
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,160
- Yeah.
- Look.

35
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:03,206
- You were so young here.
- [Esang chuckles]

36
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,415
This is our father.

37
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,459
That's Jethro.

38
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,128
Now you know who you take after.

39
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,879
[Esang, Andres chuckle]

40
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,006
[Andres] Grandma,
tell him about that picture.

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,301
Oh, that was when
you two were goofing around

42
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,304
and rolling down the hills.

43
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,266
- [Esang chuckles]
- You were so happy.

44
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:27,605
[soft music continues]

45
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,441
[Esang] Oh, right!

46
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,362
I have some chicken stew.

47
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,324
Isn't that your favorite, Junjun?

48
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,535
Uh, just call me Diego.

49
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,704
Diego?

50
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,834
He goes by Diego Aguinaldo now.

51
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,003
Oh, Diego.

52
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,256
Like the name of that brave hero?

53
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,342
- I like it!
- [Andres, Esang chuckle]

54
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,052
[Esang chuckles]

55
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,097
Oh, that's Luis.

56
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,308
We took him in.

57
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,476
He's Domeng's grandson.

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,729
Do you remember Domeng?

59
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,690
I don't remember anything.

60
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,900
[Esang] Oh.

61
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,027
All I remember is that I had a brother…

62
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,194
[Esang] Mm.

63
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,864
…and that I was wearing a bonnet.

64
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,616
Oh, that's the one!

65
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,160
Your brother Andres gave it to you.

66
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,579
So, you remember it. [chuckles]

67
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:29,375
I was waving to him,
and I disappeared after that.

68
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,502
- [Esang] I see.
- That's all I can remember.

69
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:38,593
[soft music continues]

70
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,470
Are you okay?

71
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,804
Okay.

72
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,015
Oh, sorry!

73
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,643
I'm really sorry.
I couldn't help staring at you

74
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,480
because… [chuckles gleefully]

75
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,732
I still can't believe

76
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,860
you're here in front of me now, Jun.

77
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,153
[Esang, Andres chuckle]

78
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,908
Grandma, what if Jun… I mean, Diego,

79
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,202
thinks that you're a crybaby?

80
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,536
Why? Am I crying?

81
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,039
Yeah, a bit. Let's cook now!

82
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,583
[Andres, Esang chuckle]

83
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,960
- You know what?
- What?

84
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,212
Why don't you get changed?

85
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,256
Let's eat out.

86
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,173
Alright!

87
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,591
Let's eat out.

88
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,426
- Let's go, Grandma.
- We'll go together.

89
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,679
- All of us?
- All of us.

90
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,472
- Yes, alright. Hold on.
- Come on.

91
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,556
- Don't leave.
- Yes.

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,892
He's not going anywhere. I'll tie him up.

93
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,018
- Me first!
- Sorry.

94
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,436
- You're too excited.
- [Esang chuckles]

95
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,855
- Just a second.
- Seriously, Grandma!

96
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,649
[door closes]

97
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:38,069
[soft music continues]

98
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,821
They're so happy, right?

99
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,660
Philip, we should be eating at our house

100
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,036
since my Tom is the groom.

101
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,747
Tom, you should've told me about this.

102
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,999
- [Tomas] Well--
- [Gab] Yeah.

103
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,418
I agree. We didn't really have to do this.

104
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,254
Why not?

105
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,965
I want to talk to Rolando more.

106
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,049
[Rolando] Yeah.

107
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,509
[Rolando] It's okay, Gab.

108
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,595
I have a magnetic personality,

109
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,598
lots of people want to be my friend.

110
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,309
[chuckles]

111
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,560
Let's eat up.

112
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,936
Let's not waste this blessing.

113
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,938
- Go ahead.
- [Tomas clears throat]

114
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:14,731
- Tom.
- Okay.

115
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,817
You want this, Uncle?

116
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,943
Yeah.

117
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:24,532
- [unsettling music playing]
- [utensils clanking]

118
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,757
- [Tomas clears throat]
- [utensils clanking]

119
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,425
Eat up, Hon.

120
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,802
Go on.

121
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,928
[Gab] Eat up.

122
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,389
[in low voice] What are you doing?

123
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,349
- Huh?
- Why are you so tense?

124
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,268
Huh? I'm not.

125
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,020
My dad is looking at you.

126
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,773
Remember, I still
haven't gotten my rest house.

127
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,317
Stop being so obvious.

128
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,611
- Okay?
- Yeah. Sorry.

129
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,820
I-I'm just not hungry.

130
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,364
You look like you're about to faint.

131
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,200
[unsettling music continues]

132
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,284
Okay.

133
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,453
[Tomas exhales]

134
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,913
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

135
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,999
- [glass clinking]
- [light-hearted music playing]

136
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,001
What's that? You want them to kiss?

137
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,546
[light-hearted music continues]

138
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,090
[Shari chuckles]

139
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,716
- No.
- [Rolando] They're shy.

140
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,927
No, no, it's okay. I understand.

141
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,762
I just wanted to say something.

142
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,891
I'm really so happy

143
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,103
because Tomas looks kind

144
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,730
and at least I know

145
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,985
that he'll be a good
brother-in-law to our baby.

146
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,570
Right, Love?

147
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,782
[Shari, Philip chuckle]

148
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,700
[Shari giggles]

149
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,495
- [Rolando clears throat]
- [Tomas sighs deeply]

150
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,496
Aren't you hungry, Dada?

151
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,706
- You haven't eaten.
- Yeah, we should eat.

152
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,834
- Eat up.
- Dig in, Uncle.

153
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,877
You don't get to eat here often.

154
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,297
- I haven't had this before.
- [Gab chuckles]

155
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,633
- There you go.
- Thank you.

156
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,219
- Do you want some egg?
- Sure, I'll have some.

157
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,971
[Gab] Don't be shy.

158
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,014
What do else you want? This one?

159
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,142
- [Rolando] Mm-hmm.
- There you go.

160
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,018
[utensils clinking]

161
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,645
Is this his first time here?

162
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,689
Why don't you ever bring
him to restaurants like this?

163
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,399
I don't know if he'll like the food.

164
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,485
[light-hearted music continues]

165
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,321
[Gab] Go ahead and eat, Dada.

166
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,448
[chuckles]

167
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,033
[light-hearted music fades]

168
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,996
Jun, do you remember our old house?

169
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,622
The one near the rice fields?

170
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,043
It was much colder there.

171
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,921
And we had the best views.

172
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,423
But…

173
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,009
the Manalastas took it from us.

174
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,219
When…

175
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,558
When they seized our land
in the mountains, a riot ensued.

176
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,312
That's when
your father was shot and killed.

177
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,986
But, Jun, you know what?

178
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:12,200
Until his last breath,
he was thinking of you.

179
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,330
His dying wish was for me to find you

180
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,333
and reclaim our land.

181
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,003
[patrons chatter indistinctly]

182
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,422
And now it's for sale.

183
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,217
- Mm-hmm.
- Worth 20 million.

184
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,052
[Esang huffs]

185
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,346
As much as we want to get it back,

186
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,516
we still need to save up.

187
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,392
[chuckling]

188
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,393
It's too expensive.

189
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,646
[chuckling]

190
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,814
That's a big amount.

191
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,193
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you do for a living?

192
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:51,656
[uneasy music playing]

193
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,243
Your brother…

194
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,746
does a lot of odd jobs here and there.

195
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,166
Whatever work I can find. I'm not picky.

196
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,670
But if you didn't know,

197
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,881
- your brother's pretty badass.
- Super.

198
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,508
He's a soldier.

199
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,717
[Andres scoffs]

200
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,219
You're a soldier?

201
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,763
I used to be.

202
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,516
I was discharged from service.

203
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,144
[Esang] Because he lost control

204
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,689
when he witnessed
how your father was killed.

205
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:29,860
[pensive music playing]

206
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,988
I was sent to jail, I got out…

207
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,574
And here I am.

208
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,242
This is me now.

209
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,493
Aw.

210
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,620
I'm sorry to hear that.

211
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,414
It's fine. It's all good.

212
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,417
- What about you, Jun?
- [Esang] Yeah.

213
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,586
Tell us about yourself. How have you been?

214
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:51,340
[uneasy music resumes]

215
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,178
[uneasy music fades]

216
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,764
What a waste.

217
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,391
You guys didn't finish your food.

218
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,851
Let's just take the leftovers home.

219
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,185
Sure.

220
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,729
Alright.

221
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,896
[Shari] Um…

222
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,440
I'll just go to the restroom.

223
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,983
Excuse me, you know how it is.

224
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,277
[Philip clears throat] I'll go with you.

225
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,361
Thank you.

226
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,741
[Rolando clears throat]

227
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,826
[footsteps receding]

228
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,994
[Rolando clears throat]

229
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,330
[Tomas clears throat]

230
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,418
- [Tomas sighs]
- Hey, I'm stuffed.

231
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,211
I'll just go outside to smoke.

232
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,172
Alright, sure.

233
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,465
[Rolando clears throat]

234
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,510
[Tomas exhales deeply]

235
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,222
[Tomas exhales loudly]

236
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,060
[Tomas huffs]

237
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,187
[Gab sighs exasperatedly]

238
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,563
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,816
This dinner wasn't part of the plan.

240
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,485
I don't know why this happened.

241
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,820
- [Gab exhales sharply]
- It's okay.

242
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,907
[Gab breathes loudly]

243
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,245
- Mm?
- We don't need to wear these.

244
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,623
Let's just wear them when Dad's around.

245
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,169
Yeah, it's a little too tight for me.

246
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,921
[chuckles softly]

247
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,923
[sighs deeply]

248
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,342
[tender music playing]

249
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,010
You did great earlier.

250
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:20,763
What do you mean?

251
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,060
I mean, you were so
convincing with your vows earlier.

252
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,855
[tender music continues]

253
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,315
They sounded real.

254
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,943
[chuckles]

255
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,403
You too.

256
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,238
- Yeah, right.
- You did great too.

257
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,448
- It felt real too.
- Huh?

258
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,617
- It's true.
- Really?

259
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,120
That was just an act. [chuckles]

260
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,916
[both sigh deeply]

261
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,418
[tender music fades]

262
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,921
When I got abducted…

263
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,007
It's a bit vague in my memory now.

264
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,176
- [Andres] Mm.
- All I know is…

265
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,512
Someone took me.

266
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,265
I was brought to different places.

267
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,308
I met so many people.

268
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,395
Until I was rescued.

269
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,273
[Diego] Someone took me in.

270
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,817
He gave me a good life.

271
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,196
His name is Manuel Aguinaldo.

272
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,782
- Ah…
- He's a good man.

273
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,828
- [unsettling music playing]
- He treated me like his own son.

274
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,583
When I was a kid,
I'd always have nightmares.

275
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:37,131
They say I used to sleepwalk
and end up in random places.

276
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,177
That's why Papa
could barely get any sleep.

277
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
He would just watch
over me the whole night.

278
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,726
He told me I couldn't go missing again.

279
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,231
Until eventually,
I started getting proper sleep.

280
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,901
I don't how it happened.

281
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,654
Maybe because
I want to be brave like my Papa.

282
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:05,618
And I want to take care
of him when he gets older.

283
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,749
He dressed me,
fed me, and sent me to school.

284
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,251
I owe him the life I have today.

285
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,005
Whoever Diego Aguinaldo is today.

286
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:23,135
[unsettling music continues]

287
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,096
[Esang acknowledges, sniffles]

288
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,723
[chuckles]

289
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,727
I'm happy for you, dear.

290
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,146
[Esang] Because…

291
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,564
[smacks lips]

292
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,901
You were--

293
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,028
- You were raised…
- [Andres] Mm.

294
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,281
…by someone
who loved you. [chuckles dryly]

295
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,659
[unsettling music continues]

296
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,202
Mm-hmm.

297
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,746
I hope we get to meet that person.

298
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:51,872
- [Esang] Right.
- Right?

299
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,917
- Mm-hmm.
- So we can thank him.

300
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,422
That can be arranged.

301
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,676
But I'm hoping we can take our time.

302
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,594
This is all new to me.

303
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,012
[Esang] Of course.

304
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,222
And the truth is,

305
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,724
my dad doesn't know about this meeting.

306
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,395
[unsettling music continues]

307
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,688
Sure.

308
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,023
We understand that.

309
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,985
Let's eat?

310
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,446
- Go on, keep eating.
- Eat as much as you like.

311
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,741
Help yourself. Those are all for you.

312
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,289
[unsettling music fades]

313
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,960
Look, don't worry. I've already spoken
to someone from the municipal hall.

314
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,506
They won't process
the registration of our marriage contract.

315
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,052
- So, we're not really married?
- Yep.

316
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,679
We're still free.

317
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,097
[Gab inhales deeply]

318
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,934
- [exhales deeply]
- Gab, um…

319
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,144
Are you happy right now?

320
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,898
Do you really have to ask, Tomas?

321
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:03,736
I mean, look at Dad.
He totally fell for our act.

322
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,071
I'm close to getting
my mother's rest house

323
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,573
and everything she left behind.

324
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,326
Meaning, I'll finally
have some peace of mind.

325
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,536
[sighs]

326
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,330
[chuckles]

327
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,957
This was the most perfect contract

328
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,084
- we got ourselves into, Tomas.
- [laughs]

329
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,462
Absolutely perfect, no hitches at all.

330
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,255
- [Gab chuckles, inhales]
- [Tomas sighs]

331
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,133
- [Gab sighs gleefully]
- [Tomas breathes deeply]

332
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,096
[breathes shakily]

333
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,433
[foreboding music playing]

334
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,226
- [Philip] Hey.
- S-Sir.

335
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,812
I-I'm just looking for the restroom.

336
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,899
Try not to make it obvious.

337
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:47,196
Just so you know, sir,
my guilt is eating me up right now.

338
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,405
Oh, come on.

339
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,992
You didn't feel guilty
when you were planning to deceive me.

340
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,703
Sir, I don't care about you!

341
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,832
What I mean to say is,
we're not really close.

342
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,043
Did I say anything?

343
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,296
Did I call you out on your fake marriage?

344
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,547
No, right?

345
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,883
I even had a feast prepared.

346
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,096
Don't act guilty or you'll get caught!

347
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,682
You're doing this for Gab, right?

348
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,809
[breathes shakily]

349
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:21,105
Just try to hurry up and
transfer everything to her name.

350
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,941
She always mentions
her mother's rest house.

351
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,026
Maybe you can start with that.

352
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,486
Now, may I, sir?

353
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,822
What?

354
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,283
May I go use the restroom?
My bladder's about to burst.

355
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,911
- It's over there.
- Thank you, sir.

356
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,329
[Tomas breathing heavily]

357
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,414
[Philip sighs sharply]

358
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,751

359
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,836
[sighs deeply]

360
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,049
Are you sure you don't
want to come home with us?

361
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,551
You can stay the night.

362
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,471
I'm sorry,
but I really need to get going now.

363
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,223
I don't want Papa to worry.

364
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,686
I've missed you so much, my grandson.

365
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,108
I'll be on my way, Grandma.

366
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,444
Okay.

367
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,447
So, when can we see you again, Jun?

368
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,323
We could…

369
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,909
visit Dad next time.

370
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,077
[Esang] Mm-hmm.

371
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,621
Let's plan it over the phone.

372
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,665
[uneasy music playing]

373
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,833
Alright.

374
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,212
- Alright.
- See you next time.

375
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,590
Take care, okay?

376
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,425
Take care.

377
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:36,430
[uneasy music continues]

378
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,939
[uneasy music builds, fades]

379
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,649
Manuel Aguinaldo?

380
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,027
Yes.

381
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,697
He protected and managed to sneak out
someone on the masterlist.

382
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,742
Because he's working for El Cano.

383
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:04,249
JB, are you saying
that you saw him in the flesh?

384
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,212
We had an encounter with his group.

385
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,256
He's my lead to El Cano.

386
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,509
He's an ex-military.

387
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
That's all I know about him.

388
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,058
Do you know this guy?

389
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,606
We used to be in the same group.

390
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,401
But he betrayed us.

391
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,031
Remember when I told you

392
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,992
that everything I do has a purpose?

393
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,787
This is what I mean.

394
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,208
All the contracts
we accepted and the missions we did…

395
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,171
Starting with Timor,
the master list, Sameo…

396
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,381
We did all of that…

397
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,009
because I was hoping

398
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,930
that it all leads down…

399
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,850
It all leads back to El Cano.

400
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,352
You know why?

401
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,813
Because I've been suspecting…

402
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,608
that Manuel works for El Cano.

403
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:17,030
[ominous music playing]

404
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,532
And you were right.

405
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,618
He's connected to them.

406
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:27,332
[ominous music intensifies]

407
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,379
[ominous music fades]

408
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,840
Ma'am, here's your takeout.

409
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,675
Oh, right!

410
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,843
Thank you.

411
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,179
I forgot to give this to Jun!

412
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,891
He should've taken this home with him.

413
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,393
- Go after him.
- It's fine. Next time.

414
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,729
- We'll see each other again.
- No.

415
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,607
Give it to him.
I wanted to give this to him

416
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,152
as a thank you
to those who took care of him.

417
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,947
Go after him. I'm sure he hasn't gone far.

418
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,575
- Fine. I'll be back.
- Alright.

419
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:09,750
[unsettling music playing]

420
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,511
Jun?

421
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,097
Jun!

422
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,141
Jun!

423
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,518
[unsettling music continues]

424
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,479
<i>I found my brother.</i>

425
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,813
<i>- Okay!</i>
<i>- Finally!</i>

426
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,024
<i>What does Andres's brother</i>
<i>have to do with Manuel Aguinaldo?</i>

427
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,776
<i>Manuel adopted him.</i>

428
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,321
<i>You let him look for his brother</i>
<i>when you knew where he was?</i>

429
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,532
<i>We will use Jun to find Manuel.</i>

430
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,660
<i>VIP protection. That'll be our job.</i>

431
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,371
<i>Second layer detail.</i>
<i>No one should know we're there.</i>

432
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,290
<i>This revenge will</i>
<i>happen at a charity event.</i>

433
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,084
<i>Diego, are you ready?</i>

434
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,544
<i>Andres, you should</i>
<i>always stay close to Barrios.</i>
