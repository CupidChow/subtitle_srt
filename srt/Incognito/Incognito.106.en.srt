These injuries are nothing

125
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,189
compared to the fights
I used to get into when I was younger.

126
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,817
We should really head home.

127
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,443
Not yet. The doctor said you're okay,

128
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,737
but you still need
to stay here for a while.

129

Gab.

130

Sorry, Uncle.
I thought I'd never see you again.

138
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,184
Are you still in pain?
What did the doctor say about your liver?

139
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,978
Didn't you have an injury there before?

140
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,104
You…

141
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,609

Doc, how is he?

146
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,628
He's stable now.

147
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,879
He's safe.

148
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,176
But it'll take a long
time for him to fully recover.

149
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,178
You know, he needs to rest.

150
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,223

You can leave JB here for now.

153
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,066
Go, change your clothes,
and get some rest.

154
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,903
Okay, Doc. Thank you.

155
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,363
Excuse me

Andres, I know this is tough,

163
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,524
but you need to stay strong.

164
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,736

Diego Aguinaldo?

[somber music playing]

170
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,758
How are you related to him?

171
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,553
I'm his brother.

172
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,015
There's no Diego Aguinaldo here.

173
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,227
What do you mean, there's not?

174
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,064
Sir, someone already
claimed him as a family member.

175

Who?

176
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,612
According to the log sheet,
he's been transferred.

Where?!

180
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,749
Sir, please calm down.

181
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,084
All it says in the log sheet

182
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,253
was a family member has claimed him.

183
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,880
Which family member exactly?!

[somber music continues]

185
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,468

00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,969
- [Miguel] Andres!
- I'm sorry!

187
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,095
[Miguel] Get a grip, man.

188
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,139
Try to calm down. Come on.

189
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,932
It's against their protocol.

190
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,726
But Jun…

191
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,144
Let's just go.

192
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,606
- [Andres breathes heavily]
- [somber music fades]

193
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,985
Yes, Diego Aguinaldo.

194
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,571
Was his body transferred there?

195
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,409
Check it again. Please.

196
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,077
[Miguel] Thank you very much.

197
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,126
Andres, I'm positive.

198
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,545
I've talked to some insiders.

199
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,757
It was the Aguinaldos who took Diego.

200
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,051
[tense music playing]

201
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,595
Who? Manuel?

202
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,848
Yes, Manuel didn't want you to know.

203
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,311
That bastard… [breathing heavily]

204
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,396
Please take me home, Miguel.

205
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,066
Let's go home.

206
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,445
[tense music builds, fades]

207
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:48,953
[sinister music playing]

208
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,806
[sinister music continues]

209
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,688
This is Greg Paterno's group.

210
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,484
The ones who captured me in Kaigen.

211
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:26,365
[sinister music continues]

212
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,910
We will make them pay.

213
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,538
[dramatic music sting]

214
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,957
[car engine rumbling]

215
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,958
[handbrake ratchets]

216
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:47,469
[crickets chirping]

217
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,770
[door creaks]

218
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,868
Miguel, how is Andres?

219
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,413
Are you still with him?
He's not picking up my calls.

220
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,041
[crickets chirping]

221
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,752
His brother didn't make it.

222
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,547
[sighs deeply]

223
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,011
We were at the hospital the whole time,

224
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,973
but his brother's
body suddenly disappeared.

225
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,060
[crickets chirping]

226
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,521
We suspect someone's
keeping him from Andres.

227
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,318
Manuel must've taken care of it.

228
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,408
Andres will stop at nothing
until he finds his brother's remains.

229
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,746
Then don't let him out of your sight.

230
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,248
Stay with Andres.

231
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,751
Copy, Contractor.

232
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,962
I'll stay here with him.

233
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,673
Just update me.

234
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,842
I'll handle things here.

235
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,220
Thank you.

236
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,517
[crickets chirping]

237
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,770
[sighs deeply]

238
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,570
[sighs]

239
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,330
[sniffling, stifled sobbing]

240
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:43,127
[sorrowful music playing]

241
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,753
[door closes]

242
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:51,301
[Andres sniffling, sobbing]

243
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,386
Andres?

244
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,180
[sniffling, sobbing continues]

245
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,515
Hey.

246
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,058
What happened?

247
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,769
[sniffles, whimpers]

248
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,231
Andres! What happened?!

249
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,315
Hey!

250
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:10,696
- [sniffling]
- [sorrowful music continues]

251
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,699
What's going on, Andres?! Talk to me!

252
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,409
What?

253
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,828
[Andres sniffling, coughing]

254
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,788
[Esang stammers]

255
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,540
What happened?!

256
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,624
[sniffles, whimpers]

257
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,088
[both sobbing]

258
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,174
Grandma, Jun…

259
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,925
Huh?

260
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,093
What happened to Jun?

261
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,220
He, he's gone!

262
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,097
[sniffles]

263
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,266
What do you mean Jun's gone?!

264
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,894
- What?!
- He's d…

265
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,104
- He's what?!
- [breath quivers]

266
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,814
Jun's dead!

267
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,899
What…

268
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,443
- What are you… [gasps]
- [Andres sniffles]

269
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,446
- [Andres sobbing quietly]
- [sorrowful music continues]

270
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,572
Jun…

271
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,616
No… [whimpers]

272
00:17:55,699 --> 00:18:00,245
[both sobbing]

273
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,122
- No…
- Grandma…

274
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,044
Tell me it's not true! No!

275
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:11,632
[stifled sobs]

276

You're lying! Tell me it's not true!

[sobs]

283

How could this happen? Why?

284
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:41,078
What… Where… How did that happen?!

285
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,329
[Andres sniffles]

286
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,124
How could that happen?!

287
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,460
Tell me it's not true!

288
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,878
No!

289

Oh, my grandson…

[crying]

291
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,761
How could this happen to Jun?!

292
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,557
[Esang wails]

293
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,434
- [Andres whimpers]
- Andres!

294

- [both sobbing]
- [sorrowful music intensifies]

<i>I told Contractor I'd stay with you.</i>

296
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,906
<i>- It's too dangerous.</i>
<i>- What else is there to lose?</i>

297
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,741
<i>My brother is gone.</i>

298
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,744
<i>I promised him,</i>
