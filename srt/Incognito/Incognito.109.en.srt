<i>One thing that my Papa taught me</i>

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,674
<i>is that when I kill someone,</i>

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,300
<i>I should look them straight in the eyes.</i>

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,264

<i>It was you, wasn't it?!</i>

<i>Jun!</i>

8

12
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,741
<i>I won't give it to you.</i>

13
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,910
<i>You brainwashed him</i>
<i>with your twisted beliefs.</i>

14
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,413
<i>You should be thankful</i>
<i>that you're my son's brother.</i>

15
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,291
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>I would've killed you right here.</i>

16
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,170
<i>I'm sure El Cano was</i>
<i>behind the assassination of Barrios.</i>

17
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,505
<i>I bet it had something</i>
<i>to do with their mining operations.</i>

18
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,424
<i>That's where I'll start my investigation.</i>

19
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,551

00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,264

I want to be early for church.

27
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,453
for Jun?

28
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,289
Okay, get one from inside.

- Uh…
- Good day.

33
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,687
How may I help you?

34
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,981
Is Andres here?

35
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,109
Andres?

36
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,153
Who are you?

37
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,656
I work with him.

38
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,202
You work together in that group?

39
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,955
That's why my grandson--

40
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,540
My sincerest condolences.

[somber music playing]

42
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,591
I just need to talk to Andres.

43

He's not here.

[somber music continues]

45
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,936
Can you tell me where he is?

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,772
Because this is important.

47
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,153
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,200
I can't do that.

49
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,207
My grandson's wound is still deep.

50
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,839
I want him to sever all
his connections with your group.

[somber music continues]

52
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,931
And that's what Andres wants too.

53
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,687
Leave us to begin again…

54
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,359
and heal.

55
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,866
I understand.

56
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,786

I won't let you be alone in your flat.

62
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,686
What happened to you?

63
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,522
Nanny Madel, come on.

64
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,525
You've always seen me and Dad like this.

65
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:42,782
I will never get used
to seeing you wounded and injured.

[inhales, exhales deeply]

67
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,413
Thank you, Nanny Madel.

68
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,584
But I hope that when you visit Dad,

69
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,422
you won't tell him about this.

70
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,174
[scoffs] Of course.

71
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,135
He'd definitely worry.

72
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,138
Stay here and rest.

73
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,307
I'll get you something to eat.

74
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,309

Mister Domeng.

84

I can't buy the entire land yet.

85
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,661
But my lawyer said
I can get a piece of it.

86
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,623
Maybe we can start with a small part.

87
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:18,419
I will take care of the papers we'll need.

88

[Domeng] Okay.

93
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,973
Take this.
Use that for processing the papers.

94
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,141
Oh.

95
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,436
Uh… [chuckles]

Oh, Andres. Thank you so much for this.

Thank you.

Your father and I planted those.

Yes, Dad?

is for you to be happy.

Can I talk to Tomas for a second?

- Dad, don't rope him in--
- No, Gab.

You probably know what I'm going to say.

125
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,561
Sir, if I already know,

126
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,479
why do we still need to talk?

127
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,732
- [both chuckle]
- You're ridiculous.

128
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,778
No, sir. I'm just trying
to lighten the mood, sir.

129
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,489
It feels a bit sad.

130
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,993
I only have two things I want to tell you.

131
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,704
First…

132
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,499
I want to thank you for
saving me the other day.

133
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,003
I know that a simple
"thank you" wouldn't suffice.

134
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,549
Don't worry about it, sir.

135
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,968
Second…

136
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,345
it's about Gab.

137
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,682
[tender music playing]

138
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,851
You know what our deal is.

139
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,855
This is the last time
we're seeing each other.

140
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,906
But, sir…

141
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,783
this isn't what you want, right?

142
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,579
This is painful for me.

143
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,499
But if this is what she wants…

144
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,294
if this is what's
going to make her happy…

145
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,006
I won't stop her.

146
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:37,762
[tender music continues]

147
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,055
Sir.

148
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,848
Your daughter loves you so much.

149
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,977
She just doesn't say it but

150
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,229
I know it, sir.

151
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,358
I know that…

152
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,236
you're the most
important person in her life.

153

00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,577
Um…

155
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,624
I don't know you that well yet,
but I do know…

156
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,587
you can love her with all your heart.

157
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,512
Gab and I can't see each other again,

158
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,639
but that's not the case for us.

159
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,934
Let's keep in touch, okay?

160
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,979
That way, I'll feel like…

161
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,983
I'm also watching over Gab.

162
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:41,617

Thank you.

- [footsteps receding]
- [pensive music fades]

167
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,866
So, how was your conversation with him?

168
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,867
Huh?

169
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,785
Well, we just talked about…

170
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,621
the cockfighters.

171
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,373
And your father thanked me.

172
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,375
Really?

173
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,710
Yeah.

174
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,295
He didn't say anything else?

175
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,463
No.

176
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,589
That's all?

177
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,923
Yup. [exhales sharply]

178
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,138
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

179
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,057
I'm okay. That's what I want, right?

180
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,230
By the way,
we can now have the annulment processed.

181
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,733
It will take around six months
and cost around 200,000 to 300,000 pesos.

182
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,985
I promise to shoulder all the expenses.

183
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,154
Yes! I won't have to pay.

184
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,282
Wait. What about the custody of the kids?

185
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,868
Huh?

186
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,371
I'm talking about Bud and Dy.

187
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,831
[chuckles]

188
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,791
Well? [chuckles]

189
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,461
- They're only mine.
- Hey.

190
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,962
What about me?

191
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,422
[scoffs] They're only yours?

192
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,715
Okay, fine.

193
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:23,177
I have no problem with
that since you're their mother.

194
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,722
Just give me some visitation rights.

195
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,224
But don't worry.

196
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,391
You know,

197
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,976
while we're still married,

198
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,770
- I won't date anyone else.
- [chuckles]

199
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,314
I'm very loyal and faithful to you.

200
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,482
- As you should.
- [chuckles]

201
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,317
Because if you date someone else,

202
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,153
I'll sue you for adultery, concubinage…

203
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,363
- Everything!
- Hey.

204
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,697
Hey, calm down.

205
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,367
- Mark my words.
- That's if you catch me.

206
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,618
[laughs]

207
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,620
Wow. Okay, fine.

208
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:54,625
[foreboding music playing]

209
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,878
[car engine starts, revs]

210
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,260
[gears grind]

211
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:17,815
[foreboding music continues]

212
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,197
Um, <i>caldereta…</i>

213
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,074
Um…

214
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,326
- Wait. <i>Kare-kare.</i>
- Why?

215
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,161
- Please?
<i>- Kare-kare?</i>

216
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,873
That spoils easily.

217
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:38,627
But we have a fridge.
It's a brand-new one, too.

218
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,170
<i>- Caldereta.</i>
- [laughs]

219
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,672
Okay, <i>kare-kare.</i>

220
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,048
- Um…
- Hmm.

221
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,842
- What if we add…
- But if it's too difficult--

222
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,552
crispy <i>lechon</i> belly?

223
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,639
- Dear, you're here!
- Come here.

224
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,850
[chuckles]

225
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,935
- Mm… Mwah!
- Crispy <i>lechon</i> belly.

226
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,437
- Alright.
- There are three now.

227
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,648
- I will put it on the menu.
- [laughs]

228
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,027
We're making
the menu for our anniversary party.

229
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,487
Oh, by the way, I invited JB.

230
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,865
It's just a small
gathering with close friends.

231
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,242
You two are close, right?

232
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,369
- [giggles]
- You told JB we're here?

233
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,290
Yes, I told him we checked
in here for our anniversary. Why?

234
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,051
I hope what you're going to tell me
won't be a waste of my time, Joris.

235
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,264
I promised I'd make
it up to you, remember?

236
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,726
I know it was wrong
of me to double-cross you.

237
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,146
- I was desperate back then.
- [brooding music playing]

238
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,567
Here's your copy of the document.

239
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,822
I paid some people
inside to pull some strings

240
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,741
so we can get your father out of jail.

241
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,962
[brooding music continues]

242
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,714
I'll only shake your hand
once my father has been released.

243
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,260
- [exhales sharply]
- [glass thuds]

244
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,230
[brooding music fades]

245
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,357
Because of my anger towards Manuel…

246
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,903
I made things personal.

247
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,701
I even used Andres's brother
after he told me not to many times.

248
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,245
I kept promising him…

249
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,456
that his brother wouldn't get involved.

250
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,043
Now that Diego's gone,

251
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,588
it's only natural for
Andres to get mad at me.

252
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,590
I can't blame him.

253
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,470
And you're hurting because
you can't bear him being mad at you.

254
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,265
The truth is…

255
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,518
you consider them family.

256
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:04,273
[patrons chatter indistinctly]

257
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,154
I just hope…

258
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,282
at some point, Andres finally realizes…

259
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,619
that his brother was
one of Manuel's victims.

260
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,081
[ominous music playing]

261
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,166
Maybe…

262
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,586
Just maybe…

263
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,714
if I give Andres Manuel's head,

264
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,596
he might understand
all the decisions I made.

265
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:43,395
And we can give justice
to everyone Manuel wronged.

266
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:50,486
[ominous music continues]

267
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,032
[exhales sharply]

268
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,704
[ominous music fades]

269
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,333
Grandma.

270
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,501
[Esang] Hmm?

271
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,670
Hmm.

272
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,881
[exhales sharply]

273
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,050
- Check this out.
- Alright.

274
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:17,679
[gentle music playing]

275
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,392
This is just a small part of the land.

276
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,686
But it's enough for us to start over.

277
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,355
The two of us…

278
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,315
along with the other tribe members.

279
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,653
I've been waiting
a long time for this day to come.

280
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,862
[chuckling]

281
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,825
Grandma, I'm sorry.

282
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,580
I wasn't able to fulfill my promise,

283
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,708
that we'd return there with Jun.

284
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,714
But Jun is in our hearts.

285
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,427
So, I believe…

286
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,389
he'll be with us when we return there.

287
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:09,314
[gentle music continues]

288
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,866
<i>I already got my inheritance from Dad.</i>

289
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,951
<i>I'll have</i>
<i>our annulment processed right away.</i>

290
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,162
<i>Is that really what you want to happen?</i>

291
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,621
<i>You want to stay married?</i>

292
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,250
<i>Wolf visited the group chat</i>
<i>only to leave right after.</i>

293
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,545
<i>Let's meet before another one leaves.</i>

294
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,547
<i>This will be</i>
<i>the start of our peaceful life.</i>

295
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,049
<i>As long as</i>
<i>El Cano's group is still standing,</i>

296
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,217
<i>there will be many more victims.</i>

297
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,803
<i>We will continue this</i>
<i>with or without a contract.</i>

298
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,015
<i>We're preparing everything necessary</i>
<i>for you to have that seat.</i>

299
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,308
<i>What's the status?</i>

300
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,350
[trilling]

301
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,351
<i>I have cloned it.</i>
