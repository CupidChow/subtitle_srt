<i>Twenty million?!</i>

19
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,548

Uncle, why didn't you tell me?

23
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,850
Uncle.

24
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,269
It was supposed to be a surprise.

25
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,438
That's why I bought some shares

26
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,358
from that newly-opened
restaurant in Makati.

27
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,526
Really? Shares?

28
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,319
You know lots people fall victim to that

29
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,570
and you still joined?

30
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,905
I had no idea.

31
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,115
A celebrity owns that restaurant.

32
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,699
So what if it is?

33
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,119

Are you serious?

00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,644
You also used the money
I stashed in there? That's all I had.

It's your mom's fault.
She made me cry too.

How is it my fault? You cried first.

- Okay, let's not point fingers.

- [both laugh]
- I'm okay.

77
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,447
We're all okay.

Let's go inside?

00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,081
- [Teddy] Yes, yes.
- Okay.

- Huh?
- Where are you going?

85
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,888
I have to hide.

00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,265
From who? Me?

87
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,267
Is it because you spent my money?

88
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,643
It's fine, Uncle.

89
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,144
No, you dummy!

90
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,646
Then who are you hiding from?

91
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,066
Remember the restaurant I invested in?

92
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,610
There were others who also invested.

93
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,820
You recruited other people?!

94
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,322
Why'd you do that?
You put your reputation on the line.

95
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,740
I know.

96
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,659
But I was thinking about the commission.

97
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,119
Commission?

98
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,579
You know you could
go to jail for what you did.

99
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,000
That's the thing.
Somebody has filed a case against me.

100
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,251
That's why--

101
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,461
But don't worry, I can get out of this.

102
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,921
I have lots of connections, remember?

103
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,506
Yes, you have connections
to different Wi-Fi networks,

104
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,758
but not in the judiciary,
for crying out loud!

105

[clears throat, breathes deeply]

106
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,929
Anyway, here's the plan.

107
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,141
I'll settle this. You won't go to jail.

108
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,767
You still have some money?

109
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,894
Right now, no. So you'd better hide.

110
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,688
- But not from me, okay?
- Yeah.

111
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,274
- Call me. I'll find a way to fix this.
- Alright.

112
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,568
- I should go.
- Wait. Where's my hug?

113
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,652
Right.

114
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,445
[smooches]

115
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,904
Alright.

116
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,823
- Okay.
- Take care. I love you.

117
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,158
Yeah. Bye.

118
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,204

It's hard to raise an adult.

00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,166
Hmm. [breathes deeply]

120
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,128

Miguel.

126
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,639
Make them leave. We don't need them.

127
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,517
[exhales sharply] Jake just died.

128
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,562
You never know.

129
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,857
His killers might come for you.

130
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,817
Why would they come after me?

131
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,694
I've not doing anything wrong.

132
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,696
Well, yeah.

133
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,198
But who knows,

134
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,200
Jake might have done something bad

135
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,660
which lead to this situation.

136
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,204
Don't you see?

137
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,956
He's already dead, Miguel.

138
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,794
Please don't speak ill of him.

139
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,215
Fine, fine.

140
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,593
But, please.
Let these guys stick around, okay?

141
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,098
Just think about Mickey's safety.

142
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,933
Alright? Please.

Thank you.

148
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,163
- Oh, hey, Max.
- It's not like…

149
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,873
I'm borrowing a huge amount.

150
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,083
Why is he here?

151
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,709
Why are you here?

152
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,588
Are you the owner of this restaurant?
You’re not, right?

153
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,215
Can you guys stop already?

154
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,885
Tomas texted me that he wanted a drink,
so I brought him along.

155
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,762
- Drink?
- Yes, sir.

156
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,264
Is something bothering him?

157
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,476
- Actually, yeah.
- Hey…

158
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,353
He's got issues with his uncle,

159
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,189
and he's struggling with money.
He even borrowed money from me.

160
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,858
- Shut up.
- He borrowed money?

161
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,317
[Max] Well, it's true.

162
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,945
Besides it's just Gab.
It's not a big deal.

163
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,029
Well…

164
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,742
Whatever, I have no choice.
You're already here.

165
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,661
What can I do? Nothing, right?

166
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,163
- Welcome!
- Thank you.

167
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,293
Hmm… shopping? Let's go shopping?

168
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,461
- Let's go.
- Shopping?

169
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,546
Wait, shopping? I'm broke.

170
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,798
We'll shop, you'll carry our bags.

171
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,134
[Tomas] Wait…

172
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,307
Bitch.

173
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,685
She's spending my dad's money again.

174
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,104
- Who is she?
- Where?

175
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,273
[Gab] Over there.

176
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,942
- Let's go.
- Wait, hold on.

177
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,986
What's your deal with her?
Is she your friend

178
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,362
- No.
- or your enemy?

179
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,200
- Don't tell me she's your mom.
- Definitely not.

180
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,285
[laughs] You want to go see her?

181
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,746
No, I'll go. I'll bring her to you.

182
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,748
Better than you just
window-shopping around here.

183
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,334
Oh, we're still talking
about window-shopping?

184
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,086
Oh, I thought that was over.
Why are you bringing it up again?

185
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,172
Over? Who do you think I learnt it from?

186
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,632
- Me, yeah, me.
- From you.

187
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,966
But didn't you say it's over?

188
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,761
You said, instead of just looking around,
face it head-on.

189
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,804
I'm helping you here.
I'm making it up to you.

[chuckles] "Making it up", he says.

191
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,476
Are you making it up to me
or throwing shade? Which is it?

192
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,728
Wait, wait, what are you
two even talking about?

193
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,771
What's window-shopping?

194
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,813
Ask that meddler over there.

195
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,608
- Where are you going?
- Going home.

196
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,904
- Just let her go.
- So we're not having a drink anymore?

197
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,155
No, I'm not in the mood.

198
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,658
If we're not drinking, I'm heading off.

199
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,659

So, has your anger towards me passed?

203

- Not yet. Never.
- Mm?

204
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,636
- My anger is forever.
- Wow.

205

Careful, you might not wake up.

206
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,223
Honestly, I hope so.

207
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,600
- What? [scoffs]
- I hope so.

208
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,644

- Perfect.

Bro, I just really wanted
to make it up to her.

What?

213
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,199
Nothing. I just don't
have anyone to talk to.

Yeah.

Are you okay?

218
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,631
I just noticed…

219
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,467
she woke up in a bad mood, huh?

220
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,721

I don't know her.
You don't seem familiar to me?

228
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,922
[Gab] So you went shopping.
You're the only one who followed through.

It might sound bad, but…

I realized a lot of things.

- Mm-hmm.
