00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,547
Close your eyes.

183
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,926
Let go of distractions.

184
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,178
Focus on your breathing.

185
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,390
[calming music continues]

186
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,933
[Rafael exhales sharply]

187
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,184
[Gab exhales sharply]

188
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,269
[Rafael] Let's begin.

189
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:11,152
[calming music continues]

190
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:33,382
[calming music continues]

191
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,018
- [soft thud]
- Oh, sorry.

192
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,102
[whispering] Sorry.

193
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,231
[Rafael] To the left.

194
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,525
Oh! Sorry.

195
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,736
Sorry. Sorry, Coach.

196
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,780
Sorry. Is that annoying?

197
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,366
Don't start with me, Gab.

198
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,078
- [Shari exhales deeply]
- Isn't yoga about inner peace?

199
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,121
You might be losing yours already.

200
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,041
[Gab scoffs]

201
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,417
[Rafael] The other side.

202
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,380
[calming music continues]

203
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,131
- [soft thud]
- [Gab gasps]

204
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,592
[whispering] If you don't shut up,
you'll annoy Coach.

205
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,594
[whispering]
Oh, you're concerned about him?

206
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,012
Why? Are you two close?

207
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,056
[Rafael] Ladies.

208
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,225
Focus.

209
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,018
- [Rafael] Okay?
- I'm sorry, Coach.

210
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,145
Let's focus, Shari?

211
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,151
[Shari inhales deeply, sighs]

212
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,028
[engine humming]

213
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,823
[Max] This is me.

214
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,907
- [seat belt clicks]
- [handbrake cranks]

215
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,827
Max.

216
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,414
Thank you for everything.

217
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,500
Anytime.

218
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,004
Just tell me when you want to
start looking into Tienza.

219
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,301
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,471
You got dragged into my problems.

221
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,810
Aren't we way past that point, JB?

222
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,145
[both chuckle]

223
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:17,153
I know you won't be at peace
until you find out everything.

224
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,071
[birds chirping]

225
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,287
Where are you?

226
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,957
Max is here.
She's talking to JB inside his car.

227
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,667
[Lorena] <i>You're spying on them again.</i>

228
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,751
[Teddy chuckles]

229
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,921
[Teddy]
Why are they talking inside the car?

230
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,090
Why don't they do it here in the house?

231
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,341
Wait. I'll go to them.

232
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,051
[Lorena] <i>Hey, don't.</i>

233
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,137
<i>Just let them be.</i>

234
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,431
Ugh. Fine. Fine.

235
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,391
[Lorena] <i>Stop being a snoop, okay?</i>

236
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,355
- It's nice here, right?
- [Agnes chuckles]

237
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,150
Although it's too formal and quiet for me.

238
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,818
[chuckles]

239
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,197
Oh, so you don't like it quiet?

240
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,868
- Uh…
- For me, it's perfect.

241
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,578
I like the silence.

242
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,123
Well, I'm okay with silence. It's fine.

243
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,167
- [Agnes chuckles]
- It depends.

244
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,753
I don't mind.

245
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,837
[Agnes chuckles]

246
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,507
Um…

247
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,759
[patrons chatter indistinctly]

248
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,093
What do you like doing?

249
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,597
Hmm.

250
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,765
Outreach activities.

251
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,267
- You should join us sometime.
- Outreach?

252
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,268
Mm-hmm.

253
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,395
Oh, right.
I've heard about that outreach program.

254
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,689
Isn't it called the <i>Pinoy Big</i>
<i>Sister and Big Brother?</i>

255
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,483
- Am I right?
- Yes.

256
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,859
[both chuckle]

257
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,569
[Tomas] That's nice.

258
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,448
You're very ladylike, aren't you?

259
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,533
[Agnes clears throat]

260
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,743
I can't help but notice.

261
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,456
Sorry. Am I making you uncomfortable?

262
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,166
Oh no, it's okay.

263
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,751
It's fine. It's okay.

264
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,670
- [cutlery clinks]
- Oh. Sorry.

265
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,964
- No, don't.
- Five-second rule, right?

266
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,216
No, it's dirty already.

267
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,970
I like things clean.

268
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,264
It still has germs even
if it's less than five seconds.

269
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,891
- Yeah. I have spoon, anyway.
- We'll ask for a new one.

270
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,352
- I'll use it instead.
- Oh, okay.

271
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,605
Um…

272
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,983
Do you like guns?

273
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,193
Guns?

274
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,737
Just kidding.

275
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,738
[both laugh]

276
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,532
I mean, action movies.

277
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,494
You see, I like movies
with gunfight scenes.

278
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,996
- That scared me.
- Oh, sorry.

279
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,707
I haven't touched a gun in my life.

280
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,126
I know nothing about guns. [chuckles]

281
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,380
Um… Anyway…

282
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,340
What are your favorite things?

283
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,302
What's your favorite food?
Your favorite color?

284
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,971
Uh… What's your favorite pet? [chuckles]

285
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,306
Dog.

286
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,933
Oh, you're a dog-lover. [chuckles]

287
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:57,980
I guess you don't have large dogs
and named them Bud and Dy.

288
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,106
[both chuckle]

289
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,900
No, they're small dogs.

290
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,736
Their names are Mini and Tiny.

291
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,447
Mini and Tiny.

292
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,698
[chuckles]

293
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,200
Such cute names. [chuckles]

294
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,289
[patrons chatter indistinctly]

295
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,046
[Shari] Thank you so much
for a great class, Coach.

296
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,673
- Thank you for coming, Shari.
- Of course. See you next week.

297
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,799
- Bye.
- Bye.

298
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,722
You said yoga is about mindfulness…

299
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,558
and getting balance.

300
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,354
You know, it's just funny
how people seek balance,

301
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,691
but all they do is ruin
other people's lives.

302
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,818
[inhales deeply]

303
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,904
Did you come here just to follow me?

304
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,032
You must really obsessively hate me.

305
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,742
Oh, that's not even a question anymore.

306
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,828
I really do fucking hate you,
you homewrecking piece of shit.

307
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,498
Well, actually, I don't hate you.

308
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,333
I really do fucking despise you.

309
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,710
You know, Gab, I understand you.

310
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,422
I know it's easier for you
to believe that I'm the villain

311
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,968
because I'm the mistress or "other woman."

312
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,177
Right?

313
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,887
It's a convenient narrative to believe.

314
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,972
It's simple.

315
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,016
But whether you believe it or not…

316
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,143
I love your father.

317
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,311
[scoffs]

318
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,939
We love each other and you
don't know the full story.

319
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,982
So, just stop.

320
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,901
- Oh, I already know enough, Shari.
- Please. No, you don't. Stop.

321
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,112
Women like you are just after money.

322
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,740
And love, seriously?
What are you going to do with that?

323
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,410
You just use it as an excuse
to justify what you did.

324
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,036
[pensive music playing]

325
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,663
Look, Gab.

326
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,416
I'm not saying I don't want
your father's money.

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,419
I mean, come on, who would say no to that?

328
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,796
I love my expensive things.

329
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,923
I love my luxurious lifestyle.

330
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,011
But that doesn't change the fact
that I love your father.

331
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,054
I repeat.

332
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,141
I love Philip.

333
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,811
- We love each other.
- Go. Keep saying that.

334
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,147
Keep repeating it.

335
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,942
Tell yourself that over and over again

336
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,861
until one day…

337
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,447
You know, someday,
you might actually believe it.

338
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,950
[pensive music continues]

339
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,412
- [footsteps receding]
- [pensive music fades]

340
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:27,046
[indistinct chattering]

341
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,683
[man] Have you always come
to these assistance programs?

342
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,602
No, it's my first time.

343
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,021
It's been quite a while for me.

344
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,316
Ma'am Marichu is really a good person.

345
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,527
What makes you say that?

346
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,864
- Have you talked to her?
- Yeah, she's there inside.

347
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,867
They personally interact with
the people to give help.

348
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,703
That's why I'll vote for Selo.

349
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:05,417
[indistinct chattering]

350
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,178
[indistinct exclaiming, chattering]

351
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,306
Miss.

352
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,642
Is Ma'am Marichu in?

353
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,727
Do you have an appointment with her?

354
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,563
No.

355
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,067
But I really need to talk to her.

356
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,611
Sorry, she's not here.

357
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:36,490
But the man at the line said she
personally hands out help.

358
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,534
Yes, if she's not busy.

359
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,244
- Is that so?
- [man] Here, mister.

360
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,748
Miss, I won't take long.
It's really important.

361
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,209
She's not here.
Just come back some other day.

362
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,253
Or better yet, call her office
and set an appointment.

363
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,130
[Selo]
I'm glad we have many beneficiaries.

364
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,172
Yes, sir.

365
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,508
I still have some clothes
left for donation.

366
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:02,641
[dramatic music playing]

367
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:18,824
[dramatic music continues]

368
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,870
- Sir, the line is over there.
- Sir.

369
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,871
[bodyguard] Wait.

370
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,539
[Selo] It's okay.

371
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,837
Good day, sir.

372
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,383
I'm Marcelo, but you can call me Selo.

373
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:42,639
[dramatic music continues]

374
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,391
I'm Andres.

375
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:49,188
[dramatic music intensifies]

376
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,107
<i>I've sent someone there.</i>

377
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,651
<i>He'll give you the intel on Dexter Tienza.</i>

378
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,570
<i>Make sure this is all true.</i>

379
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,697
<i>- Aww.</i>
<i>- Hi, baby.</i>

380
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,781
<i>Baby?</i>

381
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,409
<i>I talked to her son, Marcelo.</i>

382
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:06,955
<i>Maybe the BSWP staff</i>
<i>are trying to mislead us</i>

383
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,875
<i>because it was Secretary Marquez herself</i>

384
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,919
<i>who adopted Junjun.</i>

385
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,629
<i>We need to meet ASAP.</i>

386
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,505
<i>The moment we've</i>
<i>been waiting for has arrived.</i>
