Last week, his mother received a message.

"Mama, please help me.
I'm alive, but I'm not safe."

According to CIB,
they traced the IP address.

It came from Lakandula.

we believe Manuel
is building a base there.

00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,063
The kids, actually.

71
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,232

There are more.

But thanks to Pio's text message,

we know he's alive.

77

[tense music sting]

183
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:17,087
[leader] Attention!

184
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,509
At ease!

185
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,721
Do it properly.

186
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,641
One more time!

187
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,851
Pay attention!

188
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,812
[unsettling music playing]

189
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,315
Parade…

190
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,608
…rest!

191
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,862
At ease!

192
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,782
[unsettling music continues]

193
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,326
Platoon…

194
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,911
Ready!

195
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:54,250
[unsettling music continues]

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,211
Port…

197
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,504
Arms!

198
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,633
Finger out. Remember, finger out!

199
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,134
Lift it higher.

200
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,554
[gun clicks]

201
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:12,601

202
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,853
Order…

203
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,230
Arms!

204
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,901
[unsettling music continues, fades]

205
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,321
Eagle, where are the choke points?

206
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,908
Right there.

207
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,661
These narrow passages
are perfect for an ambush.

208
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,080
Usually, these are
where they'll set up traps.

209
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,292
[key taps]

210
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,337
You'll also find sniper positions up high

211
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,424
rooftops and windows
for over-watch and fire support.

212
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,596
This is where the IEDs
and landmines are placed.

213
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,514
You can usually spot
them by soil disturbances

214
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,807
and cracks on the ground.

215
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,937

- [metal clanging]
- [rocks rattling]

219
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,630
Like I said…

220
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,131
Kids are everywhere,

221
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,800
and we can watch their every move.

222
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,970
But we really don't
know what's happening inside.

223
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,182
So we need to be
careful with every move we make.

224
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,312
We'll take out Manuel Aguinaldo.

225
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,189
That's for sure.

226
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,691
But still.

227
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,694
This is a high-risk contract for everyone.

228
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,321
Yes, we have additional manpower.

229
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:33,200
But we really have no
idea how big Manuel's group is.

230
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,078
So let me just remind you.

231
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,372
This is not just an operation.

232
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,750
This is war.

233
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,128
[dramatic music sting]

234
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,049
Do or die, sir.

235
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,386
We'll wipe all those bastards out.

236
00:16:54,179 --> 00:17:01,186
[dramatic music playing]

237
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:20,789
[dramatic music continues]

238
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,208
We will split into two teams.

239
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,377
Team Alpha, shock them all.

240
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,091
Team Bravo, silent extraction.

241
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,763
Our plan starts with
Alpha Team breaching the north entrance.

242
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:41,226
That's myself,
Eagle, Shark, Jaguar, Giraffe,

243
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,937
along with the first unit of Black Viper.

244
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,190
We'll cause a distraction.
We'll make them panic.

245
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,442
We'll make it look
like a full-scale assault.

246
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,944
Meanwhile, the Bravo Team…

247
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,782
Wolf, Sparrow, and Monkey,

248
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,075
along with the second unit,

249
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,826
keep a low-profile.

250
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,244
You act silently.

251
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,580
Your objective is to watch over the kids.

252
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,248
Make sure they don't get involved.

253
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:08,128
[dramatic music continues]

254
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,761
Once the Bravo Team has saved the kids,

255
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,014
the Alpha Team, we go loud.

256
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,600
We'll detonate all the charges.

257
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:26,980
[dramatic music continues]

258
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,819
And we will eliminate Manuel Aguinaldo.

259
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,237
- Roger that!
- Roger that!

262
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,794
You need to talk to your men.

<i>I'm not just some contractor anymore.</i>

269
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,996
<i>I'm someone fighting for justice.</i>

270
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,957
<i>When it comes to war,</i>
<i>emotions can't take over.</i>

271
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,627
<i>This contract is bigger than us,</i>
<i>it's bigger than our pain.</i>

272
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,087
<i>It's for the greater good.</i>

273
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,756
<i>Now, I'm not just fighting for myself.</i>

274
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,052
<i>I'll fight for those</i>
<i>who were abused, exploited, and hurt.</i>

275
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,054
<i>This isn't a place for the weak!</i>

276
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,973
<i>I'll fight for all of you.</i>

277
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,267
<i>No way.</i>
