<i>You were with my dad?!</i>

00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,880
<i>I just wanted you</i>

4
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,465
<i>I can understand why your dad did it.</i>

5
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,509
<i>He only did it because he loves you.</i>

00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,428

7
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,972
<i>The one who I thought was</i>

8
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,725
<i>You know, Gab, I could never lie to you.</i>

9
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,310
<i>I just want you to know</i>

10
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,771

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,398
<i>Gab, where are you going?</i>

12
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,192
<i>- Hey, what's going on?</i>
<i>- Hold on, Migs.</i>

13
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,402
<i>Is Tomas here?</i>

14
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,278
<i>What do you want?</i>

15
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>I came here to make up with him.</i>

16
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:37,287
<i>Today, we offer up Jun to our ancestors.</i>

17
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,124
<i>Shine a light on his path,</i>

19
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,086
<i>Phase 2 is in motion, sir.</i>

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>On this day,</i>

21
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,507
<i>they'll learn what it's</i>
<i>like to lose someone you love.</i>

22
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,553
<i>I'll make sure that the</i>
<i>pain will pierce through their soul.</i>

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,809

Hello, Uncle? What's up?

[Rolando] <i>Tom,</i>

31
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,789
Maybe later. Why?

32
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,626
[chuckles] You have a special guest.

33
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,379
So, come home now.

34
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,841
Uncle, who is it?

35
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,137
It's a surprise.

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,764
Uncle, I'm in a bad mood right now.

37
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,100
Please don't make it worse.
Who's the guest?

38
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,187
Alright. It might lighten your mood a bit.

39
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,190
Your big brother, Baste, is here.

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,951
He might just make my day even worse.

43
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:43,454
<i>I don't think so.</i>
<i>He wants to make up with you.</i>

44
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,956
<i>So, if I were you,</i>

45
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,917
I'd come home now
before he changes his mind.

46
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,252
Oh. [chuckles]

47
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,005
I won't change my mind, Tomas.

48
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,756
<i>I'll wait for you here, okay?</i>

49
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,429
Okay, Uncle. I'm on my way.

This means a lot to me.

Sir.

60

What was that?

61
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,756
Beats me.

62
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,550
How about JB, sir?

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,803
He'll be here soon.

No, I think it's a delivery.

What is it?

74
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,337
Uh, there's
nothing written on it except…

75
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,756
"Happy Anniversary."

76
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,217
[exhales deeply]

77
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,678
Alright. Thank you.

78
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,429
I wonder what it is.

79
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,432
You're such a hardworking kid.

80
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,851
- Thank you.
- [chuckles] Thank you too.

[Lorena] Look how sweet our daughter is.

84
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,406
She's even prepared this.

85
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,492
How sweet of her to surprise us!

86
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,868
Can we open it?

87
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,704
No, not yet!

88
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,123
This is super special. Let's wait for Max.

89
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,625
- It's so special and it's here now.
- No.

90
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,795
- Just a little peek--
- Love, no. Not yet.

91
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,714
Let's wait for her. Come on.

92
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,342
- Just a little peek.
- No, let's wait for her.

93
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,760
- [Lorena] Okay.
- [Teddy] My goodness.

94
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,220
Wait. Should we add more?

[Greg] I thought this was a get-together?

98

Where are they?

99
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,569
[Miguel] Beats me, sir.

100
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,905
If only I could answer that.

101
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,491
Max couldn't come.

102
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,705
And those two… I don't know.

103
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,708
They were getting along just fine earlier,

104
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,876
but now…

105
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,294
[Greg chuckles]

106
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,798
If they're not coming,

107
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,508
I'll be leaving shortly.

108
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,096
I just stopped by as
my father's being released today.

109
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,018
I'm happy for you, bro.

110
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,898
Thank you.

111
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,317
I'll go now.

112
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,612
Stay safe.

[footsteps receding]

114
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,283
Sir, want some soup?

115
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,788
Sure. What do we do with all these food?

116
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,414
It's just us two now.

JB, where are you?

122
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,345
<i>I'll come pick you up.</i>

123
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,555
Alright.

124
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,682
Are you excited to go home?

125
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,768
<i>You know,</i>

126
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,896
I'm most excited to see you.

See you.

130
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,487
Okay. See you. Hurry up, okay?

131
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,531
Okay.

Yes, sir.

Sir, what happened to Andres…

147
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,056
[sighs] I don't want it to happen to me.

148
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,852
In a snap, he lost a loved one.

149
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,942
I want to watch Mickey grow up.

150
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,112
I want to start fresh.

151

With my family.

00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,953
I'm sorry, sir.

153
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,873
I'm leaving the group.

154
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,668
Miguel…

155
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,756
you don't have to be apologetic.

156
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,552
You're just prioritizing your family.

157
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,097
I may not have a family,

158
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,849
but I know that family is everything.

159
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,644
And…

160
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,064
maybe this is my chance to tell you

161
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,025
that what you've done…

162
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,113
you worked hard

163
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,992
to make your family accept you again…

164
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,620
That's amazing.

165
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,789

00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,594
<i>You're important to me, Gab.</i>

186
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,805
<i>But Shari is also important in my life--</i>

187
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,432
[Gab] <i>Then who will you choose?</i>

188
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,642
<i>Choose now.</i>

189
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,185
[Philip] <i>I love you both!</i>

190
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,020
[Gab] <i>She doesn't love you!</i>

191
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,524
<i>All I want is for us</i>
<i>to start all over again.</i>

192
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,068
[Gab] <i>With that woman?</i>

193
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,736
<i>That will never happen.</i>

194
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,822
<i>Shari doesn't love</i>
<i>you and she will never love you.</i>

195
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,616
<i>He made the wedding real</i>

196
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,743
<i>not out of love but for revenge!</i>

197
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,912
[Tomas] <i>Gab,</i>
<i>he wasn't trying to get revenge, okay?</i>

198
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,455
<i>He got us married because he knew</i>

199
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,207
<i>he was about to disappear from your life.</i>

200
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,292
<i>He only did</i>
<i>that because he loved you so much.</i>

201
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,213
[Philip] <i>All I ever want…</i>

202
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,008

204
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,931

205
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,684

211
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,624
What have I done, Shari?

212
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,336
I only ended up hurting my daughter more.

213
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,635
Love, whatever you did…

214
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,470
you did it because you love her.

215
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,182
You only wanted
what's best for her, right?

216
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,185
And if it makes you feel better,

217
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,522
if I were in your position,
I would've done the exact same thing.

218
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,483
I would've married Gab off to Tomas too.

219
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,196
That boy might seem like a joker, but…

220
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,575
I'm convinced he's sincere.

221
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,743

223
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,582
And I ruined that too.

224
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,710
I'm sure Gab's angry at Tomas now.

225
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,505
Love…

226
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,299
I wouldn't worry so much.

227
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,177
In time, Gab will understand.

228
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,179
I mean…

229
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,347
knowing her, it might take a while.

[chuckles]

231
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,560

00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,774
I hope you're right.

Let's go home.

235
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,656
I'm sure the baby's tired too.

That's one of
the things I learned from you.

I owe you so much, sir.

Sir, sorry for slipping
out all of a sudden earlier.

If I'm the reason
you called, I'm really sorry.

Just check.
