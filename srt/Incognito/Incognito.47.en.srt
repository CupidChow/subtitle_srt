<i>Three days.</i>

<i>After that,</i>

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,138
<i>we'll give the hard drive to Contractor.</i>

8
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:17,308

10

<i>This won't be easy for you.</i>

11
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,899
<i>Our contract is to secure</i>
<i>the Escalera's hard drive.</i>

12
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,818
<i>We need to call Auntie Isabel.</i>

13
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,529
<i>She has to let them know that</i>
<i>we still have the hard drive.</i>

14
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,614
<i>- Or else…</i>
<i>- They'll kill us.</i>

15
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,534

<i>We're missing something.</i>

<i>Traces.</i>

19
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>I'm sure they left some</i>

20

23
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,182
Are we seriously going
to deceive the contractor?

24

Max, no.

25
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,728
We'll still give him the hard drive.

26
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,688
I accepted the contract, didn't I?

27
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,608
I just need to get
information from Isabel.

Do you hear yourself?

29
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,781
This isn't cool, guys.

30
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,159
Of course, I have no choice

31
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,745

since we're all in on it.

32

You know, Max,

33
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,000
when we decided to help Andres

34
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,502
with the hard drive,

35
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,089
we didn't think that
it'll be our next contract.

36
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,884
Relax, Max. We're not guilty.

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,012
But then why don't we just tell him now?

38
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,514
Not yet, Max.

39
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,307
Three days.

Alright.

00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,990
I'll play along.

any of your plans.

That way, I can infiltrate the system

- Who knows.
- [Gab chuckles dryly]

66

So, this is real love?

We'll see.

I just remembered my mom.

82

Being a martyr for love
is what killed her.

83

But what about me?

84
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,891
What about me who got left behind?

[Gab] Clear.

108
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,306
Only three people did this.

109
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,601
What do you think?

[unsettling music playing]

111
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,820
Everything seemed to be planned.

112
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,159
What could possibly be their motive?

113
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,831
They probably want money

114
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,290
in exchange for the hard drive.

115
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,087
No.

116
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,381
I think it's personal.

117
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,386
Why so?

118
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,515
Because if they're the Escalera's enemies,

119
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,602
the authorities or the media
would've gotten wind of it.

120
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,689
But so far, we haven't
heard any news about it.

121
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,108
And if it's about money?

122
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,528
Why do they have to look for it?

123
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,405
They can easily pay them.

124
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,407
- [Tomas] You're so smart, Doc.
- [Miguel] So…

125
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,451
Buy us drinks.

126
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,119
No, I'm kidding.

127
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,829
Treat us to dinner next time.

128
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,831
But what if it's personal?

129
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,916
It might take us forever

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,252
to investigate their enemies one by one.

131
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,213
It's definitely for personal reasons.

132
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,007
Whoever took the hard drive

133
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,676
is looking for a piece of information

134
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,598
or wants to cover up something.

00:07:53,973 --> 00:08:00,980
[unsettling music continues]

136
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,408
Sir, I don't think we'll find
anything in here.

137
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,409
[Gab] Hold on.

138
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,288
I think we got something here.

139
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,708
Yup.

140
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,594
We can trace whose gun
this bullet is from.

141
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,933
I'll take care of it.

142
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,226
Give it to me.

143
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,186

Okay.

155
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,710
But we can't open the
masterlist in a crowded place.

156
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,004
It's too dangerous. You know that.

157
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,005
I know.

158
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,799
We'll leave together.

where we won't be followed

161
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,099
and isn't guarded by my husband's men.

162
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,102
Okay.

Team, the bullet was traced
to Clover Escalera.

170
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,009
So, we've reached a dead end, sir?

171
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,346
Diamond was at La Vida Royale.

172
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,222
Which means he followed someone there.

173
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,600
Max, take a look
at their guest list for that night.

174
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,187
Yes, sir.

175
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,148
[Miguel] Sir, if they were following them,

176
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:54,445
it's just logical
that we follow the Escaleras.

177
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:59,492
[suspenseful music continues]

178
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,202
I bet Diamond is in hiding now.

179
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,330
That's why we're going to follow
the person who's not hiding,

180
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,915
and that's Isabel Escalera.

181
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,917
[Miguel] But, sir…

182
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,837
based on our previous missions,

183
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,133
Isabel Escalera has nothing
to do with Timor's operations.

184
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,011
But Miguel, she is still an Escalera.

185
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,723
We need to look at all the possibilities

186
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,934
just to make sure we catch Diamond.

187
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,437
Sorry, sir. But wouldn't that waste time?

188
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,690
We should just target Diamond directly.

189
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,110
Gab has a point, sir.

190
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,196
In any case,

191
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,615
we should be thorough.

192
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,699
So, Max,

193
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,412
find all information about
Isabel Escalera's location.

194
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,331
Yes, sir.

195
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,627
[suspenseful music crescendos]

196
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,634
I need to go to Isabel's now.
I can't let them see me there.

197
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,885
I'll go with you.

198
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,012
We can't take any chances.

199
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,307
Isabel was still Timor's wife.
It's too dangerous.

200
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,767
She might betray you.

201
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,228
Alright.

202
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,479
But what about Max?

203
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,897
[sighs]

204
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,607
There is nothing we can do.

205
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,901
She said herself.

206
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,112
She doesn't want to know our plans.

207
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,323
[tense music playing]

208
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,533
Alright.

209
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,118
So, let's go? Come on.

210
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,202
Okay.

211
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,874

213

[tense music continues]

214
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,922
[footsteps approaching]

215
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,799
[Gab] Max, how do you do that?

216
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,303
Do what?

217
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,515
I mean, how do you manage to find stuff

218
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,517
that's so hard to find?

219
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,687
- [keys clacking]
- Ah, it's easy,

220
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,690
The Internet has all the
information that we need.

221
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,609
Oh, the Internet?

222
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,194
[scoffs]

223
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,906
Well… have you found anything?

224
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,910
[tense music continues]

225
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,036
This.

226
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,120
[Gab scoffs]

227
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,210
Got ya.

228
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,505
Alright.

229
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,006
That was fast. You're amazing, Max.

230
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,716
I'll tell the Contractor
that you've found something.

231
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,717
Alright.

232
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:29,642
[tense music continues]

233
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,404
I'm here, near your condo.

234
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,114
Okay.

235
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,200
[exhales] Wait for me.

236
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,785
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

237
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,787
[sighs]

238
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:06,512
[tense music continues]

239
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,896
[Diamond] Bruno, if you don't hurry up

240
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,023
and get to Auntie Isabel,

241
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,110
I'll have the Elcano kill you first!

242
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:30,452
[tense music continues]

243
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:42,965

[tense music turns suspenseful]

245
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,698
Did you bring what I'm looking for?

246
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:12,995
[dramatic music continues]

247
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,123
Where's this place you're talking about?

248

[dramatic music continues]

[phone vibrating]

250
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,810
[Greg] <i>JB, where are you?</i>

251
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,398
We're on our way
to Isabel Escalera's condo.

252
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,692
We'll wait for Diamond there.

253
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,196
<i>When he arrives,</i>

254
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,530
<i>we will snatch him</i>

255
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,616
and get the information
about the hard drive.

256
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,202
I'll call Andres now.

257
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,622
Max will send you the exact location.

258
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,499
Follow us immediately.

259
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,501
Got it?

260
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,713
JB!

261
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,384
Yes, sir.

262
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,010
Copy.

263
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,305
Good.

264
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:21,814
[dramatic music continues]

265
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,691
Game.

266
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:39,915
[dramatic music intensifies]

267
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,293
[engine revving]

268
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:51,885
[ominous music playing]

269
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:12,448
[ominous music continues]

270

[car revving]

[suspenseful music playing]

272
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,817
Where's the hard drive?

273
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,696
[exhales sharply]

274
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:04,208
[suspenseful music continues]

275
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,007
Give it to me.

276
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,218
I'll take care of it.

277
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,805
[tense music playing]

278
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,306
[Isabel sighs]

279
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,686
I'm sure by now, you've already tried
to open the hard drive.

280
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,816
And you've seen a lot of information

281
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,317
about Timor's operation

282
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,278
and the people he had transactions with.

283
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,906
But those things,

284
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,033
they do not concern you.

285
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,912
[tense music continues]

286
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:42,996
Exactly.

287
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,833
I only care about finding my brother.

288
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,000
That's all I want.

289
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,337
That's why I need you to give it to me,

290
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,131
so I can take a look at it

291
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,715
and tell you what you need to know.

292
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,008
But it's not that easy.

293
00:18:55,092 --> 00:19:00,013
[tense music continues]

294
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,807
You need my help, right?

295
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,185
Look.

296
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,814
I don't have much time
so either you give it to me…

297
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:10,899
or not.

298
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:17,322
[dramatic music playing]

299
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,282
Alright.

300
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,785
When you open this,

301
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,080
I need to be there with you.

<i>We have to do everything to get it back.</i>

307
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,017
<i>They're hunting down</i>
<i>everybody on the payroll.</i>

308
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,394
<i>And you're on the masterlist,</i>
<i>so you'll be targeted too.</i>

309
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,606
<i>As soon as you see Diamond, grab him.</i>

310
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,107

<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

311
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,025

312
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,401

313
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,321
<i>Get moving. Don't let them</i>

315

316
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,824
<i>End it now!</i>

317
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,284
<i>Give me the hard drive!</i>
