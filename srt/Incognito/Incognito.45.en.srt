00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:01,835
It's in a hard drive.

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:05,005
That masterlist contains
all their contacts

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,924
and everyone involved
in their illegal operations.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,218
This is the kind that can
bring down governments.

5
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,220
The hard drive with the masterlist?

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,015
That data can't get out.
It's too dangerous.

7
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,933
JB, this is going to be a problem!

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,310
- I know.
- So, what do we do?

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,603
I don't know yet.

10
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,231
He'll be angry if he finds out,

11
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,025
so you better keep your mouth shut.

12
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,528
Or else, you'll answer to me.

13
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,322
Information. That's all I need.

14
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,699
What information?

15
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,534
His name is Jun.

16
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,702
He's my brother.

17
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,704
One of the kids you sold.

18
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,997
Where did you get that?

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,498
It doesn't matter.

20
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,212
Auntie!

[theme music playing]

22
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,515
We need to talk.

[suspenseful music playing]

24
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,281
You may go.

25
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,202
- [Andres] Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

26
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:02,914
Come in.

27
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,499
Thank you!

28
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,003
Wow! Who is your interior designer?

29
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,214
You didn't have to flex this hard.

30
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,511
I'm loving the new place.

31
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,013
Such a wonderful bachelorette pad.

32
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,098
Diamond,

33
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,433
you know for a fact

34
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,019
that I don't want you coming here.

35
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,106
Auntie,

36
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,025
you've long quit the group.

37
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,446
But who else knows about it aside from us,

38
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,282
Donato,

39
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,284
Uncle…

40
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,119
Exactly.

41
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,457
My son and my husband are both dead.

42
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,419
So don't drag me into your problems.

43
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,505
I can't help it, Auntie.

44
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,300
We need your help.

45
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,804
I think they're trying to cut us
off from the organization.

46
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,931
Well then, so be it!

47
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,892
So you're just going to let us die?!

48
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,519
What if they also go after you?!

49
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,606
[Diamond inhales deeply, sighs sharply]

50
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,192
It's been one thing after another.

51
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,904
From Uncle's death…

52
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,698
to Donato's.

53
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,825

[inhales sharply]

55
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,579
The masterlist is missing.

56

What?

57
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,210
It's missing?

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,087
Yes, Auntie.

65
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,503
Do they already know?

66
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,341
Not yet, but they're asking for it.

67
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,304
We need to get ahead of whoever took it

68
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,431
so we can hand it over to them.

69
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,602
El Cano must not find out that
we don't have the hard drive.

70
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,897
We need to do something.

71
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:38,528
[tense music continues]

72
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,904
You know what?

73
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,449
Diamond, I really don't care…

74
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,994
because that's not my problem anymore.

75
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,705
So, will you just leave?

76
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,748
Auntie.

77
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,417
[exhales heavily]

78
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,835
Please.

79
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,004
I'm asking you nicely.

80
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,007
Talk to them,

81
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,885
or they'll wipe us all out.

82
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,596
Leave!

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,144

- Hmm?

After you put our clothes away,

104
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,626
get some rest, okay?

105
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,002
- Okay, Grandma.
- All right.

Isn't that him?

185
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:22,413
[unsetting music continues]

186
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,917
So you're saying he's the
same guy with auntie earlier?

187
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,502
Positive.

188
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,506
The eyes, the build, his body…

189
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,591
it's him.

190
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:41,098
He's one of the guys
who stole the hard drive.

191
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:45,728
[unsettling music continues]

192
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,896
So that means…

193
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,899
…auntie had it stolen?

194
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,902
She has the hard drive.

195
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:59,033
[pensive music plays]

196
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,202

[officer] Move!

199
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,501
[officer] Go!

200
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,587
We're not done yet, you bastard!

201
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,589
Go ahead, sir, take him in.

202
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:25,351
[foreboding music playing]

203
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,686
JB, thank you.

204
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,480
No problem.

205
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:39,657
[foreboding music continues]

206
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,285
Come on, let's go inside.

207
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,713
But why?!

208
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,510
Is this her revenge because
we failed to protect Donato?!

209
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:05,599
[foreboding music continues]

210
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,684

[music fades]

214
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,207
I never thought Emil would track us here.

215
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,003
I just really missed our place,

216
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,714
so we delivered groceries there.

217
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,718
I almost got you in trouble.

218
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,307
Andres, I'm sorry.

219
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,559
[footsteps approaching]

220
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,311
- Sorry.
- Grandma…

221
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,897
Don't think about it.

222
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,774
Don't worry, I understand.

223
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,318
[Grandma sniffles]

224
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,404
Good thing your friend showed up.

[breathing deeply]

226
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,285
Are you hurt, Grandma?

227
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,703
- Huh?
- [Esang sobs]

228
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,996
No.

229
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,831
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

230
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,832
[sobs]

231
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,584
I'm just scared.

[sombre music playing]

233
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,088
You know how the Manalastas are.

234
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,383
That Emil?

235
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,719
He'll rot in jail.

236
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,305
- [rooster crows]
- I promise you that.

237

[suspenseful music continues]

247
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,299
What?

248
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,885
You wouldn't have opened
the door for me anyway, right?

249
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,015
I don't want us to be enemies, Auntie.

250
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,102
Come on, put that down.

251
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,606
It's okay.

252
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,734
It's alright. It's okay.

[suspenseful music continues]

254
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,118
What else do you want?

255
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,495
Where is the hard drive?

256
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,706
Just give it to us.

257
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,084
I told you…

258
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,920
I don't care about you anymore!

259
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,798
Mmh. [chuckles]

260
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,717
Is that why that person
you were with earlier…

261
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,928
the one who stole the masterlist?

262
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:52,516
[suspenseful music continues]

263
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,518
[sighs]

264

If you don't want all of us to die…

265
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,190
give it to me now!

Grandma, I'm just going out for a while.

270
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,506
Let your friend come inside.

271
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,300
JB, right?

272
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,719
So I can thank him properly.

273
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,013
Alright.

[exhales deeply] Ma'am.

280
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,704
I'll help you with your brother.

281
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,331
Jun, right?

00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:03,128
[suspenseful music playing]

283
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,130
I'll remember more

284
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,634
if we can access the records
in the masterlist.

285
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:14,098
[suspenseful music continues]

286
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,891
Ma'am, I already told you..

287
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,018
I don't know anything about that.

288
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,985
Dear, I know you have it.

289
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,322
You wouldn't know the things you know

290
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,408
if you hadn't accessed it.

291
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:38,622
[suspenseful music continues]

292
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,082
I don't know anything.

293
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,878
Are you really going to stand by that?

294
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,131
That you don't know anything?

295
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:54,138
[suspenseful music continues]

296
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,390
I'll be gone in three days.

297
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:02,312
If you have the master list
or you know where it is,

298
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,814
bring it to me.

299
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,982
Or else…

300
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,151
[suspenseful music intensifies]

301
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,737
you lose your chance to find your brother.

302
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,988
Got it?

303
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,614

308
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,386
How's your grandma?

309
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,681
She's fine now.

310
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,308
Thanks again.

- [pensive music continues]
- [JB sighs]

312
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,981
Has Contractor talked to you
about the new contract?

313
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,610
New contract?

314
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,112
Didn't he call you?

315
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,823
He did.

316
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,117
But he said we'd talk about it in person.

317
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,414
Andres.

318
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,584
There's a new contract.

319
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,629
The masterlist,

320
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,506
the hard drive you have.

321
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:18,180
[ominous music playing]

322
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,183
How is the hard drive a contract?

323
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:24,937
[sighs]

324
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,814
The government is cleaning up.

325
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,066
They want the hard drive found

326
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,111
because of the confidential files inside.

327
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,615
I already accepted the contract, Andres.

328
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,703
We'll talk to Contractor,

329
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,415
tell him we already have the hard drive.

330
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,000
Boom, mission accomplished--

331
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,294
Wait, JB, that's not possible.

332
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,088
Andres.

333
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,715
You've already got the
information you need.

334
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,925
What's the problem?

335
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:03,225
[suspenseful music playing]

336
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,185
I already met with Isabel Escalera.

337
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,694
You revealed yourself to Isabel Escalera?

338
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,698
There was no other way
for me to find my brother.

339
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,410
What happened?

340
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,290
She wants the hard drive…

341
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,087
in exchange for information
about my brother.

342
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,425
Andres, you can't give her
that hard drive.

343
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:45,601
[suspenseful music intensifies]

344
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,563
[suspenseful music crescendos]

345
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,110
Our contract is to secure
the Escalera's hard drive.

346
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,404
Max, trace Diamond's whereabouts.

347
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,031
Are we really going to deceive Contractor?

348
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,116
I just need to get the
information from Isabel first.

349
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,118
Tell me what you know about my brother.

350
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,120
I won't say anything unless
I have the hard drive!

351
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,121
That's not possible!

352
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,415
- Lives are at stake here!
- And I'm one of them!

353
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,125
Hurry up, Greg.

354
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,835
They're going after
everyone on the masterlist,

355
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,920
and my father is on it.

356
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,338
The Escaleras' lives are in danger,

357
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,215
we need to capture at least one of them

358
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,299
so we can get the hard drive.

359
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,011
[gunshots]

360
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,096
Team, get ready. They're here.

361
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,932
The time you asked for is up, Andres.

362
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,767
Finish things with Isabel.

363
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,687
- [grunts]
- [thuds]

364
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,398
