368
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,260
- You're included, too.
- Move!

369
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,720
You're General Antonio,
Bonifacio's son, right?

370
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,182
Aren't you curious about
what I know regarding your father?

371
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,892
Sir, he's connected to
the people who took my sibling.

372
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,352
Where's my sibling?

373
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,436
Tell me!

374
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,731
Andres, I have an army
of people working for me.

375
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,441
- [GUNSHOTS]
- Gunshots in three meters.

376
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,818
[BLOWS LANDING]

377
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,363
I thought this was a safe place.

378
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,614
How did they find us?
