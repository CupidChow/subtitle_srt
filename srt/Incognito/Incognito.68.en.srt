1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,836
<i>- It's done.</i>
<i>- Thank you, Greg.</i>

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:03,712
<i>Thank you, Mayor.</i>

3
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,630
<i>Team, congratulations.</i>

4
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,631
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

5
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,425
<i>- </i>[Tomas] <i>Thank you.</i>
<i>- </i>[Gab] <i>Thank you, sir.</i>

6
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,426
<i>What is that?</i>

7
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,302
<i>We found it in Sameo's hideout, sir.</i>

8
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,638
<i>Well, in that case, you can keep it.</i>

9
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,848
<i>Aside from that,</i>

10
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,641
<i>you'll also get your salary</i>
<i>from the contract.</i>

11
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,309
[Tomas]<i> Alright! </i>[chuckles]

12
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,020
<i>Fifty million. Just like we discussed.</i>

13
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>I'll do what I can with it.</i>

14
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,648
<i>Hey, man.</i>

15
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,192
<i>Do everything you can</i>
<i>to get my father out.</i>

16
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,820
<i>When have I ever let you down, buddy?</i>

17
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,991
<i>- Miguel.</i>
<i>- Tomorrow, I'll bring you the money</i>

18
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,909
<i>at the place we agreed upon.</i>

19
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,327
<i>Everything's set, Boss Edward.</i>

20
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,579
<i>Are you sure?</i>

21
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,582
<i>I suppose you don't want</i>
<i>to end up like your friend…</i>

22
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,624
<i>Victor.</i>

23
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,876
<i>Twenty million.</i>

24
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,171
<i>For my son.</i>

[door opens]

27
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,443
I already saw that the other day.

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,827
[dramatic music playing]

29
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,412
Be honest with me, Andres.

30
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,127
My head is starting to hurt
from overthinking.

31
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,133
Where did you get all that money?

32
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:20,223
[dramatic music builds, fades]

33
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,518
[footsteps approaching]

34
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,270
[Gab] Good afternoon!

35
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,521
Gab.

36
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,733
[bag thuds]

37
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,614
[Gab] It's still not enough.

38
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,200
Give me a few weeks, not even a month.

39
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,077
I'll pay for the house in full.

40
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,164
Love…

41
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,707
I already found a buyer?

42
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,710
It would be rude
to back out all of a sudden.

43
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,129
I don't think it's rude, Dad.

44
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:55,091
Especially if it's the original owner's
daughter who is buying the house.

45
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,176
[Shari] Yes, but we've already
set a meeting for later.

46
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,138
- I can't back out--
- I'm not talking to you.

47
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,681
Stop butting in. Here you go.

48
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,099
- Gab.
- That's real money.

49
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,851
- [money thuds, gab scoffs]
- Gab!

50
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:05,977
Get back here!

51
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,896
Gab!

52
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,318
- [pensive music playing]
- Let's talk.

53
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,403
Let's talk this out, dear.

54
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,573
[pensive music continues]

55
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,657
Okay.

56
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,620
But if you want to say something,

57
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,289
say them in front of Mama.

58
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,752
[pensive music continues]

59
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,878
[Philip sighs]

60
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,051
What's your job?

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,969
Tell me.

62
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,937
[sobs]

63
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,147
You disappear for days,

64
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,443
then you come home with a lot of bruises

65
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,237
and carrying such
a huge amount of money.

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,365
What do you expect I'd think, huh?!

67
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,741
Answer me!

68
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,790
[breath quivers, exhales deeply]

69
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,380
[morose music playing]

70
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,464
Grandma…

71
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,467
Even if I want to tell you, I can't.

72
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,594
[Esang inhales deeply]

73
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,227
I raised you properly.

74
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,897
[morose music continues]

75
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,818
Because I wanted to make sure
that when you grew up,

76
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,908
[sobs] you wouldn't do something bad.

77
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,662
[breath quivering]

78
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,624
[pensive music playing]

79
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,667
Grandma…

80
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,798
- I'm not hurting anyone…
- [Esang sniffles]

81
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,469
…or scamming people to get that money.

82
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,265
I promise that.

83
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:14,355
[pensive music continues]

84
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,694
- [door slams]
- [Esang sniffles]

85
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,617
[pensive music fades]

86
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,246
[birds chirping]

87
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,248
- [cane thuds]
- [footsteps approaching]

88
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,709
[JB] Dad.

89
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,924
- [chair scrapes]
- [Antonio thuds]

90
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,009
[Antonio exhales deeply]

91
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,429
Son, how are you?

92
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,638
[JB sighs]

93
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,725
I should be the one asking you that, Dad.

94
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,479
Then just tell me a story.

95
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,357
How are things outside?

96
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,028
[JB breathes deeply]

97
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,118
Does Madel's stew taste delicious now?

98
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,581
[JB chuckles softly]

99
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:24,550
[crickets chirping]

100
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,432
I know it's hard.

101
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,522
It took me so long to recover
from her death.

102
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,442
I loved your mother.

103
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,028
Bullshit.

104
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,282
Say what you want to say.

105
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,076
But it's the truth.

106
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,250
You and your mistress upstairs…

107
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,089
You two are the reason Mama died,
so I'll never forgive you.

108
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,176
I never wanted the accident to happen.

109
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,344
Oh, really?

110
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,847
[Philip] Gab…

111
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,224
- When that happened…
- [Gab sniffs]

112
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,561
[exhales sharply]

113
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,355
…your mother and I had
long been separated.

114
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,359
We had already talked.
We were just waiting for the right time

115
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,278
- to tell you.
- Stop!

116
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,030
Stop lying!

117
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,158
- Gab…
- What?

118
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,618
You're just trying to clear your name…

119
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,996
because your conscience
is eating you up.

120
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,832
Listen to me.

121
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,958
[Gab huffs]

122
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,918
I'm telling the truth.

123
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,713
On the day of the accident,

124
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,673
she was mad at me

125
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,550
because she thought

126
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,011
I would introduce you to Shari right away.

127
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,721
Are you trying to say it was Mama's fault?

128
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,889
[Philip] No!

129
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,309
What I'm trying to say is…

130
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,605
we had been separated for almost a year

131
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,399
without you knowing!

132
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:09,780
[crickets chirping]

133
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,664
Fine.

134
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,500
[inhales deeply]

135
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,585
Alright.

136
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,922
You two had already separated by then.

137
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,549
I see.

138
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,763
But that didn't mean
Mama was okay with this.

139
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,809
Do you know what she'd tell me
whenever we saw each other?

140
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,895
[pensive music playing]

141
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,397
That she'd die loving only you.

142
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,274
[Gab breathes shakily]

143
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,944
[exhales sharply]

144
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,904
[pensive music continues]

145
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,572
I hurt your mother's feelings.

146
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,658
I know that.

147
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,494
What about me?

148
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,251
Since then, you've also
been hurting my feelings.

149
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,879
Do you know that?

150
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,007
[inhales deeply]

151
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,969
[exhales sharply]

152
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,180
[pensive music continues]

153
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,974
Break up with her.

154
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,643
Break up with your mistress.

155
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,894
Gab!

156
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,729
[Gab] If you're really telling the truth

157
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,107
that you didn't mean for it to happen,
then break up with her!

158
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,318
[sighs deeply]

159
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,280
You're important to me, dear.

160
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,159
But Shari's important in my life, too.

161
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,745
Then you have to decide.
Who are you going to choose?

162
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,459
Me or your mistress?

163
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:50,631
[pensive music continues]

164
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,220
- [pensive music fades]
- [crickets chirping]

165
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,680
I can't.

166
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,684
[somber music playing]

167
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,185
I love you both.

168
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,187
She doesn't love you!

169
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,940
She only loves your money!

170
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,192
Don't you see that?

171
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,321
Is that really what you think?

172
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,574
That she's only after my money?

173
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,078
That no one could ever love your father?

174
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,834
All I want is for us to start over again.

175
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,210
[Gab] With that woman?

176
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,672
Us three together? Fuck no!

177
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,673
Fuck.

178
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,300
That will never happen.

179
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,303
Shari doesn't love you,
and she never will never love you!

180
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:44,268
[footsteps receding]

181
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:50,941
[somber music continues]

182
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:59,492
[breathing heavily]

183
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,247
[sniffles]

184

00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,303
[Tomas] Where is it?

188
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,015
Jeez, Uncle this is so confusing.

189

[Uncle] <i>Right, left, left, right.</i>

190
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,981
No. [huffs]

Huh?

194
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,865
What?

195
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,033
What?

Has Uncle turned into some kind
of supernatural creature?

- What are you doing?
- What?

225
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,186
- Did you just curse at me?
- No!

226
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,271
What were you thinking?
You almost hit me!

227
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,439
I thought you're a loan shark.

228
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,650
You didn't tell me
you're also involved in drugs!

229
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,692
[Uncle] You bastard!

230
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,402
You're so stupid!

231
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,239
I already gave you instructions,
but you didn't follow them!

232
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,866
Uncle, I knocked, didn't I?

233
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,744
I told you to knock three times
so I'd know if it was you.

234
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,704
Uncle, you should've just called me.

235
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,290
Whatever! Just shut up.

[quirky music continues]

237
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,044
People outside might hear you.

238

You want…

You want it to go faster, huh? [chuckles]

245
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,857
I love this, Papa!

- Thank you!

247

Oh no, you crashed!

248

249
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,365

00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,164
Yes. Thank you, Papa!

254

Anything for you, baby boy.

[Tomas] Uncle…

264
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,336
You really think you won't be
recognized looking like that?

265
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,882
[laughing softly]

266
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,968
- I'm serious.
- [Tomas continues laughing]

267
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,595
Okay, I'm sorry.

268
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,555
If I get caught,

269
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:36,226
it'll take millions to bail me out.

270
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,230
[sighs deeply] I know, Uncle.
But don't worry…

271
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:46,862
You can take that disguise off.
Whatever it costs, I'll pay for it.

272
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,572
- Really?
- Of course!

273
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,741
- When have I ever lied?
- All the time.

274
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,118
- Fine, I'm not paying then.
- Hey, I'm kidding! Come on!

275
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,954
I'm just kidding! [sighs]

276
00:15:55,037 --> 00:16:00,584
Truth is, I'm lucky because
you're such a good kid.

277
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,173
You look timid right now.

278
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,092
It doesn't suit you. Don't be like that.

279
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,387
[chuckles]

280
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,516
I just want everything settled.

281
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,935
I'm done with all the threats.

282
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:22,523
Now, call Attorney Pretty
so she can handle it.

283
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,649
[sighs deeply]

284
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,402
Oh?

285
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,404
What? You still haven't made it up to her?

286
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,655
You idiot.

287
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,949
- She's just too fussy.
- Really?

288
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,159
Whatever! Just forget her.
I'm starving.

289
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,536
Got any food here?

290
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,126
Thank you.

291
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,420
- It's still hot.
- It's fine.

292
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,756
Look at Mickey.

293
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,509
He looks very happy.

294
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,513
Miguel…

295
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,225
I'm planning to take Mickey to the UK.

296
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,603
We'll be staying there for good.

I'll go back to our place.

I've got some good news.

Someone told me…

316
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:58,971
that Jun wasn't sold.

317
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,850
He escaped.

You mean, Jun's alive?

Yes.

321

You didn't raise me like that.

335
