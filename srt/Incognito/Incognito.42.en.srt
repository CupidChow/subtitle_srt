Is that the only tattoo you got

185
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,783
during your military service?

186
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,118
Yes.

187
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,913
I took it as part of a…

188
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,415
covert operation.

189
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,543
What operation?

190
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,923
[exhales sharply]

191
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,508
And what group was that?

192
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,720
JB.

193
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,098
There are things I did during my service

194
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,892
that shouldn't be discussed
out in the open.

195
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,604
There are protocols of confidentiality

196
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,899
that blood can't breach.

197
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,195
I was working as a spy in the government.

198
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,908
So, let's just leave it at that, okay?

But…

202
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,917
[Antonio] You should go home.

203
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,003
We already have security outside.

Hello, JB?

213
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,427
Can we meet?

220
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,835
Hey, Attorney.

221
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,005
You look different today.
You're even prettier.

222
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,507
[chuckles] Thank you.

223
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,884
This is just how I look on my days off.

224
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,928
Come on, dig in.

225
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,721
- Let's eat.
- Wait.

226
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,806
Sorry.

227
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,307
- Did I disturb you?
- No.

228
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,809
It's okay. Don't worry.

229
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,103
I also want to make sure

230
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,896
that he wasn't harmed by my da…

231
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,234
I mean, to make sure
that Tomas got home safely.

232
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,778
He hasn't come home yet.

233
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,323
You know,

234
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,325
when Tom has these moments,

235
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,495
he'd always go to his brother's bakery.

236
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,999
Huh? He has a brother?

237
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,835
Yes, he has two siblings.

238
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,628
They all have different fathers.

239
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,799
After his mother gave birth
to the third one,

240
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,885
she died.

241
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,597
After that, the three of them
were separated.

242
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,520
Where's the bakery located?

Have a seat.

248
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,301
Good morning.

249
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,346
Coffee.

[china rattling]

253
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,684
So, how have you been?

254
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,398
I'm good, sir.

255
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,028
I heard the news,

256
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,696
Jake Dela Cuesta was murdered

257
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,949
and you were called in for questioning.

258
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,535
[foreboding music playing]

259
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,787
Yes, sir.

260
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,580
That's true, but…

261
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,499
but, sir…

262
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,001
they couldn't do anything.

263
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,879
They can't even hold me in jail.

264
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,090
Because, sir,

265
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,717
I know nothing of this.

266
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,097
Why do they suspect you?

267
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,601
I don't know, sir. Maybe it's just…

268
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,479
It's just…

269
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,606
You know,

270
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,317
me and my ex-wife…

271
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,612
[exhales deeply, clears throat]

272
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,031
We're going through
a lot of things right now.

273
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,908
But I assure you, sir,

274
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,910
everything is under control.

275
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,498
Okay, just let me know

276
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,291
if I can help you in any way.

277
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,794
You have nothing to worry about, sir.

00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,505
[ominous music playing]

279
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,883
I will still be your good soldier, sir.

280
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,304
Just ask me where to point my gun,

281
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,306
and I will shoot.

282
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,188
I need the money for me and my son.

283
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,607
That's why…

284
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,485
I need to constantly work for you.

285
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,700
Good to know, Miguel.

286
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,912
Thank you, sir.

287
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,297
Hello, Grandma.

288
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,923
How are you?

289
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,511
We're doing good.

290
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,307
When are you coming home?

292
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,603
That's the reason I called.

293
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,314
I still have some things to take care of.

294
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,732
I can't go home yet.

295
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,400
[Esang] <i>If you're coming home,</i>

296
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,027
tell me.

297
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,197
So I can cook you your favorite.

298
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,908
I will.

299
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,577
I'll call you again, Grandma. Take care.

300
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,704
Take care, dear.

301
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,624
Was that Andres?

302
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,584
Yes.

303
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,003
He'll be mad at us.

304
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,216
He'll only get mad if he finds out.

305
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,094
So make sure to keep your mouths shut.

306
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,513
If not, I'm the one who will be angry.

Yes.

315
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,383

It's pointing towards Isabel Escalera.
