[Kenji] <i>That is Greg Paterno's group.</i>

[sobbing] Jun is gone.

Uncle, I didn't know
that they'd go after you.

[sighs]
I'm sorry you got involved in this mess.

59
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,599
[exhales sharply] Is this
the job you were talking about?

[exhales]

61
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,940
Yes. Yes, Uncle.

62
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,817
But don't worry. I'll quit that job.

63
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,152
- I'm not--
- No, don't.

64
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,030
We'll always have
to face danger in our lives.

65
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:04,118
I mean, I almost died
because I got involved in a scam.

66
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,539
And besides,
don't you earn a lot from that job?

67
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,753
Right, daughter-in-law?

68
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,258
Can you knock some
sense into your husband?

69
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,973
You need to be practical
and look for ways to get rich.

70
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,852
We'll die faster if we don't have money.

71
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,399
Don't worry about what happened to me.

72
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,776
It's a good thing Gab was there.

73
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,696
You've got an awesome wife, Tomas.

74
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,575
She's pretty and smart.

75
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,538
And she's one hell of a fighter.

77
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,007

Get some rest, okay?

Don't mention it.

85

Are you okay?

86
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,410
Yeah, I'm okay.

[crickets continue chirping]

91
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,103
You should rest.

92
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,609
Andres, I can't leave yet.

93
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,195
I told Contractor
that I'd keep you company.

94
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,115
I'm okay now. You should go home.

95
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,244
There's still danger.

96
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,666
What else is there to lose, Miguel?

97
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,337
My brother is gone.

[somber music playing]

99
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,010
Alright. I understand.

100
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,098
But if you need someone to talk to,

101
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,433
just call me, okay?

102
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:39,107

I'm here for you, okay?

How are you feeling?

[JB inhales, exhales heavily]

113
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,863
I'm still having a hard time, sir.

114
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,492
What happened?

115
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,873
[unsettling music continues]

116
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,208
Barrios has been eliminated.

117
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,172
What about Jun?

118
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,008
How is Jun?

[exhales sharply]

127
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,543
I haven't spoken to him yet.

128
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,839
But…

129
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,093
I promised him
that his brother wouldn't get hurt.

[ECG continues beeping]

131
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,060
What's your next move?

132
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,232
Right now, this is what we know.

133
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,778
I'm sure that El Cano was

134
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,531
behind the assassination of Barrios.

135
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,740
[dramatic music sting]

136
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,493
For sure, it had something
to do with their mining operations.

137
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,204
You see, Barrios had
a mining site shut down.

138
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,915
So, for now…

139
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,377
that's where I'll start my investigation.

140
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,005
Sir.

I know it's hard for you.

148

It's hard for me, too.

149
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,583
Diego was like a brother to me.

150
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,252
Where is he?

151
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,755
Where's my brother's body?

152
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,469
I was about to ask
you because I don't know either.

153
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,972
I know that you know.

154
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,850
You've been with him for so long.

155
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,895
- Sorry.
- Come on, Selo!

156
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,192
I hadn't seen my brother in two decades.

157
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,987
I just want to give him a proper burial!

158
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,196
That's it!

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,781
That's all I want!

160

[ominous tone continues]

161
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,452
Okay.

162
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,787
I'll call someone.

Thank you.

167
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,104
Max, leave that to the nurse.

168
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,939
It's okay. I can do it.

169
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,860
How are you feeling?

[sighs]

171
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,948
Could be better.

172
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,287
I spoke to Dr. Carpio.

173
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,248
They said you had a seizure
when they were treating your wounds.

Sure.

So, how are you feeling now,
Mr. Bonifacio?

183
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,836
Any breathing difficulty?
Any localized pain?

184
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,046
- [door closes]
- [ominous music playing]

185
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,714
Yes. He's here.

186
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,968
It's Andres.

187
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,512
He's looking for Diego.

188
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,224
What do you want me to do, Uncle?

189
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,019
I'll face him.

190
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,564
[Selo] <i>Are you sure?</i>

191
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,150
I can just give him an excuse.

192
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,361
No need.

193
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,196
[ominous music continues]

194
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,615
We're bound to face each other anyway.

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,952
[Selo] <i>Okay. I'll let him know.</i>

196
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:34,837
[ominous music continues]

[ominous music fades]

198
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,058
[teacher] They hid all the truth from you.

199
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,896
Every day, you follow the orders

200
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,024
of a system you don't understand.

201
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,152
They're feeding you lies.

202
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,490
They're making you chase
a dream that was never meant for you.

203
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:08,037
Remember, justice is
only for those with money.

204
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,999
Laws only favor those in power.

205
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:17,421
The people you considered family
left you without any protection.

206

[unsettling music playing]

207
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:29,600
We're the only ones
who won't turn our backs on you.

- [door opens]

[ECG monitor beeps]

219
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,335
You should get some rest, Max.

220
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,257
There are people
looking after me here anyway.

221
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,134
[zipper zips]

222
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,012
Max.

223
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,265
[pensive music playing]

224
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,892
I owe you big time.

225
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,769
Thank you.

226
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,483
[pensive music continues]

227
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,236
JB, what's really going on?

228
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,072
I know something's up.

229
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,160
[exhales heavily]

230
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,121
It's nothing.

231
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,624
[Max sighs frustratedly]

232
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,127
Extracting a bullet is
a routine in our line of work, Bonifacio.

233
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,465
What did the doctor say?
How did it happen?

234
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,009
You almost flatlined.

235
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,970
[pensive music continues]

236
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,472
Don't worry about it.

237
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,518
Is there something
you're not telling us, JB?

238
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,605
Are you hiding something?

239
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:45,736
[pensive music continues]

240
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,946
If you are,

241
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,949
whatever it is,
the Contractor should know.

242
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,204
There's nothing he needs to know, Max.

243
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,665
[pensive music swells]

244
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,333
And neither do you.

245
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,878
- Do you understand what's going on, JB?
- [music fades]

246
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,591
The next time this happens, you could die.

247
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,761
[tense music sting]

248
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,472
All of us…

249
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,475
could die anytime.

250
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,019
Don't be an asshole.

251
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:23,816
[tense music playing]

252
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,192
What disease do you have?

253
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,820
What medications are you taking?

254
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,697
[JB sighs]

255
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,408
It doesn't concern you, Max.

256
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,786
Why can't you tell me the truth?

257
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,038
[pensive music resumes]

258
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,873
[JB breathes deeply]

259
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,250
Max.

260
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,964
Ever since I started my missions,

261
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,594
I've known I was going to die eventually.

262
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:57,850
[pensive music continues]

263
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,643
But I also know…

264
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,481
that nothing can stop me,
not even a fucking disease.

265
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,649
[inhales sharply]

266
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,573
[pensive music continues]

267
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,907
So, please…

268
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,579
just let me do what I want.

269
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,458
So, I should just let you die?

270
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,547
[pensive music continues]

271
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,841
Leave me alone for now, Max.

00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,981

285
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,631
<i>He shot my son.</i>

<i>Jose Bonifacio.</i>

287
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,137
<i>Your teammate's bullet</i>

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,556
<i>If you want to blame</i>

289
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,350
<i>You're the first person</i>

290
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,060
<i>Who put him in that position?</i>

291
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,020
<i>Wasn't it you?!</i>

292
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,693
<i>Team, now we begin phase 1.</i>

293
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,321
<i>Kenji, I want to attack</i>
<i>when they least expect it.</i>

294
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,655
<i>For Diego.</i>
