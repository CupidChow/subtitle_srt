00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,718
<i>Eagle, can you trace</i>
<i>the location of Monkey's caller?</i>

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:10,927
<i>On it.</i>

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,470
<i>It's coming from inside the venue.</i>

6
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>Eagle, site cleared</i>
<i>except for this dummy phone.</i>

7
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,142
<i>I've got a bad feeling about this.</i>

8
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,852
<i>Eagle, where's</i>
<i>the nearest parking lot here</i>

9
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,020
<i>with a basketball court?</i>

10
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,273
<i>Parking 1 and 2 both</i>

11
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,358
<i>If I save Monkey's uncle,</i>

12
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,693

13
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,777

00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,864
<i>Monkey, listen to me.</i>

16
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,241
<i>I'll make sure your uncle is safe, okay?</i>

17
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,036
<i>Monkey, turn on your comms slowly.</i>

18
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,370
<i>Monkey switched on his comms.</i>

19
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,538
<i>Good job, Monkey.</i>

<i>- Eagle, cut the CCTV.</i>
<i>- Copy.</i>

21
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,333
<i>We lost the CCTV connection.</i>

22
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,419

23
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,670
<i>They're up to something.</i>

24
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,964

Yes, Shark.

41
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,778
[host] Now, before we welcome
our guest speaker today,

42
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,824
our BENR Secretary,
Ms. Josephine Ella Barrios,

43
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:43,371
let's take a moment
to recognize some of our honorary donors.

<i>The moment Barrios steps on stage…</i>

[applause]

46
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,046
don't let her finish her speech.

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,507
Thank you so much, Mr. and Mrs. Yelcito

48
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,011
for your unwavering support
to the Rosales Foundation charity.

[Diego] <i>Go towards her</i>

Then shoot her in the head.

[Tomas] <i>I'll go towards her</i>

55
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,693

They really want to cause trouble.

60
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,055
Whoever the mastermind is, he's heartless.

61
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,266
The biggest coward.

62
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,021
Who are these people?

63
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,734
Tomas.

64
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,029
<i>If you repeat what I'm saying again,</i>

65
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,782
I'll have your family killed.

<i>Don't test me, Tomas.</i>

67
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,663
<i>I only a give warning once.</i>

Remember, I'm watching you.

[suspenseful music playing]

70
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,132
[host] Your pledge to the women's shelter
truly goes a long way,

71
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,760
in helping
the victims rebuild their lives.

72
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,263

[breathing heavily]

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,957
You don't have to do it, Monkey.

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,041
Wolf.

79
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,128
Distract the hostile
who has been following Monkey.

[tense music sting]

81
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,969
Jaguar, we meet at the exit point.

82
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,808
We'll get the package out
of here as soon as possible.

83
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,518
Eagle.

84
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,104
But Shark,
they're going to kill Monkey's uncle.

85
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,316
I won't let that happen!

86
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,693
[Miguel] <i>Have you found the van?</i>

87
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,572
I'm sure it's just here somewhere.

88
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,240
I'll find it soon.

[metal clangs]

91
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,414
One wrong move and they'll kill Monkey.

92
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,667
It's a choice between
his uncle or the people here.

Eagle, call the Contractor.

[Greg] <i>Eagle, what's your status?</i>

106
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,813
Sir, Monkey's been compromised.

107
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,983
[Selo] It's with great pleasure
to be part of this cause.

108
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,194
As you all know,

109
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,405
I was also a victim of human trafficking.

110
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,326
And because of
the people who showed compassion,

111
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,204
helped me, and took me in,

112
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,039
I made it here today.

113
00:06:55,123 --> 00:07:01,003
[tense music continues]

114
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,220
He got an anonymous
call and he's being blackmailed.

115
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,931
The caller knows that he's an usher,

116
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,309
they want him to kill the package.

117
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,229
If Tomas doesn't do it,
he and his uncle will die.

119
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:25,778
Eagle, our contract is very clear.
Protect the package no matter what.

120
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,864
But, sir…

121
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,199
<i>You know how this works.</i>

122
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,660
If you can help Monkey, then good.

123
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:36,581
But if not, you should all remember
the mission comes first.

[tense music continues]

125

We can still fix this.

130
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,735
We just need more time.

I'll handle
the package once she comes out.

Wolf, secure Monkey.

- Hey!

Do you really have to push me?

Hey!

152
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,537
- Shut up!
- You want to fight, huh?

153
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,790
Along with the establishment
of the learning center

154
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,835
for children who have
survived human trafficking,

155
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:51,799
a big part of this
donation is not from me alone.

156
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,011
We'll do what we can do for now.

157
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,347
Secure the package and Monkey.

158
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,892

I'm honored to share the stage

I thought your brother left.

Why did he come back?

173
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,539
[Diego] Hello, everyone…

[Max] To go on stage?

175
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,378
Then he shouldn't
have left in the first place.

176
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,383
I actually left a while ago,

177
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,968
but my friend, Selo,

178
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,554
didn't want me to miss this.

00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,355
What's going on?

182
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,065
Why do you keep stopping?

183
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:32,858
Hey!

184
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,027
[man 2] Boss, he suddenly stopped.

185
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,904
[man 1] You keep dallying!

186
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,364
Get moving!

187
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,908
[grunting]

188
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,244
I knew this would happen! Catch him!

189
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,038
[men grunting]

190
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,417
You know,

191
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,503
for child victims,

192
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,714
only two things can happen to them.

193
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,676
Either you recover,

194
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,430
or your life will
shatter because of the trauma.

195
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:08,060
[Diego] Selo and
I were among the lucky ones.

196
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,815
We were lucky because someone took us in.

197
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,609
Someone fought for us.

198
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,405
Someone gave us a chance

199
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,116
to change our future.

200
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:29,206
[dramatic music continues]

201
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,794
And that's what we're celebrating today.

202
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,964
Each of you…

203
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,967
your generosity,

204
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,094
your compassion.

205
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,346
It matters.

206
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,224
It changes lives.

207
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,605
So, on behalf of Selo,
and other victims like us,

208
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,860
thank you so much for your kind hearts.

209
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:10,915
[dramatic music continues]

210
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,378
This night is for us.

211
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:21,550
[applause]

212
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,860
Team, listen.

213
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,820
I'll wait for the package.

214
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,657
Once she's on stage,
I will stay close to her.

215
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,451
Once the package is on stage,

216
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,995
I'm sure they'll
order Monkey to shoot her.

217
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:56,919
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [breathing heavily]

218
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,966
Miss the shot on purpose, Monkey.

219
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,511
Do you understand?

220
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,932
[breathing shakily]

221
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,729
Shark will grab the package and escape.

222
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,444
Wolf, Monkey, Jaguar, Eagle,

223
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,574
secure all the guests
and neutralize all threats.

224
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,327
Shark, it might trigger them.

225
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,581
We can't do
that with all these people here.

226
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,667
It will just cause more collateral damage.

227
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,503
Listen to me.

228
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,632
Regardless if we do it or not,
a lot of people will get hurt.

229
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
I agree.

230
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,266
Copy.

Boss!

235
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,625
Catch him!

00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,127
[grunting, groaning]

237
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,963
- How dare you escape!
- [Rolando grunting]

238
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,050
You think you can escape, huh?!

239
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,263
[suspenseful music continues]

240
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,807
[man 1] You just
can't stay still, can you?

241
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,643
You want to get beat up again?

242
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,936
[gun cocking]

243
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,562
Let's see if you're not scared of this.

244
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,649
- Ow! Ow! Aah!
- Well? How is it?

245
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,275
Where'd your toughness go?

246
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,319
- Show us what you've got!
- [Roland groans]

247
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,154
Come on!

248
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:52,910
[suspenseful music continues]

249
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,043
Barrios is coming out of her room.

250
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,379
You know what to do.

251
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,881
I want her dead.

252
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:15,474

254
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,742
Rabbit is on the move.

255
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,369
Make sure the hallway is clean.

256
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,745
No shadows.

257
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,372
Secure the stage access.

258
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:46,672
[suspenseful music playing]

259
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,966
[host] Ladies and gentlemen,

260
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,510
it is truly an honor to welcome someone

261
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,013
whose work has made a real difference.

262
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,807
Even as an environment secretary,

263
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,517
she's been actively supportive

264
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,270
of any cause against human trafficking.

265
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,813
In fact, just recently,

266
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,025
she helped in rescuing
victims from forced labor

267
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,568
of a mining company.

268
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,530
She continues to help
those who cannot help themselves.

269
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,242

[host] Friends, a round of applause

272
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,753
to our BENR secretary,

273
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,006
Ms. Josephine Ella Barrios.

274
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,674
- [applause]
- [Josephine] Thank you.

275
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,470

[applause continues]

00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,602
Thank you so much.

Thank you all for being here.

- [foreboding music playing]
- [loud footsteps echoing]

280
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:10,464
We gathered here
tonight not just to celebrate

281
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:15,636
but also to stand up for
people who can't speak up.

[heart beating loudly]

284
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,367
A lot of people ask me why I'm here.

285
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,998
They say I should just
focus on environmental issues.

286
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,711
Whichever department I'm assigned to,

287
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,507
- I will help and support causes like this.
- [loud footsteps echoing]

288
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,386
For kids who were robbed of their rights

289
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,222
and families who were
ruined because of human trafficking.

290
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,682
Monkey, don't do it.

- Monkey.

293
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,107
- Don't do it.
- <i>…as long as there's abuse.</i>
