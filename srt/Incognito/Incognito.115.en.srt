- Greg.
- Give me the channels,

205

assets, and intel pertaining to El Cano.

206
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,051
You know I can't just give them to you.

207
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,677
Sir, I'm begging you.

208
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,263
I don't care if it's
part of the contract or not.

209
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,434
Manuel dragged my
men's families into our fight.

I can't just let it slide.

211

Sir, this has nothing
to do with the job anymore.

212
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,315
This is personal.

[Mariano sighs]

214
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,862
Okay.

Here.

00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,046
This is new.

219
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,843
This intel's still
not verified and complete,

220
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,303
so I can't release it yet.

221
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,598
But since you're the one asking…

222
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,812
A few days ago, we received a message

223
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,691
from a boy who's been
missing for almost a year.

224
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,735
His name is Pio Magnaye.

236
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,398
- [dramatic music playing]
- We traced the message.

237
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,650
And it led us here.

238
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,906
A remote location in Lakandula.

239
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,159
Sir.

240
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,703
Not only that.

241
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,792
That's the place
we've long been suspecting

242
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,128
of being a trafficking site ran by El Cano

243
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,299
and headed by Manuel Aguinaldo.

244
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,010
[dramatic music continues]

245
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,888
Greg, the intel's too vague.

246
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,389
There's no certainty.

247
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,060
There's no clear visual confirmation.

248
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,770
General.

00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,482
[dramatic music continues]

250
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,234
I will end El Cano.

251
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,488
I'm going to kill Manuel.

253

260
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,318
I don't know him.

261
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,074
There he is.

262
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,870

<i>You're soldiers of change here.</i>

<i>you're not only one who'll get hurt.</i>
