to turn their lives around,

You know…

168
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:10,813
You spent
your whole life searching for me.

169
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,191
Just so you could meet and hug me.

170
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,904
But now…

171
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,991
allow me to change myself for you.

172
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:29,039
I just don't know when or how.

173
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,212
Or if I can do it at all.

174
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,718
