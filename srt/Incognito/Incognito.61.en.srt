[exhales sharply]

184
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,524
[grunts]

185
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,908
[birds chirping]

186
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,285
[Miguel grunts]

187
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,744
[exhales sharply]

188
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:46,836
[Miguel panting]

189
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,796
[gasps, grunts]

190
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:55,886
[water sloshing]

191
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,559
[panting]

192
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,893
Let's take five.

193
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,647
[Miguel clears throat]

194
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,609
[panting]

195
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,946
Miguel.

196
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,740
I just want to ask.

197
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,536
Are you still upset with me and JB?

198
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,833
- [panting]
- [somber music playing]

199
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,667
[sighs deeply]

200
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,252
To be honest?

201
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,382
It really doesn't matter anymore, Andres.

202
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,427
Because…

203
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,350
I understand that we all have our reasons
for each of our choices.

204
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,186
Right?

205
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:53,277
[somber music intensifies]

206
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,280
- [water splashes]
- [somber music fades]

207
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,366
- [thud]
- [exhales]

208
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,202
Stay here, okay?

209
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,578
Good boy.

210
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,877
[Max grunts]

211
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,803
It took me along time, you know.

212
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,597
And it was so hard.

213
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,143
There were times when I wanted
to follow him to the other side.

214
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:33,484
But look at me.
I'm still here. Still fighting.

215
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,613
I'm proud of you.

216
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,909
Even though we aren't that close.

217
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,661
[both chuckle softly]

218
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,247
- How about you?
- Hm?

219
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,498
How's your love life?

220
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,125
[snorts]

221
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,128
- Nope.
- Really?

222
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,712
Really.

223
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,052
So, if nosy Tomas isn't your type,

224
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,179
what kind of guy do you like?

225
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,556
The serious type?

226
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,349
[chuckles]

227
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,437
- I'd rather date a plant.
- [chuckles] A plant?

228
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,523
Come on, Gab.

229
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,193
Well, love is all fun at the beginning.

230
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,113
But when it falls apart,
it'll ruin you forever.

231
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,907
It'll wreck your whole world.

232
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,119
I was raised by that kind of love.

233
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,455
So I'm already a mess to begin with.

234
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,748
You think I can handle a boyfriend?
[scoffs]

235
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,750
Hey, I'm not a masochist.

236
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:38,215
[pensive music playing]

237
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,011

[grunts]

240
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,018
[groans]

241
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,896
Sir, wait.

242
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,148
[bags thud]

243
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,527
- Tomas!
- Hang on, sir.

244
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,696
[JB] Hey! Where are you going?

245
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,660
- Tomas!
- Just wait, sir.

246
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,829
What are you doing?

247
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,877
Sir, I think we've passed here before.
I think we're lost.

248
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,047
Tomas, don't you trust me?

249
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:23,511
I do trust you, sir. But I remember
this fence! I've seen it before!

250
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,555
You know what Tomas?

251
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,934
That's just the fatigue speaking.
You're delirious.

252
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,394
- No, sir.
- We're not lost. Let's go.

253
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,730
[backpack thuds]

254
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,777
What are you doing, Tomas?

255
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,156
Sir. Elders say we should turn our clothes
inside out if we're lost in the woods.

256
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,324
Tomas, stop this nonsense.

257
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,867
- Let's go.
- Okay, I'm done.

258
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,328
Tomas!

259
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,330
- Don't move.
- Sir?

260
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,123
- I said, don't move!
- Why, sir?

261
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,876
- [foreboding music playing]
- Sir?

262
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,921
- [snake hissing]
- Something's on my shoulder.

263
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,131
Don't move.

264
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,134
[snake hissing]

265
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,679
Sir?

266
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,808
- Tomas!
- Sir! Aah!

267
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,143
- I'll kill it!
- [gun cocks]

268
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,645

- [exclaims in disgust]
- [music fades]

272
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,321
Let's go.

273
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,365
I'm not going back there, sir.

274
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,742
[Tomas exclaims in disgust]

275
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,288
We're almost at the exit. Come on.

276
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,581
[both grunt]

277
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,000
Are we going that way, sir?

278
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,085
Yes. What about it?

279
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,753
But the snake went that way.

280
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,673
- Sir…
- Why? You scared?

281
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,467
N-No, sir. But…

282
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,803
You go ahead. You have the GPS.

283
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,513
I'll be right behind you.

284
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,266
[JB] Just avoid the snakes.

285
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,225

- [bags thudding]

298
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,894
Okay, let's go.

00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,184
- Andres.
- [Rita] Let go!

305
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,644
Ignore it. Let's go.

306
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,146
[Rita] No! Let go!

307
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,690
Andres.

308
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,109
- Wait, wait.
- We have to stick to the plan.

309
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,235
I said, wait!

[Raul] Shh.

315
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,916
Are you working with those thieves, Rita?

316
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,294
- [Rita breathing heavily]
- Tell us. Hmm?

317
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,756

- I see.
- [gun cocks]

319
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,260
Did you tell them about our hideout?

320
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,178
- Fess up!
- I don't know anything!

321
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,639
And I don't care
what you're talking about!

322
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,598
[chuckles]

323
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,768
Sir Sameo was so good to you,
yet you still betrayed him.

324
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,978
Good?!

325
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,814
You blinded us with your money!

326
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,651
You manipulated us and
poisoned the minds of the kids.

327
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,611
Just like you did to my brother!

328

You didn't want to join me and Emer.

- You dare raise your voice?

334
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,295
Shut up and stay down.

335
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,048
Andres, we don't have to get involved.

336
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,716

[Max] He's getting away!

352
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,472
- [Gab] He's too fast!
- [Max] Shit! Shit!

353
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,516
[Gab] We can still catch him! Let's go!
