190
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,023
It's so cold.

191
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,025
Okay.

192
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,819
[exhales heavily]

193
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,239
So, according to the forecast,
the snowfall is expected to get heavier.

194
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,783
In a few days, a snowstorm is coming.

195
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,161
That's why we need to capture
Kenji Lee as soon as possible.

196
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,875
No wonder Kenji is hiding here in Setsumi.

197
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,545
It's far, and the town of Kaigen is small.

198
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,464
Snowstorms are common in this area.

199
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,342
It's hard to get in, and hard to get out.

200
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,636
Also, the police force is limited.

201
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,596
There are very strict gun laws.

202
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,893
So strict, that even our contacts
can't get us illegal guns.

203
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,818
No wonder Kenji can endure this cold,
there are no guns.

204
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,695
It increases his chances to survive.

205
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,573
Besides, he can't
just be shot on the spot.

206
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,324
There's also
very little surveillance here.

207
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,827
That criminal is an expert at hiding.

208
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,121
But he'll soon face justice

209
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,082
because we're bringing him
back to the Philippines safely.

210
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,333
Aye, bars, brother!

- Good to see you, Greg.

222
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,518
How's the ryokan I prepared
for you and your team?

223
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,769
Everything's fine.

231
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:01,215
Kenji used to work
at Aji-No-Mai, Yakitori House.

232
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,301
He goes by the name Ryu.

233
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,681
But he recently transfer
to a new workplace.

234
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,183
[Greg] Where?

235
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,226
At Shirogane.

Smoking?

243

Isn't that only on my birthday?

255
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,620

<i>I know.</i>

257
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,459
He hates the smell of cigarettes.

- I remember the time
- [pensive music playing]

259

then he suddenly ran away.

Have you received a call
from social welfare?

274
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,503
Did they send someone there?

275
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,254
<i>No, I haven't talked to anyone.</i>

276
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,508

this will be our weapon of choice.

292
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,232
Our job is to snatch him discreetly.

293
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,651
So wait for him to get off from work.

294
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,945
Don't worry, sir.
This will be a piece of cake.

295
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,198
It's one versus six.
We'll definitely get him.

Keep an eye on him and tail him

302

where you can grab him.
