I don't kill innocent people.

51
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,414

[tense music continues]

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,751
What are you talking about, Jun?

54
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,921
Is that what your father told you?

55
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,676
You were a victim of a syndicate.

56
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,262
You were taken from us, that's the truth!

57
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,265
Why are you acting all righteous?

58
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,267
You take on contracts too!

59
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,603
Maybe your contracts
are even worse than mine!

60
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,564
I took contracts to find you.

[Barrios] We're all here,
not just to celebrate,

who can't speak for themselves.

- [dramatic music sting]
- [loud footsteps echoing]

74
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,283
Many ask why I'm here.

75
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:08,665
They say I should
stick to environmental issues.

76
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:17,966
But wherever they place me,
I'll support causes like this,

77
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,511
for the youth robbed of their rights

78
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,973
and the families
destroyed by human trafficking.

my brother, Jun…

91
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,694
he was a good kid.

92

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,332
our father,

00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,419
he was a good man.

96
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,422
I don't know him.

97
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,258
My adoptive father, that's who I know.

Jun…

99
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,347
Manuel,

100
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,268
is a bad man.

101
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,271
He's manipulating you.

[ominous tone continues]

106
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,620

The time…

00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,203
rats were chasing me in the streets.

115
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,333
In the sun, in the rain…

116
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,544

[somber music continues]

120
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,856
But you know what was the hardest part?

121
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,985
Hunger.

122
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,155
I was so hungry.

123
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,116
That's what I remember.

[somber music continues]

125
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,504

someone would come back for me,

127
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,469

[somber music continues]

129
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,102
I looked for you, Jun.

But you didn't come!

131

It's not too late.

We can fix this.

135
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,629
I'll go with you.

136
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,214

That's why I'm asking you…

139

tell your people to stop this.

140
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,143
Okay?

There's nothing more you can do.

If it's not Barrios,

145
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,455
many innocent people will be hurt,

146
