You don’t care about those
who badly needed the reward!

152
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,713
Because you only think
about yourselves

153

and your own happiness.

154

- I did everything I was told!

That reinstatement…

174

It’s not really for me.

175

that his father is
not a failure.

it seems to be the opposite.

00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,217
I'm a failure.

184
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,888
Am I right, Contractor?

185
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,016
Miguel.

186

This isn't the end
of your life yet.

187
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,608
It’s just one contract.

188
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,612
What’s important is
you’re alive.

189
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,615
Because as long as you live,

190
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,284
you'll have a chance
to make it up to him.

191
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,411
Remember that.

Not at the moment,

I really wanted this
to work out, you know.

216
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,011
So I can pick myself up.

You know what I mean?

218
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,982
Maybe I just need to accept
that I've lost.

219

That I still can't escape

I know that the contract
regarding Timor is over.

But I want to go after his men.

229

I want to stop the groups
he was making alliances with.

230

Forget it.

If you'll let your emotions
get to you, in the end,

you’ll lose.

As of now,
we don’t have a contract

240
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,780

What do you want?

I said it right this time.

Don't tell me you didn't
understand that.

247
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,018
What do you want?

248
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,104
Nothing.

249
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,897
You know,

250
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,234
all of our efforts
went down the drain.

251
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,486
We got outsmarted
by Timor’s men.

252
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,905
They killed one of their own.

253
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,324
That’s all part of the mission.

254
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,827
To account for
all possibilities.

255
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,328
Wait, why are you so calm
about it?

256
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,287
Aren’t you pissed?

[sighs] A bit.

258
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,001
But what do you want me
to do?

259
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,419
Get mad?

260
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,213
And then what?

261
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,008
You know, personal feelings
don't have any place

262
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,426
in this line of work.

263
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,220
- Really now?
- Yeah.

264
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,682
I know that.

265
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,309
But I can’t do it.

It’s all in the job, Tom G.

267
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,189
You should’ve read
the fine print.

268
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,109
Win or lose,
once the contract ends,

269
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,318
it's over.

270

Now?

282

While we don't have
a new contract,

I’m going to look for
my brother.

a master list?

anyway, bro.

just to find my brother.

Miguel's reaction.

Are you okay?

reinstated anytime soon.

if we don't keep fighting
in this line of job,
