<i>Tomas, it's always dark here in Kaigen</i>

00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,273

20
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,664

According to Tagawa,

70
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,270
the ones who attacked our target
are the Rai Jins.

71
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,063
"Rai Jins"?

72
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,774
They're the infamous local mafia here.

73
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,737
But what's their beef with Kenji?
Why do they want to kill him?

74
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,992
A group like the Rai Jins
don't do anything without getting paid.

75
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,039
So, that means
there's a bounty on Kenji's head?

76
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,376
But who's paying it?

77
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,169
We don't know for sure.

78
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,256
Maybe he clashed with one of the Rai Jins.

79
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,136
We all know that he's a hired assassin,

80
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,388
so might have killed one of them.

81
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,016
[unsettling music playing]

82
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,559
So, they want to get back at him?

83
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,981
Guys, I think it's not part
of the job contract

84
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,607
to know everything about that anymore.

85
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,152
What matters now is beating them to Kenji.

86
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,738
[Greg] Gab is right.

87
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,324
We have an advantage

88
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:28,411
because neither Kenji or the Rai Jins
don't know we're here.

89
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,205
So, we will stay incognito

90
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,832
until we capture the target.

91
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,961
[JB] Kenji is a good fighter.

92
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,755
He has some slick moves.

93
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,257
[Andres] Yes.

94
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,383
He's well-trained.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,762
But I'm sure he won't
be coming back to work.

96
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,555
[Max] He can't leave right away.

97
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,975
All exit points are closed
because of the looming snowstorm.

98
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,564
Tomorrow, we'll check out
the places where he could be.

99
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,734
But for now, get some rest.

100
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:04,530

102
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,210
Is there any update?

103
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,672
[huffs] Look.

104
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,801
My father can't stay in jail
for much longer.

105
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,636
[Joris] <i>You know how the system works.</i>

106
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,304
It will take time.

107
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,351
Can't the money can speed things up?

108
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,186
[pensive music playing]

109
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,979
Is the money not enough?

110
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,649
Just wait.

111
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,235
I'll update you on the progress.

112
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:50,368
[pensive music continues]

113
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,582
[sighs deeply]

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,836
[Tomas] When the weather is cold,

115
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,130
do you feel sad or happy?

116
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,590
[Gab] That has nothing to do
with our search for Kenji.

117
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,467
[Tomas] Huh? Yes, it does!

118
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,221
It can help us figure out if Kenji is
drowning in sorrow or jumping for joy.

119
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,557
[chuckling]

120
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,975
You're talking nonsense.

121
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,352
As for me, I'm happy
when the weather is cold.

122
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,438
Aren't people usually sad
when the weather is cold?

123
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,689
Oh, yeah!

124
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,774
Especially when you don't have
anyone to hold hands with.

125
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,401
- What?
- [chuckling]

126
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,028
- Yuck!
- [chuckling]

127
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,449
Ask me why I'm happy
when the weather is cold.

128
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,741
[clapping]

129
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,952
- I don't want to. Just focus on our job.
- Come on.

130
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,247
I am focusing on my job.

131
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,583
We look like tourists who
are enjoying our time here.

132
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,834
So, go ahead and ask me.

133
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,086
Okay! Tomas, why are you happy
when the weather is cold?

134
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,213
Because my underarms
aren't getting emotional.

135
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:49,135
[chuckling]

136
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,137
Why don't we just pretend we're tourists
who don't know each other?

137
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,430
You're embarrassing me with that joke.

138
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,098
[chuckling]

139
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,975
- Your underarms get emotional?
- Yeah.

140
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,019
- [chuckling]
- [playful music playing]

141
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,105
- Keep your eyes peeled, Tomas.
- My underarms get emotional.

142
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,441
Be more vigilant!

143
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,109
Okay, I will.

144
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,944
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,614
- [playful music continues]
- [exhales sharply]

146
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,157
- Okay.
- Back to work, okay?

147
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,992
- Okay, back to work.
- Be serious, please. Okay?

148
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,911
[inhales deeply, exhales sharply]

149
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,706
You know,
I've been wanting to do this so long.

150
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,919
It's always been my dream
to build a snow castle.

151
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,712
[shivering]

152
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,881
- Whatever.
- Look, Gab.

153
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,175
Snow castle.

154
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,177
[chuckling]

155
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,803
Look, there's Kenji!

156
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,722
- Where?
- Stupid.

157
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,934
The intel says he's here.

158
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,479
Yeah. Stay sharp, Max.

159
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,190
We don't know who else might be here.

160
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,282
How are you?

161
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,078
I should be the one asking you that.

162
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,829
How are you?

163
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,706
I mean, your dad…

164
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,379
There are still some things
to be resolved,

165
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,465
but I'm determined to help him
regain his freedom.

166
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:17,139
[pensive music playing]

167
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,894
We have to play the part.

168
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,980
We're doing surveillance.

169
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:27,942
Yeah.

170
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:28,943
[clears throat]

171
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,571
We stick to the plan, Max.

172
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,990
When we see Kenji,

173
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,326
we get him fast, okay?

174
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,746
Yeah, stick to the plan.

175
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:47,336
[pensive music continues]

176
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,255
Sometimes, the wait seems so long.

177
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,842
Just like what we're experiencing now.

178
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,970
We've been waiting and waiting.

179
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:58,889
[clicks mouth]

180
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,101
But like what my mom says…

181
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,188
"The longer you wait for something,

182
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,150
the more fulfilled you will feel
when it finally arrives."

183
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:16,198

[shop owner in Japanese]
Welcome. Please come in.

187

Feel free to look around.

188
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,812
[shop owner] Thank you very much.

189
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,563
This is a Kokeshi doll.

190
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,108
It's like a good luck charm,

191
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,151
so I hope it brings you good things.

192
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,236
Thank you.

193
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,664
Here you go. Thank you so much.

194
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,958

- Thank you so much.

195
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,549
Take care. Thank you very much!

196
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,804
Hello? How are things there?

197
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,854
Like you told me,
I waited until everyone left the funeral,

198
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,148
and I noticed someone suspicious.

199
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,275
I don't know who he was. [inhales deeply]

200
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:24,160
[foreboding music playing]

201
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,093

[foreboding music continues]

203
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,725
[inhales deeply]

204
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,560
I got his motorcycle's number plate.

205
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,480
Continue to follow that lead.

206
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,356
Copy.

207

[phone buzzing]

210
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,422
Miguel.

211
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,090
[Miguel] <i>Andres.</i>

212
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,928
I'm taking them all down.

213
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,305
No more threats.

214
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,558
- [ominous music playing]
- [breathing heavily]

215
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,477
My family deserves peace.

216
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,022
Andres.

217
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,027
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't
bother you, but…

218
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,111
[inhales deeply]

219
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,031
What is it, Miguel?

220
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,161
My family is in danger.

221
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,206
I need somewhere to hide.

222
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,000
Do you know a safe place in Bugias?

223
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,796
[ominous music continues]

224
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,632
Yeah. I'll send you the location.

225
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,716
You'll be safe there.

226
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,136
Thank you, Andres.

227
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:15,729
[ominous music intensifies]

228

[suspenseful music playing]

231
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,307
[Rai Jin in Japanese] Yes.
I'm surveying the area.

232
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,476
Kenji won't be able to leave Setsumi.

233

[door opens]

236
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,552
Hold on.

237
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:34,516
[tense music continues]

238
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,643
[lights flicker]

239
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,357
[sighs]

240
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,566
The place is clear.

241
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,071
[door slams]

242
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,697
- [locks clicks]
- Sit down.

243
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,034
[Miguel breathes deeply]

244
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,118
Get some rest for now.

245
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:58,791
[tense music continues]

246
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,419
[line ringing]

247
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,463
Have you arrived?

248
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,798
[man] <i>Yes, boss.</i>

249
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,550
We're checking all the places
where they could be staying.

250
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,970
We're about to leave.

251
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,015
Don't let them escape.

252
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,059
<i>Copy, boss.</i>

253
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,312
[tense music continues]

254
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,108
Boss, what's the plan
once we get the money?

255
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,321
We'll kill them afterwards, of course.

256
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,991
Otherwise, that bastard will rat us out.

257
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,327
Why are you even asking?

258
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,999
It's just that he seems
to have powerful connections.

259
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,836
He was charged with murder,
but he was released right away.

260
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,298
[tense music continues]

261
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,591
Then so be it.

262
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,014
Let's see if those connections
can save him in hell.

263
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,603
Let's go!

264
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,480
Yes, boss.

265
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:14,575
[tense music builds]

266
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,995
Here, I bought you guys some clothes.

267
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,206
Freshen up before we go to Bugias.

268
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,916
We'll be safe there.

269
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,960
[Christine sniffles]

270
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,004
I'm tired, Miguel. [sobs]

271
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,798
I'm so tired of all this. What's going on?

272

- [Miguel] Christine.
- [Christine sobs]

274

Everything will be okay.

275
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,894
I promise.

276
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,063
You'll be safe.

277
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,484
And I won't let anything
bad happen to the both of you.

Mama, don't cry.

281
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,912
Miguel…

282
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,747
Think about our son…

283
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,627
[Christine sobs] It's okay, baby…

284
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,005
It's okay…

285
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,091
[Miguel] You'll be okay.

[Christine sobs]

287
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,304
Just relax.

288
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,848
I'll take care of everything.

289
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,142
I swear.

290
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,855
[ominous music continues]

291
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,107

298
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,915
[in Japanese] I'm home.
