Breach the military system?

181
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,681
JB, we're talking about
military-grade encryption.

182
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,101
Yes, it's possible,
but it won't be easy.

183
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,936
It's going to take time.

184
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,021
And we can't get in

185
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,607
if we don't have
an active internal account.

186
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,902
Without one, it's like
banging on a locked door.

187
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,403
First of all,

188
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,405
whose files do you
want to access?

189
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,823
And why?

190
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,784
Are you sure
you want to do this?

191
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,619
Max…

192
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,788
Are you okay?

193
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,415
[scoffs]
After all the things I said,

194
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,084
do you really think
I'm not okay?

195
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,880
You said so many things
you almost ran out of breath.

196
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,385
I just had to say everything
on my mind.

197
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,890
So, why do you
want to do this?

198
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,103
I just need some files.

199
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,312
Whose files?

200
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:31,732
[sighs deeply]

201
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,901
Look, JB, how can we find
the files you need--

202
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,404
Antonio Bonifacio.

203

204

Your dad's files?

205
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,081
I would ask you why, but I know
it's none of my business.

206
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,917
Then again, I'll repeat myself.

207
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,710
- We need an…
- Access point.

208
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,630
I know we need an access point.

209
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,714
Exactly.

210
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,217
Once we get one,

211
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,511
we can get you
what you need.

00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,519
Can you please get it
for me, sir?

225
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,312
Sir!

226
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,980
It might be important, sir!

227
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,109
- [line ringing]
- Please answer.

228
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,278
Tomas, where are you?

229
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,280
[Tomas] Sir!

230

Sir, that's my phone!

Don't you want to take some?

There's so much money, buddy.

237
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,636
They won't notice
if we take a small amount.

Why did you let him die?

245
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,632
Magundayao was our only
way to get intel.

246
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,133
You should've protected him.

done anything either

even if you were there.

250
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,111
Magundayao is dead.

251
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,196
But before he died,

252
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,699
he said someone
was following him.

Here's what you're going to do.

256
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,709
Go through the master list.

257
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,335
sort all of the names on it,

258
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,714

we can use as contact.

by the time I get back.

264
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,598
We don't know if Magundayao
spilled anything

265
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,099
to whom ever is chasing him.

266
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,019
I'll take care of it.
