[wind howling]

193
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,313
Ugh!

194
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,528
[panting]

[wind howling]

[thuds]

203
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,823

[suspenseful music turns foreboding]

208

[suspenseful music resumes]

209
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,366
- [groans in pain]
- [suspenseful music fades]

210
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,705
[exhales sharply]

211
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,124
These guys are nuts.

212
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,543
Damn, my body hurts.

213
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,379
[groans] Ouch…

214
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,550
Ouch…

215
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:51,640
[unsettling music playing]

216
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:11,619
[unsettling music continues]

217
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,885
[unsettling music intensifies]

218
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,725
[Tomas] Hasn't Wolf updated yet?

219
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:41,357
[Andres panting]

220
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,526
Wolf!

221
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:54,453
- [panting]
- [unsettling music continues]

222
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,830
That bastard escaped.

223
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,835
[phone vibrating]

224
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,090
Sir.

225
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,716
The target escaped.

226
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,636
[Greg] <i>Team, regroup now.</i>
<i>I need everyone back here.</i>

227
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,429
Copy.

228
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,224
- What did he say?
- Back to base.

229
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,517
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

230
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:27,611
[suspenseful music playing]

231
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,167
[suspenseful music crescendos]

232
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,464
Why isn't Gab here yet?

233
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:56,890
[pensive music playing]

234
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,024
[pensive music fades]

235
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:14,575
[foreboding music playing]

236
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:26,295
[foreboding music continues]

237
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,303
[foreboding music builds, fades]

238
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,434
[footsteps approaching]

239
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,393
Oh!

240
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,478
What happened to you?!

241
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,147
Don't ask.

242
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,775
There! That's what you get
for being so reckless.

243
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,153
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

244
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,699
- Why don't you go in?
- You go first.

245
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,330
[Gab groans]

246
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,040
- [Greg] Gab.
- [JB] What happened to you?

247
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,750
I'm fine. [exhales sharply]

248
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,711
I was just late because…

249
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,922
I wanted to make sure
they weren't following me.

250
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,924
- [Tomas] How's your wound?
- [Gab] Tch. [sighs]

251
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,676
I said I'm fine.
I can just cover it up with makeup.

252
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,389
[Greg] Okay, listen.

253
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,267
Even if Kenji wants to leave,

254
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,646
it's not possible now
because of the snowstorm.

255
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,150
I'm sure the Rai Jins are
also watching the exit points.

256
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:36,824
[ominous music playing]

257
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,284
- [wind whistling]
- [footsteps approaching]

258
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:47,751
[foreboding music playing]

259
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,132
[Greg] But, unfortunately,

260
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,300
because of this encounter,

261
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,387
he's now aware that the Rai Jins
are not the only ones after him.

262
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,181
He has also seen Andres.

263
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:09,439
[dramatic music playing]

264
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,358
I had my hands on the bastard.

265
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,405
That's okay, bro.

266
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,866
It wasn't your fault.

267
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,868
If he didn't slip away from me,

268
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,162
this mission would have been done by now!

269
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,705
Bro, it's okay.

270
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,791
The Contractor said he won't be
able to leave Setsumi anyway.

271
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,378
Andres, this isn't your fault.
We still have a chance.

272
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:36,091
[dramatic music continues]

273
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,135
[Greg] Let it go. It's done.

274
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,889
We need to focus on our next step now.

275
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:48,520
[dramatic music intensifies]

276
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,941
[dramatic music crescendos]

277
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,784
Andres, what happened?

278
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,746
[Andres breathes heavily]

279
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,874
Sir, even if you don't say it,
I know it was my fault.

280
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,292
It was my responsibility.

281
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,252
I'm the reason the target escaped.

282
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,883
I want to know what really happened.

283
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,094
You're not the type to make a mistake.

284
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,973
Is this related to your search
for your brother?

285
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,854
Sir, you know I've been looking
for my brother for a long time.

286
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,734
I've sacrificed a lot.

287
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,863
I clung onto hope and made
my grandma believe, too.

288
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,617
[somber music playing]

289
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,286
Only to find out that he's gone.

290
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,583
My brother is dead, sir.

291
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:57,506
[somber music continues]

292
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:04,805
[somber music builds]

293
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,767
<i>- Miguel.</i>
<i>- Let's stop the chase.</i>

294
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,227
<i>Meet with me.</i>

295
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,770
<i>Andres, what happened?</i>

296
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,314
<i>Sir, even if you don't say it,</i>
<i>I know it was my fault.</i>

297
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,483
<i>Is this related to your search</i>
<i>for your brother?</i>

298
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,069
<i>- My brother is dead, sir.</i>
<i>- Is that confirmed?</i>

299
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,989
<i>I want this mission to be over</i>
<i>so I can confirm it.</i>

300
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:26,660
<i>Uh, I heard your conversation</i>
<i>with the Contractor about your brother.</i>

301
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,246
<i>If it were up to me,</i>
<i>I'd want you to be my brother.</i>

302
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,956
<i>Why, Tomas?</i>

303
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,833
<i>Do you have a brother, too?</i>
