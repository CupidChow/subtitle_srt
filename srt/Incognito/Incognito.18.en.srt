Andres, I understand
why you did that.

I know what happened
to your brother.

I know what happened
when you were a kid.

How do you know that, sir?

45
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,919
I was already profiling you
before I recruited you,

46
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,384
I know you went to jail
because of your temper.

47
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,304
Because you got angry.

48
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,309
But that's the problem
with you, Andres.

You always let your emotions
control you.

50

That's what's going to get
you and your companions killed.

187
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,097
[breathing rapidly] Sorry.

188
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,016
Sorry.

189
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,982
Let me get you some water.

190
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,153
Thank you.

191
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:06,911
[somber music continues]

192
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,209
Sevi…

193
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:22,718
[sniffling, sobbing softly]

194
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:43,113
[chair clatters]

195
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:48,410
[dark music playing]

196
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,620
What do you want?

197
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,500
[exhales sharply]

198
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,587
I'll tell you
where your brother is…

199
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,549
if you release me.

200
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,599
How will I know
if you're telling the truth?

201
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,310
[scoffs]

202
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,104
I gain nothing

203
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,399
from lying to you, Andres.

204
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,733
To what extent
are you willing to go

205
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,694
to save your brother?

206
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,696
And you know this.

207
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,823
In the whole world,

208
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,243
I'm the only person
who can help you.

209
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,204
Just me.

210
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,627
Am I wrong or am I right?

211
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:45,593
[dark music continues]

212
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:54,727
[dark music swells]

213
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,479
[cicadas chirping]

214
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:06,405
- [twigs breaking]
- [footsteps approaching]

215
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:12,620
[tense music playing]

216
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,997
Hey! Hey, hey!
Stand down.

217
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,332
- Gab, hold on, hold on.
- Sorry, sorry.

218
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,791
I almost shot you.

219
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,376
- Sorry.
- It's just me.

220
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,128
Okay.

221
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,504
- Where did you go?
- [exhales sharply]

222
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,840
I just went out to
buy some groceries.

223
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,050
So…

224
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,386
have there been any news
or updates on the Contractor?

225
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,597
Nothing yet.

226
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,807
Why?

227
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,310
[breathing heavily]

228
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,519
Seriously?

229
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,481
What's causing
the goddamn delay?!

230
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,817
How long are we going
to wait here?!

231
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,278
- Forever?!
- Easy. Easy.

232
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,322
It's been so long!

233
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,407
Are you okay?
Take it easy. Calm down.

234
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,912
- Are you okay?
- [clears throat]

235
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,497
I'm just feeling kind of…

236
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,706
kind of sick.

237
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,792
I-I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

238
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,126
[clears throat]

239
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,711
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

240
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:11,095
[unsettling music playing]

241
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,981
[plastic crumpling]

242
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,618
[unsettling music continues]

243
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,081
[footsteps approaching]

244
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,209
[door opens]

245
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,714
Sir.

246
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,009
Miguel.

247
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,220
Yes, sir?

248
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,597
Are you okay?

249
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,977
Yes. Yes, sir.

250
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,895
I'm okay.

251
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,607
That's good.

252
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,318
That means I don't have
to worry about you.

253
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:14,199
[unsettling music continues]

254
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,409
Go get some rest.

255
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,787
[door closes]

256
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:29,882
[unsettling music swells]

257
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,342
I'll give you an idea

258
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,304
of how we do what we do.

259
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,389
[Timor sighs]

260
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,769
After my men find victims.

261
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:53,030
we bring our human resources
to Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong,

262
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,532
we send them wherever we want.

263
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,493
You have abducted so many kids.

264
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,370
How will you know
where my brother is?

265
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,625
Andres, I have an army
of people working for me.

266
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,837
[dark music playing]

267
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,672
You want proof?

268
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,008
Okay, fine.

269
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,511
I need to make a call.

270
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,721
Lend me your phone.

271
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:24,186
Answer my questions first,
and I'll give you what you want.

272
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,397
Come on, Andres.

273
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:33,070
I'll have plenty of chances
to get out of here.

274
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,863
But you…

275
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,327
You know I'm the only one
who can give you

276
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,912
what you want.

277
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,082
What do you take me for?

278
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,209
A fool?

279
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,214
One phone call.

280
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,299
This is for you.

281
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,094
You want proof, right?

282
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,181
You'll be making a huge mistake
if you let this chance go.

283
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,559
Where's my brother?

284
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,603
Freedom for your brother.

285
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,730
Freedom for me.

286
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,107
What's your group's name?

287
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,901
Who are the leaders
of your syndicate?

288
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,903
No. No.

289
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,405
Not part of the deal.

290
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,532
Give me the phone.

291
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,534
[tense music playing]

292
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,119
Who do you want to call?

293
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,705
[Timor sighs exasperatedly]

294
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,916
An assistant to get my list.

295
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,128
List of the people
my group abducted,

296
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,798
the time, date, and place
where they were abducted,

297
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,301
and their pictures.

298
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,136
And in case
you're thinking about it,

299
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,929
it's in a very secure place

300
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,099
guarded by many,
many of my people.

301
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,894
And it even has a passcode

302
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,230
that only a few know.

303
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:54,610
[tense music continues]

304
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,819
Alright.

305
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,780
Where's this list?

306
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,908
Tell me.

307
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:08,415
Is our negotiation moving
forward or not, Andres?

308
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:15,505
[tense music continues]

309
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,009
Good.

310
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,387
Good, Andres.

311
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,016
You're right.

312
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,562
My family is important to me.

313
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,273
Good, Andres.

314
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,401
Good. Give me the phone.

315
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:43,408
[tense music continues]

316
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,918
[tense music swells]

317
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,214
<i>What reason could someone</i>
<i>like you have for being here?</i>

318
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,132
<i>What are you lacking?</i>

319
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,509
<i>You look familiar.</i>

320
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,219
<i>Have we had an encounter</i>
<i>before?</i>

321
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,429
<i>Evil people live longer.</i>

322
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,305
<i>It's unfair, isn't it?</i>

323
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,724
<i>People like Timor are</i>
<i>the ones who often live long.</i>

324
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,227
<i>What's funnier is</i>
<i>we even have to protect him.</i>

325
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,895
<i>I'm bored. Make a joke.</i>

326
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,522
<i>Me. I'm a joke.</i>

327
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,232
<i>- If only you knew.</i>
<i>- So dramatic!</i>

328
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,108
<i>Someone's here!</i>

329
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,110
<i>Tomas!</i>
