<i>Congratulations!</i>

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,923
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, too.</i>

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>Sorry for everything.</i>

[Gab] <i>You're in a good mood!</i>

00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,928
<i>- He's all smiles. Right?</i>
<i>- He looks happy.</i>

7
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,431
<i>- It's nice.</i>
<i>- What's up with you?</i>

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,391
<i>I found my brother.</i>

9
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,269
<i>What's Andres's brother</i>
<i>got to do with Manuel Aguinaldo?</i>

10
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,147
<i>Manuel adopted him when he was a kid.</i>

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,898
<i>This is our contract.</i>

12
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,861
<i>BENR Sec. Josephine Barrios</i>
<i>is a keynote speaker</i>

13
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,362
<i>at a charity event.</i>

14
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,449
<i>We must take down Josephine Barrios.</i>

15
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,826
<i>Covert VIP protection.</i>

16
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,202
<i>That's our mission.</i>

17
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,787
<i>We'll be there at the venue.</i>

18
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,664
<i>Diego, I'm counting on you on this one.</i>

19
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,417
<i>We must teach</i>
<i>people like Barrios a lesson.</i>

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,127
<i>I like your idea.</i>

21
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,963

[theme music playing]

25
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,816
Oh. Where is Junjun?

26
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,818
I thought he's coming here.

27
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,403
Yes, Grandma.
I talked to him. He's on his way.

28
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,488
Okay.

29
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,575
Oh.

[Esang, Andres chuckle]

31
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,791
Where is the…

[unsettling music playing]

33
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,933
JB.

34
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,185
That's him.

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,106
Don't take your eyes off him.

36
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,025
- Grandma.
- Hmm?

37
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,110
What?

38
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,032
- Finally, Jun.
- [Esang] Oh.

39
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,909
I thought you weren't coming.

40
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,452
I had something to attend to.

41
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,787
It's okay. Come on.

42
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,499
We'll follow Jun once they part ways.

00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,597
Jun!

00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,850
Hmm. [mwah]

[chuckles]

48
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,727
How are you?

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,022
You don't have to be so formal.

50
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,273
[chuckles]

51
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,818
But of course,
your grandma is still beautiful as ever!

53
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,113
Hmm.

- Oh. come on.
- Come on.

[Esang] Pedro, your sons are here.

00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,982
I hope you're happy
wherever you are right now.

[inhales deeply, sighs]

62
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,488
[Luis] Alright.
Let's eat before Grandma starts crying.

63
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,572
Come on.

64
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,368
- Hey. I'm not going to cry.
- Oh. [chuckles]

65
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,286
I'm all smiles now.

66
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,205
Right? [chuckles]

67
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,207
Oh. Come here, Jun.

68
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,668
- I prepared your favorites.
- Let's eat.

70
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,547
- [dramatic music sting]
- You liked these when you were a kid.

71
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,259
No, thanks. I have to go anyway.

72
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,094
Uh…

73
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,846
You just got here and you're leaving?

74
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,766
Let's go.

75

[unsettling music continues]

76
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,858
I actually have an appointment.

77
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,568
I just dropped by to visit.

78
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,949
It's okay, Grandma.
Maybe it's something important.

79
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:43,950
Right?

80
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,743
What matters is that he came here.

81
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,954
[Andres chuckles]

82
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,956
Well? Let's go?

83
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,125
- Bye, Grandma.
- I'll walk with him.

84
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:58,464
[unsettling music continues]

85
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,468
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,431
Take care, okay? Keep me posted.

87
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,515
Yeah, I will.

88
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:17,984

[unsettling music continues]

91
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,547
[Luis] What's with him?

92

[engine revving]

93
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:50,933
[unsettling music continues]

94
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,810
He knows he's being followed.

95

[unsettling music intensifies]

96
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,732
We need to hurry.

[car door opens, closes]

100
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,998
What's going on?

101
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,876
Andres, there's no time.
I'll explain later.

102
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,170
No, sir. What's going on?
Why are you here?

103
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,342
Okay, so I'm sorting through all the names
on the master guest list.

104
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:28,763
[keyboard clacking]

105
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,641
Anyone suspicious?

106
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,642
[Max inhales deeply]

107
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,978
Hmm… None so far.

108
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,272
Most of these people are CEOs

109
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,066
and a couple of socialites.

110
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,442
[breathes deeply] Hmm.

111
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,277
I also cross-checked all the names

112
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,947
listed in the CID and NPP local precincts.

113
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,616
I went over the list of staff,
crew, and suppliers.

114
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,744
No criminal records. No red flags.

115
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,037
Okay.

116
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,998
I'm checking the list of major donors.

117
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,127
But investigating them won't be easy.

118
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,962
Not all of them have background info.

119
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,382
Maybe you can start from the newest

120
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,467
and see if there are any new names.

121
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,386
Okay, I'll do that.

122
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,680
[keyboard clacking]

123
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,515
[phone buzzing]

124
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,725
Oh. Excuse me. I have to take this.

125
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,644
Sure, I'll take it from here.

126
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,064
- Hello, Gab?
- [Miguel exhales sharply]

127
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,649
Do you have an update for me?

128
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:29,115
- [phone buzzing]
- [keyboard clacking]

129
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,534
Hello, Mickey?

130
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:38,499
- [foreboding music playing]
- [keyboard clacking]

131
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:50,845
[foreboding music continues]

132

[music turns dramatic]

133
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,639
Sir?

134
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,266
I asked why you're here!

135
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,645
Are you following my brother?

136
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,442
[dramatic music continues]

137
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,944
Well?

138
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,781
JB?

139
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,580
Andres.

140
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,125
We are planning to follow Jun

141
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,631
because we believe he'll
lead us to Manuel Aguinaldo.

142
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,134
Manuel Aguinaldo?

143
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,469
That's the man who adopted him.

144
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,595
I know.

145
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,058
I was the one who sent
you his certificate of adoption.

146
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,479
So, you knew?

147
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,857
Are you saying you knew Jun all along?

148
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,778
Andres, Manuel was my former teammate.

149
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,740
I trusted him with my life.

150
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,117
But he's a bad person.

151
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,330
He's the reason why
the people who are like my family died.

152
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,957
Why are you only telling me this now?

153
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,500
Had I told you back then,

154
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,878
you wouldn't have told
me where Jun was, right?

155
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,048
It's only natural that you'd protect him.

156
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,718
So, you used me?

157
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:18,766
[dramatic music continues]

158
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,268
At first, yes.

159
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,187
But when I got to know you more,

160
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,939
believe me,

161
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,442
I sincerely wanted
you to find your brother

162
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,528
because you've become like family to me.

163
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,863
So, I'm sorry, Andres.

164
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,867
It's the only way for me
to get justice for my teammates.

165
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,538
[dramatic music continues]

166
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,165
What's your plan now, sir?

167
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,212
Are you planning
to use my brother this time?

168
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,464
[JB inhales deeply]

169
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,091
Andres, listen.

170
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,762
You brother and family won't get hurt.

171
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,974
Our objective is Manuel Aguinaldo.

172
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,270
Because he's the one
who'll lead us to the El Cano.

173
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,692
You know, whatever you're planning,

174
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,278
leave Jun out of it.

175
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,741
And if he says Manuel is a good person,

176
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,369
that's what I'll believe.

177
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,041
- Andres.
- Andres.

178
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,211
[dramatic music continues]

179
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,344
[dramatic music crescendos]

180
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,929
Your wife…

181
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,765
My wife?

182
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,602
Do you think what you did was funny?

183
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,937
Coffee?

184
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,606
[scoffs] Coffee?

185
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,901
Sir, what you did wasn't funny.

186
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,738
You've pushed me and Gab into a corner.

187
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,494
You don't understand, Tomas.

188
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,915
I did it because I'm her father.

189
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,708
Okay?

190
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,044
I want to teach her a lesson.

191
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,963
A lesson? [chuckles dryly]

192
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,131
A lesson, sir?

193
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,093
I think I understand Gab now.

194
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,887
You really are good
at hurting your daughter.

195
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,680
Why? Did Gab get mad?

196
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,725
She didn't, right?

197
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,438
Because I know she doesn't know.

198
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,315
Okay?

199
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,526
It was an honest mistake. That's all.

200
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,278
Why?

201
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,782
Did you tell her our secret?

202
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,535
[scoffs] Hold on.

203
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,412
A-Are you blackmailing me?

204
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,039
[somber music playing]

205
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,624
Tomas.

206
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,464
I only did it because I want
someone to take care of Gab.

207
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,009
I know you care for my daughter.

208
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:01,929
But…

209
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,642
once I've given her everything,

210
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,228
it's over.

211
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,522
[somber music continues]

212
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,524
I'll be gone from her life.

213
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,862
But at least I know she has you.

214
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,116
Sir, it's not--

215
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,409
[Philip] Tomas.

216
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,912
It's not a problem, okay?

217
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,292
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

218
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,712
[somber music continues]

219
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,172

[cup clanks]

221
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,383
Now go pick up your wife.

222
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,011
There's something I want to give to her.

223
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:47,141
[somber music continues]

224
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,767
[sighs] Okay, sir.

225
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,437
Thank you.

226
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,740
[somber music fades]

227
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,453
[phone vibrating]

228
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,747
[Andres] <i>Jun?</i>

229
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,499
Andres.

230
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,420
When can we meet?

231
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,507
There's something we need to talk about.

232
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,970
Okay, I'm free tonight.

233
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,805
[suspenseful music playing]

234
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,057
Okay.

235
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,934
Let's meet up.

236
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:34,563
[suspenseful music continues]

237
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,361
[suspenseful music ends]

- [engine revs]
- [bird squawking]

239
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,533
[engine stops]

240
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,917
What's our next move?

241
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,962
JB, I'll handle it.

242
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,588
I have a plan.

243
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,300
But I can't guarantee
that Andres won't get hurt.

244
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,719
What's your plan?

245
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,138
[foreboding music playing]

246
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,224
I think it's better that you don't know.

247
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,272
Sir, I'm sorry,

248
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,941
but I have a bad feeling about your plan.

249
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,735
What are you going
to do to Andres's brother?

250
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,029
JB, I'm not going to hurt Jun.

251
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,158
[foreboding music continues]

252
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,660
I'll count on that.

253
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,583
But unfortunately,
there are difficult decisions to be made.

254
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,462
If someone gets affected, then so be it.

255
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,464
Nothing personal.

256
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,342
I have to go.

257
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:51,891
- [foreboding music continues]
- [footsteps receding]

258
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,314
- [engine starts]
- [music fades]

259
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,649
[sighs]

260
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,821
- [indistinct chatter]
- [footsteps approaching]

261
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,490
Oh, have you been here for a while?

262
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,994
[exhales sharply] Not really.

263
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,998
[JB slurps, gulps]

264
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,626
I didn't want to bother
you and Miguel while you were working.

265
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,379
Did Miguel go home?

266
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,173
Yes, he did.

267
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,551
So, how was it?

268
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,762
Well, most of them seemed okay.

269
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,264
But Miguel and I flagged a few of them

270
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,516
because they seemed
capable of targeted killing.

271
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,187
But honestly, it seems like
the threat might be coming from outside.

272
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,401
[sighs deeply]

273
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,363
That was a deep sigh.

274
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,656
Is there a problem?

275
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:55,829
[pensive music playing]

276
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,040
It's about Andres and his brother.

277
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,211
What about them?

278
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,966
Jun's adoptive father…

279
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,177
is Manuel Aguinaldo.

280
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,889
Huh?

281
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:18,852
[pensive music continues]

282
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,981
[car approaching]

283
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:36,078
[pensive music continues]

284
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,621
- Jun.
- Andres.

285
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,290
- [Jun] Have you been waiting long?
- Not really.

286
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,669
You said we have
something important to talk about.

287
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,880
Yes, uh…

288
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,301
Jun, I want…

289
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,932
I want the three of us to live together.

290
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,520
We can live near our old land.

291
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,149
It's quieter there.

292
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,359
And I want…

293
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,571
to talk to your adoptive father.

294
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,575
I don't want to.

295
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:19,038
[unsettling music playing]

296
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,374
Andres, just because we got reunited…

297
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,335
doesn't mean my whole life has to change.

298
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,300
I like the kind of life I have now.

299
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,012
I won't give it up just to be with you.

300
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:40,142
[unsettling music continues]

301
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,394
We followed Andres earlier…

302
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,190
…to find out where Jun lives.

303
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,568
But Andres saw us.

304
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,446
So…

305
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,949
he got really mad.

306
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,201
Of course!

307
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,537
We all know how
much Andres loves his brother.

308
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,209
Contractor won't hurt Jun.

309
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,755
But now, [inhales deeply]

310
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,925
Contractor is planning something
that he doesn't want me involved in.

311
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,844
What is he planning to do?

312
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,721
I don't know yet.

313
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,895
But he's really determined
to go after Manuel Aguinaldo.

314
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,815
And that's also what you need.

315
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,484
Yes.

316
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,070
Contractor and I have the same objective.

317
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,114
But Andres is your friend.

318
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,201
[cicadas chirping distantly]

319
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,579
You know what, Max?

320
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,834
No matter how I look at it,

321
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,589
Andres's brother is bound to be affected.

322
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,846
JB, you have to weigh everything up.

323
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,973
[foreboding music playing]

324
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,892
Allegiance or mission integrity?

325
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,770
Friendship or justice?

326
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:13,777
[foreboding music continues]

327
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,237
Justice.

328
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,407
Well then, I guess there's your answer.

329
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,870
Because whether you like it or not,
you're going to betray Andres.

330
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:28,292

What's the plan exactly?

334
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,891
To kidnap Diego Aguinaldo.

335
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,562
Let's do our best to keep him unharmed.

336
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,773
We just need to lure out Manuel.

337
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,693
It's going to be hard.

338
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:00,032
But we've waited for a long
time just to get back at Raven.
