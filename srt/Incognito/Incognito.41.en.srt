We don't know.

186
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,617
But they said

187
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,203
that three people only,
entered the safe house.

188
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,292
Only three people.

189
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,379
But they were able to wipe out
all the men in the safe house.

190
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,798
And kill an Escalera.

191
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,800
They're that good?

192
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,010
Yes.

193
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,137
Whatever their intentions are,

194
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,597
we don't know anything about it.

195
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,102
But they suspect,

196
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,313
it was their own organization who did it.

197
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,317
Because of everything
happening to the Escaleras,

198
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,111
their organization wanted them removed.

199
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,697
Greg.

200
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,116
I hope I was able to help you.

201
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,203
