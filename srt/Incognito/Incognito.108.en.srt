My brother's body.

27
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,373
Give it to me.

28
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,753
I won't give it to you.

Because of you…

35
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,486
my brother is gone now.

36
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,659
You brainwashed him
with your twisted beliefs.

37
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,743
[Manuel] Yes.

38
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,288
I made him that way.

39
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,332
I shaped him with my beliefs.

40
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,626
But I never forced him.

41
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,921
He obeyed me because I loved him.

42
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,342
A little boy couldn't have known better.

43
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,139
He could only learn from
what's right in front of him.

44
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,683
You…

45
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,020
took advantage of his weakness.

46
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:12,025
It was your comrade's
bullet that first hit my son's body.

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,031
it shouldn't be me.

50
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,199
Why not?

51
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,662
Who put him in that position?

52
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,040
It was you, wasn't it?

53
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,962
You're the one who first
put a bullet through his head.

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,050
You should be thankful…

55
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,844
that you're my son's brother.

56
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,849

Are you really fine coming here with me?

66
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,267
Shouldn't you be with your uncle?

67
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,476
He's more important, right?

68
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,937
Oh, come on. You're my wife, remember?

69
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,773
It's better this way.

70
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,442
Besides, your dad might
find it strange if we're not together.

71
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,236
Okay, fine. I get it.

72

[exhales sharply] Okay.

Yes! Because you're siding with him!

[Gab] You're such a crybaby.

150
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:08,529

Calm down. You're making me dizzy.

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,310
Don't worry about it.
It was cool, actually.

179
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,729
I mean, we just looked at each other,

180
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,148
and then we understood what to do.

181
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,443
That's what you call
"chemistry" or "connection." [chuckles]

182
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,529
- Seriously?
- We're really partners.

183
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,490
[laughing]

184
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,450
It was amazing.

185
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,413
But seriously, I'm sorry you got
dragged into my family's mess.

186
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,499
Well, I'm part of your family now.

187
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,500
[sighs sharply]

188
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,919
You're Mrs. Guerrero, remember? [chuckles]

189
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,379
- Mrs. Guerrero. [laughs]
- What?

190
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,923
Please don't call
me that or I'll kill you.

191
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,800
- Sorry… Mrs. Guerrero.
- [laughs]

192
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,343
- Yuck!
- [laughs]

193
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,304
Sorry, sorry.

194
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,557
But seriously, thank you.

195
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,560
It's okay.

196
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,522
You know, they would've
been dead now if it weren't for you.

197
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,483
Other people would've fled
and stayed out of trouble.

198
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,694
That's how people are wired.

199
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,904
They prioritize
themselves over other people.

200
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,866
- Well, I'm not like them.
- I know.

201
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,659
I like getting into trouble.

202
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,537
[laughs] Just kidding.

203
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,248
But nothing happened to me, anyway.
I'm even happy.

204
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,876
Besides…

205
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,087
that's how families are, right?

206
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,799
There will always be conflict and drama.

207
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,803
In fact, a family
wouldn't be complete without it.

208
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,388
It would be boring.

209
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,641
And even though you fight…

210
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,436
you still come home to them.

211
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,563
- That's what a family is all about.
- [chuckles]

212
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,816
I wish we could choose our families.

213
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,526
But we can't, right?

214
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,365
- Look at me and my uncle.
- [pensive music playing]

215
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,076
We're not related by blood,

216
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,286
but he's more than family to me.

217
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:07,208
I love him so much,
even though I don't know why. [chuckles]

218
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,502
But I'm willing to die for him.

219
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:13,047
And I'm sure you'd do
the same for your father.

220
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,093
- I'd do that for my father?
- Yeah.

221
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,678
You were so mad at your father earlier,

222
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,932
but I've known you for awhile now.

223
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,852
I feel like I know
you and your personality.

224
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,146
- I know when you're mad--
- Oh, really?

225
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,816
For example, take what happened earlier.

226
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:38,072
I noticed that you were mad,
not because…

227
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,533
you didn't care about your father.

228
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,869
You got mad because
you were worried about him.

229
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,206
I don't know why
you don't want to tell him.

230
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,874
I guess you're trying to look tough.

231
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,586
[pensive music continues]

232
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,674
I know your father
might not understand you now…

233
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,885
but I do.

234
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,013
I know that you love him.

235
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,686
And I think,
you also would be willing to die for him.

236
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,440
Right?

237
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,653
[Kenji] We already have
the info about Tomas Guerrero.

238
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,867
He's an orphan who grew up in Boys' Town
and then got adopted.

239
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,953
He went to military school,
but he got kicked out.

240
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,663
He didn't graduate.

241
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,664
[mug thuds]

242
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:33,919
[unsettling music playing]

243
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,130
He was the one who shot my son.

244
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,259
Jose Bonifacio.

245
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,513
The son of General Antonio Bonifacio,
who is currently in jail.

246
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,641
He was part of
the Naval Special Operations Group.

247
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:54,273
Everyone knows he's a former soldier who
was dismissed for taking part in a mutiny.

248
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,401
[unsettling music continues]

249
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,736
What about them?

250
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,489
[Kenji]
I still have no information on them.

251
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:06,577
[unsettling music continues]

252
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,330
They will lead us to them.

253
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:15,127
[unsettling music continues]

254
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,004
On it, sir.

255
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,802
Kenji, I want you to attack
when they least expect it.

256
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,472
[dramatic music sting]

257
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,516
For Diego.

258
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:33,354
[unsettling music continues]

259
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,566
[unsettling music intensifies, ends]

260
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,780
- [birds chirping]
- [footsteps approaching]

261
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,911
Oh. Andres, where have you been?

262
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,412
I was worried.

263
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,790
[sighs]

264
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,794
I did everything I could, Grandma.

265
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,464
But it was no use.

266
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,009
Manuel refused.

267
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,681
He wouldn't even let me see Jun's body.

268
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,729
[melancholy music playing]

269
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,107
We need to accept it now.

270
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,825
God just let us borrow Jun for a while.

271
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:37,960
[melancholy music continues]

272
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,630
Let's just remember him

273
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,925
as the Jun we knew.

274
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,219
The boy who was happy,

275
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,597
kind and mischievous.

276
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,808
The Jun who loved us.

277
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,272
I'll remember him that way

278
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:02,818
instead of that Diego you told me about.

279
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,576
Just remember the happy memories, Andres.

280
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,247
So we can start over.

281
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,919
- [melancholy music continues]
- [dogs barking distantly]

282
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,300
How can I start over, Grandma?

283
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,391
You have me, dear.

284
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,186
We have each other.

285
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,148
We'll start over together.

286
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:47,029
[melancholy music continues]

287
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,714
[melancholy music builds, fades]

288
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,008
[indistinct chattering]

289
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,388
[Miguel] Look, six missed calls.

290
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,683
[Tomas sighs] I give up.
I can't do it. Tch.

291
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,977
[Max] You know,
let's just let him be for now.

292
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,563
I mean, we don't even
know what to say to him anyway.

293
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,482
- You're right.
- [Tomas] Right.

294
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,944
Andres is really acting strange.

295
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,113
I wonder how he is. It's been a week.

296
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,365
He's not answering my calls.

297
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,578
He doesn't even read
messages in the group chat.

298
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,165
It's like he won't
even touch his phone now.

299
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,460
Why don't we visit him?

300
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,879
Let's go see him. Just the two of us.

301
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,840
- [Tomas chuckles]
- No, Tomas.

302
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,760
Let's give him space.

303
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,345
Okay?

304
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,681
He just needs time.

305
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,145
You know, losing a loved one is not easy.

306
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:06,316
- [pool balls clattering]
- [patrons chattering indistinctly]

307
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,860
That's true, but…

308
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,697
I still believe
that everything will be okay.

309
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:16,660
All of us. Andres, JB…

310
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,790
Max.

311
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,501
How's JB doing?

312
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,964
[Miguel] I haven't
visited him in the hospital yet.

313
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,341
Right. When is he getting discharged?

314
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,263
I don't know.

315
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,307
Maybe… maybe soon.

316
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,018
I think he's recovering.

317
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,729
[Miguel] I hope so.

318
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,276
Don't worry.
Our group will be complete again.

319
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,030
We're like a band that disbanded,

320
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,490
then boom! We'll make a grand comeback.

321
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,617
Right? [chuckles] Cheers!

322
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,994
Come on, guys.

323
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,412
Cheers.

Team, now we begin phase 1.

[foreboding music intensifies]

[music fades]

330
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,950
It's part of the job, Greg.

331
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,536
You can't win all the time.

332
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,123
But I know you did everything you could.

333
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,170
Anyway, the reason I called you here

334
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,383
is because I want
you to know the offer still stands.

335
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,177
[dramatic music playing]

336
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,887
Including the reinstatement?

337
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,557
Yes. We had a deal,

338
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,142
and I want to keep it.

339
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,187
All of your teammates will
be reinstated into active service

340
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,985
once you've given me
everything I need about the El Cano.

341
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,987
[dramatic music intensifies]

342
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,075
I can still count on
your help against the El Cano, right?

343
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:27,749
[dramatic music crescendos]

344
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,503

345
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,213
<i>I made the mission personal.</i>

346
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,798
<i>I even used Andres's brother.</i>

347
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,260
<i>I couldn't keep my</i>
