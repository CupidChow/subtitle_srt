we currently have individuals

Congressman, what can you say

28
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,277
about the accusations you're facing?

29
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,946
Are they true?

30
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,491
We will be filing multiple charges
against them.

31
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,661
These include plunder,

32
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,746
abuse of power,

33
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,833

<i>to do what's right against them.</i>

39
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,139
Yes, that's the right thing to do!

40
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,474
They deserve the death sentence! Thieves!

41
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,185
Calm down. Death penalties
are already a thing of the past.

42
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,312
I know. So we need to implement it again.

57
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,347

JB.

201
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,516
I know I've caused you a lot of trouble.

202
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,897
And everyone, in the group.

203
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,776
If I hadn't been reckless, then maybe…

204
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,863
that wouldn't have happened
to your father.

You can't take all the blame.

209
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,797
You have nothing to do
with what happened to my father.

210
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,219
It was Timor and his group's doing.

211
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:29,475
The Elcano. They're the ones to blame.

- Thank you.

217

Did you get anything from Isabel?

218
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,203
Well, yeah.

219
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,914
Before she died,

220
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,333
she told me the name
of the shipping company

221
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,834
they used to transport Jun.

222

Do you mean he's still alive?

223
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,716
I'm going to find the ship's captain.

224
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,386
Especially now that I'll have
more time in my hands.

225
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,808
I've decided to leave the group.

227

Do what you have to do, Andres.

228

230
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,788

- [dramatic music sting]
- [chuckles wryly]

232

Relax, man.

234

[lips smack] But you know what, Andres?

237
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,142
I know the day will come…

238
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,522

who wronged me and father.

[pensive music playing]

240
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,156
Just let me know when you need backup.

241
