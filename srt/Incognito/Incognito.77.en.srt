It wasn't easy.

52
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,484
But I had to be strong.

53
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,071
Strong enough to let go.

54
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,119
It's about accepting things
that are beyond our control.

- Target is-- Hey, wait!

187
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,755
You can't just go to him.
We have to be discreet.

188
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,674
All units, we have eyes on the target.

189
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,594
- Sparrow, stall him.

190
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,679
Don't let him get away. I'm on my way.

I've worked at an <i>onsen </i>before.

207
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,165
After that, I worked at a noodle shop.

208

need a school allowance,

00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,718
and I've got to pay for their tuition fee.

212
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,927

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,229
I didn't know you were bringing company.

231
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,566
Too bad.

232
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,152
I only bought food for one person.

233
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,863
But that's okay.

234
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,407
I've got something else here.
What would you like?

235

Would you like some, uh…
