1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,210
I heard the news

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,212
that Jake Dela Cuesta was murdered

3
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,922
You have nothing to worry about, sir.

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,925
I will still be your good soldier, sir.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,137
You know, when Tom has these moments,

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,806
he'd go to his brother's bakery.

7
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,308
Where's the bakery located?

8
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,310
About your tattoo…

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,814
Is that the only tattoo you got
during your military service?

10
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:26,526
I took it as part of a covert operation.

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,404
What operation? With what group?

12
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,115
There are protocols of confidentiality

13
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,325
that blood can't breach.

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,119
Did you find any info about your brother?

15
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,704
My brother's name was there.

16
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,706
His file points to Isabel Escalera.

17
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,915
But JB…

18
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,001
I found another name there.

19
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,335
Whose name?

20
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,795
Your father's name.

21
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:59,517
[theme music playing]

22
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,184
Apparently, he's on their payroll.

[phone thuds]

24
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,813

[JB exhales slowly]

28
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,506
He mentioned something to me

29
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,886
about doing covert operations
for the government.

30
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,933
It's probably part of their
intelligence operations

31
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,601
on the Escaleras.

32
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,604
Covert?

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,982
But he used his real name.

34
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,613
[sighs deeply]

35
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,908
Andres, I know nothing about this.

36
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,704
I also want to know the truth.

37
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,207
But I'm telling you,

38
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,918
I grew up admiring my father.

39
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,005
He's was good and respectable soldier.

40
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,716
He's not corrupt.

41
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,429
[unsettling music crescendos]

42
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,890

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,516
Greg.

44
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,185
You have a new contract for my group?

45
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,104
Yes.

46
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,898
You're familiar with our target.

47
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,483
What do you mean?

48
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,821
[Greg scoffs]

49
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,533
The Escaleras again?

50
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,826
Yes.

51
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,872
This time, you need to
retrieve something from them.

52
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,710
A hard drive?

53
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,421
Their master list.

54
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,007
That is now the contract.

JB, I'm just telling you
what I saw on the hard drive.

57

Fine.

58
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,733
But I need his help.

[tense music playing]

60

For what?

61
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,329
If he was part of the DPA
like you mentioned,

62
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,791
he will know a lot
about the Escaleras' operations.

63
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,586
Andres.

64
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,215
You've already got what you wanted.

65
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,593
You opened the hard drive.

66
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,513
What do you suppose I do, JB?

67
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,599
Confront Isabel Escalera?

68
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,394
Expose myself?

[exhales deeply]

00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,024
Andres, my father is old.

71
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,070
You won't get anything from him.

[tense music continues]

73
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,492
But I have to try.

74
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,328
Even I struggle to get close to him.

75
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,832
It isn't easy. What more do you want?

76
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:59,632
[tense music continues]

77
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,010
Fine.

78
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,179
I won't force you to do anything.

[sighs sharply]

80
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,482
It's dangerous for you
to hold on to that hard drive.

81
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,530
Be careful.

[tense music swells]

83

The names on their payroll…

00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,425

00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,511
police and military officers, businessmen,

87
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,599
and civilians involved
in their illegal operations.

88
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,314
That's why you can't entrust
the mission to the military.

89
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,192
So, you're assigning it to my group.

90
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,944
We both know

91
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,906
the Escaleras have a mole among our ranks.

92
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:11,120
So, our goal is to cleanse
the military and the government.

93
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,583
And that hard drive
will be a huge help with that.

For a while, I thought you let me go.

189
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,183
[sniffles]

190
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,519
So if I didn't look for the ring,

191
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,987
does that mean you're letting me go?

192
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:09,497
[somber music continues]

193
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,836
[sniffs]

194
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:25,804
[phone buzzing]

195
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,518
[sniffles]

196
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,481
Yes, Contractor?

197
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,196
Okay. I'll be there.

198
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,033
Hey!

199
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:46,909
Tomas!

200
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,537
Why did you walk away?
You're so dramatic!

201
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,413
Hey!

202
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,916
Tomas!

203
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,709
Go back there and face your brother,

204
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,336
who turns out to be toxic.

205
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,796
Tell him that he's wrong--

206
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,297
Why do you care?

207
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,384
Who told you to talk to my brother?

208
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,805
Uh, I just want to make
your life easier, okay?

209
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,431
Instead of staring and standing outside

210
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,016
like you're window shopping,

211
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,726
- What?
- I took it upon myself

212
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,311
that it's time for you to buy.

213
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,521
Window shopping?

214
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,730
- Yes!
- I don't do that.

215
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,107
I don't like shopping.

216
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,026
Gosh, it's a metaphor, okay?

217
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,821
I just want you and your brother
to patch things up is all.

218
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,990
[phones chiming]

219
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,339
[phone dings]

220
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,011
You know what, Gab? You're too nosy.

221
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,015
What? Wow, okay. Sorry for being nosy.

222
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,601
I'm sorry for stepping in.
I thought you were just shy.

223
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,228
I thought it would be a happy reunion.

224
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,314
I had no idea your brother was like that.

225
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,610
Look, I just want to…

226
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,405
call it quits because of
what happened with Buddy.

227
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,698
Quits?

228
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,200
I don't care if we're quits or not.

229
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,535
I'm good.

230
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,703
- Okay!
- Okay.

231
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,705
Alright then. If you say so.

232
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,416
Hey, it's not my fault

233
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,335
your brother has a bad attitude, okay?

234
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,295
You're just like him, by the way.

235
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,505
Ugh!

236
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,008
I'm nosy, huh? Whatever.

237
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,803
Madel.

238
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,932
I'm done with my meds.

239
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:38,520
[ominous music playing]

240
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,480
Dad.

241
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,567
Your tattoo

242
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,819
and the insignia

243
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,447
that appeared on the Escaleras' master
list

244
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,907
are one and the same.

245
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,618
[dramatic music sting]

246
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,495
Who are they after?

247
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,413
Is it me?

248
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,915
Or you?

249
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,793
Master list?

250
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,087
You have it?

251
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,424
Is this about your
previous covert operations?

252
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,510
Is that why your name

253
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,303
is on their payroll?

254
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:16,976
[suspenseful music playing]

255
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,186

[foreboding music playing]

257
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,482
Alright, bring that outside.
Handle it with care.

258
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:31,073
[foreboding music continues]

259
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,784
Careful with that.

260
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,497
[engine revs]

261
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,209
What do you want?

262
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,003
Uh, is Mrs. Escalera there?

263
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,713
She's no longer on the island.

264
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,506
Is that so?

265
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,716
Do you know where she is?

266
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,217
Why? Who are you?

267
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,597
Hey, be careful with that.

268
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,307
That's Sir Donato's painting.

269
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,393
Mrs. Escalera is waiting for it.

270
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,980
You're both dead if that breaks.

271
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,606
Careful now.

272
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,900
Well? Do you need anything else?

273
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,112
I'm good. Thank you.

274
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,698
[suspenseful music playing]

275
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,492
What exactly is your involvement
in all of this, Dad?

276
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,286
I told you,

277
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,788
I was a secret operative.

278
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,416
And I'm telling you now,

279
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,088
that master list should never
see the light of day.

280
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,923
It's dangerous.

281
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,719
[suspenseful music continues]

282
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,012
Give it to me.

283
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,811
JB, if you know where it is,

284
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,688
go get it.

285
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,191
This can't get out.

286
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,110
It'll put many people in danger.

287

[suspenseful music playing]

297
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,932
[Greg] What's the problem?

298
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,433
[Andres] Sir, he had something to do

299
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,018
with my brother's abduction!
[breathing heavily]

300
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,312
It's the reason I joined your group.

301
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,356
I'm looking for my brother.

302
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:14,027

[clears throat] Sir.

306
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,087
Andres, where are you?

307
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,092
Uh, I'm just attending to
some personal matters, sir.

308
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:43,932
[suspenseful music continues]

309
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,809
I need to talk to you in person.

310
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,480
Okay, sir. Can we talk tomorrow?

311
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,316
Sure.

312
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,818
What is this about?

313
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,325
I'd rather not discuss it over the phone.

314
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,409
I'll just see you tomorrow.

315
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,410
Alright.

316
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:18,008
[suspenseful music continues]

317

[car door closes]

318
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,021
Is this the delivery for Ma'am Isabel?

319
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,814
Are you working for Mrs. Escalera?

320
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,523
Yes, sir.

321
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,400
We have a lot to unload.
Thanks for the help.

322
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,818
Oh, you're welcome.

323
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,278
Let me help you with that.

324
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,411
Let's put it down here.

325
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,293
Contractor.

326
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,295
JB!

327
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,297
How are you?

328
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,800
Still alive and kicking.

329
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,635
Beer, please.

330
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,220
How's everything with the family?

331
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,015
Well, it's still the same.
Nothing's really changed.

332
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,102
Seems like heavy stuff.

333
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,228
[JB chuckles softly]

334
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,021
That's not what I came here for.

335
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,690
What's our new contract?

336
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:23,407
[ominous music playing]

337
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,786
Escalera?

338
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,792
Yes. Somehow,
we keep going back to them.

339
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,461
[suspenseful music playing]

340
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,588
We need to retrieve a master list.

341
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,092
A master list?

342
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,804
It's in a hard drive.

343
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,016
[suspenseful music sting]

344
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,519
I saw the Escaleras at the hotel.

345
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,105
Are you trying to say
that we've been compromised?

346
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,607
The Contractor called me
about the new contract.

347
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,901
It's about the Escalera hard drive.

348
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,195
JB, this is a huge problem!
We have to think of something.

349
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,114
- Andres, pick up!
- [line ringing]

350
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,408
- Mrs. Isabel Escalera?
- Come in.

351
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,994
Oh, please be careful,
that's my son's painting.

352
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,496
- Is Auntie Isabel upstairs?
- Yes, sir.

353
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,916
Isabel Escalera, I need to speak with you.
