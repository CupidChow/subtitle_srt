00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,503
<i>Secretary Barrios</i>
<i>has made a lot of enemies.</i>

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:05,130
<i>Which means she's crossed a lot of people.</i>

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,674
<i>Including Velasco Mining Corporation.</i>

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:12,554
<i>There's also a complaint against them</i>
<i>for hiring minors to work in their mines.</i>

5
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,223
<i>Human trafficking.</i>
<i>Do you know who's behind it?</i>

6
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,725
<i>It all leads back to El Cano.</i>

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,518
<i>How is it related to Raven?</i>

8
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,020
<i>We had an encounter with his group.</i>

9
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,646
<i>He's my lead to El Cano.</i>

<i>All the contracts we accepted…</i>

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,194
<i>I was hoping</i>
<i>that it all leads back to El Cano.</i>

12
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,487
<i>Because I've been suspecting,</i>

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>that Manuel works for El Cano.</i>

14
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,325
<i>Tell us about yourself. How have you been?</i>

15
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,910
<i>Someone took me in.</i>

16
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,620
<i>I owe him the life I have today.</i>

17
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,789
<i>I hope we get to meet that person.</i>

18
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,832
<i>That can be arranged.</i>

19
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,626
<i>But I'm hoping we can take our time.</i>

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,754

<i>- Oh, right! Thank you!</i>

21
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,006

Grandma asked me to give this to you.

She said it's for your dad.

Pa! [chuckles softly]

Sorry, sorry, I had to make a stop.

I've been waiting for you.

Mm-hmm, just for dinner.

Okay.

Let's finish it.

Will you beat me this time?

You're really challenging me, huh, Pa?

50
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,808
You've been thinking
about that since last night.

51
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,310
Oh, well…

- Checkmate!

it's checkmate.

I know you've already eaten,
but come join me.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,457
- Haven't you had dinner yet?
- Not yet.

71

Alright, I'll join you.

72
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,253

- Grandma.
- Mm-hmm?

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,027
We're getting our land back, okay?

80
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,616
But it's going to cost us a lot,

81
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,160
and the process is still long.

Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,132
So what's a little
more patience for the land?

86
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,676
- [chuckles]
- Right?

87
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,970
[breathes deeply] Oh, well…

88
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,849
Thank you, Andres.

89
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:13,313

everything you're doing for the family.

94
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,471
It's too sweet.

95
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,139
It's sugar with just a bit of coffee.

96
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,348
- That's it.
- It's fine.

97
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,725
It's wrong because coffee should be pure.

98
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,185
- It's bad for your health.
- [Gab] Oi!

99
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,811
- Pure is better…
- [Max] Hey!

100
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,521
- Sir JB!
- Like him.

101
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,898
You're in a good mood!

102
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,567
- He's all smiles. Right?
- He looks happy

103
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,319
- It's nice.
- What's up with you?

104
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,487
- Nothing.
- You okay?

105
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,113
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

106
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,908
You can't wipe that smile off your face.

107
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,159
- Nothing.
- Yeah.

108
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,994
No, I think he's got a girlfriend.

109
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,080
- Woah.
- That's a success smile.

110
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,707
Really? You've got a girlfriend?

111
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,501
- Really?
- No way.

112
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,128
Come on, don't make us guess.

113
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,755
Spill the beans. Spill it.

114
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,173
[Gab] Yeah, tell us.

115
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,342
Sir.

116
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,346
I found my brother.

117
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,681
- Oh…
- [Max] Wait, really?

118
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,225
- [unsettling music playing]
- We're not alone anymore.

119
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,602
- [Max] What?
- [Gab] Wait… Oh my god!

120
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,521
- [Gab] Congrats!
- Thank you!

121
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,772
- Dude, finally!
- Congrats!

122
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,940
[JB] Congrats!

123
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,527
Finally, bro,
all those solo missions paid off.

124
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,153
- [Gab laughs]
- Hey!

125
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,571
- Shush it.
- [Tomas] Just kidding.

126
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,658
But we're really happy for you. [chuckles]

127
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,785
Time flies, huh?

128
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,789
He's all grown up,
but he's still the same.

129
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,208
He's a good kid.

130
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,670
My grandma was so happy.
You should've seen her.

131
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,132
You know what? That's
the best gift that you can give to her.

132
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,593
- Your family's whole again.
- Yeah.

133
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,472
- [unsettling music continues]
- So, how about a celebration?

134
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,933
- [Gab] Yes!
- [Max] Yeah! Let's celebrate!

135
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,936
And maybe one of these
days we can meet him too.

136
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,896
- Yeah. We'll do that.
- Yes.

137
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,857
Let's set that up, we should.

138
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,610
We know you sacrificed
a lot to find your brother.

139
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,070
So, good job.

140
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,865
Thank you, sir.

141
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,451
But sir, I still have
to buy our land back.

142
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,369
Let's start this contract already.

143

[slide clicks]

144
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,457
Wow.

00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,351
Wow.

[magazine clicking]

152
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,401
- Aim carefully.
- Huh?

153
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,612
Be careful.

154
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,947
- Is he faster now?
- Yes, he's a fast learner.

155
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,491
Now your gun.

156
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,578
- That's it.

- Yeah.

- Good job.
- [chuckles]

160
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,711
Good job.

161
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,595
Look at him, sir, he's just like you.

162
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,307
[chuckles softly]

163
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,353
Did you know I was
young when I adopted Diego?

164
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,442
I've seen many kids
separated from their families, but…

165
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,238
Diego was different.

[sinister music playing]

167
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:59,372
It all started with him,
which is why you helped us all.

[sinister music continues]

169
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,421
And because of you and your help,

170
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,340
there's so much more we can change.

BENR Sec. Josephine Barrios

is a keynote speaker at a charity event.

176
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,319
The beneficiaries are
victims of human trafficking.

177
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,823
- Hold on, sir. Time out for a second.
- [dramatic music playing]

178
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,575
BENR and human trafficking?

179
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,786
Isn't that environmental?
What's the connection?

180
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,663
She's fresh off a major win.

181
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,957
Barrios led a crackdown
in an illegal operation

182
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,252
with a mining company
that employed underage minors.

183
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,713
Her stance might seem anti-poor

184
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:54,093
but she and those
backing her closed a mine

185
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:59,515
- critical to the community relying on it.
- [dramatic music continues]

186
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:05,187
Her environmental
advocacy is just a front…

187
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,985
while she serves the elite.

188
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:17,658
- So, we must take down Josephine Barrios.
- [dramatic music crescendos]

189
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,329
- Covert VIP protection.
- [dramatic music resumes]

190
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,914
That's our mission.

191
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,542
We'll be there at the venue

192
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,419
to be her secondary layer of security.

193
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,338
Sir, if we're the shadow team,

194
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,256
who will handle the first layer?

195
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:38,304
- Barrios has her own security detail.
- [dramatic music continues]

196
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,098
It's a big event,
so there will also be police present.

197
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,644
[JB] As second layer detail,

198
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,979
no one must know we're there.

199
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,151
[Max] If anything slips past
the first line, we'll take action.

200
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,694
[Gab] Silent but ready.

201
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,156
- [music turns ominous]
- We'll carry out this act of retribution

202
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,450
at an upcoming charity event.

203
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,037
Diego.

204
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,706
I'm counting on you on this one.

205
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,043
[ominous music continues]

206
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,503
Are you ready?

207
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,049
JB, lead the team.

208
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,929
Gab, Tomas, Miguel, you're on recon.

209
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,972
It's also your task
to bring in our weapons.

210
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,600
Max, you handle the comms.

211
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,852
Make sure no one else
gets inside the perimeter.

212
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,562
- Yes, sir.
- Andres.

213
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,231
Stay in the shadows.

214
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,901
- Keep a close watch on Barrios.
- [Andres] Yes, sir.

215
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,694
Just make sure she doesn't notice you.

216
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,446
Yes, sir.

217
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,075
[ominous music continues]

218
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,286
Sir, I have ideas on
how to execute the mission.

219
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,665
We mustn't be associated
with whatever happens.

220
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,418
We will not even lift
a finger in her assassination.

221
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,920
This contract is critical.

222
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,924
So, let's do this clean. No mistakes.

223
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,718
- Yes, sir.
- Copy, sir.

224
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,097
We must teach
people like Barrios a lesson.

225
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,393
I like that idea of yours.

226
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:14,150
[ominous music continues]

227
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,662
[Tomas grunts]

228
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,331
[ominous music fades]

229
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,584
Well? When will we meet Jun?

230
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,169
I'll set a date with him.

231
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,588
- Okay. Looking forward to it.
- [chuckles]

232
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,214
[Greg] Andres.

233
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,340
Sir?

234
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,426
I'm really happy for you.

235
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,096
You searched for years.

236
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,224
Finally, you found your brother.

237
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,477
Thank you, sir.

238
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,188
The group helped a lot to make it happen.

239
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,691
Where are you headed now?
Are you meeting up with Jun?

240
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,026
I'll probably meet him tomorrow.

241
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,695
I invited him to visit our father's grave.

242
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,489
I'm just waiting for his call.

243
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,034
He's probably still processing everything,

244
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,328
especially since
he grew up with another family.

245
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,206
Have you met who took him in?

246
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,333
Not yet.

247
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,668
But he said it was a good man.

248
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,046
I have to go, sir.

249
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:23,719
[dramatic music playing]

250
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,682
[dramatic music crescendos]

251
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,352
[Gab] Okay, first…

252
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,561
Where's your ring?

253
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,813
- It's here.
- Okay.

254
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,815
[Gab breathes deeply]

255
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,151
[cicada chirping]

256
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,736
- Okay.
- Ready?

257
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,363
It's great that your father acted quickly.

258
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,949
You can finally get
your inheritance and your freedom.

259
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,992
Well, that was the agreement.

260
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,370
I'll get Mama's resthouse
after I get married.

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,914
Oh, thank You, God!

262
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,333
And thank you.

263
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,584
[chuckles]

264
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,963
You're such a convincing actor, huh?

265
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,507
[chuckles]

266
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,468
- [clears throat]
- You okay?

267
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,136
Hey.

268
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,805
- It's nothing.
- Okay.

269
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,265
Come on. Let's go inside.

270
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,224
[Gab inhales deeply]

271
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,350
Oh, shit. Shit.

272
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,685
Oh.

273
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,105
[Gab chuckles with excitement]

274
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,234
[Gab] Hello, hello!

275
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,278
- Hello!
- Hello, attorney!

276
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,030
- Attorney, my husband, of course.
- Good evening, sir.

277
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,407
[Gab chuckles] You're right.

278
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,492
It is a good evening.
Everything's good, indeed.

279
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,536
[Gab claps, exhales loudly]

280
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,579
Hmm?

281
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,540
This is going to be the last time
we'll ever going to see each other.

282
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,379
My inheritance. Where do I sign?

283
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,132
- [smacks lips]
- [Philip] Calm down, dear.

284
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,509
I have some other good news for you.

285
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,552
[Tomas] Huh?

286
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,554
- Hmm, okay.
- [chuckles nervously]

287
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,347
- Okay, go.
- [Philip] Uh, attorney?

288
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,640
Yes?

289
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,565
You are officially wed.

290
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,068
[dramatic music playing]

291
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,446
Congratulations.

292
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,825
[gasps, whimpers]

293
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,035
What did you do?

294
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,995
[Tomas breathing erratically]

295
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,289
Oh, why do you seem mad?

296
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,584
I went out of my way to do this for you.

297
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:23,714
Those good-for-nothing employees at
the municipal hall, were taking too long.

298
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:28,469
So, I pulled some strings to expedite
the registration of your marriage.

299
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,972
[dramatic music continues]

300
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,515
- Okay.
- [Philip] Well?

301
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,478
Sir, sir, so… It's official?
[chuckles nervously]

302
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,896
Of course!

303
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,483
Well, it's a requirement
so I can officially…

304
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,238
t-transfer your inheritance
under your name.

305
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,324
- Oh, right.
- [Philip] Got it?

306
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,535
Well?

307
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,536
[Tomas clears throat]

308
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,956
Aren't you even going to say thank you?

309
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,040
Thank you!

310
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,167
- [Philip] Okay!
- Thank you, attorney.

311
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,460
[Philip] Attorney?

312
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,753
[Tomas panicked breathing]

313
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,172
[Philip claps] It's yours.

314
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,758
Congratulations.

315
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,594
You're now officially husband and wife!

316
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,680
[light-hearted music playing]

317
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,473
- Wife…
- [chuckles nervously]

318
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,392
Thank you.

319
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,727
[Philip] Thank you, attorney.

320
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,521
[Tomas breathes shakily]

321
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:24,775
[light-hearted music continues]

322
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,527
- [Gab pants] Hey.
- I need a moment.

323
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,196
- You okay?
- I can't breathe.

324
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,115
- Okay, breathe. Breathe.
- [Tomas breathes deeply]

325
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,616
Inhale…

326
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,203
Exhale-- What the actual fuck?
Inhale… [inhales deeply]

327
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,080
- Exhale. [exhales loudly]
- Thank you.

328
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,332
You good now? Fuck!

329
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,253
- [both breathing deeply]
- [light-hearted music continues]

330
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,006
Annulment. That's what we'll do.

331
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,843
I'll process it once
I get all of Mama's properties

332
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,803
so Papa can't take it back.

333
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,929
[breathes deeply]

334
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,974
I'll do anything to end
this as fast as possible.

335
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,475
I'll pay for everything, I promise.

336
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,519
You won't have to pay a penny.

337
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,313
I'm so sorry, Tomas!

338
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,108
I'm sorry I put us in this situation.

339
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,653
How could I not have foreseen this?!

340
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,239
I should've known Dad would be meddling!

341
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,240
[exhales sharply]

342
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,408
- It's…
- You okay?

343
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,118
- It's fine.
- Sorry.

344
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,619
I'm sorry, too.

345
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,123
- Sorry for everything.
- Why are you apologizing?

346
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,000
He's the one to blame!

347
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,877
He had no business getting involved!

348
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,379
N-No… I'm just…

349
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,922
I'm sorry.

350
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,466
Okay.

351
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,552
We'll get an annulment. I promise.

352
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,679
Is this for real?

353
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,723
Argh!

354
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,559
I'll handle this, okay? I'll handle this.

355
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,354
I have contacts who might know what to do.

356
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,774
- [both breathing deeply]
- [light-hearted music ends]

357
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,652
I don't know where else
to look for Manuel Aguinaldo.

358
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,241
There's only one other way.

359
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,659
Jun.

360
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,122
Jun who?

361
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,793
Andres's brother.

362
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,379
[unsettling music playing]

363
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,633
What's Andres's brother got to do
with Manuel Aguinaldo?

364
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,097
Manuel adopted him when he was a kid.

365
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,307
[music turns tense]

366
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,184
How long have you known?

367
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,063
A while.

368
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,982
And you didn't tell Andres?

369
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,655
You let him chase
his own tail looking for Jun.

370
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,783
All along, you knew where to find him?

371
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,869
I didn't know where to find him.

372
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,955
All I know is,

373
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,916
if Andres finds his brother,

374
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,793
I'll find Manuel.

375
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,130
[tense music continues]

376
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,464
JB, look.

377
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,551
The El Canos are playing a long game

378
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,636
of gradual occupation.

379
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,514
They know no shame.

380
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,932
They show no mercy.

381
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,102
They're brutal.
They don't even spare infants.

382
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:10,566
[tense music continues]

383
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,069
You need to understand, JB.

384
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:20,284
There are things
we have to do for the greater good.

385
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:29,918
We'll use Jun to find Manuel.

386
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:42,347
[unsettling music playing]

387
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,357
<i>Andres is bound to get hurt.</i>

388
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,442
<i>What's your plan?</i>

389
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,235
<i>The Contractor and</i>
<i>I have the same objective.</i>

390
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,154
<i>No matter how I look at it,</i>

391
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,907
<i>we can't prevent Andres's</i>
<i>brother from getting involved.</i>

392
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,993
<i>JB, you have to choose.</i>
<i>Friendship or justice?</i>

393
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,912
<i>There are difficult decisions to be made.</i>

394
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,747
<i>It's nothing personal.</i>

395
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,296
<i>What's going on? Why are you here?</i>
