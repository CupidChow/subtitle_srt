What do you mean, just in case?
I know what you're going to say.

35

Just in case, my dad…

For lying to you.

Don't worry about it.

Let's go to Noah's area.

Sir, go straight to the safe zone.

We'll meet you there with the other kids.

88
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,984
Sir Lucio's men killed all of them.

89

By the way, I have an older brother.

90
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,654
His name is Thaniel.

91
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,867
They're making him fight against his will.

92
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,454
I hope you can save him
so he can start a new life, too.

93
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,291
Alright.

94
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,418
Leave him to me. Hop on now.

Are they all dead? [pants]

106
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,771
They're in here somewhere.

108
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,400

00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,048
Yes, they're escaping.

114
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,718
Sir, Manuel's men are getting away.

00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,553
Damn it.

134
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,224
That Manuel
should've been blown to pieces.

[Gab sighs sharply]

136
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,852
These must be the bodies from the blast.

137

Don't worry, once I find his body,

138
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,399
I'll shoot him again even
if he's already burning in hell.

Thank you for everything.

00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,473
We leave no man behind.

- Copy, sir.

157
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,520
Sir.

158
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,023
We'll take care of him.

159
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,070

Move!

[Tomas] Why did the others pull out?

168
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,132
Did they get scared or something?

169
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,134
[Miguel] I doubt it.

170
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,928
They chased all of us down.

171
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,555
Why would they back out now?

172
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,973
No, no!

173
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,850
Did they leave already?

174
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,268
Which way did they go?

175
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,146
JB and the others already blocked

176
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,605
the only exit in Lakandula.

177
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,607
Which means…

178
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,360
they had no plans of escaping.

179
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,571
Because if they did,
they would've attacked us.

180
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,406
They're planning something.

181
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,076
[Andres] Sir,
they still have six kids with them.

182
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,744
Where could they be going?

183
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,538
And another thing…

184
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,957
how many kids do they even have?

Manuel's at the camp.

187
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,340
I'm sure of it.

188
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:44,138
I bet he's furious
that we found his location.

189
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:48,350
[suspenseful music continues, fades]

190
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,561
How are the other areas?

191
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,770
[man] They're all clear.

192
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,232
If you see anything suspicious,
report immediately.

193
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,652
If you see any enemy,
don't hesitate to shoot.

194
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,698
[foreboding music playing]

195
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,533
Now go back to your posts.

196
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:09,914
[man] Sir.

197
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,256
How did Greg's team find us?

198
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,134
You don't know?

199
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,391
Lucio, go and talk
to our men and the kids.

200
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,394
Explain to them
why we need to continue to fight.

201
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,106
Those people are
standing in the way of our mission.

202
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,401
Alright, sir.

203
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,362
Let's go!

204
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,157
Move.

205
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,704
Do you know why we left earlier?

206
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,126
Because I couldn't let
anyone I value get hurt again.

207
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,505
Don't worry, sir. I've handled everything.

208
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,839
Just as you instructed.

209
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,093
We've come to this point with Greg…

210
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,596
because his men pushed me too far.

211
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,017
They've given me
a reason to wipe them all out.

212
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,355
And he won't stop until he kills me.

213
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:22,862
[tense music playing, fades]

214
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,906
I know him. He'll retaliate.

215
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,658
Then let's see who dies first.

216
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,331
No matter what happens,
we're finishing the contract.

217
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,002
I'll kill Manuel,
even if it costs me my life.

218
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,420
[dramatic music sting]

219
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,882
[unsettling music playing]

220
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,426
For now, hydrate and reload.

221
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,219
We go in later.

222
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,220
- Yes, sir!
- Copy, sir!

223
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,766
[unsettling music continues]

224
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,691
Only one of us…

225
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,571
either Greg or someone
from our group can survive.

226
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,783
[unsettling music continues]

227
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,287
This is for protection of
the mission we fight for.

228
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,207
The system and power,

229
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:22,671
weaklings like Greg and his people
are trying to destroy!

230
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,178
So prepare yourselves.

231
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:34,391
[unsettling music continues, ends]

232
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,269
[gun cocks]

233
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,231
Is this Manuel?

239
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,185
Guys, I got visuals on Manuel.

240
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,269
[Gab] Shit.

241
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:25,192
[suspenseful music continues]

242
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,822
- He's not far from here.
- [suspenseful music ends]

243
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,533
Load up. Let's move.

244
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,617
[Tomas] Let's go.
