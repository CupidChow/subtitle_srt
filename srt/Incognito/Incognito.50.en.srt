It's better you don't know who they are.

It will only jeopardize you.

After all, I wasn't able
to help your brother.

What are you waiting for?

79

Just leave her here.

80
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,143
She's not the contract,
it's the hard drive.

[sobs] Their batch was my last transaction

186
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,392
before I left the group.

187
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,938
Back then, I tried to save
a group of kids.

188
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,274
I managed to save half of them,

189
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,818
but so many children died, Andres.

190
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,321
One of the kids I saved…

191
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,947
was Jun.

192
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,157
[dramatic music sting]

193
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:12,875
[unsettling music playing]

194
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,587
<i>Okay, just keep going straight.</i>

195
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,631
<i>Keep going.</i>

196
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,799
<i>Just keep going straight.</i>

197
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,513
<i>Just keep going.</i>

198
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,268
What happened?

199
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,563
We ran, but while we were running,

200
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,065
his beanie fell off.

201
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,401
<i>My beanie fell over there.</i>

202
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,654
<i>My brother gave it to me.</i>

204
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,824
<i>Come on now.</i>

- [panting]
- [unsettling music continues]

206
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,870
He said his brother gave it to him.

207
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,414
So no matter how dangerous it was,

208
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,999
he went back for it.

209
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,252
[sobs] I went back for him, too, Andres.

210
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,008
I did everything I could
to save your brother.

211
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,177
Where did you take them?

212
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,932
[gasps] I got them on a shipping vessel.

213
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,103
Uh… The Marina Pacifica!

214
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,480
I entrusted them to the ship's captain.

215
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,773
What was the captain's name?

216
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,234
I don't remember.

217
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,653
That's enough.
We need to go! Come on!

218
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:31,412
[tense music playing]

219
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,002
[Andres] Get in!

220
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,965
[car doors close]

222
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,221
What are you doing?!

223
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,432
You should go!

224
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,850
You're just putting yourself in danger.

225
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,143
Don't worry about me.

226
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,853
I've been living on borrowed time.

227
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,188
Mister, speed up a little.

228
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:05,279
[tense music continues]

229
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,082
[van whooshing]

230
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,210
Wait, that's it?

231
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,712
We're just leaving Andres behind?

232
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:25,841
[morose music playing]

233
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,384
- Huh?
- Yes.

234
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,221
Damn, so that's it?
Like none of this ever mattered?

235
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,098
What if something happens to him?!

236
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:39,855
[morose music continues]

237
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,482
Which part of "the mission comes first"

238
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,775
don't you understand?

239
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,527
In this life, we're all dispensable.

240
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,405
The contractor can
replace us just like that.

241
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,783
That's why you shouldn't
get attached to anyone.

242
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,410
This is part of the job we signed up for.

243
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:01,794

246
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,939
I'll probably be on the run forever.

[pensive music playing]

248
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,110
But why is it that…

249
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,406
I finally feel like I'm free.

250
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,328
Free from our old life.

251
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:42,459
Free from hurting people,
from harming the innocent.

252
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,383
[pensive music turns dramatic]

253
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,218
From ruining their lives.

254
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,722
You know,

255
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,142
this is what my son wanted to do.

256
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,396
But never got the chance.

[sniffles]

258
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,861
So I'll do this for both of us.
