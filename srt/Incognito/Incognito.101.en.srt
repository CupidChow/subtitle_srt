[panicked breaths]

180
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,410
- [footsteps approaching]
- Shh.

181
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,247
<i>Be careful.</i>

182
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,958
I know someone's inside with you.

183
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,839
[unsettling music continues]

184
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,470
<i>Don't panic or make any noise.</i>

185
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:12,982
[breathes heavily]

186
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,150
Fuck.

187
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,110
[dramatic music stings]

188
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,864
- [panicked breaths]
<i>- Be quiet, Tomas.</i>

189
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,199
Didn't I tell you

190
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,453
your actions have consequences?

191
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,079
[dramatic music sting]

192
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:33,919
[unsettling music continues]

193
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,385
<i>Because you acted too slow,</i>

194
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,970
someone died.

195
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:49,935
[unsettling music continues]

196
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,397
<i>Go inside the cubicle</i>

197
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,400
and open the tank.

198
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,491
[whispering] Tomas, what's happening?

199
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,246
Is Barrios in danger?

200
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,126
[unsettling music continues]

201
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,715
[suspenseful music playing]

202
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,842
[Diego] <i>Sais, proceed with caution.</i>

203
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,683
[tense music sting]

204
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,771
[suspenseful music continues]

205
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:38,234
[faucet running]

206
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:51,163
[suspenseful music continues]

207
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:04,927
[suspenseful music continues]

208
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,151
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Diego] <i>Sais, get out of there.</i>

209
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,531
Copy.

210
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,995
<i>Tomas.</i>

211
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,371
Open the tank.

212
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,456
[winces]

213
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,293
[grunts]

214
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,255
[door opens]

215
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,091
[breathing heavily]

216
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,721
[plastic rustling]

217
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:55,060
[foreboding music playing]

218
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,064
[dramatic music sting]

219
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,735
[panicked breaths]

220
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,653
[Diego] <i>Have you retrieved it?</i>

221
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,779
A gun?

222
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,240
<i>Now…</i>

223
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,870
you will use that
to kill Josephine Barrios.

224
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,914
[tense music sting]

225
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,583
[breathing heavily]

226
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,335
W-Why me?

227
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:26,717
[tense music continues]

228
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,010
Shh.

229
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,638
Be quiet, Tomas.

230
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,934
<i>Didn't I tell you to just do as I say?</i>

231
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:44,318
In case you forgot,
we still have your uncle.

232
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:50,658
[inhaling, exhaling deeply]

233
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,867
Okay.

234
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,287
<i>You can go back out now, Tomas.</i>

235
00:15:55,371 --> 00:16:00,793
[unsettling music playing]

236
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,339
I said you can go back out now.

237
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:16,350
[breathing heavily]

238
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:22,815
- [indistinct chatter]
- [unsettling music continues]

239
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,072
Monkey was talking to someone earlier.

240
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,199
I don't know who it was.

241
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,369
We went to the restroom
and found a dead guest in there.

242
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,706
Barrios is definitely in danger.

243
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,125
[tense music playing]

244
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,462
Get the subject out of the venue now.

245
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,008
She can't stay here any longer.
Even if you have to drag her out, do so.

246
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,677
I'm already on standby.

247
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,929
Just give me the go signal.

248
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,850
Confirming.

249
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,106
I'm checking the possible exits
you can use without the guests noticing.

250
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,315
The west wing.

251
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:11,238
[tense music continues]

252
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,246
[Gab breathing heavily]

253
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,540
Oh, wait, guys.

254
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,334
Monkey sent me… He sent me--

255
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,544
- [thud]
- Sorry.

256
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,881
[breathes heavily, hesitates]
M-Monkey sent me a video.

257
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,426
[ominous music playing]

258
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,511
What does it say?

259
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:40,434
[tense music resumes]

260
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,272
Fuck.

261
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,108
Fuck.

262
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,027
Uh…um, um.

263
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,866
[breathes heavily]

264
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,785
Uh, guys…

265
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,082
Monkey sent me a video.

266
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,959
A video of his uncle who's all beaten up.

267
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,253
This must be
the reason he can't speak now.

268
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:13,801
[tense music continues]

269
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:31,360
[tense music continues]

270
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,823
We can't risk this, guys.

271
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,033
[gasps] Their lives are at stake.

272
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,702
Shark, what do we do?

273
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,205
We need to move now.

274
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,667
Our goal is to protect the subject.

275
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,919
We need to act fast.

276
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,005
Shark, please.

277
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,716
Do we have to do that?

278
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,426
Because if we do that,

279
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,512
Monkey and his uncle will die.

280
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,681
[dramatic music sting]

281
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:06,311
[tense music continues]

282
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:26,957
[tense music continues]

283
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,255
<i>Monkey, nod if you're being blackmailed.</i>

284
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,216
<i>They're watching Monkey's every move.</i>

285
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,552
<i>You're going back there.</i>
<i>Your brother will be suspicious.</i>

286
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,804
<i>If he's involved, I'll be his distraction.</i>

287
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,014
<i>Shark, what do we do?</i>

288
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,308
<i>Get the subject out of the venue now.</i>

289
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,601
<i>Monkey's uncle's life is at stake.</i>

290
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,270
<i>- Everything is working according to plan.</i>
<i>- That's good to hear.</i>

291
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,438
<i>Finish it now.</i>

292
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,190
<i>Let's find out who's blackmailing him.</i>

293
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,276
<i>And we'll find out</i>
<i>where Monkey's uncle is.</i>

294
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,153
<i>And we'll save both of them.</i>

295
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,156
<i>Eagle, can you trace</i>
<i>the person Monkey's on the phone with?</i>

296
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,782
<i>I need a location right now.</i>

297
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,700
<i>Got it.</i>

298
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,868
<i>Traced confirmed active line.</i>

299
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,620
<i>They're right inside the venue.</i>
