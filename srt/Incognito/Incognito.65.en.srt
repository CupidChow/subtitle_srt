00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,978
[sniffs, gasps]

185
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,191
[breathing shakily]

186
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,990
[suspenseful music intensifies]

187
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,705
[suspenseful music crescendos]

188
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,747
[quivers]

189
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,541
You know,

190
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,126
my life used to be happy.

191
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,171
I was a soldier.

192
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,756
I had a family.

193
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,301
A wife and a son.

194
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,387
We were happy.

195
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,599
But…

196
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,643
[inhales, exhales sharply]

197
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,397
Damn it.

198
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,444
It happens over and over again.

199
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,991
Every time I try, I keep failing, Andres.

200
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,829
I keep promising myself
that I'll stop drinking, but…

201
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,416
but I still do.

202
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,710
[pensive music playing]

203
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,921
[chuckles]

204
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,007
[breathes deeply]

205
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,843
Now, I'm thinking…

206
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,763
how I can make my family complete again…

207
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,474
after everything I've done.

208
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,476
Hmm?

209
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,438
[pensive music continues]

210
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,524
[inhales, exhales sharply]

211
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,401
What have you done, Miguel?

212
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,661
I killed someone, Andres.

213
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,497
[breathes deeply]

214
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,581
But…

215
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,334
I'm not sure.

216
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:59,713
[pensive music continues]

217
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,507
But when I…

218
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,551
saw that video,

219
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,308
I thought maybe it was
really me who killed my wife's partner.

220
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,897
Everything was…

221
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,568
Everything was a blur.
I can't remember anything.

222
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,319
Because…

223
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,198
Because I was so drunk.

224
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,242
[breathes heavily]

225
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:35,332
[somber music playing]

226
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,881
You said you're not sure.

227
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,218
What if it was really me?

228
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,636
But what if it wasn't?

229
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,807
[somber music continues]

230
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,058
Hmm?

231
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,728
You know, Miguel,

232
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,023
whatever you've done,

233
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,653
you should be ready
to face the consequences.

234
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,283
[Miguel breathes deeply]

235
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,995
I know.

236
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:20,252
[somber music continues]

237
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,046
[Andres exhales deeply] Let's go.

238
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,799
- Let's go.
- Come on.

239
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,930
[grunting]

240
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,934
- [Tomas grunts]
- Status report!

241
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,353
Status!

242
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,521
How are your comms?

243
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,440
Negative, sir. I've been trying for hours.

244
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,359
[panting]

245
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,865
Damn it.

246
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,910
Why are there so many them?

247
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,538
Well, Tomas? Will you be okay?

248
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,374
[chuckles] Of course, sir.

249
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,543
[straining]
As long as I have these, I can keep going.

250
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,711
I can handle this.

251
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,712
Alright, go down.

252
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,506

255
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,014
[Tomas] There's water over there, sir.

256
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,768
Wait, sir.

257
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:25,234

Sir! Sir!

262
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,016
Drink some water too!

263
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,726
I'll watch the bags.

264
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,771
[Tomas exhales deeply]

265
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,653
The water's clean, sir.

This won't do.
