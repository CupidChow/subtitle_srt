But we must not stop

92

that if I don't withdraw the charges
against Velasco Mining Corp.,

104
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,105
you'll have me fired as BENR Secretary?

105
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,151
It's not my fault if that will
cause people to lose their jobs.

106
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,820
But if the environment gets destroyed

107
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,990
and forced labor still
exists in mining companies,

108
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,201

I'm not feeling well.

181
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,057
Hold on. What about our plans?

182
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,479
[tense music playing]

183
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:37,900
[indistinct chatter]

184
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,778
The donation.

185
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,365
Dude, who's going to come up
on stage with me to hand over the check?

186
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,158
You can do it alone.

187
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,993
You're the one running for office.

188
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,620
You need the publicity.

189
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,500
The program's about to start,
can't you stay just a bit longer?

190
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,919
[tense music continues]

191
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,712
Jaguar, do not lose him.

192
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,841
Eagle, status?

193
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,388
[Max] <i>The target is advancing.</i>
<i>He's approaching the corridors.</i>

194
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,349
[tense music continues]

195
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,350
[beeps]

196
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,897
Damn it!

197
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,649
He went to a blind spot.

198
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,653
[Tres] <i>Phase one has</i>
<i>been completed without a hitch.</i>

199
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,197
[Selo] Can't you stay just a bit longer?

200
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,576
Bro, I'll just make
it up to you next time.

201
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,327
I'm really not feeling well.

202
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,498
[tense music continues]

203
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,458
Aren't you going
to say goodbye to the others?

204
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,794
Just tell them I said goodbye.

205
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,339
Okay, I'll keep you updated.

206
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,049
Thanks.

207
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,510
Alright Selo, I'll just walk him out.

208
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,636
Take care.

209
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,518
Hello, ma'am.

210
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,564
[tense music continues]

211
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,773
- [keyboard clacks]
- [sighs deeply]

212
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,901
Jaguar, you're going
to have to go solo on this one.

213
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,653
Leave this to me.

214
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,698
Excuse me.

215
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,661
Jaguar, give me the exact
grid moving to your position.

216
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,164
[Miguel] <i>I've got this.</i>

217
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,458
<i>Focus on protecting the subject.</i>

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,168
You're needed there more.

219
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,296
[tense music continues]

220
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,631
He's right.

221
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,257
She can leave her room any second.

222
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,508
We need you here.

223
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:35,267
[sighs] Okay. Jaguar,
proceed with extreme caution.

224
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,354
Copy.

225
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,941
[guest chattering indistinctly]

226
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,528
[tense music continues]

227
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:06,465
[tense music builds]

228
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,676
[breathing heavily]

00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,691
[sighs deeply]

232
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,821
I'm not staying in this goddamn room.

233
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,618
Madam, it's dangerous out there.

234
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,954
Have you forgotten
there are death threats against you?

235
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,290
And have you forgotten
that I eat death threats for breakfast?

236
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,709
Sorry, ma'am.

237
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,836
You're too important
for us to just leave alone.

238
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,880
[huffs] Why did I even come here

239
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,299
if you're not going
to let me talk to other people?

240
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,637
- [footsteps receding]
- [dramatic music fades]

241
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:02,813
[unsettling music playing]

242
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,858
[Tres] <i>Uno,</i>
<i>Cuatro is almost at the entry point.</i>

243
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,360
This will be a piece of cake.

244
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,531
[JB] <i>Monkey,</i>
<i>Sparrow, sweep the whole venue.</i>

245
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,658
<i>Eyes open for anything off-script.</i>

246
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,909
- [Tomas] <i>Copy.</i>
- [Gab] <i>Copy that.</i>

[unsettling music continues]

248
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,416
So, how are you feeling?

249
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,835
I'm feeling a bit unwell, but I'm okay.

250
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,045
Are you sure?

251
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,379
Where's your car?

252
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:34,094
[unsettling music continues]

253
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,144

[foreboding music fades]

259
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,002
Long time no see, sir.

260
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:55,968
[sinister music playing]

261
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,762
You haven't changed at all.

262
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,975
Even now, you're still a coward.

263
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,604
I'm not a coward.

264
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,234
You were the one
who taught me to be careful

265
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,735
because you never know…

266
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,280
when the enemies will attack.

267
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,118

What do you want from me?

270
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,039
Help! [groans]

271
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,916

- [grunts]

<i>You betrayed us.</i>

275
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,934
<i>Didn't you teach me,</i>
<i>that we have to make sacrifices</i>

276
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,769
<i>to accomplish what needs to be done?</i>

277
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,188
<i>The mission comes first.</i>

278
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,857
[suspenseful music playing]

279
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,442
<i>Team, stay focused.</i>

280
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,777
<i>Our enemies' moves are well-calculated.</i>

281
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,822
[man] <i>Be quiet.</i>

282
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,616
<i>Don't make a scene.</i>

283
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,951
<i>You have to do everything I say.</i>

284
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,161
<i>Monkey has been compromised.</i>

285
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,204
<i>You know how this works.</i>

286

<i>If you can help Monkey, then that's good.</i>

287
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,999
<i>But if you can't,</i>
<i>then the mission comes first.</i>

288
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,709
<i>We can still do something about this.</i>

289

<i>Let's find out who's blackmailing him.</i>

290
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,339
<i>That way, we'll know</i>
<i>where Monkey's uncle is.</i>

291
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,882
<i>We can save them both.</i>

292
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,966
<i>Finish the job.</i>

293
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,302
<i>Shh.</i>
