There are no enemies here,

I've been walking around for a while.

193

Do not engage…

196
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,319
we must protect the hostages.

197
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,237

Please ask your friends for help!

203
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,015
How?!

204
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,309
They took my phone, didn't they?

205
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,520
Just stay quiet.

206
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,814
Don't do anything to make them angry,

207
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,899
so they don't hurt you.

- Please, have mercy!
- Calm down, my child.

227
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,438
- Please, pick someone else!
- Don't you want to see heaven?

228
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,398
No! No!

229
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,733
You have been chosen.

230
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,820
I have a mother who depends on me!

Please, not the people, sir.

235
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,455
Take me instead, just leave
my employees out of this.

[Muñoz chuckles]

239
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,796
I am your boss. I won't abandon you.

240
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,383

all who complain against me…

247
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,195
shall not enter the land I have promised.

248
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,282
All who defy my will…

249
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,704
defy our God as well.

250
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,501
But what you're doing is not godly.

251
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,127
This is not godly!

252
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,214

Stick to the plan. Move fast.
