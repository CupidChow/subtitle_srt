If you say so.

45
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,209
Go.

46
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,089
- That's not how he did it.
- Again!

47
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,008
I can do it.

48
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,886

I'll make sure those Manalastas
won't mess with us again.

Is this our life now?

Riddled with violence?
Always running away?

78
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,419
We will reclaim our land.

I know this is a long way
from home.

But your safety is my priority.

91

- He might come out early.
- I hope not.

- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

145
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,699
Yes. Besides, Joel is
working overtime today.

146

- You know, we need it.
- I see.

147
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,828
I'm really okay.

148
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,912
- Sure?
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,999
Okay, but after this,
you'd better go home.

Joel, aren't you done
with Table 8?

156
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,222
- Me? I'm almost done.
- Thank you for dining with us.

157
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,932
- Thank you for dining, ma'am.
- Take care.

158
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,810
Come back again.
See, I've caught up to you.

159
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,813
Nice, that's what I like
about you.

160
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,315
You're working really hard.

161
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,691
Of course, Chef.

162
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,402
As you know, in two weeks,

163
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,404
I'm going to be a father.

164
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,324
[chef] Oh, I was the same
when I became a mom.

165
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,825
You became hardworking, Chef?

166
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,619
- I got healthier.
- [laughter]

167
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,121
That's why we need
to make sure the guests

168
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,914
in Room 317
are healthy and happy

169
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,751
for their 50th anniversary
celebration, okay?

170
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,212
Oh, by the way, make sure
to grant all Grandpa's requests

171
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,714
for their candlelit dinner.

172
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,923
- Yes, Chef.
- Yes, Chef.

173
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,216
- Thank you.
- Alright.

174
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,927
Oh, Bert, the students
ordered room service.

175
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,597
Can you deliver the food
to their room?

176
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,931
- Yes, Chef.
- Okay.

177
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,017
- [Joel] See?
- [chef] I'll try every flavor.

178
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,518
Thank you, Joel.
[chuckles]

179
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,604
[chef] Maybe… this one.

180

So you and Grandma deserve
the special treatment.
