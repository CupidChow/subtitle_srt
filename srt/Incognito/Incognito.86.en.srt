<i>No, but I got to talk to her son, Marcelo.</i>

<i>Do you know what I saw, Grandma?</i>

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,762
<i>He has a cigarette burn here.</i>

00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:15,890
<i>Do you mean the same kind as Vincent?</i>

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,643
<i>The one who went missing with Junjun?</i>

00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,693
Sorry.

25
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,280
Sorry? What for?

26
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,284
Sorry for all the times
I was mean and snappy.

27
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,537
For being moody and judgmental.
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,956
I'm done.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,750
I don't want to be mean anymore.

What's so funny? Is that so shocking?

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,637
Yeah, I might be drunk but…

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,931
I mean every word.

35
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,601
Okay, I'm sorry too then.

36
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,229
I'm sorry for…

37
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,149
snapping back at you sometimes.

38
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,110
I mean, most of the time. [chuckles]

39
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,237
You're a handful, you know.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,032
But I promise,
I'll try to be more patient, with you.

00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,719
Funny, huh?

46
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:02,765
We're always at each other's throats,
but here we are drinking together.

47
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,602
- [chuckles] Damn.
- [pensive music playing]

48
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,938
I don't have a real family,

49
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,441
and I don't even have real friends.

50
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,986
Hey, slow down. That's enough.

51
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,364
- You've had enough.
- Oh, come on.

52
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,741
Can you still drink?

53
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,786
I can't believe I once gave my dad a…

54
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,875
[voice breaking] I gave him a mug.

55
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,376

ones also hurt you the most?

[sniffles] Big news!

Shari's pregnant.

He's got a new child coming.

[Gab sobs]

71
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,924
All I want is to get Mommy's house.

72
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,219
After that,
we can forget about each other.

73
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,430
[pensive music continues]

74
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,599
[sobs] Do you know what he said?

75
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,602
He said I can only get my inheritance,

76
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,229
once I'm married.

77
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,647
[Gab chuckles wryly]

78
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,898
Is he out of his mind?

79
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,484
He actually thinks I'd get married?

80
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,111
Huh?

81
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,905
When? When will that happen?

82
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,826
It's impossible. I mean,
where am I going to find someone to marry?

83
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,495
What if I marry you?

84
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,455
[pensive music ends]

Have you really lost it? [chuckles]

87

[scoffs]

88
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,132
What? You'll marry me?

89
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,425
Yeah!

90
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,426
[Gab] What?!

91
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,928
I'll marry you if,

92
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,179
you'll give me a share.

93
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,558
What do you think? Okay, hear me out.

94
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,226
We'll just treat it,
like one of our contracts.

95
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,437
It doesn't have to be legal.

96
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,106
You just need
a husband to show your old man.

97
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,400
[smacks lips]

[patrons chatter indistinctly]

Once I get my inheritance,

101
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,952
- I'll give you your cut.
- Mm-hmm.

102
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,711
- [glasses clink]
- Don't drink anymore.

103
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,797
Mm.

[car window whirring]

106
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,650
- We're leaving tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

109
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,994
- [Andres] Sir?
- Yes?

110
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,287
- Sir?
- Yes, sir?

111
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,580
Good morning.

112
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,332
Is Sir Marcelo here?

113
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,751
We talked last time.
He told me to come back.

114
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,211
He didn't say he was expecting guests.

115
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,421
Just drop by the BSWP office.

116
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,673
No, no. I didn't come for aid.

117
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,802
Just tell Mayor Selo
that Andres Malvar's here.

118
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,346
- He knows me.
- Andres Malvar?

119
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,181
But the mayor isn't here.

120
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,476
Bro, I just saw him arrive.
Could you please just call him?

121
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,103
I told you he's not here.

122
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,357
[metal gate creaks, slams]

123
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,733

[unsettling music playing]

125
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,413
Men sure are easy to find.
Just track down their women.

126
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,333
[Max] So…

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,460
What's your plan?

128
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,798
I'm going to find that bastard.

129
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,091
[chair scrapes]

130
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,427
So he can lead me
to the leader of El Cano.

131
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,555
You know.

132
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,767
I don't really trust that Joris.

133
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,354
Me neither, Max.

134
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,149
But…

135
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,278
After what I did to him,
he'll be afraid to cross me again.

136
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,490
Honestly, it's kind of weird.

137
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,869
He said something about protection.

138
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,831
El Cano already killed off
everyone on the masterlist.

139
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,792
Except for those
that were already arrested.

140
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,881
Someone probably tipped Joris off.

141
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,092
If that's true…

142
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,760
If that's really the case…

143
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,475
that would mean El Cano
owes Dexter Tienza big time.

144
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,727
Or maybe.

145
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,229
They still need something from him.

146
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,611
If it's true that he's
under El Cano's protection,

147
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,240
so it's possible that Dexter
knows the leader of El Cano.

148
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,576
[quirky music playing]

149
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,286
[Tomas] So, we're done with step three?

150
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,038
[Gab] Mm-hmm.
We've got our birth certificates,

151
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,831
affidavit of single status,
and marriage licenses ready.

152
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,916
Everything's set.

153
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,086
We'll use official
documents to make it convincing.

154
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,049
Even the judge who'll
officiate the wedding is legit.

155
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,510
How about step four?

156
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,595
"Registration of Marriage Certificate."

157
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,138
Do we have to hire anyone

158
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,516
- to process our--
- I already did.

159
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,143
They won't actually process it,

160
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,605
so we won't be officially married.

161
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,483
Simple as that. [exhales]

162
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,526
Okay.

163
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,486
[quirky music fades]

164
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,821
JB…

165
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,576
It's impossible to take
down a group that powerful.

166
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,787
Max…

167
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,498
No matter what I do now,

168
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,418
or who I bribe,
no one will set my old man free.

169
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,631
No one in the government believes him.

170
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,592
[pensive music playing]

171
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,512
So you think this is your only option?

172
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,722
Yes.

173
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,518
I have to do what my dad has asked of me.

174
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,189
Complete the mission he couldn't finish.

175
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,733
Max, as long as I live,

176
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,944
I won't stop hunting those guys down.

177
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:34,031
[pensive music continues]

178
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,324
Alright.

179
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,618
I'll help you.

180
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,328
Max.

181
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,330
JB, it's okay.

182
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,293
We've been doing this from the start.

183
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,128
You expect me to back out now?

184
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,549
Thank you, Max.

[woman] Mayor!

188
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,607
Oh! Mayor!

189
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,233
- [knocks on car]
- Mayor, please help!

190
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,818
- Back up, miss.
- Help!

191
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,861
Please!

192
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,322
- My mother needs help.
- [Selo] Sir, it's okay.

193
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,992
We really need
money to pay for her treatment.

194
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,410
Please, Mayor.

195
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,786
[Selo] I hope this helps.

196

- Thank you!
- Take care!

197

Thank you.

[foreboding music intensifies, ends]

202
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,183
But the crucial part is,
my Dad must be there to witness

203
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,644
The civil wedding ceremony.

204
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,771
On my end,
my uncle needs to witness it too.

205
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,732
But he won't be a problem.
I can handle him.

206
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,151
- You sure?
- Of course.

207
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,362
- He won't snitch on us?
- No, he's nice.

208
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,614
Okay.

209
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,994
So I think [exhales thoughtfully]

210
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,873
the process will take
around six month to a year

211
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,292
before Dad transfers everything to me.

212
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,877
Then that's it.

213
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,506
And after that,

214
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,217
you'll cut ties with him?

215
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,553
Yes.

216
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,478
[sighs] You don't
have to rush this, you know?

217
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,439
No.

218
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,735
I'll nag him about it so
we can get my share right away.

219
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,365
By the way, you'll be getting around…

220
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,284
30 million pesos.

221
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,830
- Th-Thirty million pesos?

What the… [chuckles]

223
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,208
Isn't that a bit too much?

224
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,128
That's nothing compared,

225
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,672
to the freedom I'm getting.

226
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,300
Thirty million…

- [clicks tongue, sighs]
- [upbeat quirky music fades]

228

- Tomas.
- Hmm?

229
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,142
No one else must know about this contract.

230
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,602
- Of course. Except for my uncle.
- [upbeat quirky music resumes]

Okay.

232
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,981
Until it's done, no one else should know.

233
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,108
Okay.

234
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,444
Copy. Copy, Sparrow.

236
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,239
So, let's get married then.

Anytime.

[ominous music playing]

00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,833
There are two CCTV cameras.

241
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,711
One at the gate and one at
the corner of the second floor.

242
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,173
But only Tienza's woman is inside.

243
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,799
No sign of Tienza.

[sighs]

245
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,304
We'll wait for him to come back.

246
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,308
Then we'll time our move.

247
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,186
[sighs deeply]

248
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,229
What an ass that Tienza is.

249
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,523
He calls himself a general?

250
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,903
All he's done is indulge
his vices and abuse his power.

251

[sighs]

252
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,323
That's quite the norm now, huh?

But don't worry.

254

Once you're reinstated…

256
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,542

260

My case is still under review.

I don't want to get my hopes up,

262
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,686
