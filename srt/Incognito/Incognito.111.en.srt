00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,503
<i>I had my colleagues investigate Manuel.</i>

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:04,504
<i>It's confirmed.</i>

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,047
<i>He's connected to El Cano.</i>

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,590
<i>They were recruiting children.</i>

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,718
<i>You'll get out of here soon.</i>

6
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,178
<i>I really don't know how to thank you, son.</i>

7
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,471
<i>How are you?</i>

8
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,307
<i>Some decisions had to be made.</i>

9
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,767
<i>Even if you don't want them to,</i>

10
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,687
<i>your decision might hurt some people.</i>

11
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,273
<i>You cannot fix everything by choosing.</i>

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,733
<i>All we can do</i>

13
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:28,778
<i>is to choose</i>
<i>which pain we're willing to endure.</i>

14
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,946
<i>Is that from Andres?</i>

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,656
<i>He left our group chat.</i>

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,242
<i>Andres, we're leaving this house now.</i>

17
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,287
<i>I hope you also leave all your anger here.</i>

18
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,998
<i>When we get back to our land,</i>

19
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,001
<i>I hope you'll be back</i>
<i>to the old Andres we know.</i>

20
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,586
<i>I'll try, Grandma.</i>

21
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,503
<i>I've cloned it.</i>

22
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>These are good enough.</i>

23
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,757
<i>- Tell our men to get ready.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>Execute phase two.</i>

[mellow music playing]

27
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,610
[Andres] Gather here, everyone.
Thank you all for coming.

28
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,821
- [Esang] This feels like a dream.
- My goodness.

29
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:59,619
I never thought I'd be
able to return to our land alive.

30
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,581
That's why I'm really
grateful to you, Andres.

31
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,834
- Don't mention it.
- Thank you.

32
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:06,793
Hey, eat up.

33
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:10,046
This is a happy beginning for all of us.

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,175
And now, a delectable feast is before us.

35
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,010
So, dig in!

36
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,096
- Let's eat!
- Come on!

37
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,222
You should eat first, Andres.

38
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,808
Grandma has been
craving this since earlier.

39
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,727
- Thank you so much again.
- It's your favorite.

40
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,604
Yes. Go ahead and eat.

41
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,398
There's so much food.

42
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,359
- We have some drinks.
- Here you go.

43
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,527
- Thank you.
- Alright.

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,237
- Put it here.
- Thank you.

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,530
Drink up.

46
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,740
There's some soup here.

47
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,325
- Andres.
- Yes?

48
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,327
Uh… Here you go.

49
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,454
I made that for you.

50
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,874
Because it's cold here in our land.

51
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,125
[tender music playing]

52
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,710
- [chuckles]
- Thanks.

53
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,044
Of course.

54
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,172
Andres…

55
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,592
- Don't worry because…
- [laughs]

56
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,177
I'm always here for you.

57
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,763
Not just for you, but also for Grandma.

58
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,224
Mm.

59
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,768
Thank you. You're a real brother to me.

60
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,604
[chuckling]

61
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,606
You must be so hungry
that you're being overdramatic.

62
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,649
- Go ahead and dig in.
- Come on, let's eat!

63
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,027
- Yeah.
- [chuckling]

64
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,206
Thank you.

65
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,592
[Tomas] Hey.

66
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,802
Wow!

67
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,055
- I knew you'd be early.
- The food looks yummy!

68
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,349
My goodness! You ordered a lot!

69
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,600
My favorites!

70
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,145
I ordered everything because
you didn't tell me what you wanted.

71
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,105
Knowing you,
I bet you can finish all of these.

72
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,858
Of course! You know me too well.

73
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,943
[breathes deeply]

74
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,612
But in fairness to this
restaurant you booked,

75
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,239
it feels different.

76
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,865
- Why?
- It's like…

77
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,575
a great reception venue for a big wedding.

78
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,826
[chuckles]

79
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,703
Perfect timing since we haven't--

80
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,121
Shut up.

81
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,122
Are you crazy?

82
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,000
Just relax. Calm down. I'm sorry.

83
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,337
That's not something
you should joke about.

84
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,964
Yes, I know. That's why I'm saying sorry.

85
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,716
- What's that?
- Nothing.

86
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,928
Hmm.

87
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,596
Do whatever you want with it.

88
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,724
I don't mind if
you want to pawn it or sell it.

89
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,855
I'll list this on marketplace
as "slightly used." [chuckles]

90
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,570
[Shari exhales sharply]

91
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,906
- Thank you, love. Yes.
- Slowly now.

92
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,075
Albert, please arrange
the shopping bags at the back.

93
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,286
- Okay, ma'am. Leave it to me.
- Thank you.

94
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,745
Ugh.

95
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,623
- Love, I'm so hungry.
- [chuckles]

96
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,418
Good thing our favorite
restaurant is just nearby.

97
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,044
You have two mouths to feed.

98
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,255
- I know.
- [chuckling]

99
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,589
[exhales sharply]

100
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,094
- Uh… Honey.
- Hmm?

101
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,888
Our favorite spot.

102
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,683
- Okay.
- Of course, thank you.

103
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,395
Okay.

104
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,986
The rest of the group
hasn't arrived yet, right?

105
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,070
Yes, they're not yet here.

106
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,155
I'll go to the restroom first.

107
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,906
Perfect.

108
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:34,417
- [phone ringing]
- [foreboding music playing]

109
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,345
"Sir Philip"?

110
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,475
I'm so happy for all of us.

111
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,812
Because we now
have a place to call our own.

112
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,481
- [chuckling]
- Right?

113
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,442
But of course, I'm not the one
who should be speaking right now.

114
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,568
It should be Andres.

115
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,861
No need, Mister Domeng.

116
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,822
- Come on. Just a short speech.
- [chuckling]

117
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,158
Alright.

118
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,242
Uh…

119
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,954
I promised Papa that…

120
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,165
I'd reclaim our land.

121
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,711
Somehow, we're able
to do it one step at a time.

122
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,755
So now, I hope…

123
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,926
we'll work together to take care of

124
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,179
and enrich our land.

125
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,931
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you hear that?

126
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,016
Did you hear what he said?

127
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,143
- Andres, this is for you.
- [chuckling]

128
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,772
- Oh my goodness.
- [laughing]

129
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,108
There's a chicken, too.

130
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:40,983
Wow!

131
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,235
Well, I'm in luck.

132
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,569
[laughing]

133
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,279
Thank you, Andres.

134
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,031
We now have our own land.

135
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,784
Our family won't be driven away anymore.

136
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,036
[chuckling]

137
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,163
He's grateful to you, Andres.
Oh, by the way…

138
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,082
this is for you.

139
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,167
No need, Mister Domeng.

140
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,502
Oh, come on, Andres.

141
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,171
That's nothing compared
to all the good things you've done

142
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,714
for our tribe.

143
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,008
Don't worry. Someday, all of us…

144
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,927
will be able to repay you.

145
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,388
No. There's nothing
to repay, Mister Domeng.

146
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,473
[chuckling]

147
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,933
You know what?

148
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,937
Wherever your father may be, I'm sure…

149
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,773
he's proud of you.

150
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:27,029
[sentimental music playing]

151
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,532
Let's continue the fun.
Check out what they brought.

152
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,701
- [chuckling]
- Yes! Let's eat!

153
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,203
- Dig in, everyone!
- Alright!

154
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,456
Look at them! Esang.

155
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,666
Hello, Tomas.

156
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,838
Let's meet at our previous rendezvous.

157
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,757
<i>Remember where</i>
<i>we ate breakfast together?</i>

158
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,384
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

159
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:49,760
Dad?

160
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,848
<i>Why are you waiting for</i>
<i>Tomas at a certain place?</i>

161
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,724
Gab?

162
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,727
Since when have you been
meeting up with Tomas without me?

163
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,437
- Wait.
- [thud]

164
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,439
What have you been
talking about when I'm not around?

165
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,941
What have you been discussing
that Tomas isn't telling with me?

166
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,488
[hesitating] Just hand the phone to Tomas.

167
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,615
No, you tell me what's going on right now!

168
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,408
You have nothing to do with me anymore.

169
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,452
Remember?

170
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,411
Uh…

171
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,164
What have you been discussing with Tomas?

172
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,166
What have you been
talking about behind my back?

173
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,418
I'm sorry, dear.

174
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,796
Okay.

175
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,883
I've been talking to him because…

176
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,886
<i>You better tell me</i>
<i>the truth because I'll find out anyway.</i>

177
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,764
[exhales sharply]

178
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,725
Okay.

179
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,897
Tomas told me that your marriage
was supposed to be fake.

180
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,365
We didn't tell
you that I already knew about it.

181
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,581
[exhales sharply]

182
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,792
What?

183
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,504
You still had it registered
even though you already knew?

184
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,550
Because I thought it
was what's best for you.

185
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,386
And Tomas was aware of this?

186
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,012
<i>Dear…</i>

187
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,264
It wasn't his fault.

188
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,600
He only agreed because I forced him to.

189
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,646
Hello?

190
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,274
[exhales sharply]

191
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,696
[utensil clatters]

192
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,738
Liar.

193
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,115
Shit.

194
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,616
Gab!

195
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,785
Gab, wait. Let's talk.

196
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,745
Gab.

197
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,290
Gab, wait. Hear me out.

198
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,041
Gab.

199
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,420
- Gab. Gab, wait. Let's talk things over.
- What?

200
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,589
Hold on.

201
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,132
You lied to me.

202
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,510
You promised it would
be a secret between us.

203
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,429
But what did you do?

204
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,349
You conspired with my dad to fool me?

205
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:06,022
[somber music playing]

206
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,023
How much?

207
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,650
- Gab--
- How much?

208
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,653
How much did he pay you?!
More than my offer?!

209
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,155
Gab, it's not like that.

210
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,741
Well?!

211
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,745
I just wanted
you to get what you wanted at first.

212
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,914
Your inheritance, your mama's house,
and your freedom.

213
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,583
That's what's important to you, right?

214
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,835
[somber music continues]

215
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,545
You know,
I can understand why your dad did it.

216
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,591
He only did it because he loves you.

217
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,261
It's true.

218
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,430
Just think about it.

219
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,849
He knew that the wedding was fake.

220
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,602
But he let you be
because he wanted you to be happy.

221
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,067
He has tied me to you.

222
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,653
He has tied me
to you and validated the wedding.

223
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,404
That's not love, Tomas!

224
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,572
He wanted revenge!

225
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,783
- Gab, that wasn't revenge.
- It was!

226
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,827
He tied you to me because
he knows he's going to lose you.

227
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,541
He wanted someone to take care of you.

228
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,379
He wants me to take care of you.

229
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,674
You know, my brain
wants to think that's true.

230
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,721
Alright, fine. You were scheming with Dad.

231
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,974
Because you thought
that was the right thing to do.

232
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,522
What about your loyalty, Tomas

233
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,984
Where does your loyalty lie?

234
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,197
Well?

235
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,783
Where's the Tomas I trusted?

236
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,869
The one who I thought was
my friend and was on my side?

237
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,625
You know, Gab, I could never lie to you.

238
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,256
But I just want you to know
that life's too short.

239
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,176
Especially in our line of work.

240
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,557
We don't have enough time
to love the people we care for.

241
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,770
I should be mad at you.

242
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,816
You betrayed me.

243
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,819
- Oh. Gab?
- Gab!

244
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,945
Where are you going?

245
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,823
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hold on, Migs.

246
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,951
Gab.

247
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,756
[engine roaring]

248
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:44,263
[foreboding music playing]

249
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,118
That one's beautiful, ma'am.

250
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,163
Those are our last two.

251
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,498
Oh, is that so?

252
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,917
That's perfect.

253
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,461
Hmm…

254
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,588
Alright, I'll take these two.

255
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,131
For you and a friend?

256
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,926
Oh, no. They're for my mamas.

257
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,511
It's their anniversary today.

258
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,722
- Oh, happy anniversary to them, ma'am.
- Thank you.

259
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,307
Uh, here. I'll pay with my card.

260
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,850
- Alright.
- Thank you.

261
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,275
Max! Where are you?

262
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,986
- Wow, nice hair!
- [giggles]

263
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,613
Oh, I just picked something up.

264
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,241
[Lorena] <i>Oh, I know what that is.</i>

265
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,203
You're still trying
to look for a gift, aren't you?

266
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,872
- Ahh!
- Oh, dear.

267
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,084
[Teddy] <i>Is that true?</i>
<i>Dear, is that true? Tell me!</i>

268
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,211
Please, please! I promise I won't tell.

269
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,546
It'll be our little secret.

270
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,714
Ma, it's a surprise.

271
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,843
[laughing] Come on!
It'll be our secret, I promise!

272
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,597
Yeah, right.
I'm sure I'm on the speaker right now.

273
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,601
[laughing]

274
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,895
Your daughter knows you too well!

275
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,564
[laughter] <i>Dear.</i>

276
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,817
What time are you getting here, dear?

277
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,735
Our guests are on their way.

278
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,321
I'm sure they'll be
wondering where you are.

279
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,116
Alright, I'm on my way home.

280
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:27,950
Dear!

281
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,786
Max, I love you. I love you, dear.

282
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,746
I love you, sweetheart.

283
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,081
<i>We love you!</i>

284
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,541
I love you, Ma.

285
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,084
I love you, Ma.

286
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,420
See you soon!

287
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,171
[chuckles]

288
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,217
Oh.

289
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,344
Thank you.

290
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,102
Is this it?

291
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,478
Yeah.

292
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,188
- Really?
- Does it look okay?

293
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:04,403

- Who is it now?
- [Baste] <i>Tomas?</i>

- [knocking on door]
- [dog barking]

300
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,022
<i>- There we go. Oh.</i>
- [door creaks]

301
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,273
Good afternoon, sir.

302
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,402
Baste?

303
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,739
Y-Yes, that's me.

304
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,074
Is Tomas here?

305
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,992
What do you want?

306
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,453
Uh…

307
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,872
I tried looking for you at your old place.

308
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,708
They said you didn't live there,
so they pointed me here.

309
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,918
[dog barking]

310
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,962
You want to talk to Tomas?

311
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,089
You want to disrespect your brother again?

312
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,758
Uh… It's-it's nothing like that.

313
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,678
I came here to,

314
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,596
to apologize to him.

315
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:23,816
[foreboding music playing]

316
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,859
Alright, come in.

317
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,779
Have a seat.

318
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,990
[door creaks, closes]

319
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:40,582
[foreboding music continues]

320
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,294
Uh…

321
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:49,008
This might sound
like a funny story, but…

322
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,345
Two of my kids got
into a fight last night.

323
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,806
They got into a fistfight.

324
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,436
And then, they said
that they didn't want to see each other.

325
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,567
As their father,
I got scared hearing that.

326
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,446
While looking at them, I told myself…

327
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,949
I can't let them turn
their backs on each other.

328
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,619
Not like what
happened between me and Tomas.

329
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,709
You came here…

330
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,212
to mend your relationship
with your brother

331
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,381
before it's too late?

332
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,843
Yes.

[solemn music playing]

336
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,449
Today, we offer up
Jun to our predecessors.

337
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:01,789
Shine a light on
his path and help heal our hearts.

338
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,127
Please listen to our prayers.

339
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:13,675
Please bring Jun
to a better and brighter place.

340
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,347
Please guide him on his journey.

[sinister music playing]

344
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,849
Phase two is in motion, sir.

345
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,898
On this day…

346
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,403
they'll learn what it's
like to lose someone you love.

347
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,238
[dramatic music sting]

348
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,700
I'll make sure that the
pain will pierce through their soul.

349
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,662
Because all of this is for Diego.

350
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,750
<i>Long live Andres!</i>

351
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,377
<i>- Long live!</i>
<i>- Long live!</i>

352
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,714
<i>You have a special guest here. Come home.</i>

353
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:37,384
<i>Before I go,</i>
<i>I hope we can meet as a group again.</i>

354
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,510
<i>You excited to come home?</i>

355
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,013
<i>I'm more excited to see you.</i>

356
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:41,889
[phone ringing]

357
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,891
<i>I owe you a debt of gratitude.</i>

358
