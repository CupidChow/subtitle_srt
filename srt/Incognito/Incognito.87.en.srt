We're not really getting married.

You're going to marry her

100

And you finally let me be.

112
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,262
Gab is Attorney Pretty.
Do you remember her?

- Yes, she's that petite lawyer.
- Mm-hmm.

Yes, Uncle. [sighs]

I'm getting confused.

119
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,653
Yes, Uncle. I know it's confusing.

120
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,239
But I'll make the long story, short.

121
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,409
[sighs] I'm helping
Gab not just for the money.

122
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,081
S-So, you'll help
her get away from her father?

123
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,165
Yes.

124
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,375
Exactly.

Uncle, wait, let me explain first.

127
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,421
It's not like that.

128
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,173
You see, I understand Gab.

129
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,386
Uncle, I know how it feels
to force yourself into a family

130
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,221
that doesn't even like you.

131
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,889
It hurts.

132
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,352
So, if that's the only
way to help Gab feel better,

133
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,147
why wouldn't I help her, right?

134
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,774
Well, what can I do?

135
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,443
It's your decision!

136

Oh, wow. [chuckles]

00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,155
Yes, I did.

And I'm doing as you say.

155
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,957
Yes.

How did you suddenly get a boyfriend?

159

Oh, you know him.

So, that trespasser who stole Bud and Dy
really was your boyfriend?

00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,531
Yes. I'll see you at the wedding?

164
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,123
Okay.

Okay. Okay.

Sorry for the trouble, Max.

172
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,192
I don't know anyone else who could help.

173
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,695
No problem. Don't worry about it.

174
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,739
I'd feel bad if you asked someone else.

175

[Andres chuckles]

176
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,534
So, why are you and JB together?

177
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,787
We just had to take care of something.

178
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,083
So, have you sent Jun's pictures to me?

179
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,793
Here.

180
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,462
It's just a gut feeling.

181
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,299
So I wanted to see
what Jun would look like now.

182
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,762
Well, I have AI prediction tools.

183
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,056
So, if we have enough data,

184
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,436
like Jun's baby pictures
or pictures of your relatives',

185
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,439
it's possible to find out
what he'd look like today.

186
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,982
Okay.

- [unsettling music playing]

188
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,571
I've got the pictures you sent.

189
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,616
Okay, I'm just going to upload the image

190
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,285
and give AI time to generate.

[unsettling music fades]

196
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,977
- Our place is a bit small.
- It's fine.

197
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:49,440
Uncle, this is Gab Rivera,
the woman I'm marrying.

198
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,608
Gab, this is my uncle.

199
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,737
Rolando Reyes,
the person who patiently raised me

200
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,197
even though we're not blood-related.

201
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,115
- [smooches] I love him so much.
- [Gab] Nice to see you again.

202
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,867
- Hey, what's with you?
- [Gab] Whoa.

203
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,119
Are you okay?

204
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,412
[Rolando clears throat] Yeah.

205
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,039
I just got something in my eye.

206
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,248
[Tomas] Really?

207
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,334
[Rolando] Sorry.

208
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,753
You see, it's the first time
my godson's getting married.

209
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,590
Uncle, come on.
Of course, it's my first time.

210
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,966
- I'm still young--Ow!
- [thud]

211
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,218
There you go again!

212
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,887
You're ruining my moment.

213
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,597
I'm really getting emotional.

214
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,974
Jeez.

215
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:30,648
Well, even though Tomas
told me your marriage is fake,

216
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,567
he's still going to leave me.

217
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,028
What are you saying, Uncle?
I won't leave you.

218
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,906
I'll never leave you,
even if it's the end of the world.

219
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,241
I love you.

220
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:46,539
All I want is for Tom
to find real happiness

221
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,958
because he's never experienced it.

222
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,709
Hey, I've experienced it.

223
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,796
I'm happy being with you.

224
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,256
That's enough, Uncle.

225
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,882
Stop embarrassing me.

226
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,219
She really wants to get away from you.

227
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,138
From us.

228
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,557
[birds chirping]

229
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,809
I only told her that

230
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,896
because I know
she doesn't believe in love.

231
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,819
Gab… It's impossible
for her to get married.

232
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,364
Maybe that's why
you felt that it was impossible

233
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,616
for you two to completely drift apart.

234
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,912
I love my daughter.

235
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:32,084
No matter how
complicated our relationship is,

236
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,839
I still love that stubborn brat.

237
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,217
You know, when she was a teenager,

238
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,681
she wanted to party in
Boracay without a chaperone.

239
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,559
[chuckles] Of course,
I bet you didn't allow her.

240
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,522
I allowed her because
she wouldn't stop crying.

241
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,274
[Shari laughs]

242
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,943
- But little did she know,
- [pensive music playing]

243
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,862
I was also there,

244
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,948
like a shadow watching over her.

245
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,535
Well, my daughter was 16.
What did you expect?

246
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,995
[Shari] Of course. [chuckles]

247
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,039
[pensive music continues]

248
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,334
She thought she could handle parties.

249
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,588
After a few rounds of beer,

250
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,591
she threw up.

251
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,802
She kept throwing up.

252
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,138
She was so embarrassed,

253
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,434
she went to the beach
with her hands covering her face.

254
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,685
[Shari chuckles]

255
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,604
[Philip] So, what I did,

256
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,607
I called her saying…

257
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:43,239
"Gab, I'm right here. Let's go home."

258
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,823
[Shari] Aww.

259
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,118
Let me guess. She got very mad at you.

260
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,829
No.

261
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,499
[pensive music continues]

262
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,209
The next day,

263
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,337
she gave me this.

264
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,798
Aww.

265
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:10,891
[pensive music continues]

266
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,062
I just really hope
that she finds the happiness

267
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,606
that she truly deserves.

268
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,861
[Rolando] Alright. You're adults already.

269
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,863
I'll give you my blessing.

270
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,157
- [Tomas] Thank you.
- Thank you, Mister.

271
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,450
[Rolando chuckles]

272
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,785
Just call me "Dada."

273
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,204
- Sorry?
- Huh?

274
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,289
[Rolando] "Dada."

275
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,456
[quirky music playing]

276
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,960
- [Rolando] It's popular now--
- [Tomas] Oh, right.

277
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,879
- It sounds good.
- Yeah. I agree.

278
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,007
- Like a baby. [chuckles]
- It's fine with me.

279
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,508
But wait!

280
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,094
Just to make things clear,
this is a fake marriage.

281
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,305
We'll just be pretending.

282
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:54,393
Tomas will find real happiness someday.

283
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,270
- [Gab] Okay?
- [Rolando] Okay.

284
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,523
- Let's go inside now.
- Let's go.

But you know, love,

289
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,576
I think her getting
married is for the best.

290
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,372
But what if that man is
just marrying her for money?

291
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,500
What if he hurts my daughter?

292
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,420
Just relax, love.

Are you okay?

[patrons chatter indistinctly]

303
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,053
That's not Marcelo.

Marcelo?

00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,643
He's Jun.

361
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:54,610
[stirring music intensifies]

362
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,944
[JB] Let's eat.

363
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,072
- [stirring music fades]
- [patrons chatter indistinctly]

364
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,033
- JB.
- Yes?

365
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,243
We think Andres has found his brother.

366
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,829
That's good news.

367
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,667
- I have to go.
- Alright.

368
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,919
Thank you, Max.

369
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,961
JB.

370
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,297
- Don't you want to eat first?
- No, I'm good.

371
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,591
[footsteps receding]

372
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,470
I think today is a really good day.

373
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,973
We now have the lead to El Cano.

374
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,144
And Andres might have found his brother.

375
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,688
[ominous music playing]

376
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,899
I guess there's still
some good in this world.

377
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:39,821
[ominous music intensifies]

378
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,573
[ominous music fades]

379
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,659
- What's that for?
- Thank you.

380
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,661
Thank you.

381
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,330
What for? You don't have to thank me.

382
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,748
I'm not doing it for free anyway.

383
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,708
Still, it means a lot to me.

384
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,793
So…

385
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,545
Thank you. I appreciate your help.

386
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,381
- Really? You do?
- Yeah.

387
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:02,469
[quirky playful music playing]

388
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,887
This is crazy.

389
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,099
Why are you smiling?

390
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,476
I was just thinking.

391
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,144
This feels nice, doesn't it?

392
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,982
- We're not fighting.
- [Gab chuckles]

393
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,818
We're comfortable being around each other.

394
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,737
That's all in the past.
We won't fight anymore.

395
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,947
We're done with that.

396
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,908
We're business partners now.

397
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,537
- So, let's call it even?
- Yes, we're even.

398
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,621
Okay.

399
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,833
[both chuckle]

400
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,418
We're getting married.

401
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,795
- Imagine that.
- [Gab laughs]

402
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,796
[Gab inhales sharply]

403
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,798
[quirky music continues]

404
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,882
Shit.

405
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,175
What's wrong?

406
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,430
- Hey!
- No.

407
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,224
- We don't have rings yet.
- Oh.

408
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,476
- You're right.
- We need to buy rings.

409
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,603
We can buy them at the marketplace.

410
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,938
[quirky playful music ends]

411
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,274
- [door opens]
- Grandma?

412
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,358
Grandma!

413
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,569
[knocking on door]

414
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,195
- Grandma!
- [Esang] Wait! I'm coming!

415
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,947
Wait! Why are you in a hurry?

416
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,907
- Andres. What's wrong?
- Grandma.

417
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,284
- What's going on?
- Grandma.

418
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,452
What is it?

419
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,536
It's Jun.

420
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,705
I found him.

421
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,123
[sentimental music playing]

422
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,000
Marcelo knows him.

423
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,001
Huh?

424
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,503
Marcelo knows Jun!

425
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,256
- Rea--
- It's true!

426
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,759
- I saw him earlier.
- You found your brother?

427
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,968
- Yes!
- [Esang chuckles]

428
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,138
- [both laughing]
- [sentimental music continues]

429
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,308
Oh, thank goodness!

430
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,517
[Esang sighs deeply]

431
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,854
- It's true?
- Yes, Grandma.

432
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,022
We found him.

433
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,942
[both laughing]

434
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,321
- Thank you, Lord!
- This is all real, Grandma.

435
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,697
- [Esang sighs]
- [Andres chuckles]

436
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,367
- You found Jun?
- Yes, I saw him earlier.

437
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,247
- [sentimental music continues]
- [Esang chuckles]

438
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,457
I know that's him, Grandma.

439
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,834
[sentimental music fades]

440
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,670
<i>Tomas Guerrero, the groom.</i>

441
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,089
<i>Can we talk?</i>

442
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,926
<i>I hope that's the</i>
<i>Manuel Aguinaldo we're looking for.</i>

443
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,553
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>His name sounds familiar.</i>

444
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,889
<i>It's because he was listed in the army.</i>

445
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,474
<i>We can't find any new leads, Greg.</i>

446
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,267
<i>Manuel is really cunning.</i>

447
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,061
<i>Based on all the information I got,</i>

448
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,479
<i>it all leads back to El Cano.</i>

449
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,523
<i>That's likely his group.</i>

450
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,025
<i>Sir, who were</i>
<i>you talking to at the restaurant?</i>

451
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,276
<i>He's my brother, isn't he?</i>
