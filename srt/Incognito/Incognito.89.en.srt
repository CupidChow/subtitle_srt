<i>You're getting married?</i>

2
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:04,129
<i>- It's a civil wedding.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,130
<i>See you.</i>

4
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,673
<i>Leave my daughter.</i>

5
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,591
<i>With all due respect, sir,</i>

6
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,302
<i>but isn't Gab asking</i>
<i>you to give her freedom?</i>

7
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,471
<i>We even had to put on a fake wedding</i>

8
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>so she can get away from you.</i>

9
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,017
<i>I'm not as bad as you think.</i>

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,728
<i>Go ahead with the wedding.</i>

11
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,605
<i>And this conversation never happened.</i>

12
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,315
<i>We are going to fool her.</i>

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,359
<i>Who from El Cano is protecting you?</i>

14
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,652
<i>Manuel Aguinaldo.</i>

15
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,820
<i>You're coming with me.</i>

16
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,113
<i>I'll only let you go</i>

17
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>when it's time for</i>
<i>you to meet with Manuel Aguinaldo.</i>

18
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,159
- [explosion]
<i>- </i>[Andres] <i>The Raven is alive.</i>

19
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,244
<i>You sold out the lives of your comrades.</i>

20
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,954
<i>You'll pay for that, Manuel.</i>

21
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:38,955
[Kenji]<i> It's confirmed.</i>

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,373
<i>Greg Paterno is the Contractor.</i>

23
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,958
<i>What do you want me to do, sir?</i>

24
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,084
<i>Nothing.</i>

25
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,711
<i>I'll handle Greg.</i>

26
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,588
<i>Who were you talking to at the restaurant?</i>

27
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,672
<i>That was my brother, right?</i>

28
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>- Were you following me?</i>
<i>- Am I right or wrong?</i>

29
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,009
<i>Was that guy my brother?</i>

30
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,596
<i>Is that you, Jun?</i>

31
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,306
<i>Andres?</i>

32
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,808

He'll be here soon.

Remember…

44
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,690
You know what will happen
to you if you make a wrong move.

45
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,858
I'm done with all this.

46
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,820
I still want to live,
so I'll ride on that boat.

47
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,989
If you want to follow Manuel,
suit yourselves.

48
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,323
I don't care.

- [suspenseful music continues]
- [boat engine roaring]

53
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,009
You'll shake hands with Manuel Aguinaldo.

54
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,762
Just him and no one else. Is that clear?

55
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,515
[inhales sharply]

56
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,600
Yes.

57
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,604
Max.

58
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,274
If he tries to pull a fast one on us,
you know what to do.

We are gathered here today

to witness an important
moment in the lives

72
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,635
of Gabriela Rivera and Tomas Guerrero.

73

- These two…
- [mouthing] Ow.

74
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,264
- will become one…
- [mouthing] Sorry.

75
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,726
for better or for worse…

76
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,978
until death parts them.

77
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,813
Tomas.

78
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:20,320
Do you take Gabriela as
your lawfully wedded wife?

79
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:26,701
[soft music playing]

80
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,465
Yes, Your Honor. I do.

81
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,844
[officiant] And Gabriela…

82
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:50,016
Do you take Tomas as
your lawfully wedded husband?

83
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,353
Yes.

84
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,606
Yes, I do.

[Dexter breathes sharply]

88
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,930
- Manuel.
- Hmm.

89
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,849
What happened to your knee?

90
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,770
[chuckles]

91
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,231
It comes with old age, Manuel.

92
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,232
Here.

93
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,983

JB.

99
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,441
- The target is moving.
- [JB] <i>Copy.</i>

100
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,733
I'm heading back to the car.

101

102
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,958
[dramatic music ends]

103
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:44,505
You may now exchange rings
and say your vows.

104
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,382
Bud, come here. Come.

105
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,761

00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,726
Thank you. Go. Stay.

111
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,112
Tom G.

112
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,159
Honestly…

113
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,498
I don't like you.

114
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,582
Huh?

115
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,836
- I mean, before.
- [Tomas clears throat]

116
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,467
[soft music continues]

117
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,428
But aside from Bud and Dy,

118
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,931
you're the only one who gets me.

119
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,185
I mean…

120
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,436
[Tomas chuckles]

121
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,230
We used to fight a lot.

122
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,775
But now, we're partners.

123
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:51,781
[soft music continues]

124
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,908
You've always been there for me.

125
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,287
You're the only one I can depend on.

126
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:09,131
[soft music continues]

127
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,763

[inhales deeply]

129
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,267
You're my ride or die.

Um…

145
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,756
Gab.

146
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,428
Actually, I also don't like you.

147
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,555
That was before.

148
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,598
[Tomas chuckles]

149
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,100
My feelings changed.

150
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,854
Well, you're right.

151
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,942
You may not be my ideal angelic girl,

152
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,404
but you have almost
all the good qualities.

153
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,949
You're pretty and kind…

154
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,034
[chuckles]

155
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,121
And I'm here because I want to.

156
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,541
Because I'm choosing you.

157
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:13,798
[soft music playing]

158
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:23,766
And I promise you that whatever happens,

159
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,603
no matter what it is you want to do,
we'll do it together.

160
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,400
No matter where you want to go,

161
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,026
I'll be with you.

162
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,071
Because there's only one thing I want.

163
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,740
And that is, for you to be happy.

164
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:45,162

[light-hearted music continues]

189
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,707
No, I can't.

190
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,501
[smooches, exhales]

191
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,044
[Tomas clear throats, chuckles nervously]

[panting]

194
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,383
O-One more time? One more. [chuckles]

195
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,511
[smooches]

196
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,975
[applause]

197
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,645
[Judge] You may now
sign your marriage contract.

198
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:20,568
[light-hearted music continues]

199
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,325
Cheers to the newlyweds!

200
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:33,289

- [dramatic music playing]
- [engine revs]

203
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,838
They're speeding up, JB.

204
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,673
You think they've caught on to us?

205
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,342
Screw it.

206
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,803
We can settle this right here, right now.

207
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:58,147
[dramatic music continues]

208
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,859

[music turns suspenseful]

220
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,454
- [grunts]
- [gunshot]

221
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,166
[gunshots]

222
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,167

[Max grunts]

[gunshots]

230
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,349
We can't let Manuel get away!

231
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,600
- Let's go!
- Come on!

232
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,980
[suspenseful music continues]

233
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,149

00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,901
[suspenseful music fades]

235
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,696
VIP protection.

236
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,906
That's your next contract?

237
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,993
There's a death threat made against a VIP.

238
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,245
[unsettling music playing]

239
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,372
She's gone against many
people because she wanted

240
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,749
to completely ban
mining in this one place.

241
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,711
That's a complicated issue.

242
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,922
It doesn't just concern
the corporations' interests,

243
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,634
but also the miners
who may lose their jobs,

244
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,844
am I right?

245
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,138
Well, according to intel,

246
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,224
some of their miners

247
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,892
are also victims of human trafficking.

248
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,437
Human trafficking?

249
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,439
Do you know who's behind it?

250
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,066
[unsettling music continues]

251
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,527
Based on all
the information I've gathered,

252
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,865
it all leads back to El Cano.

253
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,620
If that's the case,
how is it related to Raven?

254
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,917
Remember that contract we had

255
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,879
where Raven betrayed us?

256
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:34,803
[unsettling music intensifies]

257
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,016
[unsettling music fades]

258
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,353
We almost had him.

259
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,981
Goddammit!

260
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,485
[Max] We still have time, JB.

261
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,987
At least now, we know that
Manuel Aguinaldo's the key

262
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,781
that will lead us to El Cano.

263
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,284
You're closer to getting
the justice your father deserves.

264
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:01,413
[unsettling music resumes]

265
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,498
[sighs]

266
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,793
[footsteps approaching]

267
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,672
[Kenji] Sir.

268
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,633
We heard you were followed.

269
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,843
Mm. So, what?

270
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,595
We were worried.

271
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,890
I'm having them traced.
There were no CCTVs on the road.

272
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,850
Let me take care of it.

273
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,603
I don't want to hear this topic anymore.

274
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,396
I can handle myself.

275
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,691
I'm used to dealing with surveillance,

276
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,903
ambushes, and hurdles that come my way.

277
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,947
You don't have to worry about me.

278
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,908
Let me just remind you guys

279
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,703
that I chose this life willingly.

280
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,457
I'm fully prepared and committed to this.

281
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,627
I dedicated my whole life to this mission.

282
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,672
And no devil in hell can stop me.

283
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,508
Or our mission.

284
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,427
Is that clear?

285
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,221
We were just worried, sir.

286
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,556
[Manuel] Yes, I know.

287
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,559
But let's not dwell on it anymore.

288
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,728
I want you all to remember

289
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,691
that our mission is bigger than all of us.

290
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,693
Let's focus on that.

291
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,027
Got it?

292
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,070
Yes, sir.

293
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,530
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,283
Go on, get some rest.

295
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:24,454

[exhales loudly, chuckles nervously]

298
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,095
He's coming.

299

[car door closes]

303
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,283
Well? What happened?

304
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,076
- Grandma…
- Yes?

305
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,538
Didn't I tell you you'd see him again?

306
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,335
[car door opens]

317

<i>But you were fine</i>
<i>with the plan to fool me.</i>

318
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,275
<i>You're finally here in front of me, Jun!</i>

319
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,985
<i>Just call me Diego.</i>

320
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,653
<i>If you don't mind me asking,</i>

321
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,238

325

<i>We encountered his group.</i>

326
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,707
<i>Do you know him?</i>
