According to the initial investigation,

183
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,384
Supt. Allan Marquez was leaving his house

184
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,553
when he was shot by two gunmen.

185
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,971
Damn it!

186
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,558
Two high-ranking officials
killed in one day?!

187
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,478
General, the same gunmen

188
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,063
are suspected to be behind this.

189
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,193
This might be the work of only one group.

190
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,070
I won't be surprised…

191
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,031

I told you before,

201
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,322
don't tell me your plans.

202
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,910
Later tonight, after the surveillance,

203
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,745
he'll tell the contractor everything.

204
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,455
<i>Why not now?</i>

205
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,792
Sooner or later, Contractor will
figure out what you're doing.

206
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,293
Just tell him the truth.

207
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,172
Max, Andres is on a mission.

208
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,216
He can still find what he has lost.

Why were they killed?

218
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,856
They are part of the list, sir.

219
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,735
How did you know that?

220
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,321
Because I'm the spy
you're looking for, sir.

222

I'm just a low-ranking officer, sir.

I don't know who is at the top

224

or what they're planning.

225
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,798
I'm just their minion.

226
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,551
But I quit.

227
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,639
They'll kill me and my family.

228
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,558
Please save us.

229
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,147
I can be a state witness.
I'll do anything, sir.

230
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,236
Men!

How long have you been here?

242
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,647
I just got here.

243
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,941
We need to find Isabel Escalera.

244
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,026
If you see her, let me know immediately.

245
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,987
Copy sir. I'll check this area.

246
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,154

<i>Greg,</i>

251
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,126
they're targeting important,
high-ranking officials.

252
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,253
Three are already confirmed dead.

253
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,674

We need to find Isabel Escalera fast.

270
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,474
Someone wants to kill her.

271
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,061
Is it because of the hard drive?

272
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,524
Yes. It's either her or Diamond.

273
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,527
There are people interested
in the hard drive.

274
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,947
According to intel,

275
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,949
they are killing people
that are on the masterlist

276

277
