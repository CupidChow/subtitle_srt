Diego Aguinaldo is Jun, my brother.

24
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,781
That's him? That's your brother Jun?

25
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,077
So, why are we profiling him?

26
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,290
Is it because
you might see each other, Wolf?

27
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:10,255
[tense music continues]

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,091
Right. It'll be hard
for you to make a move.

29
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,846
Wait.

30
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,306
How is he connected to the package?

31
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,021
It's a long story. This is not the time.

32
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,567
For now, just keep your eyes on him.

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,236
Copy that.

34
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,446
Copy that.

We need to confirm that, Wolf.

Hey.

41
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,988
- Hi. I'm Cess.
- Hello. I'm Crisanto.

42
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,740
This is Paul.

43

- Hi, Paul. How are you?
- I'm fine.

44
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,577
Nice to meet you, sir.

[Diego] Uh, ma'am, I'll see you around.

46
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,753
- What's up?
- He's not a first-timer.

47
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,795
But I am.

- I'm glad you made it.
- [Paul] Thank you.

51
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,523
Hey.

52
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,027
Jun.

53
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,737
What are you doing here?

54
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,949
Uh, excuse me, ma'am. This is my brother.

55
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,242
How are you, Jun?

56
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,204
I didn't expect that you'd
come to these kinds of events.

57
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,296
- The wolf is burned.

[suspenseful music continues]

59
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,402
Hold on. What do you mean by "burned"?

60
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,280
He just talked to his brother.
What's wrong with that?

61
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,198
Morning, sir. Good morning

62
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,575
What--Good morning.

63
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,537
Is there something
we don't know about him?

64
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,124
[suspenseful music continues]

65
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,334
His adoptive father
is connected to El Cano.

66
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,880
H-Hold on.

67
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,717
How is he connected to them?

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,261
How long have you known?
Why didn't you tell me?

69
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,387
How are they connected?

70
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,101
Manuel Aguinaldo is
the one who protects El Cano's men.

71
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,770
Shit.

72
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,607
So Jun's adoptive father is a bad person?

73
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,363
- Seriously--
- [woman] Shh!

74
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,449
Sorry, ma'am. [clears throat]

75
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,326
Hold up.

76
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,870
Just because he's a bad
person doesn't mean Jun is too.

77
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:34,625
[suspenseful music continues]

78
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,253
Besides, isn't that mining
corporation the problem here?

79
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,255
It has nothing to do with El Cano.

80
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,133
We can't be complacent.

81
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,594
Everyone here is a possible suspect.

82
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,306
[guest chatter indistinctly]

83
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:56,064
[suspenseful music continues]

84
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,398
Hmm.

85
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,526
So, we're really
suspecting Wolf's brother?

86
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,403
Isn't he just a kid?

87
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,824
It's better to be safe, Monkey.

88
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,659
Pull yourself together.

89
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,456
You two can argue later.

90
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,626
Keep visuals on all sectors.

91
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,632
I'll keep monitoring him on CCTV.

92
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:29,597
[suspenseful music continues]

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,891
We can't let anyone slip past us.

[suspenseful music fades]

95
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,691
Yeah, I always come to
these kind of events when I have time.

96
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,778
Especially for victims of
human trafficking like me.

97
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,862
[Andres] Of course.

98
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,240
You know, Andres, we're the same.

99
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,118
I never miss these events.

100
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,372
[Diego] <i>Especially since I know</i>
<i>what they're going through personally.</i>

101
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,499
<i>I understand them.</i>

102
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,708
Of course.

103
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,754
- [camera shutter clicking]
- He sounded sincere.

104
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,049
[unsettling music playing]

105
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,218
No flinch. No shake.

106
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,055
Or maybe he's just really good at lying.

107
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,684
You know, I'm getting confused.

108
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,145
Are we seriously going
to suspect Andres's brother?

109
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,062
No.

110
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,191
Do you have company?

111
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,278
No.

112
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,281
- How about you?
- Yes, they're on their way.

113
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,950
Oh, did you come here
with your father? Where is he?

114
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,120
He really wanted to, but he's busy.

115
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,914
[Andres]
Okay. I hope he can come next time.

116
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,082
[Diego] Mm-hmm.

117
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,751
[unsettling music continues]

118
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,837
- Hey, Selo!
- Hey.

119
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,464
- Bro, how are you?
- What's up?

120
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,467
- You've already met, right?
- Yeah.

121
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,510
Selo, thanks again for everything.

122
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,929
If it weren't for you,
I would not have found my brother.

123
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,850
Don't mention it.
Your reunion was bound to happen.

124
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,147
I know what you went through wasn't easy,
but you're here now.

125
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,773
I salute you.

- Do you have company?
- No.

129

Well then, you can join our table.

130
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,788
- Come on.
- Okay.

131
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,375

[Miguel] <i>Wolf, you should…</i>

133
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,465
just leave.

[unsettling music intensifies]

find out you're using a different name.

[Max] Everyone at
their table has a clean record.

Famous journalists, businessmen,

145
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,440
fashion designers, and socialites.

146
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,817
Nothing suspicious.

[dramatic music continues]

149
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,617
See. Their conversation is legit.

150
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,828
He's here because he was a victim, too.

151
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,833
I never said he wasn't a victim.

152
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,711
All I'm worried about is that,

153
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,005
he's connected to El Cano.

154
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,464
Well, his father is.

155
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,384

I agree. Sorry, Wolf.

158
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,983
Something just feels off.

159
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,700
[chuckles] Wait a minute.

160
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,494
Look at what kind of people you are.

161
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,164
For once, can
we believe in someone's goodness

162
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,542
even if their father is
a demon or some kind of Pontius Pilate?

Wolf will take care of Diego.

Copy, sir.

175
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,087
Copy, sir.

176
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,881
Copy that.

00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,116
[Tomas] So far, so good.

182
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,575
All clear.

183
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,910
Nothing suspicious.

184
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,622
- [Tomas] Sir, ma'am, welcome.
- [man] Good morning.

185

[uneasy music playing]

187
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,423
Tomas.

188
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,299
You know I'm kind of busy.

189
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,803
- [uneasy music continues]
- [inhales deeply]

190
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,596
Are you okay? Why are you shaking?

191
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,100
Hi, ma'am. Welcome.

192
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,271
- What's going on with you?
- Come with me outside.

193
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,817
We're still at work.
We can't just go outside.

194
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,486
Come on, it won't take long.

195
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,905
[breath quivers] Please.

196
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,492
Do you have a fever?

197
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,579
Maybe you need some water.

198
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,873
- Let's go tell our boss.
- No. Don't.

199
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,250
No. Never mind.

200
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,294
Huh?

201
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:40,885
[uneasy music continues]

202
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,643
Diego and I first met on a ship.

203
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,270
He was using a different name back then.

204
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,147
Junjun.

205
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,943
That's right. And since then,
we've never lost contact with each other.

206
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,488
Even after he got adopted by Uncle Manuel.

207
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,824
You know what, Selo?

208
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,076
I should thank you even more

209
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,455
because you were there for
him during the time we were apart.

210
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,790
That's why Jun
managed to get through it all.

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,835
[Selo] You don't have to thank me, bro.

212
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,463
Sorry, can I call you "bro"?

213
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,840
Of course! You're like a brother to Jun.

214
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,176
I mean, Diego.

215
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,346
Thank you.
Diego was also a big help to me.

216
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,681
We've been through worse.

217
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,141
The trauma.

218
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,685
But we managed to get through it together.

219
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,939
[uneasy music crescendos]

220
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:39,109
By the way, Andres, do you know
any of the board of directors here?

221
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,446
[foreboding music playing]

222
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,282
Yeah, I've met and talked to some of them.

223
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,787
Okay. I'll go get us some drinks.

224
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,914
- I'll go with you.
- No need.

225
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,291
I'm sure Selo has more stories about us.

226
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,752
[Selo] So now, I'm your storyteller?

227
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,796
I know you like telling stories, Selo.

228
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,881
Now's your chance.
I'll get some drinks, okay?

229
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,175
Okay. Thank you.

230
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:08,097
[foreboding music continues]

231
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,018
- Where's the restroom, please?
- Oh. Restroom.

232
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,312
Just turn left and you'll find it there.

233
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,356
- Thank you.
- Alright. Welcome, sir.

234
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,818
Dominic Lopez.

235
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,111
[clears throat]

236
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,445
He's headed to the restroom,

237
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,698
but I'll keep tabs on
him when he comes out.

238
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,408
I don't trust him.

239
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,409
[Max] <i>Copy that.</i>

240
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:32,621

[tomas exhales sharply]

242
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,623
Hey.

243
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,126
Do you smoke?

244
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,962
Come on. Join me.

245
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,172
Now you want us to smoke?

246
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,757
What's going on with you?

247
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,637
Nothing. I just want to smoke.

248
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,182
- You know, Lisa--
- Tomas.

249
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,935
- Come on.
- I'm Matthew, okay?

250
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,399
[foreboding music continues]

251
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,157
Shit.

252
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,501
[foreboding music fades]

253
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,797
[whispering] Are your comms off?

254
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,800
It's good now.

255
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,971
Who was that girl?
She called you by your name.

256
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,433
I… I told you, remember?

257
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,101
She was just being friendly.

258
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,688
- She asked me questions.
- So, you gave her your real name?

259
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,856
[hesitates] Uh… I…

260
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,149
Did you?

261
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,070
Alright. Fine. I admit.

262
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,071
Admit what?

263
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,658
She was my classmate in high school.

266
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,998
Why didn't you tell me?

267
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,793
It's not like it matters.

268
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,211
- What?
- And besides…

269
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,716
[whispering] I didn't tell
you because you'd react that way.

270
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,093
So, you lied…

271
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,763
[whispering] So you lied?

272
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,808
Hey, I didn't lie to you.

273
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,434
- I just didn't tell you.
- [thud]

274

- That's still lying.
- Ow.

[suspenseful music continues]

290
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,649
My long-lost brother.

291
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,359
Your brother?

292
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,905
- [suspenseful music continues]
- [keyboard clacking]

Yes.

295
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,958
And he should be
registered as Andres Malvar.

296
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,172
Do you know Diego is a chess champion?

297
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,548
- Really?
- Yes.

298
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,717
No one could beat him
when we were in high school.

299
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,011
His strategy is impressive.

300
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,306
It's like he could read
his opponent's thoughts.

301
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,433
- Is that so?
- Yes. [chuckles]

Look, Sparrow. You don't have to worry.

She doesn't know what we're doing here.

She has no idea why I'm here.

309
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,704
You're supposed to be incognito.

310
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,166
So, what now? You've been compromised.

311
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,835
Wait. I'm compromised?

312
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,005
Wolf's brother is also here.
He knows someone here.

313
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,799
Did he get compromised or kicked out?

314
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,635
No, right?
Why do you want me out of this mission?

315
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:19,056
Don't worry, okay? Lisa is harmless.

316
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,307
I promise.

317
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,935
Oh, so you call each
other on a first name basis?

318
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,479
Hold it, Sparrow. Calm down. Take it easy.

319
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,106
I'm sorry, okay?

320
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:32,027
But can you let this one slide?

321
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,029
Please don't tell the others.

You better hope that this
won't make our mission complicated.

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,500
Or else, I have no choice Monkey

325
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,961
but to tell everyone
and you're out of the mission.

326
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,462
I promise. Cross my heart.

327
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,839
Don't worry.

328
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,423
- Fix it.
- Yeah, I know.

00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,636
