When I told you about it before,

36
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,982
you got upset with me and Jake.

37
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,653
And now, you're suddenly okay with it?

Don't you want that?

I'm supporting your decision.

No, no, no. There's something wrong.

No. Who was it?

- into other people's lives.
- No, it's not like that.

136

I mean JB, so…

to be with JB, okay?

00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,694
None yet.

187
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,029
Most of them just show as read.

194

Grandson.

195
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,346
Yes, Grandma?

196
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,642
How did you find all of this out?

197
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,063
Your brother has been missing
for a long time.

198
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,731
How did you do it?

199
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,734
Grandma,

200
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:20,072
Don't I always tell you that
I'm doing everything I can to find Jun?

201
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,657
That's exactly what I'm doing.

202
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,492
I'm doing everything I can to find him.

203
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,663
And I mentioned that
I joined a group, remember?

204
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,832
Well, it's also been a big help to me.

205
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,085
So, there's a higher possibility
that we'll find Jun.

206

208
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,693
What?

209
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,653
You're going to back out?

210
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,073
But why? I'm willing to pay--

211
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,492
What? No!

212
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,203
No, you can't do this to me!
We have an agreement.

213
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,371
Come on, man!

214
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,581
What the hell?!

215
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,750
- Fuck!
- Wow!

216
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,751
Why are you angry so early--

217
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,128
- Why are you late?!
- Wait, I just got here.

218
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,254
- Chill out.
- Get in!

219
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,673
- You're the one who needs me,
- I said get in!

220
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,467
yet you have the nerve to lash out at me?

221
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,385
How dare you!

222
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,638
- Fuck!
- [car door slams]

223
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,348
- [Tomas] What's your problem?
- [Gab huffs]

224
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,432
Hey.

225
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,935
What's going on?

226
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,980
What's your problem, Gab?

227
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,066
You're the one who needs me,

228
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,735
yet you have the nerve
to lash out at me so early in the morning?

229
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,028
All I'm asking for

230
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:41,946
- is a little humility.
- Sorry.

231
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,697
I'm not mad at you, okay?

232
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,201
It's just that the jerk I hired
suddenly backed out.

233
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,204
- [chuckles]
- [huffs]

234
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,288
Sorry.

235
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,831
It's okay.

236
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,958
No problem.

237
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,751
I also called you because…

238
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,795
I asked you to come here because…

239
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,506
Hmm?

240
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,591
I'm going to accept it.

241
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,844
What are you going to accept?

242
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,474
- The money.
- Wow!

243
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,310
I thought you said you didn't want it.

244
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,563
- You suddenly need it now?
- Please. I'm in a hurry, Tomas.

245
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,397
Wha--

246
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,023
- I really need--
- Let's see.

247
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,817
Argh! What the hell?!

248
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,529
I just wanted to check how cheeky you are
because I'm quite in disbelief!

249
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,822
You're too much!

250
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,492
I don't even know
where you get the audacity to pressure me

251
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,202
when you're the one asking for a favor.

252
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,996
- Sorry.
- How dare you!

253
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,915
Please. I really need the money, Tomas.

254
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,669
[Tomas] What are you doing?

255
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,379
I'm just trying…

256
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,257
…to look cute. Isn't it obvious?

257
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:50,347
- [laughing]
- [quirky music playing]

258
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,184
That won't work on me.

259
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,270
Nope.

260
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,565
[quirky music continues]

261
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,275
Call me handsome first.

262
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,360
Oh my…

263
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,571
Come on. That's so easy.

264
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,864
Fine. Suit yourself.

265
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,199
- I'll just leave.
- Please. Please, Handsome.

266
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,787
Huh? I didn't hear it.
You have to say it again.

267
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,122
Please, Handsome.

268
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,373
[laughs]

269
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,125
That's music to my ears.

270
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,294
- What was that? Say it louder.
- Please, Handsome!

271
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:24,006
Yes! That's how I like it.

272
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,257
Alright?

273
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,551
[clears throat]

274
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,803
It sounded a bit forced, though.

275
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,472
Let's count the money.

276
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,557
Here, this is the exact amount.

277
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,851
- That will do.
- [inhales, clicks mouth]

278
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:41,774
[soft music playing]

279
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,317
Give it to me.

280
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,863
- Thank you, Handsome.
- There we go. [chuckles]

281
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,615
You're quite a fast learner.

282
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,367
[chuckles]

283
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,162
[soft music continues]

284
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,246
What?

285
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,499
I know I'm handsome,

286
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,125
but you don't have
to stare at me like that.

287
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,504
- Stop it. That's enough.
- Don't be so full of yourself.

288
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,255
- I have an idea.
- Hmm?

289
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,050
I have another favor to ask you.

290
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,428
- Well, you see…
- What?

291
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,640
- What is it now?
- If you do this,

292
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,183
you can finally make it up to me.

293
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,185
Oh, here we go again.

294
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,104
- What do you want?
- No, wait.

295
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,064
I need a spy, okay?

296
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,565
The jerk I hired backed out.

297
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,234
Wait a minute. Aren't you a spy?

298
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,111
- Why don't you do it yourself?
- It can't be me

299
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,862
because they will recognize me.

300
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,407
- You do it instead.
- You know what the problem is?

301
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,200
I might get in trouble again.

302
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,202
You want me to steal
from your dad once more?

303
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,247
What will you ask me to take?
A horse? A carabao? A giraffe?

304
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,665
- Gab, I've had enough.
- A giraffe?

305
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,125
- I don't want to steal again.
- No.

306
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,418
- Your dad might kill me.
- No, Tomas. Okay?

307
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,545
This isn't-- Okay, this is about my dad,

308
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,963
but I won't ask you
to steal from him again.

309
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,923
Okay? There won't be any animals involved.

310
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,550
I just want to prove to him,

311
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,219
that his mistress
is using him for his money.

312
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,013
That's it. Easy!

313
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,848
- Really?
- Yeah.

314
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,808
[quirky music playing]

315
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,226
I'll even pay you.

316
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,438
I'll pay you, I promise.

317
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,897
- No need.
- Wow.

318
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,900
I'll still do it even if you don't pay me.

319
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,278
- Really?
- Yes, I'm serious.

320
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,572
- Are you really serious?
- Yes, you don't have to pay me.

321
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,990
- Okay.
- But if I do this,

322
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,283
you have to promise that we're even, okay?

323
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,368
- Yes, we'll call it even.
- I mean, come to think of it,

324
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,954
you got not only the money
but also a free spy.

325
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,123
What else can you ask for?

326
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,167
So, I hope after I do this,

327
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,420
- we can finally call it even.
- Yes, I promise.

328
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,424
- You're always hotheaded.

337
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,707
Is that why you turned down
the kidnap-for-ransom contract?

338
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,336
You didn't even think twice

339
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,130
about accepting all these contracts

340
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,841
no matter how difficult
or impossible they seemed.

341
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,011
But you turned down a cheap mission.

342
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,681
It was supposed to be easy money.

343
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,144
But you probably thought
it wasn't connected to him.

344
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,313
That it wasn't connected to Raven.
