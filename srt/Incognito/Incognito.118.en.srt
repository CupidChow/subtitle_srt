[Greg] <i>This op just escalated.</i>

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:03,920
<i>We need more boots on the ground.</i>

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,589
<i>Black Viper Tactical</i>
<i>will be our reinforcement.</i>

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:10,301
<i>Lakandula, a place</i>
<i>torn apart by a savage war.</i>

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,512
<i>We're setting up 20</i>
<i>clicks south from the hot zone.</i>

6
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,472
<i>Close enough to conduct recon,</i>

7
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>and far enough to maintain a perimeter.</i>

8
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,352
<i>We're fully equipped</i>
<i>with supplies, gear and manpower.</i>

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,521
- <i>Wolf, do you need help?</i>
- <i>I'm good.</i>

10
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,189
<i>You need to talk to your men.</i>

11
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,443
<i>So now, the mission is</i>
<i>to eliminate Manuel Aguinaldo.</i>

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,194
<i>That's it? Then let's finish this.</i>

13
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,446
<i>Tomas, it's not that simple.</i>

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,031
<i>There are kids involved.</i>

15
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>Our mission now includes</i>

16
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,784
<i>rescuing as many as possible.</i>

17
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,244
<i>Expect resistance.</i>

18
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,497
<i>The Basillos will be there,</i>
<i>kids brainwashed by Manuel.</i>

19
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,958
<i>They are loyal, trained, and ruthless.</i>

20
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,128
<i>We have detected some</i>
<i>movements in certain areas.</i>

21
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,963
<i>Multiple units in and out.</i>

22
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:50,049
<i>Which strengthens</i>
<i>the possibility that Manuel is here.</i>

23
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>This is a high-risk contract for everyone.</i>

24
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,970
<i>So let me just remind you…</i>

25
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,221
<i>This is not just an operation.</i>

26
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,347
<i>This is war.</i>

27
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,932
<i>Do or die, sir.</i>

28
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,268
<i>We'll wipe all those bastards out.</i>

[waves crashing distantly]

31
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,865
Before we go,

32
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,244
there are a few things I need to clear up.

33
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,371
[birds calling]

34
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,581
It's hard to go into battle

35
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,084
with wounds we haven't addressed.

36
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,422
[bird calling]

37
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,724
- [Greg] So…
- [chair scrapes]

38
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,476
…I'll go first.

39
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,191
My biggest mistake,

40
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,281
was not telling you about Manuel.

41
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:43,538

[birds calling]

43
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,087
And because of that…

44
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,718
Andres's brother died.

45
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:05,059
[poignant music continues]

46
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,814
Sir.

47
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,319
I need to say this too.

48
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,823
If I hadn't shot Jun,

49
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,744
maybe he would've gotten away.

50
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:32,337
[poignant music continues]

51
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,177
Maybe he'd still be alive.

52
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,390
Sir, you only did it to protect yourself.

53
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,522
If you hadn't,
we'd be lighting candles for you now.

54
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,860
I lived with that guilt every day.

55
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,284
Because you're my friend, Andres.

56
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,831
[music becomes tense]

57
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,299
[inhales deeply]
But then they killed my father.

58
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,809
Now I'm not doing
this just for the contract.

59
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,648
I'm doing this for vengeance and justice.

60
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,074
[somber music playing]

61
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,119
Andres.

62
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,789
I know your brother's gone and I'm sorry.

63
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,423
But I can't forget how
they held my uncle hostage.

64
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,177
And fuck man,
they killed my innocent brother.

65
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,180

[poignant music playing]

69
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,279
That was Manuel.

70
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,287
If anything, Jun's also a victim here.

71
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,420
Yes, he used you. But Manuel used him too.

72
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,677
That bastard's the reason
my dad's in that hospital bed.

73
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,057
And I honestly don't
know if he'll ever wake up.

74
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,186
[Max] At least you still
have something to hold on to.

75
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,566
But I have nothing.

76
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,198
They killed both my mothers.

77
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,660
They had nothing to do with any of this.

78
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,831
They were innocent.

79
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:21,380
[poignant music continues]

80
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,136
They were all I had.

81
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,809
As for me,

82
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,687
I'm grateful my wife and son are safe.

83
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,067
I should be with them right now, but…

84
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,363
I couldn't just leave.

85
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:52,245
I can't just walk away after what they did

86
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,872
to you and your family.

87
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,752
Your wounds are mine as well.

88
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,089
Your pain is my pain.

89
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,925
Your fight…

90
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,094
is mine.

91
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,763
We're not just a team.

92
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,474
We're a family.

93
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,353
[poignant music continues]

94
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:22,150
The kind of family
that they can't mess with.

95
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,861
And that is us.

96
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:30,366
[poignant music continues]

97
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,915
[Andres] When…

98
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,881
When my brother died.

99
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:53,264
[somber tone playing]

100
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,849
I was filled with anger.

101
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,314
I went back to my old life.

102
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,570
I left everything behind to start over.

103
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,574
Just like my grandma wanted.

104
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,619
But now…

105
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,121
I'm here.

106
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,750
With you.

107
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,754
[somber music continues]

108
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,925
And I'm not just
fighting for myself anymore.

109
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,225
I'm fighting for the ones who were used,

110
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,436
those who were tricked,

111
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,066
for the exploited, betrayed and wounded.

112

[stirring music playing]

113
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,370
I'm fighting for them.

114
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,374
I'm fighting for you.

[stirring music continues]

116
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,054
This contract…

117
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,724
is bigger than us.

118
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,187
It's bigger than our pain.

119
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,482
It's for the greater good.

120
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:32,071
[stirring music continues]

121

- Now we're ready.
- [dramatic music sting]

123

Fuck them all.

- Let's move!

But there are three guards. All armed.

One at each exit point.

137
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,700
[Gab] I'm in the left sector.

[suspenseful music continues]

139
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,334
No sign of the subject here.

140
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,172
But I see signs of movement.

141
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,717
Looks like kids, approximately…

142
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,429
9 to 13 years old.

Tomas, how's it looking in your sector?

146
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,843
Geez.

147
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,304
These kids are up early.

[Gab] <i>Movement started at 0500.</i>

149
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,438
<i>Likely their wake-up protocol.</i>

150
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,691
[sighs] Their training is intense.

151
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,238
They're just teenagers,
but already this tough.

152
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,659
Teenagers?

153
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,955
So that means,
the younger ones are separated from them.

154
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,166
Yeah, looks like it.

155
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,463
Gotcha.

156
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,592
I see guards too.

157
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,844

going to get what they deserve.

I wouldn't have let you do recon.

185
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,721
[sighs deeply] Sir…

186
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,395
I couldn't sleep knowing what's happening.

187
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,654
Look, I get your pain and anger
after losing your father.

188
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,782
But you have to control your emotions.

189
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,119
Like I always say…

190
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,081
on the battlefield, emotion can't lead.

191
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,251
Get some rest.

192
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,752
Your body needs it.

193
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:49,383
[somber music continues]

194
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,974
[crow cawing]

195
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,269
[somber music fades]

196
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:08,569
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [motorcycle revving]

197
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,987
Guys, someone's coming.

198
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,322
[Gab] <i>Who?</i>

199
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:23,917
[suspenseful music continues]

200
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,846
[motorcycle humming]

201
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:42,352
[engine idling, shuts off]

202
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,152
- Kenji Lee?
- [dramatic music sting]

203
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,743
[music turns unsettling]

204
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,827
What?!

205
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,205
Kenji Lee?

206
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,458
Your contract from Kaigen?

207
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,004
[Gab] Yes! Yes, it's him!
But, what's he doing here?

208
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,341
[unsettling music continues]

209
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,425
Sir Gaspar.

210
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,261
- How's everything here?
- Good.

211
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,098
Sir's been waiting for you.

212
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,228
He works for El Cano.

213
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:29,066
[unsettling music continues]

214
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,237
Now it makes sense.

215
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,741
No wonder they didn't come for me,
I wasn't part of the contract.

216
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,620
They've been watching you since Kaigen.

217
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:46,125
[unsettling music continues]

218
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,919
Just say the word, Doc. I'll end this now.

219
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,176
[Miguel] <i>Negative, Monkey!</i>

220
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,263
Do not do that!
You'll compromise the mission.

221
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,848
[dramatic music sting]

222
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:07,479
[unsettling music continues]

223
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,945
[unsettling music crescendos]

224
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,074
- [screaming]
- [gunshots]

225
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,077
<i>If you think Manuel's</i>
<i>just out for revenge, no.</i>

226
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,453
<i>He's been planning this for a while.</i>

227
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,373
<i>Even if it kills us,</i>
<i>we're not letting his plans happen.</i>

228
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:31,837
[dramatic music playing]

229
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,547
<i>That yours?</i>

230
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,216
<i>Probably from</i>
<i>a soldier who didn't make it back.</i>

231
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,595
<i>We'll get justice for what El Cano did.</i>

232
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,891
<i>For your brother, my father</i>
<i>and to the rest of our team.</i>

233
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,935
<i>We have to prepare for Greg's attack.</i>

234
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,021
<i>There's a price on my head.</i>

235
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,648
<i>Sir, if they will attack us,</i>
<i>why not strike first?</i>

236
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,401
<i>Greg's coming to us himself.</i>

237
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,031
<i>Bravo team, south bound.</i>
<i>Alpha team, north bound.</i>

238
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,365
<i>- Clear?</i>
- [all] <i>Roger that!</i>

239
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,825
<i>Let's do this! Move!</i>

240
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,118
- [car revving]
- [gunshots]

241
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,369
[explosion]
