Didn't you learn anything?

186
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,614
A package can be anything.

187
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,325
Money, people… Anything!

188
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,827
- Right?
- I could've used a heads-up!

189
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,496
How hard is it to say,
"Tomas, sorry.

190
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,123
They're too heavy.
I need help carrying them"?

191
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,917
I could've prepared properly!

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,337
He's so dramatic, isn't he?
So freaking dramatic!

193
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,130
What are you yapping for?

194
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,216
The mission's done.
They're here now.

195
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,301
You could've told me

196
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,011
- that was your father's house!
- Shh!

197
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,513
[whispering]
You're stressing them out.

198
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,516
Bud and Dy hate being stressed,
so keep it down.

199
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,309
You had me steal from your dad!

200
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,312
What did you say? Steal?
Steal what?

201
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,898
Excuse me?
They're mine dogs, okay?

202
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,233
I didn't steal anything.

203
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,735
Besides, my father
is much worse!

204
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,030
He's been luring people
into gambling since forever.

205
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,324
My father is evil, okay?
No need to feel guilty.

206
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,410
You know, my uncle
isn't a saint either.

207
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,203
But I'd never steal from him.

208
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,413
Well, we're different!

209
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,123
- Damn right, we're different!
- So?

210
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,126
Because I won't compromise
a teammate like you just did

211
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,420
and leave them
in enemies hands!

212
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,879
I hope you understand that.

213
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,133
I already paid you, alright?

214
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,593
Paid? Oh, right.
[chuckles dryly]

215
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,804
Screw you.

216
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,517
Alright, Bud.
Say goodbye now.

217
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,310
Goodbye!

218
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,604
Goodbye! Get lost!

219
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,231
Right?!

220
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,316
I missed you!

221
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,778
Technically, what you did
was kidnapping.

222
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,199
Biologically, I'm still
Mickey's father.

223
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,118
I have a right to see him.

224
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,996
[Jake laughs]

225
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,581
[claps]

226
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,084
What's so funny?

227
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,212
You.

228
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,506
You're a joke, Miguel.

229
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,093
There's nothing funny
about what I said.

230
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,514
Mickey is my flesh and blood.

231
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,102
And you?
What are you to him?

232
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,897
You're just my wife's lover.

233
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,482
Leave us alone.

234
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,901
Leave my family alone!

235
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,612
Stop calling Christine.

236
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,198
And stop seeing Mickey.

237
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,782
Just leave!

238
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,411
Tell him not to get
on my nerves

239
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,704
before I snap.

240
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,415
You have no right to
come near our family.

241
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,629
And if you still won't stop,
I'll take them far away.

242
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,713
[Christine] Jake.

243
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,302
What did you say?

244
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,720
I didn't quite hear that.

245
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,014
You know I have the power
to take them away if I want to.

246
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:27,932
Babe!

247
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,017
Somewhere you can't find.

248
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,521
You'll lose your mind
before you ever find us.

249
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,815
- [blow lands]
- [Jake grunts]

250
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,527
- Miguel!
- Yeah?! Just you try!

251
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,612
- Damn you!
- [blow lands]

252
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,200
- [blows landing]
- [Jake yelps, grunts]

253
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,701
[Christine] Enough!

254
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,411
- [blow lands]
- [body thuds]

255
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,621
- Well?!
- Stop!

256
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,706
Just you try!

257
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,834
You good for nothing bastard!

258
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,211
You're worse!

259
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,713
Just you try to take
my family away from me,

260
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,215
I'll kill you!

261
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,425
I will kill you!

262
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,010
Just go away!

263
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,888
[sobbing] Jake.

264
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,893

[phone buzzing]

266
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,120
Hello, ma'am?
How can I help you?

267
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,332
[Taki] <i>Andres, Esang begged me</i>

Okay. I'll let Father know.

284

Problem?

285

I'm sorry.

295
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,324
I did everything I could
to block the warrant, but…

296
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,826
But what?

00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,704

I'll drag you down with me.

304
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,102
I'll arrange a way
for you to exit the country.

305
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,896
Just lie low and wait
until the situation dies down.

308
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,580
I'm already being hunted…

…by all the law enforcement
agencies throughout the country.

I've tried all the
decryption keys I know.

328
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,113
None of them worked.

329

I asked if your stomach hurts,

Come on. Just grab a bite.

00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,204
I should be able
to crack this!

I've done this
a million freaking times.

340
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,419
But I can't decode it.

341
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,093
- Take a break first.
- JB, what the hell?

342
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,721
Max, you haven't eaten anything.

343
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,389
You obviously aren't
feeling well.

344
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,725
You need to rest.
Get some sleep.

345
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,393
I can't sleep.

346
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,315
Not even a wink.

347
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,817
You know what?
I might as well do this.

348
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,903
I can't fall asleep anyway.

349
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,697
- [pills rattle]
- Take two tablets.

350
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,199
They will surely
knock you out.

351
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,785
Get some sleep, Max.

352
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,837
- [tongue clicks]
- [Max sighs softly]

353
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,802
All your reports are useless!

354
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,681
Get lost!

355
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,017
[Andres] Emil.

356
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,897
You don't learn, do you?

357
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,399
Why won't you leave
my grandma alone?

358
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,193
Easy there.

359
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,278
You're too tense.

360
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,199
Acting like a victim
when you've also drawn blood.

361
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,784
I already paid
for what I've done.

362
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,911
I've served my sentence.

363
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,287
That's not enough!

364
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,500
