- There's one outside.

183
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,201
And it's a beautiful woman.

184
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,036
- Really?
- Yeah.

185
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,037
Where?

186
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:28,085
[stirring music playing]

187
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,097
Article 125 of
the Revised Penal Code,

188
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,016
detaining someone
without charges

189
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,602
for more than the allowable
period is illegal.

190
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,605
Now, my client here
has been in custody overnight

191
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,608
without formal charges
nor a probable cause.

192
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,779
But my men saw him
with the thieves.

193
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,907
He even helped one escape.

194
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,992
Are you sure about that, sir?

195
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,789
Sir, I know you're
doing your job.

196
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,500
You need someone
to blame,

197
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,210
someone to take the fall.

198
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,131
Mr. Guerrero was just
at the wrong place

199
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,591
at the wrong time.

200
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,595
Tom, your lawyer's
something else.

201
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,597
Wait.

202
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,516
Is she your lawyer
or girlfriend?

203
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,101
None of the above.

204
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,311
Never mind. You don't need
to answer.

205
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,898
I know you can't get
a girlfriend that pretty.

206
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,526
- Wow, thanks.
- But, seriously,

207
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,902
where did you meet her?

208
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,822
She's a friend of
my friend's friend.

209
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,115
- Really?
- Yeah.

210
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,035
Then introduce me to that friend
of your friend's friend.

211
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,205
Maybe they know an older woman
who looks like her.

212
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,998
Are you seriously
thinking of that

213
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,333
while I'm in jail?

214
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,918
How about we switch places?

215
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,294
Well, I was just asking.

216
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,922
Fine, I'll find you a girlfriend
once I get out of here.

217
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,715
She's gorgeous.

218
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,928
If my client remains in custody
without any piece of evidence,

219
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,930
you will be facing
civil suits

220
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,807
and administrative complaints.

221
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,810
We don't want that to happen,
do we, sir?

222
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:15,609
[tense music playing]

223
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,987
Fine.

224
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,989
I got it.

225
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,616
We'll release him,

226
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,619
Finally, thank you.
I want everything intact.

227
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,997
All his stuff,
bags, cellphones…

228
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,999
If something is missing,
I'll know right away.

229
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,002
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, attorney.

230
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,213
[Tomas sighs in relief]

231
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,298
Let's go.

232
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,508
[laughing]

233
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,427
Bye, guys!

234
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,929
Hey, wake up.
I'm leaving now. Come on.

235
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,806
[birds chirping]

236
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,392
Is Clover always here?

237
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
No.

238
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,902
He just comes
once in a while.

239
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:04,700
[pensive music playing]

240
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,495
We need to find
the perfect time.

241
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,581
Five o'clock.

242
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,417
The four staff members
will be gone by then.

243
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,586
But they have sensors
out the back.

244
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,507
They'll see anyone
entering the property.

245
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,636
I'm sure they've doubled
the security in this place.

246
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,430
[pensive music continues]

247
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,308
We need eyes inside.

248
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,687
[birds chirping]

249
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,734
Leave it to me.

250
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:45,783
[stirring music playing]

251
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,334
I thought I'd rot in there.

252
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,212
Welcome to the outside world,
Mr. Guerrero.

253
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:02,299
Attorney Pretty,
thank you so much.

254
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,218
You're amazing.

255
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,928
You're so slick like a fish.

256
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,597
Not only are you pretty,
you're also smart.

257
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,517
Hmm, thank you so much.

258
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,103
I'm willing to do anything
to help those in need.

259
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,939
Well then, I'll get going now.

260
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,315
I have a lot
of things to do.

261
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,984
- Go ahead.
- Alright, sir.

262
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,113
- Thanks again, Attorney Pretty.
- Thank you, too.

263
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,198
- I hope we meet again.
- Sure.

264
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,702
- You should go now. Bye.
- Bye.

265
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,996
- Thank you so much.
- What a chatterbox!

266
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,916
Check if they stole anything
from your bag.

267
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,126
I'm on it. Don't get mad.

268
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,419
Why are you mad?

269
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,420
I'm not.

270
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,298
[tense music playing]

271
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,008
- All good?
- All good.

272
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,095
Wait.

273
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,431
How did you do that, huh?

274
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,016
How did you find out I'm here?
Who told you--

275
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,434
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.

276
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,603
How about you thank me first?

277
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,812
I got you out of jail,
remember?

278
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,814
Okay. Thank you.

279
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,900
Now, tell me.
How did you do that?

280
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,402
Stop asking questions.

281
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,990
Fine.

282
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,618
The Contractor can't
find out about this.

283
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,120
Don't tell him, please.

284
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,041
Okay.

285
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,794
I had additional security
deployed.

286
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,589
Now, there are five people
out the back.

287
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,384
I've also had additional
sensors installed.

288
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,179
[computer beeping]

289
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,181
Zoom in a bit closer here.

[suspenseful music playing]

291
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,105
That guy's quite brave.

292
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,815
He sneaked in alone.

293
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,615
Are you sure he's alone?

294
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,576
Yes.

295
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,914
[suspenseful music continues]

296
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,209
How did he get pass
the countless guards we have?

297
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,296
He came through
a dark area.

298
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,092
He's probably from around here.

299
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,096
Because he knows all the twists
and turns of the forest.

300
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,806
Boss,

301
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,307
if he was alone,

302
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,892
he might just be a burglar…

303
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,603
who mistook our property
for a normal house.

304
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,189
He's out of his mind if he
came alone for us intentionally.

305
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,732
[lip smack]

306
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,818
Still, we can't take this
lying down.

307
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,697
We have to take
every threat seriously

308
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,490
after what happened to Uncle.

309
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:36,203

- [traffic noises]
- What was that?

311
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,001
You looked for me because
you wanted to offer me a job?

312
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,210
Mm-hmm.

313
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,130
Aren't you frustrated that you
didn't earn anything from Timor?

314
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,215
Damn it! Did you really have
to remind me?

315
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,634
- Well, I have a job for you.
- [scoffs]

316
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,511
I'll pay you 50,000.

317
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,015
But since I saved you earlier--

318
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,182
Okay, I'll do it.

319
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,518
So I can make it up to you.

320
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,896
Besides, I'm willing to help
those in need, just like you.

321
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,524
Wow, you even used
my own words on me.

322
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,735
How about you add some more
and pay me 60,000?

324
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,196
How long has that been there?

325

I'm not sure, sir.

326
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,284
You're not sure?

327
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,037
Wait, what's going on?

328
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,705
There's a car nearby.

329
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,290
It's not one of ours.

00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,317
Go look.

335
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,735
Hurry.
They might still be nearby.

336
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,819
Come on.

337
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,206
Boss, they're not there!

338
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,293
They got away.

339
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,506
Keep your eyes peeled.

340
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,424
They'll be back.

Wow!

00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,308
Is this all yours?

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,936
- I didn't know you're rich!
- Hmm?

347
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,104
Where do you get
your money from?

348
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,814
Where do you think?

349
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,525
You got all this from
doing contract work?

That's impressive!
I want to have all this, too.

I should've started doing
contract work earlier.

Okay, that's enough.

354
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,700
- Have a seat.
- Alright, I'm ready.

That's the house
you're going to sneak into.

What?

Okay, we can do that.

369

00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,119
Alright.

371

get the package.

373

- Package? Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

374
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,337
