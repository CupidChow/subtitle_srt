00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,016
[surgeon] We'll do hemostasis.

Is the patient stable?

23
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,687
- The patient's stable, doc.
- Okay.

00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,654
Okay, let's check for bleeding.

No more bleeding.

00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,579
[nurse] No more bleeding.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,706
[surgeon] Is the patient stable?

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,542

He's stable for now,

35

but he sustained serious wounds.

36
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,499
We need to keep him
under close monitoring.

37
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,044
And the next 24 hours will be crucial.

38
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:55,258
He also sustained
serious internal injuries.

39
00:02:55,341 --> 00:03:00,930
We still don't know how he'll
respond to the procedure.

40
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,642

I'm taking over here.

The situation has become too sensitive.

53
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,316
Yes, sir. I understand.

54
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,985

He wants to go home later.

That's how old folks are.

152
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,135

00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,105
He saved his father,

188
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,315
who got shot.

189
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,026
But he's recovering now.

190
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,742
Was it related to this?

191
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,579
Related to what?

192
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,418
Any suspects?

193
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,886
[Antonio breathing heavily]

194
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,846
Dad.

195
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,557
I've added more security personnel.

196
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,351
I also won't leave for now.

197
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,688
[Antonio] El Cano can't be stopped.

198
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,818
That's the group the Escaleras' belong to.

199
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:04,909
[unsettling music playing]

200
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,455
- Dad.
- [gasps]

201
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,873
[Antonio groans]

202
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,500
Dad, all that matters now is…

203
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,252
that you get some rest
and regain your strength.

204
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,755
That's what matters.

205
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:27,431
[unsettling music continues]

206
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,562
[Max] <i>It's still under investigation.</i>

207
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,653
I want to get out of here.

208
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,154
When can I leave?

209
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,491
Andres, you have to rest.

210
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,701
We've told you that, many times.

211
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,995
A few more days won' t hurt.

212
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,956
Don't worry, you can go home soon.

213
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:59,046
[suspenseful music playing]

214
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,176
There's food here.

215
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,469
You can eat it anytime.

216
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,554
Mm-hmm.

217
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,474
Eat it before she gets mad. [chuckles]

218
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,727
Right? [chuckles]

219
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,313
Dad.

220
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,524
Here's your medicine.

221
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:27,658
[suspenseful music continues]

222
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,911
[exhales sharply]

223
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,623
- [door opens]
- [Madel] Please wait.

224
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,375
Hold on. [breath quivers]

225
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,628
Sir Tony, JB, it's the police.

226
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,838
Mr. Bonifacio.

227
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,924
We have a warrant of arrest
for your father.

228
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:52,224
[suspenseful music continues]

229
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,397
No problem.

230
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,317
I'll come with you willingly.

231
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,944
Just let me talk to my son.

232
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,115
Dad.

233
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,742
You're innocent.

234
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,413
Your name is only on that list
because you served the country.

235
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,875
This is part of my sworn duty.

236
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,086
I'm already old, son.

237
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm done fighting.

238
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,176
But you…

239
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,387
You can still do many things.

240
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,099
Do whatever it takes

241
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,185
to return to service.

242
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,314
Finish the mission I failed to complete.

243
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:44,068
[suspenseful music continues]

244
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,235
Dad.

245
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,364
- Dad.
- [officer] Mr. Bonifacio.

246
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,740
- You're under arrest.
- Wait, hold on.

247
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,159
Let's talk things over.
My father is an ex-general.

248
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,870
That's enough. It's okay, JB.

249
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,164
- [JB] Dad.
- [Madel sobbing] Sir.

250
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,875
- [Madel] Sir Tony.
- Dad.

251
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,799
[suspensful music fades]

252
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:14,515
- [banging on door]
- [foreboding music playing]

253
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,308
I said--

254
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,268
- Come with us.
- Wait.

255
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,062
- What's going on?
- Don't resist

256
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,648
- if you don't want to get hurt.
- I don't even know you.

257
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:29,196
- [blows landing]
- [grunting]

258
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,656
Put your gun down!

259
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,366
[breathing heavily]

260
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,618
Just one word from us,

261
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,703
and your son will be dead.

262
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,957
[foreboding music continues]

263
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,041
Well?

264
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,793
Are you still going to resist?

265
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:52,219
[foreboding music intensifies]

266
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,891
Alright.

267
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,976
Wait.

268
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,311
Don't hurt my son.

269
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,981
I'm begging you.

270
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,315
I'll come with you.

271
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,359
I'll do whatever you want.

272
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,777
Just don't hurt my son.

273
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,320
Shut up.

274
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,613
Take him.

275
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,407
My son.

276
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,950
- [blow lands]
- [groans]

277
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,119
[groans]

278
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:26,211
[suspenseful music playing]

279
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,511
[Greg] Andres.

280
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,019
[Andres] Sir.

281
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:48,400
[suspenseful music continues]

282
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,027
I'm glad you're okay.

283
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,530
But you know why I'm here.

284
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,868
Why did you deceive me?

285
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,081
[suspenseful music intensifies]

286
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,165
Sir.

287
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,087
I took the hard drive
even before our contract.

288
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,714
It was my decision.

289
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,218
I also got JB and Max involved.

290
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,302
It's all me.

291
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,307
Andres, there is no such thing
as "It's all me"

292
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,809
when it comes to our job.

293
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,937
Any move one makes
can affect the whole group.

294
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,896
You know that.

295
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,523
Yes, sir, I know that.

296
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,567
It was my fault. I'm sorry, sir.

297
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:35,239
[suspenseful music continues]

298
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,573
If only I had known,

299
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,575
a lot of bad things could've
been stopped before they happened.

300
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,205
Sir, you know that everything
I do is for my brother, right?

301
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,250
During that time,

302
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,418
I was so close to discovering
his whereabouts.

303
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:53,715
[suspenseful music continues]

304
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,425
I would've understood…

305
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,761
if only you had told me.

306
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,429
You shouldn't have kept it from me.

307
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,681
[Andres] You said it yourself.

308
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,766
The mission comes first.

309
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,564
But then again, I know it was my fault.

310
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,731
I'll own up to it.

311
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,653
Sir, I'll leave the group.

312
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:20,325
[suspenseful music continues]

313
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,869
One more thing, sir.

314
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,414
Isabel Escalera has a message for you.

315
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,793
The Raven is alive.

316
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:36,842
[suspenseful music intensifies]

317
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,807
[suspenseful music crescendos]

318
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,352
<i>You're selling the rest house in Tanay?</i>

319
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,228
<i>I'll buy it.</i>

320
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,229
<i>Does she have 30 million?</i>

321
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,355
<i>Shut up!</i>

322
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,649
<i>We currently have in custody individuals</i>

323
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,568
<i>who are involved in corruption.</i>

324
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,069
<i>The people who helped him</i>

325
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,946
<i>are the real legends.</i>

326
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,073
<i>I'll do everything to get you out of here.</i>

327
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,825
[gunshot]

328
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,161
<i>I know I've wronged you</i>
<i>and the group, big time.</i>

329
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,287
<i>If only I wasn't so impulsive,</i>

330
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,497
<i>that wouldn't have</i>
<i>happened to your father</i>.
