<i>And now he's not answering your calls?</i>

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,550
<i>I think he ran off with the money.</i>

- [Gab chuckles softly]

34
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,874
Well, we made a group chat without you,

35
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,252
but don't worry, we'll add you later.
It's a surprise!

36
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,880
Yeah, a surprise.
Gab said you and Andres were here.

37
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,342
Of course, we miss you,
so we came by for… you know,

38
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,679
to see you. [giggles]

Good thing, Miguel,
I didn't get slide up like sashimi.

00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,816
There, there. Sit still, will you?

43
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,319
How's that cut supposed to heal?
Relax a bit.

44
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:38,408
But seriously, Doc,
that contract… it was insane.

45
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,660
It was ten times harder than we expected.

46
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,911
- Super.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,831

- Yeah.

Hmm? Really, Guerrero?

I thought you were the
happiest in the snow.

50

Max, I love the heat and
stickiness of the Philippines.

51

Spill what?

55
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,267
Oh, come on, Doc.
Don't play dumb like a kid.

56
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,852
- Just spill it.
- Yeah, spill.

57

It's just that…

We didn't even get to hang out.

- Wow.

- What a boring conversation.
- Respect.

- Tomas!
- Sorry. I'm kidding, Doc.

72

Show some respect.

181
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,904
Are you sure this is
his girlfriend's address?

182
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,323
I'm sure, Max.

183
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,950
She lives in this area.

187

Can you zoom in here?

188
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,891
Is that him?

190

It can be used against
or in favor of you in court,

nothing but the truth.

- For me?
- Yeah.

He'll be out soon.

[Joris] I'll just go for a smoke.

The smoking area is over there, sir.

257

- Calm down.
- Where is my money, Joris?

267
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,551
I'll give it back to you. Just calm down.

268
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,387
It's in my car. Follow me.

269

Relax, okay?

[suspenseful music continues]

271
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,231
That's Jun. I'm sure of it, Grandma.

272
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,027
How are you so sure?
His name's not even here.

273
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,739
And didn't the BSWP already give us

274
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,617
records of Jun's death?

275
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,244
- It even has a picture of him.
- [Andres] I know, Grandma.

276
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,163
But don't you think it's suspicious

277
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,209
that I received this after we
were informed of Jun's death?

278
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,544
[suspenseful music continues]

279
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,089
Maybe that lady from BSWP felt guilty

280
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,008
after witnessing Grandma's
crash out back in their office.

281
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,134
Maybe?

282
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,639
But who adopted your brother?

283
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,432
According to this document,

284
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,059
it's a man named Manuel Aguinaldo.

285
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,103
Who is he?

286
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,022
And… and how will we find him?

287
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,193
Look, it has the signature
of the previous BSWP head, Ligaya Argonza.

288
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,321
- Oh.
- Isn't she long dead?

289
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,448
She died of cancer.

290
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,575
Yeah, but check out the other signatory.

291
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,579
It's the current secretary,
Marichu Doronilla.

292
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,998
- This one?
- She's married now.

293
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,835
She now goes by
the last name Marquez.

294
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,216
I don't know what to think anymore.

295
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,927
I smell something fishy, Andres.

296
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,805
It looks like Cristy isn't telling us the truth.

297
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,433
That's why I need to talk to this Marichu.

298
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,603
Wait a minute.

299
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,230
If Jun was adopted,

300
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,275
why would they lie to us?

301
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,445
And who sent you this document?

302
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,656
What are their motives?

303
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,994
And if Jun is still alive,

304
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,122
why are they doing this?

305
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,915
Why are they playing with us?

306
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,375
Grandma…

307
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,546
I don't know, Grandma.

308
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,300
Whether this is Jun or not,

309
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,135
I need to get to the bottom of this.
