2
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:04,212
<i>To kidnap Diego Aguinaldo.</i>

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,756
<i>We just need to lure Manuel out.</i>

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,050
<i>That's the man who adopted him.</i>

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:12,429
<i>I know. I sent</i>
<i>you his certificate of adoption.</i>

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>Why are you only telling me this now?</i>

7
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>Had I told you back then,</i>

8
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,642

9

<i>Whatever you're planning,</i>

10
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,729
<i>leave Jun out of it.</i>

11
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,023
<i>Andres's brother will get dragged into it.</i>

12
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,942
<i>JB, you need to choose.</i>

13
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,611
<i>Allegiance or mission integrity?</i>

14
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,321
<i>Friendship or justice?</i>

15
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>Justice.</i>

16
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,784
<i>I want you, me,</i>

17
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,910

20
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,957
<i>I like the life I have now.</i>

21

24
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,721
Jun.

25
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,308
I'm still your brother.

26
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,394
And Grandma…

27
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,856
has been waiting for you her whole life.

28
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,275
Andres, sorry.

29
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,320
But I have my own life now.

30
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,365
We all have our own lives.

31
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,243
I'm no longer Jun.

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,286
I am Diego.

Jun, I understand if
this is all too sudden for you.

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,966
But I…

37
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,677
Grandma and I…

38
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,972
we want to make it up to you, of course.

39
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,599
There's no need.

[cicadas chirping]

41
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,982
Jun… [sighs]

42
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,025
I don't understand you anymore.

43
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,446
Are you avoiding me? Be honest.

44
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,576
You suddenly left
when we were at the cemetery.

45
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,706
You also changed your clothes
and hid your face last time. Why?

46
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,919
Are you hiding something?

47
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,547
Tell me.

48
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,842
What kind of life do you have now?

49
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,553
What's with all your questions?

[Jun sighs]

51
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,645
I was taken from my
family when I was seven.

52
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,232
For the longest time, I was alone.

53
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,861
I felt like I always had to hide.

54
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,865
[pensive music playing]

55
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,952
Andres, you don't
know the fear I felt then.

56
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,539
Until Papa rescued me.

57

[pensive music continues]

58
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,130
He raised me and taught
me not to trust people easily

59
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,342
because it's the only
way for me to get stronger.

60
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,761
Was that wrong?

61
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,262
Jun, I'm your brother.

62
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,557
I want you to be safe.

63
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,850
I'm safe.

64
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,769
I like my life.

66
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,774
Alright.

67
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,943
Is that your decision?

68
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,197
I'll respect it.

69
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:07,121
But let me meet your adoptive father.

[pensive music continues]

71
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,170
After that, you'll stop?

72
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,172
I'll never leave your side again, Jun.

73
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,841
[thunder rolling]

74
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,929
But I'll respect the life you have now.

[music turns foreboding]

76
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,602
If that's what you want,

77
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,604
fine.

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,606
Tomorrow.

79
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:43,157

[foreboding music fades]

83
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,293
Dad, you promised not
to bother us anymore after the wedding.

84
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,259
Unless this is about my inheritance.

85
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,679
It is.

86
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,099
I just want to update you.

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,481
We're still processing
the transfer of my assets to you.

88
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,068
So, while we're waiting,

89
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,782
I wanted to give this to you as a gift.

90
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,911
- [keys jangling]
- [Tomas chuckles]

91
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,542
This is the key
to your mom's rest house, Gabriela.

92
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,256
This one's the easiest to process.

93
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,968
So, I had it taken care of first.

94
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:50,266
[soft music playing]

95
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,102
- Take it.

[Gab sobs, breathes shakily]

100
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,079
Here, Gab.

104
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,724
Thank you, Dad.

105
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,397
[Gab sobs] Thank you.

106
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,442
[voice breaks] Thank you.

[sentimental music fades]

109
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,132
It's not that easy, Andres.

110
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,551
He has a different family now.

111
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,180
Well, what about us, Grandma?

112
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,433
We're his family too, right?

113
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:20,398
We also want him
to have a good and happy life.

114
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,318
Yes.

115
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,821
But he said…

116
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,158
he grew up well, right?

117
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,577
Why?

118
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,328
Is there a problem?

119
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,374
- No. It's fine, but…
- Hmm.

120
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,835
what was our plan?

121
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,380
The plan was we'd all live together

122
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,674
once we find Jun, right?

123
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,801
Then we'd move near our land.

124
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,052
That was the plan.

125
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,726
You're hurting because

126
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,102
you had false hope.

127
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,734
Was I the only one
who had false hope, Grandma?

128
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,778
I also did.

129
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,573
[pensive music playing]

130
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:15,411
But when I heard him
speaking highly of his adoptive father,

131
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,040
how that man took
care of him and loved him,

132
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,542
I knew it.

133
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,630
[inhales deeply]

134
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,799
What matters is that we finally found Jun.

135
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,015
And we learned that he had a good life.

136
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:45,900
[pensive music continues]

137
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,151
What if he didn't?

138
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,904
What do you mean?

139
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,241
You saw how dignified
your brother looked, right?

140
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,827
It was so far from
what Junjun used to look like.

141
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,915
You know what, Andres?

142
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,086
[pensive music continues]

143
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,255
He turned out well

144
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,132
even though we weren't with him.

145
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,470
Because aside from us,

146
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,099
someone else loved him, too.

147
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:23,521

151
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,001
Hello, Mom.

152
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,504
I'm here.

153
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,219
Are you good here?
I can leave now if you want.

154
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,973
Since you're already here,

155
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,309
you can come inside.

156
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,185
Is that okay?

157
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,520
Do you want to?

158
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,105
I can give you a tour if you want.

159
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,690
Sure.

160
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,484
[inhales deeply]

161
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,694
Come, this way.

00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,934
Wow.

166
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,894
Is that your mom?

167
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,399
She's so pretty.

[inhales, exhales deeply]

175
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,665
So, this is how it feels
to be happy, Tomas.

Don't worry.

So far, all the guest
profiles are cleared.

No active warrants,

186
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,588
no affiliations to extremist groups,
and no red flags.

187
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,757
Clean records and normal lives.

188
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,011
We also marked a few
of them for close monitoring.

189
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,471
Nothing criminal.

190
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,933
But we noticed some
behavioral inconsistencies.

191
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,519
Like traces of affiliation

192
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,896
and unusual travel patterns.

00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:45,574
Noli Magsambol, Shiela Estrellado,

195
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,786
Julian Abad, and Dominic Lopez.

196
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,455
We need to keep an eye on them.

197
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,209
Once inside the venue,
act like you don't know each other.

198
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,711
No contact. No familiar looks.

200
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,217

202
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,893
Watch out for possible threats
that we might need to neutralize.

Remember, there is no room for error.

205
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,820
It's a targeted event.

206
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,613
We hold the line inside.

207
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,156
And I'd just like to add, sir,

208
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,201
one wrong move
from us and we tip them off.

209
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,619
Max is right.

210
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,538
We're hoping that it's an empty threat,

211
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,833
but if something goes wrong,
we know what to do.

Take it easy. It's okay.

246
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,874
You've improved a lot.
You just need more practice.

[tense music continues]

248
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:50,884
Are you sure you don't need
my help with the Barrios contract?

I'm worried about you.

250

No need.

251
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,518
I want to do it alone.

252
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,897
You've trained me enough
so there's no need to worry.

[tense music builds, ends]

254
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,698
What about you, doc?
If you were hired to assassinate Barrios,

255
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,535
how would you kill her in a crowded event?

256
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,914
I'd look for a high vantage point.

257
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,250
A secluded area with a good line of sight.

258
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,628
One shot kill, then exit.

259
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,466
But maybe it's not a sniper.

260
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,180
It could be close
range like poison or gas.

261
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,183
Or it could be something as simple as…

262
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,393
putting poison in their food.

263
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,605
Sabotaging the drinks, spiking the food…

264
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,442
There are many ways
to make it look like an accident.

265

[Max] Mm-hmm.

Continue. I'll just make a phone call.

Is there a problem?

00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,265
I want out.

274
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,896
Leave me out of the contract.

[unsettling music continues]

276
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,694
So, now you're taking it out on me?

277
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,533
You gave me your word
and you accepted the contract.

278
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,119
Do you think you can just
quit whenever you want to?

We will not be compromised by you.

I repeat, Andres.
Don't get personal with me.

I can't get personal with you,
but you can with me?
