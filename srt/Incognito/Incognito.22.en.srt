Sir, what are you talking about?
I'm not trying to escape!

I even helped you!

Sir, I'm not a thief!

181

Sir-- Ow! That hurts!

182
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,416
- That's mine, sir!
- Check his bag.

183
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,710
That's mine, sir.

184
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,426
Shit.

185
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,510
It's him.

186
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,721
- Sir, I'm not a thief!
- Come with us to the precinct!

187
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,014
I'm not a thief!

Hello, Max.

200
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,214
I need your help.

Hello, Andres?

203
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,600
I'm outside your house.

- Hey, Kaleb. Come in.

- How are you?
- I'm fine. You?

207
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,904
- Want something to drink?
- I'm good, bro.

208
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:24,905
What about water?

209
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,282
- No, thanks.
- All right.

210
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,284
Oh, by the way…

211
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,788
This is CIB Agent Pagundayao.

212
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,627
There are rumors
that he's paid by the Escaleras.

213
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,297
Looks like he's the protector
of their illegal businesses.

[Kaleb] <i>That could</i>
<i>probably help you get</i>

I'm sorry, that's all
I can give you for now.

No.

218
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,812
This is good. It's a huge help.

219
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,188

If you don't talk,

I'll make sure you rot in jail.

You're tarnishing
the CIB's reputation.

230

I don't know
what you're talking about!

231
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,318
I know you're working
for the Escaleras!

Where are you?

240
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,426
I told you
we need your help.

We've been waiting for you.

242
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,679
I've been compromised!
Someone's chasing me!

If you know anything
about the master list,

spill it now.

Master list?

254
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,414
No. I don't know
anything about that.

255

You don't know anything?

256
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,083
Then you're useless to me.

257
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,127
Wait! Wait!

258
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,504
Wait! Fine, I'll tell you!

[Andres] What?

260
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,924
I know.

261
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,718
I know where
their safe house is.

262
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,636
It might be there.

263
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,096
The master list you're
looking for might be there.

Where?!

265
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,308
In 100 Casanto Street.

Make sure you're telling the truth.

267
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,732
If you trick me,
I will hunt you down.
