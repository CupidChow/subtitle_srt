Ma'am, with all due respect,

61

you socializing out there

If you can't protect me out there,

then why are you even here?

71
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,871

Hello, Secretary Barrios.

- Hi.
- Can I take a photo with you?

After what you did to us,

you went into hiding

90
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,100

Just like in other contracts,
unexpected things happen.

93
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,669
Collateral damage.

94
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,422
That's what happened to you.

95
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,133
You accepted a contract from us.

96
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,304
But you also accepted
a contract from our enemy.

97
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,264
It wasn't an accident.

98
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,141
You chose to betray us.

[sinister music continues]

100
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,986
Didn't you teach me…

101
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,282
that we have to make sacrifices
to accomplish what needs to be done?

102
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,452
The mission comes first.

103
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,746
Right, sir?

104
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,169
Don't try to justify what you did.

[dramatic music playing]

106
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,302
We have a lot of disagreements.

107
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:31,599
We don't see eye to eye on some things.

108
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:39,398
Like how I don't believe in
a higher government, but you do.

109
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,818
You're still helping the military, right?

110
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,614
You still believe in the government.

111
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,785
The system is already flawed, sir.

112
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,413
Do you really think…

113
00:06:55,623 --> 00:07:00,169
obeying a higher
power is still an honorable goal?

114
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,800
I don't care about beliefs.

115
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,929
The bottom line is, you betrayed us.

[exhales sharply] You're so narrow-minded.

That's what tore us apart.

00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,648
No.

121
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:27,155
It was because of your greed
and betrayal, you damn bastard.

122
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,034
You act as if you're still in service

123
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,954
even though you're no
longer part of the military.

Team, something feels off.

Eagle, keep an eye on
the man Jaguar followed earlier.

No one was alerted.

138
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,624
That means, the man
we suspected didn't report us.

139
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:06,671
[foreboding music continues]

140
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,007
Are we in the clear
since he didn't report us?

141
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,219
Maybe they're afraid
we might cause trouble.

142
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,807
Or maybe it was intentional.

[foreboding music continues]

144
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,980

That's possible.

148
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,030
They baited us with
something that looked like a weapon.

[Max]<i> To alert us.</i>

What if it's really nothing
and we're just overthinking?

152
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,672
It's not wrong
to overthink in this kind of situation.

153

00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,050
That's essential for our job.

183
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,638
I treated you like my own brother.

184
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:06,392
[tense music continues]

185
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,768
I am loyal…

186
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,855
but only to my principles.

187
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,315
I don't care about your principles…

188
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,651
- [guns cock]
- [birds flutter]

189
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,529
…or all the nonsense
coming out of your mouth.

190
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:23,033
I have a bullet specially made for you.

191
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,328
I will shoot you in the head
before you can get out of here.

192
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:32,168

[foreboding music playing]

196
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,735
[Andres] Selo.

197
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,571
I just noticed

198
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,698
that the event's setup
this year is a bit different.

199
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,283
Oh, yes.

200
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,118
We used to have a live band before.

201
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,120
If the organizers are needing extra,

202
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,165
they'd also set up
some cellos and violins.

203
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,792
Right, that's what's missing today.

204
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,213
[Selo]<i> I guess so.</i>
<i>There's no sound system setup on stage.</i>

205
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,134
That's why there are no instruments.

206
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,720
Yeah. But I prefer that.

207
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,307
I'd rather give money to the victims
than spend it on that.

208
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,267
You're right about that.

209
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,897
[scoffs]

210
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,399
The guy earlier was a bait.

[foreboding music continues]

213
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,007
I'll go through one of
our designated exit points.

214
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,635
I just need time to get in.

215
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,595
There are too many
CCTV cameras in the corridor.

216
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,138
On it.

217
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,767

[tense music fades]

223
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,172
I'd rather not get any civilians involved.

224
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,174
Would you?

225
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,346
[tense music builds]

226
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,098
We have history.

227
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,851
I'll never forget that.

228
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,812
But don't test my patience.

229
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,397
This will be the last time.

Okay. We're back.

248
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,756
[Tomas] Excuse me, ma'am and sir.

249
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,260
While waiting for the program to start,
you can get some drinks from the bar.

250
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,179
We have alcoholic drinks,
shakes, anything you prefer.

251
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,807
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

252
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,602
Wait, what do you mean the power was out?

253
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,104
The power didn't go out here.

254
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,566
Mrs. Sonia and her guest are arriving.
Please tend to them, thank you.

255
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,484
Someone is monitoring us.

256
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,278
There's a threat to the target.

257
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,030
They're controlling that too.

258
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,907
[Miguel]<i> But what for?</i>

259
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,702
Why would they turn off their feed?

260
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,956
They're doing their initial procedure

261
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,167
to execute the assassination plan.

262
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,336
[Max]<i> They're trying</i>
<i>to see if there's an enemy present.</i>

263
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,506
And just like us,

264
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,759
they're working incognito.

[suspenseful music crescendos]

271
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,451
Barrios is playing smart.

272
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,787
She knows that someone is on her.

[keyboard clacking]

274
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,332
But we're smarter than her.

275
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,376
Execute phase two now.

276
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,044
What about your brother?

277
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,797
Also, why would he be using an alias?

278
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,301
Maybe he's part of Barrios's second layer.

- [keyboard clacking]
- [dramatic music playing]

280
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,472
I wouldn't be surprised if he is.

281
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,809
My brother is a former soldier.

282
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,062
Leave him be.

283
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,438
Let them be.

284
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,858
And let the operations speak for itself.

286
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,163
Uh, excuse me. Matthew?

00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,790
- Yes, sir.
- When is it going to start?

288
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,250
- I think I missed it.
- No.

289
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,501
- You're just on time.
- I arrived late.

290
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,461
It'll be starting soon.
You should register first.

291
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,880
- Okay.
- Over here.

292
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,464
- Thank you.
- Come with me.

[chuckles] Do you see this?

299
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,040
I look good in my new shirt.

300
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,833
With the amount you gave me,

301
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,793
of course, I bought a good-quality one.

302
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,545
A special shirt for my birthday.

303
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,382
See? Look. Nice, right?

304
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,926
[Tomas] This way, sir.
