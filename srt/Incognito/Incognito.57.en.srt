00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,587
Copy.

186
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,297
[guns click]

187
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,674
Let's move.

188
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,511
[suspenseful music continues]

189
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,472
Benjie, Sameo's
second-in-command was there.

190
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,395
It looks like they're heading to
town to deliver drugs.

191
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,106
That's a relief.
One less threat on our hands, right?

192
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,067
Don't celebrate just yet, Tomas.
We have to remain vigilant.

193
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,402
You're so pessimistic.

194
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,571
Tomas, just a reminder: Don't slack off.

195
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,449
Don't be complacent. Do you understand?

196
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,659
Got it, madam.

197
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,788
Monkey, Sparrow's right.
Now's not the time to relax.

198
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,415
- She's right again?
- We're not done yet.

199
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,083
Everyone, stay focused.

200
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,420
We have no choice,
we'll have to pass through town.

201
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,549
We have to stay out of sight.
For now, we have to keep on moving.

202
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:32,640
[suspenseful music continues]

203
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:50,574
[suspenseful music continues]

204
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,205
[suspenseful music fades]

205
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,289
[lighter clicks]

206
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:03,003
[pensive music playing]

207
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:07,174
[sighs sharply]
I'll get a copy of the autopsy report.

208
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,094
I want to make sure
that's really Agno's body.

209
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,766
Sim.

210
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:22,022
[inhales deeply]
They tortured him before killing him.

211
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,400
[sighs] What's the plan?

212
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,823
[foreboding music playing]

213
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,741
He died with honor.

214
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,286
He deserves a decent burial.

215
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,664
All right. Leave it to me.

216
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,250
Claire already knows. We've talked.

217
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,379
You know she would always
ask me about her husband.

218
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,799
[inhales, exhales deeply]

219
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,260
I don't know.

220
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:56,015
I don't know where to start
explaining to them.

221
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,102
Greg, we've found Agno.

222
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,771
You can finally face his family.

223
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:08,235
[foreboding music continues]

224
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,739
He needs more than just a proper burial.

225
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,117
I want the full report.

226
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,164
Give me all the details about his death.

227
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:27,921
[foreboding music swells]

228
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,300
[sighs sharply]

229
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,973
- [foreboding music fades]
- [cicadas chirping]

230
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,183
[Tomas] Sir.

231
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,186
Tomas, you should rest.

232
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,812
I can keep watch.

233
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,355
I'm not sleepy yet.

234
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,524
- I'll be over there.
- Okay.

235
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,569
[exhales deeply]

236
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,406
[ominous music playing]

237
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,991
[Tomas] What's up? [grunts]

238
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,164
[Tomas grunts]

239
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,458
[gun cocks]

240
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,294
[quiet snoring]

241
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,756
[guns cocking]

242
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:21,934
[ominous music continues]

243
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,147
[ominous music fades]

244
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,651
[sighs] The storm is still far from here.

245
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,238
- So?
- But your partner,

246
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,740
she looks like she's
passing through the eye of the storm.

247
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,784
[chuckles]

248
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,286
Aside from what happened
at the restaurant,

249
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,247
- what else did you do?
- Wow.

250
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,290
Why are you assuming it was my fault?

251
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,627
Okay, fine. What did she do to you?

252
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,421
She meddled in my life.

253
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,925
She said she only wanted to help.

254
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,677
So I told her not to.

255
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,221
I think I offended her.

256
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,639
See?

257
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,934
What do you mean?
I'm trying to make it up to her.

258
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,396
It just doesn't work sometimes.

259
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,481
I just don't understand your friend.

260
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,027
It's like she's always angry.
Her code name shouldn't be "sparrow".

261
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,572
- You know what suits her?
- What?

262
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,157
Tasmanian devil.

263
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,326
[chuckling]

264
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,789
You know, Tomas, you should rest up, okay?

265
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,376
Good night.

266
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,504
- Good night.
- [zips close]

267
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,178
[Tomas grunts]

268
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,764
I should just talk to her.

269
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,104
[clears throat]

270
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,942
Knock, knock.

271
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,986
Gab?

272
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,947
- [Gab grunts]
- [Tomas] Knock, knock.

273
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,994
- What?
- Wake up, sleepy.

274
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,287
[chuckles]

275
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,622
I'm just kidding.

276
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,415
Is it okay if I sit here?

277
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,876
You woke me up for that?

278
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,461
No.

279
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,795
Don't be too serious.

280
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,923
[grunts]

281
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,633
It's so dark here, right?

282
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,802
It is. So I need you
to get out of my sight.

283
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,638
Wait. There's something
I need to tell you.

284
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,348
- What?
- I'm not done yet.

285
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,099
- Come on. Don't be angry.
- What?

286
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,145
Well, I just thought…

287
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,441
that this is a dangerous job,
don't you think?

288
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,443
Did you only realize that now?

289
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:41,615
Well, do you want to die with a grudge?

290
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,243
- I don't want to.
- Are you threatening me?

291
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,287
No. That's not what I mean.

292
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,957
What I'm saying is…

293
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,835
maybe you want to apologize to me.

294
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,045
Uh… [scoffs]

295
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,922
Me? You want me to say sorry?

296
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,382
Why not?

297
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,217
Do you need me to recount what happened?

298
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,802
- Okay, sure.
- Okay, I will.

299
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,553
First and foremost,

300
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,889
it's okay if you meddle with my life.

301
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,475
- But it's bad when I do it?
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,394
Come on, apologize, please.

303
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,604
So we can call it quits and I can sleep.

304
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,357
Besides, I know you're pissed
because of the woman

305
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,151
we saw at the restaurant.
The one I told you to talk to.

306
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,654
- That annoyed you.
- You did your recount.

307
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,239
Now I'm going to do a fact-check.

308
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,657
Fact 1.

309
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,659
Yes, I'm mad at that woman.

310
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,537
Fact 2. I don't feel anything for you.

311
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,914
I didn't say you have feelings for me.

312
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,667
No. I meant it literally.

313
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,253
I don't feel annoyed at you or anything.

314
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,171
Whatever. I don't feel anything.

315
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:42,259
I don't plan to waste any emotion on you.
I'm just doing my job.

316
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,885
- Wait.
- What?

317
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,721
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

318
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,433
- Can you smile?
- [scoffs]

319
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,519
[Tomas chuckles]

320
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,608
She's smiling on the inside.

321
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,239
[grunts]

322
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,325
Mission success.

323
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,744
[exhales]

324
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,707
Miguel, are you good?

325
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,335
Yes, I'm okay.

326
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,128
Were you able to rest?

327
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,005
- Yes.
- Well…

328
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,299
any update?

329
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,177
[exhales deeply]

330
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,888
[clicks tongue]

331
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,058
Here.

332
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,645
The village looks to be deep asleep.

333
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,233
We should pass through it now.

334
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,153
Good.

335
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,947
It's time to move.

336
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,077
<i>We're five kilometers away</i>
<i>from the target's house.</i>

337
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,703
<i>If we go through the south entrance,</i>

338
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,080
<i>we'll face a lot of enemies.</i>

339
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,414
<i>But we're already here.</i>

340
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,750
<i>It will take us three hours</i>
<i>to go the other way.</i>

341
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,418
<i>JB, it's your call.</i>

342
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,130
<i>I spot two hostiles. Stay alert.</i>

343
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,466
<i>We do this quietly.</i>

344
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,220
<i>Get in, we eliminate the target</i>
<i>without alerting his men, we get out.</i>

345
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,639
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>
