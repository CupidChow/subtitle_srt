Tomas, maybe you should
skip the next contract?

00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,492
Take some time to recover first,

34
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,661
make sure you've healed up completely.

35
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,498

Grandma, please calm down.

- Where is he?

- Stay still.
- Okay.

- Get him some water.
- Okay.

68
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,588
So, how did it go?

69
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,926
We went to Cristy.

70
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,178
- Oh?
- She's impossible to talk to.

71
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,972
She just kept going in circles.

72
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,350
She didn't give us

73
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,604
any details about Jun's death.

74
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,732
She didn't give you anything?

75
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,027
Nothing. She said we'd need
some sort of… clearance.

76
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,612
- Clearance.
- …clearance.

77
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,615
- Why would they need that?
- Yes.

78
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,283
She already give me Jun's photo?

79
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,078
- Exactly…
- That's why I'm suspicious.

80
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,371
Grandma tried talking to her,

81
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,414
but she wouldn't even look her in the eye.

82
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,751
And then she told us to come back.

83
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,961
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,838
[Luis] What's that about?
Sounds like laziness to me.

85
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,341
They say they're doing their job,

86
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,760
but they're just wasting time.

87
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,055
They don't care about what
other people are going through.

88
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,308
I don't like to judge,

89
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,270

I'll handle it myself.

[Luis] Okay, Andres.

94
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,281
Okay.

95
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,535
So you've been calling this,
Joris guy since we were in Kaigen,

96
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,955
and he hasn't even sent
you a message with an update?

97
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,916
And now he's not answering your calls?

98
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,753
He's suddenly disappeared.

99
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,964
His phone's unreachable now.

100
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,510
Because it's out of coverage or
because his number's inactive?

101

[patrons chatter indistinctly]

[dramatic music sting]

105
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,604
but I have a bad feeling…

106
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,107
he has no intention
of fixing your dad's case.

[ominous music playing]

108
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,865
I think he ran off with the money.

[ominous music continues]

110
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,874

I'm sorry for the delay,

114
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,930

[office workers chatter indistinctly]

119
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,611
Yes. According to the records,

120
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,948
they tried taking him
to the hospital, but…

121
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,953
- his body was already too weak.
- He was brought here?

122
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,747

123
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,582
[Cristy] Um… Yes. Um…

124
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,627
Unfortunately, the hospital
has since shut down.

125
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,753
Mm.

Yes, sir.

129
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,640
You can visit, but as far as I know…

130
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,352
the cemetery's layout
has changed over time.

I'm sorry, sir.

I know this wasn't what your
family wanted to hear, but…

this is all I could find
about your brother.

Yes.

I picked him up here the last time we met.

I'll find him.

I can hack the system
of cameras within the city

152

so we can track him down.

If he hasn't left the country,

I'll have a hold departure order
issued against him.

But I never let anyone hack me to pieces.

00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,381
- You brat.
- Ow! [grunts] Don't do that!

179
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,926
Be honest with me. Who did that do you?

180
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,178
You always come home injured,

181
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,597
lugging bundles of cash.

182
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,349
Did you join a syndicate?

183
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,185
Syndicate?! No! What makes you think that?

184
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,272
Are you a hitman? Gun for hire, no?

185
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,858
No, Uncle. [scoffs]

186
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,028
[slurps]

187
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,739
I'm not stupid.

188
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,992
I know how those things work.

189
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,953
- And I have no plans of stopping you.
- [sentimental music playing]

190
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,871
That's your life.

191
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:45,793
Now, if you're out there
sending people to hell,

192
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,170
I hope they're demons who deserve it.

193
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,840
[sighs deeply]

194
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,675
Geez, Uncle.

195
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,637
You know what?
I'm hungry. Do you have any food?

196
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,224
You should've gotten some
takeout on your way home.

197
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,809
Takeout again?

198
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:05,813
- I'll heat some leftovers.
- Quit eating takeout

199
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,064
and fast food.

200
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,524
You know that's bad for you.

201
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,817
Ow.

202
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,652
[sighs deeply]

203
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,822
[sentimental music fades]

204
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,243
[birds chirping]

205
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,708
[sighs sharply]

206
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,628
That Shari sure is shameless.

207
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,470
[inhales deeply, sighs loudly]

208
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,306
[both panting]

209
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,308
Sorry, sorry.

210
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,227
I know you don't want bad vibes.

211
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,687
[clears throat]

212
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,230
[inhales deeply]

213
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,275
Okay, fine.
Let's just talk about happy memories.

214
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,986
[panting]

215
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,821
[rain patters]

216
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,033
Do you want to reminisce about
the day Mama gave you to me?

217
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,117
[chuckles]

218
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,414
She said I can no longer have siblings,

219
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,875
so she got you for me.

220
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,837
She named you "Bud" and "Dy",

221
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,882
so I'd have buddies
for when she's not around.

222
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,098
Do you miss Mama too?

223
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,101
[panting]

224
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,103
[pensive music playing]

225
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,687
Yeah, I miss her too.

226
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,065
Every day.

227
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,528
[inhales deeply]

228
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,530
[sighs]

229
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:42,952
[pensive music continues]

230
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,746
No, you don't miss Dad.

231
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,998
[Bud whimpers quietly]

232
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,544
No, no.

233
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,586
No!

234
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,338
You're only allowed to miss Mama.

235
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,717
I have a plan, okay?

236
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,179
We'll prove to Dad that Shari
is only after his money.

237
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,973
[Dy whimpers]

238
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,391
[Gab chuckles softly]

239
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:13,566
[pensive music continues]

240
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:27,246
[pensive music continues]

241
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,081
<i>Hi, Doc.</i>

242
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,837
<i>How are you?</i>

243
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,839
[phone swooshes]

244
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,058
[both panting]

245
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,894
[pensive music fades]

246
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,563
As kind as an angel? Check!

247
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,816
Pretty? Check!

248
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,402
- Go on, find her profile.
- Wait, Uncle.

249
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,571
Calm down. I'm on it.
What's her name again?

250
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,156
Her name is Agnes.

251
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,741
- Agnes…
- Agnes Miller!

252
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,117
- Miller?
- Yeah.

253
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,536
- [Tomas] Here.
- [Uncle] Yeah, that's her!

254
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,456
- [Tomas] Whoa. [chuckles]
- [Uncle] That's my friend's daughter.

255
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,166
- See what I mean?
- Yeah.

256
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,127
- Go on, let's see her profile.
- Okay, okay.

257
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,296
Check her out. Well?

258
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,425
LOOKING FOR VOLUNTEERS FOR OUR
UPCOMING OUTREACH PROGRAM…

259
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,052
[Uncle] What do you think?

260
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,930
- She even has an outreach program.
- Yeah.

261
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:31,018
She's very beautiful and kind.
What do you think?

262
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,853
Agnes is perfect.

263
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,772
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

264
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,400
Why are you checking things off the list?

265
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,486
- Well, of course.
- Is that necessary?

266
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,697
After all the things you've given me,

267
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,616
this is my gift for you.

268
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,201
Oh, that's sweet.

269
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,619
- Right?
- Yeah.

270
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,037
Alright.

271
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,456
I'm just planning your date.

272
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,791
What date?

273
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,001
I'm actually worried

274
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,545
because my reputation is on the line.

275
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,754
Don't mess up.

276
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,048
Oh, wow. Just look at this face.

277
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,842
- What can go wrong?
- So confident, huh?

278
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,637
Ouch! Uncle, it hurts.

279
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,846
[groans]

280
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,140
- There we go.
- [grunts]

281
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,351
[groans]

282
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,229
[Uncle grunts in concentration]

283
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,568
- Hey. Is that Attorney Pretty?
- [curious music playing]

284
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,528
Hmm?

285
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,365
Hang on. Be honest with me.

286
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,577
What's the actual deal
between you and her?

287
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,787
- Huh?
- What?

288
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,372
Are you together now?

289
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,958
What a question, Uncle!

290
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,084
Good one.

291
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,460
You know…

292
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,045
Just answer me.

293
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:46,010
Tell me, is Attorney Pretty
your girlfriend already?

294
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,596
- [scoffs]
- I need to know.

295
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,515
- So I can cancel your date with Agnes.
- [curious music continues]

296
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,934
- [sighs]
- Look.

297
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,436
I don't want any complications.

298
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,854
That's not good.

299
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,607
Uncle, don't worry. I'm single, alright?

300
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,650
So I'm okay with this whole date thing.

301
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,737
- Okay.
- Count me in.

302
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,363
Are you sure?

303
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,865
She's so pretty.

304
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,576
- Okay.
- Right?

305
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,912
[both chuckle]

306
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,288
You're mine.

307
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,331
[Uncle] Mm-hmm.

308
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,249
You're mine now.

309
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,542
[Tomas chuckles]

310
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,919
[curious music fades]

311
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,755
- [cicadas chirping]
- [Miguel slurps, gulps]

312
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,965
That guy's a bastard.

313
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,800
[Miguel exhales loudly]

314
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,386
Yeah.

315
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,097
But…

316
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,476
I've already taken care of it.

317
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,521
What matters is that my family is safe.

318
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,107
[exhales sharply]

319
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,571
But Andres, to be honest…

320
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,202
it's not easy to be away from them.

321
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,245
Of course.

322
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,124
But…

323
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,793
it's for the best.

324
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,965
Because I've got so many things
to fix about myself.

325
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,091
You know what I mean?

326
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,260
I owe it to myself

327
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,347
to be a better version of myself.

328
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,391
You know,

329
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,976
for my loved ones.

330
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,771
[sighs]

331
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,773
Nobody can save me…

332
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,318
but myself, right?

333
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,486
That's true.

334
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,615
[breathes deeply]

335
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,452
[pensive music playing]

336
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,495
How about you?

337
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,040
Any update about your brother?

338
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,168
Well…

339
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,879
I've got the documents.

340
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,676
But I really don't believe it.

341
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,057
If I were in your shoes,
I wouldn't either.

342
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,103
I'm just worried about my grandma.

343
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:06,650
[pensive music continues]

344
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,777
Is that why you don't want to go home yet?

345
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,533
You're not ready
to show her the documents.

346
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,536
Exactly.

347
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,206
[Miguel sighs deeply]

348
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,462
[phone buzzing]

349
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,382
- Oh, here goes.
- Hang in there.

350
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,553
- [buzzing continues]
- [pensive music fades]

351
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,722
So, have you talked to Cristy?

352
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,015
What did she say?

353
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,267
Did she give you the documents?

354
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,936
It's late. Why aren't you back yet?
Where are you?

355
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,647
<i>What… what did you find out about Jun?</i>

356
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,943
Uh, I talked to her, Grandma.

357
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,820
I'll just tell you when I get home.

358
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,197
I'm on my way back.

359
