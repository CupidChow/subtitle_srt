[chuckles] <i>I didn't forget anything.</i>
<i>You know me.</i>

194

[unsettling music playing]

195
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,762

197
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:52,438

Help me. Help me. Help…

207
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,734
[Jake] Help me.

208
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,319

[Jack grunts softly]

214
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,390
We saw him beaten up badly.

215
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,016
[sniffles, exhales heavily]

216
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,143
He was asking for help,

217
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,564
but… I killed him so
we could get the money.

218

[beeps]

222
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,917
So that's why you dragged me in, huh?

223
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,546
To cover up all your mess.

224
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,048
All because of that.

225
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,217
Huh?

226
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,848
Where's Edward Zamora?

227
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,018
At the hideout.

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,151
[Jack] I'll follow your lead.

230
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,446
If you're lying to me,

231
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,073
I'll do what you did.

232
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:12,119
[foreboding music continues]

233
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,623
I'll kill your entire family. Got it?

234
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,707
Yes.

235
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,669
It's true… I'm telling the truth.

236
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,129
Miguel. It's true.

237
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,175
[breathing heavily]

238
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,217
Okay.

239
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:33,766
[foreboding music continues]

240
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,309

Miguel…

247
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,039
Where are you going? Miguel!

248
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,540
Miguel, where are you going?!

249
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:06,966
[foreboding music intensifies]

He hasn't gone far.
He'll still be around here.

- [JB] Wolf!
- [Max] Wolf!

261
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,296
Where's the target?

262
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,633
Kenji got away again.

263
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,843
Someone's following us. Let's hide here.
