Do you have any medicine?

37
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,510
We need help. One of ours is wounded.

38
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,345
Just help in any way you can

39
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,098

are in those bags.

You don't have to
work for them anymore.

- Come on. Let's go.
- What? No… No.

Hurry. Get up.

We're going to get it back.

Hey, Emer!

94
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,726
Is money all that matters to you now?

95
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,770
Why, Rita?

96
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,565
Isn't money the reason you
didn't want to leave?

97
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,568
You said we wouldn't have a life
outside sitio.

98
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,030
Yeah, but that was before.
It's different now.

The situation is different now.

100

How is it any different?

101
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,827
I joined them for the same reason!

102

You don't have to do this anymore.
Let's just go. Come…

103

You don't understand, Rita!

104
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,545
As long as I'm with them,
they can protect us.

105
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,548
As long as we follow them,
we'll get rewards, money--

106

No, we have to get out of here now, Emer!

I said no!

108
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,513
I need to prove myself to them.

- We have to move.
- But the money…

Come on. Careful.

00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,339
Keep your eyes peeled.

[male hiker] Hey! You lost?

153
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,921
I heard Mt. Talimba
is a really challenging climb.

00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,882
Some hikers never make it back.

155
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,387
Are you part of this
mountain's security team?

156
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,016
Yes. And we're not lost.

157
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,684
Turn that off.

158

[flashlight clicks]

159
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,231
What if my companions and I are lost?

160
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,441
We could really use your help to get home.

161
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,567
[footsteps approaching]

162
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,069

00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,954
We're already lost.
Why did you wander off on… your own.

167
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,539
I can't help it, Vince.

168
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,707
Two beautiful girls in
the middle of the forest?

169

Uh, they're part of
Mt. Talimba's security team.

173
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,764
- Oh.
- Well, maybe you could help us.

174
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,057
Listen.

175
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,059
It's not safe to go down at this hour.

176
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,478
Just stay here.
We'll come back for you tomorrow.

177
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,480
Well, you see…

178
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,357
We were caught in the rain.

179
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,859
No, actually, we chose to
try hiking in the rain.

180
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,320
We've been climbing mountains
for a long time now.

181
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,865
So now, we're trying out
more challenging ones. Right, bro?

182
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,951
Yeah, and I guess people were right.

183
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,995
Mt. Talimba sure is a difficult climb.

184
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,165
By the way, I'm Vince. You've met Franco.

185
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,584
This is Aira.

186
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,961
Look, just stay here.

187
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,131
Like what my partner said,

188
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,133
we'll come back for you tomorrow.

189
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,926
We'll guide you down the mountain.

190
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,054
[uneasy music fades]

191
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,640
[Amado breathing heavily]

192
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,936
- [liquid squirting]
- [screaming in pain]

193
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,438
Damn those monsters!

194
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,772
[Amado moaning]

195
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,857
Relax.

196
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,737
You'll make the pain worse
if you keep moving. Stay still.

197
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,030
[groans]

198
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,949
[breathing heavily]

199
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,244
- I'm almost done.
- [groaning]

200
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,246
[groans]

201
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,831
[Franco]
You haven't even told us your names yet.

202
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,833
[Vince]
Dude, they said we should stay here.

203
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,211
Um, sorry, but…

204
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,255
What are in those
huge bags you're carrying?

205
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,300
Are they camping tents? Ours got ruined.

206
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,594
Yeah, maybe you could set it up.

207
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,389
We can share.
I don't mind sleeping with you.

208
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,728
[foreboding music playing]

209
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,104
Oh, let me help you with that.

210
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,148
Don't. I'm good.

211
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,859
Okay, alright, uh…

212
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,279
- What should I call you?
- Didn't you hear what we said?

213
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,990
We'll come back for you.

214
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,202
So if you want to set up camp,
just do it there.

215
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,745
Away from us. Please.

216
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,831
Look, we still have to patrol the area

217
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,458
to keep you guys safe.

218
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,545
So, just stay the night here.

219
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,590
It'll be easier for you
to go down the mountain

220
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,384
once the sun is out tomorrow.

221
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,094
Okay?

222
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,513
Okay.

223
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,014
We'll stay here, ma'am.

224
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:30,064

[body thuds]

241
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,510
Shark! What do we do?!

242
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,346
[distant gunshots]

243
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,684

Sir, are you okay?

265
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,082
[panting]

266
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,124
I'm okay.

267
00:13:54,208 --> 00:14:00,631
[suspenseful music continues]

268
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,633
Let's go, Tomas.

269
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,426
[Tomas pants heavily]

270
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,513
[dramatic music sting]

271
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:12,059
[Gab] Geez! Thank god
they're out of our hair!

272
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,229
They're so annoying.
Especially that Franco.

273
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,147
He thinks you'll like him?

274
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,566
- [Gab scoffs]
- [Max] Huh? Me?

275
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,901
It's obvious he's got the hots for you.

276
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,028
- Didn't you notice it?
- [Max] Seriously?

277
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,154
Yeah.

278
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,699
He kept pestering us because
he wants to make a move on you.

279
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,494
- You're jumping to conclusions.
- No, seriously.

280
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,290
He kept asking for your name. So annoying.

281
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,918
If he wasn't so arrogant
and we're not on a mission,

282
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,296
he'd be the perfect guy
to help you move on.

283
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,090
Who knows what will happen
if you give him a chance?

284
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,174
Hmm?

285
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,053
- Enough of that nonsense.
- [Gab chuckles]

286
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,974
- [crickets chirping]
- [fire crackling]

287
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,519
[Franco] Dude.

288
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,439
I saw something inside their bags.

289
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,524
- What?
- Cash.

290
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,734
Bills.

291
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,236
That's not surprising, right?

292
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,196
No, you don't get it.

293
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,198
The whole bag is filled with cash.

294
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,201
The whole bag?

295
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,912
It looked like it.

296
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,997
But, I'm not sure.

297
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,042
But, dude, bills were
sticking out from the bag.

298
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,462
They didn't want
help carrying them, right?

299
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,088
Maybe that's the reason why.

300
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,591
If that is true,

301
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,928
why would they bring that amount
of cash into this kind of place?

302
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,640
Are you saying they're not really part
of the mountain's security team?

303
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,767
How would you explain their guns?

304
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,353
I don't know.

305
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,898
- Whatever their reason is,
- [dramatic music playing]

306
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,650
I don't care.

307
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,026
I only want one thing.

308
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,987
[Vince laughs]

309
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,365
- Franco--
- Look, bro.

310
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,408
Don't you want it too?

311
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,162
Remember, your firm
is hanging by a thread.

312
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,332
As for me, I need money
for my business.

313
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,251
How about you, Aira?

314
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,004
You had to sell your house, right?

315
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,425
[dramatic music continues]

316
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,642

- [insects chirping]
- [footsteps thud]

319
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,778
[Gab] Hold on.

320
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,532
[Gab breathing heavily]

321
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,575
I'm beat, Max.

322
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,035
Can we rest for a bit?

323
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,996
[sighs sharply]

324
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,457
- This place seems safe.
- You think so?

325
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,544
Okay. Let's spend the night here.

326
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,586
Okay.

327
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,296
- Thanks.
- [Max] Let's take turns keeping watch.

328
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,673
Okay.

329
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:54,763
[foreboding music playing]

330
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,225
Rest up. I'll keep watch first.

331
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,601
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

332
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,438
[Gab sighs] Perfect. Thank you, Max.

333
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,856
I'll make it up to you later.

334
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:12,406
[foreboding music intensifies, fades]

335
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,659
[insects chirping]

336
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,497
- I'm almost done.
- [groans]

337
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:25,544
- [breathes heavily, groans]
- Alright. It's secured.

338
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:31,341
Take him to the hospital
first thing in the morning

339
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,385
[Amado breathes rapidly]

340
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,095
so he can get proper treatment.

341
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,806
Otherwise, he'll die from blood loss.

342
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,099
For his medicine.

343
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,351
[Amado groans]

344
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,020
[bag zipping]

345
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,271
Thank you.

346
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,568
Again, take him to the hospital

347
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,695
if you want him to live.

348
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,280
Understood.

349
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:05,626
[Amado groaning, breathing heavily]

350
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,128
[Elder] Thank you so much.

351
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,838
[Andres] Thank you too.

352
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,131
[Elder] Take care.

353
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,508
- You too.
- You're welcome.

354
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,885
Andres, we have to hurry.

355
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,888
- We can't waste any more time.
- Yes, yes.

356
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,856
[Miguel pants heavily]

357
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:35,322
[suspenseful music playing]

358
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,116
They better watch out.

359
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,078
Let's go. Hurry.

360
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:46,834

[chuckles]

363

And we'll take those bags as a bonus.

365

No hard feelings, alright?

366
