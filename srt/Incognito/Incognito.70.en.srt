<i>- Please?</i>

00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,842

<i>Please, Handsome.</i>

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,765

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,019
<i>Yes, I promise.</i>

10
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,478

<i>How did you find out all of this?</i>

13
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:30,196

14
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,242
<i>Miguel, I'm planning</i>

15

<i>Okay. I think it's for the best.</i>

16
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,122
<i>No, no, no. There's something wrong.</i>

17
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>You even had the entire house</i>

18
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,254
<i>and now you're okay with us leaving?</i>

19

<i>I have a new job for your group.</i>

20
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,341
<i>I'm sorry, sir. I would have to decline.</i>

21
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,927
<i>Is that why you turned down</i>
<i>the kidnap-for-ransom contract?</i>

22
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>You probably thought</i>
<i>it wasn't connected to him.</i>

23
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,390

There's just one thing that bothers me.

27

- Isabel Escalera said something to Andres.
- [unsettling music playing]

00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,083
Raven is alive.

Okay, good.

Do you see the woman

[Rafael] Okay.

Hold it.

[Rafael] Feel the heat.

Embrace it.

Where's the yoga instructor?

Tomas, answer me.

Relax, okay?

You have to report everything to me.

But can you just check the camera?

73
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,538
I'm struggling over here,

No noise allowed here!

Max.

84
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:55,211
I know that look.
You have something to say to me.

85
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,046
Just say it.

86
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,590
It's nothing, really.

87
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,385
I just wanted to check on you.

[patrons chatter indistinctly]

Here.

91
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,404
They asked me to give you these cupcakes.

- [JB chuckles]

93
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,366
Thank you.

94

You know,

95
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,956
they're really worried about you.

96
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,500
Actually, even me.

97
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,920
I mean,

98
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,965
- after what happened--
- Because of what happened to my dad.

[soft music continues]

100
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,637
I'm okay, Max.

101
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,099
For now, I'm managing.

102

[Max] Thank you.

103

Here you go.

104
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,318
Do you want extra cream or sugar?

[soft music continues]

106
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,995
It just reminded me of Sevi.

107
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,206
He stopped asking,

108
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,292
he'd just add cream and sugar.

109
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,212
He said he was good at making coffee…

110
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,049
so I just let him,

111
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,638
even though sometimes
I actually wanted it black.

These go well with coffee,

115
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,456
no doubt about it.

116
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,999
- [chuckles softly]
- [utensil clinks]

117
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,586
Exactly. And as they say,

118
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,714
sweets make people happy.

119
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,843

And…

122
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,686
Whoo… Hold.

Look, he's touching the…
He's touching the…

127
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,912
[Rafael] And release…

128
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,706
- He's touching her…
- Perfect.

129
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,253
Oh, wait. No, I got it wrong. My bad.

130
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,218
It's okay. It's fine.
There's still more later. Yeah.

131
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,805
Just make sure

Where is it?
I can't see anything. What is this?

134
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,814
Fix your body cam!

Nothing, just butts. What is this?

138
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,117
There it is, see? I'm fixing it now.

139
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,161
Tomas, get it right, okay?

140
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,996
[Rafael] Almost there…

141

Good job!

Nice.

[Tomas] He's smiling at me too.

147
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,847
- [Tomas] Yeah.
- Okay, and…

148
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,182
Release…

I just feel a bit dizzy.

166
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,849
I'll just step outside for a bit

Don't leave! We haven't
gathered any evidence yet.

00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,510
Ugh! You're as annoying as ever!

183
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,595
Ugh!

184
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,764
- Have some water first.
- My goodness.

185
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,474
[Tomas breathing heavily]

186
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,560
[Rafael] You okay? Do you need a medic?

187
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,146
I told you to lose the shirt.

188
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,107
- No need. I'll be fine.
- Really?

189
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,318
- I feel better now.
- [Rafael] Okay.

190
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,402
[Rafael] You sure?

191
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,780
Phew.

192
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,782
[knocking on door]

193
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,826
- [Luis] Grandma.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,036
[Luis] We're back.

195
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,871
[Esang] Oh, come in.

196
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,456
- Hey.
- Grandma.

197
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,665
[Esang] Alright.

198
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,959
[Andres groaning]

199
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,628
- I'll take care of it.
- Alright.

200
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,920
[phone chimes]

201
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,300
Hey, who is it?

202
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,260
Is it the captain?

203
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,470
Take a look.

204
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:43,059
[stirring music playing]

205
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,519
Oh, it's really from the captain!

206
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,563
- Mm-hmm.
- He finally replied?

207
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,652
Does that mean we'll finally find Jun?

208
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,569
[Luis] Whoa!

209
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,906
Hold on.

210
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,991
I'll message him.

211
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,787
You really fainted?

212
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,873
I didn't faint, I almost did.

213
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,250
Good thing Shari was there.

214
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,461
She saved me and gave me water.

215
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,004
Okay. And?

216
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,840
Well, here I am, still alive.

217
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,258
I'm not asking about you.

218
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,762
I'm asking how Shari
and her yoga instructor acted.

219
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,679
Nothing.

220
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,640
They weren't sweet with each other?

221
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,849
No.

222
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,476
What--[scoffs]

223
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,938
So, they're good at hiding it, huh?

224
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,481
Well…

225
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,691
Shari seems nice.

226
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,277
- What did you say?
- [quirky music playing]

227
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,612
- She's nice?
- Yeah.

228
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,489
Just because she gave you some water?

229
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,241
She didn't just give me water.

230
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,077
She even held the bottle for me.

231
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,329
[laughs]
And she's actually pretty up close.

232
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,206
[laughs]

233
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,084
Look, all I'm saying is…

234
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,878
they don't seem
to be doing anything suspicious.

235
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,630
They both seem nice.

236
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,049
- Okay.
- Yeah.

237
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,011
- You know, Gab…
- [quirky music continues]

238
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,596
you're too judgmental.

239
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,557
- What did you say?
- I'm not finished.

240
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,641
You're too judgmental.

241
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,686
She's not doing anything wrong.
She's just doing yoga,

242
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,729
but you keep
thinking bad things about her.

243
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,022
You know, if I were you,

244
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,859
you should really get rid
of that nasty attitude--

245
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,194
What if I get rid of you instead?

246
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,405
The nerve of you to call me judgmental!

247
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,573
- Hey, wait!
- [scoffs]

248
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,283
I'll never forgive you for this!

249
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,617
Come on.

250
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,286
- Judgmental, huh?
- I'm just saying--

251
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,745
- Jerk!
- Gab!

252
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,706
[quirky music playing]

- [engine starting]
- [knocking on car door]

[engine revving]

255
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,840
[quirky music ends]

256
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,634
Yes, Captain.

257
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,929
Thank you so much. This is a big help.

258
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,515
Yes, be careful.

259
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,934
Thank you again.

260
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,604
So, what did he say?

261
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,772
Cristine Cunanan.

262
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,066
She's a social worker at BSWP.

263
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,612
Bureau of Social Welfare and Protection?

264
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,490
So, Jun was taken there?

265
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,782
That's what he said.

266
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,828
T-That means Jun is alive!

267
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,288
[soft music playing]

268
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,248
We'll finally see him again!

269
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,375
I have a feeling he's alive, Grandma.

270
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,544
[both laugh]

271
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,088
We'll finally see Jun!

272
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,798
Hey, Luis!

273
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,842
- [Esang] Come join us!
- [Andres] Come on!

274
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,221
- Let me join!
- Yeah, you're also family!

275
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,348
- [chuckling]
- Finally--Oh, sorry.

276
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,476
- I'm okay.
- We'll finally see Jun!

277
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,810
Oh, Jun…

278
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,688
- [chuckling]
- Thank you, God.

279
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,607
[Miguel clears throat]

280
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,741
- [taps]
- "I'm on my way."

281
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,080
[exhales deeply]

282
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,421
Miguel Tecson?

283
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,300
You're under arrest for
the murder of Jake dela Cuesta.

284
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,427
- [foreboding music playing]
- That again?

285
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,679
Haven't I told you?

286
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,182
- I had nothing to do with it--
- You were captured on CCTV

287
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,684
near the crime scene,

288
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,186
which contradicts your alibi.

289
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,105
I really had nothing to do with it.

290
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,439
[officer] Handcuff him.

291
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,440
[Miguel sighs]

292
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,192
[foreboding music continues]

293
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,362
You're under arrest for murder.

294
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,240
You have the right to remain silent.

295
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,994
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

296
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,453
in a court of law.

297
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,123
You have the right to an attorney.

298
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,585
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

299
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,587
Is that clear?

300
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,922
Christine.

301
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,757
Don't.

302
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:45,926
Christine.

303
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,761
Listen to me.

304
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,014
Go back to our son.

305
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,392
- I'm serious.
- What are you talking about?!

306
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,687
Christine…
Wait. I'm still talking to her!

307
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,691
Go back to Mickey.
Don't take your eyes off him.

308
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,568
Keep an eye on Mickey, please.

309
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,028
You're out of your mind!

310
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,487
Of course, I'll go back to Mickey,

311
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,073
but after I make sure you go to jail.

312
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,075
- Take him.
- Christine, please.

313
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,370
I'm not kidding, Christine.
Take care of Mickey.

314
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,998
Go back to him!

315
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,501
[music turns dramatic]

316
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,338
Boss, we waited until morning,

317
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,131
but nothing.

318
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,717
[dramatic music continues]

319
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,801
"Nothing"

320
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,765
Of course, nothing.

321
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,059
He got arrested.

322
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,311
He's now in jail.

323
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,897
The cops beat you to it.

324
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,734
If Tecson rats us out,

325
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,112
it'll be the end of our group.

326
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:54,203
Why don't we just show the video
of him fleeing the crime scene?

327
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,580
That will solve our problem.

328
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,710
Oh, really? Are you dumb?!

329
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,587
You're stupid!

330
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,134
We need the money, okay?

331
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,929
Because if we fail to get it back,

332
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,432
we'll get in trouble with our bosses.

333
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,811
Do you understand?

334
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,939
[dramatic music continues]

335
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,023
Yes, boss.

336
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,484
What's our plan, boss?

337
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,488
[dramatic music intensifies]

338
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,991
Go to his ex-wife's house.

339
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,494
That way, we'll know what's happening.

340
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,997
[dramatic music crescendos]

341
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,209
How are you, JB? Any news?

342
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,586
Still the same.

343
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,672
I'm okay.

344
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,010
That's good. I have news.

345
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,803
Good news, actually.

346
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,056
I found this program in the US

347
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,017
called cutting-edge gene therapy.

348
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,602
It's for patients like you.

349
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,397
What kind of therapy is it, Trina?

350
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,150
Is it another clinical trial?

351
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,862
But this time, it has promising results.

352
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,115
It can stop the progression
of your disease.

353
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,786
[somber music playing]

354
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,913
I know it's not a cure,

355
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,624
but it's a great help
for your quality of life.

356
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,172
So, US?

357
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,049
Mm-hmm.

358
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,886
You'll stay there for a year
for therapy and follow-up.

359
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,348
One year?

360
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,018
[somber music continues]

361
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,604
It's still your decision, JB.

362
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:47,608
But I want you to know all your options.

363
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,906
[somber music fades]

364
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,326
- Greg, this is--
- General Nocum.

365
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,410
Of course, sir.

366
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,663
We have a contract for your group.

367
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:07,169
Sir, if this is about the
kidnap for ransom operation,

368
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,713
my answer remains the same.

369
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:16,011
You know, I was thinking
you rejected the contract

370
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,888
because it was too small.

371
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,767
But Greg, this is
a high-priority operation.

372
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,522
[unsettling music playing]

373
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,023
Kenji Lee.

374
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,151
He murdered Benicio Avila,

375
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,694
a prominent senator

376
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,031
and was rumored to run for presidency.

377
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,617
And now, he's on the run.

378
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,954
Last I heard he was hiding in Kaigen.

379
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,126
Greg, he's a wanted criminal,
but we need him alive.

380
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:54,091
[unsettling music continues]

381
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,717
[chair scrapes]

382
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,469
- Gentlemen.
- Look.

383
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,348
If we fail to bring Lee home,

384
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:07,396
we won't know the motive
and mastermind behind Avila's death.

385
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,525
He has information that could
change the election's outcome.

386
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,613
Greg, this is not just about one man.

387
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,366
This isn't about Avila.

388
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,370
This is for our country.

389
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:30,460
[music turns suspenseful]

390
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,343
<i>It's getting harder, JB.</i>

391
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,096
<i>I'll find a way. I'll get you out of here.</i>

392
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,264
<i>So, you're telling me,</i>

393
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,100
<i>there's a possibility</i>
<i>I could get reinstated in service?</i>

394
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,436
<i>This is Kenji Lee,</i>
<i>a highly-trained assassin.</i>

395
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,938
<i>This is a capture mission.</i>
<i>We need him alive.</i>

396
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,356
<i>That is, if we bring him alive</i>

397
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,608
<i>together with the information he has.</i>

398
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,818
<i>We're not just going to face a killer.</i>

399
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,321
<i>I'm sure there's a huge</i>
<i>organization operating there.</i>

400
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,200
- [whooshing]
- [kick lands]

401
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,243
<i>He's here in Kaigen.</i>
