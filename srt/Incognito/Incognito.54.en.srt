You stole this from my house

At first, I didn't understand you, Max.

35
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,552
To be honest with you,

36
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,930
I'm mad at you.

37
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,475

I don't want to forget him.

Have you heard the news?

Emil is still locked up, right?

74
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:24,180
But he's selling the land
he stole from us.

75
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,766
He's selling it?

76
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,101
Yes.

77
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,812
I just talked to Domeng.

78
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,607
If only…

79
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:41,698
we had the money to buy back the land?

that one day…

83
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,710
we'll be able to return there.

84
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,382
Then Junjun can come back to us.

And on that land…

[voice breaks] you, me, and Junjun…

87
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,103

No, I can't.

Holding on to Sevi's ghost is like…

losing the chance to move forward.

109
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,174

Is it your birthday?

Where have you been?

Nowhere special, just wandering around.

You know me, I'm always around.

You're here too?

Oh.

Nice makeup. What happened to you?

169
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,485
Uh, I got jumped…

[Miguel sighs]

187
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,768
But seriously, Miguel.

188
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,646
What really happened to your face?

189
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,399
I'm telling you the truth.

190
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,776
I got jumped.

191
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,988
But I let them.

192
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,156
- Ooh…
- I pretended to be…

193
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,200
weak.

194
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:44,458
Honestly, I'm getting tired
of always being strong.

195
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,168
[Tomas chuckles]

196
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,379
[Tomas] Really? I don't buy that.

197
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,047
I feel like you beat them up

198
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,882
and then treated their wounds after.

199
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,967
[chuckles]

200
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,385
[Miguel] Exactly.

201
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,970
[Tomas chuckles]

202
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,639
[Miguel clears throat]

203
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,350
[Andres] Uh…

204
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,063
There's something I need to say.

205
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,483
It's about our last mission.

206
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,907
Yeah, we have a lot
of questions about that.

207
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,245
[inhales deeply]

208
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,330
I made a mistake.

209
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,249
We did.

210
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,461
We made a mistake.

211
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,339
- [fire crackles]
- [cicadas chirping]

212
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,133
Me too.

213
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,641
We're the ones who broke into

214
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,768
the Escalera's house
to get the hard drive.

215
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,899
We kept that from you.

216
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,111
And from Contractor.

217
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,657
That's why the mission got messed up.

218
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,744
[breathes deeply]

219
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,330
[beer swishes]

220
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,504
I'm doing this to…

221
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,925
apologize, to all of you.

222
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,433
I'm sorry too, JB and Max.

223
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,230
It's okay.

224
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,272
[sniffles]

225
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,483
Just…

226
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,404
don't let it happen again, okay?

227
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,449
- [fire crackles]
- [cicadas chirping]

228
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,162
It won't happen again, Miguel.

229
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,748
That was my last contract.

230
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,669
I'm leaving the group.

231
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:59,593
[foreboding music playing]

232
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,930
Wow.

233
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,014
[scoffs]

234
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:12,231
[foreboding music continues]

235
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,191
You're leaving just like that?

236
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,359
[inhales deeply]

237
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,569
But damn.

238
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,531
You three broke into
the Escalera's safehouse?

239
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,284
That's insane.

240
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,369
You didn't even take me with you.

241
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,454
I'm jealous.

242
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,080
I wish you had at least included me.

243
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:32,877
While I was out stealing dogs,
you guys were doing the real action.

244
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,255
Don't be like us.

245
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,923
You want to get on
the Contractor's bad side?

246
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,008
I don't care about that.

247
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,385
- Wow!
- [Tomas] You want me to call him now?

248
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,512
- [Max] Oh, so brave.
- Hi, Contractor!

249
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,016
- [chuckles]
- He's not coming.

250
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,393
- He's not here.
- You got scared, didn't you?

251
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,020
- Me? Scared?
- [Gab] Yeah.

252
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,813
- [Max] He got nervous.
- I did not--

253
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,190
Me? Nervous?

254
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,232
[scoffs]

255
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,442
That's nothing to me.

256
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,570
Honestly, sir, even if I
weren't in this kind of work,

257
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,324
I'd still be living a dangerous life.

258
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,492
Right?

259
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,245
I mean, what debt collector
doesn't risk his life?

260
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,999
But ever since I joined this group,

261
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:17,129
I realized that, even if I die early,

262
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,007
even if I die first,

263
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,594
it's okay because
at least I'll die fighting.

264
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,434
- [fire crackling]
- [cicadas chirping]

265
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,020
What about you guys?

266
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,064
Why are you really here?

267
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,525
[melancholy music playing]

268
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,984
Is it just for the money?

269
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,946
Let's be honest.

270
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,865
I mean, we all need money, but…

271
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,827
is that the only reason we're here?

272
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,086
[melancholy music continues]

273
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,097
I don't want to speak for everyone, but…

274
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,891
for me…

275
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,856
this is the closest I'll ever
get to being a soldier.

276
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,652
At least, in some way,

277
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,865
we're doing something
to serve the country.

278
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,910
[melancholy music continues]

279
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,412
[Gab] In my case…

280
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,000
it was when my mom died.

281
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,338
[sobs] Sorry.

282
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,383
I was really depressed at that time.

283
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,386
I couldn't get out of bed. [chuckles]

284
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,556
And because of that, you went AWOL?

285
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,350
Yeah.

286
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:01,400
When I felt I was ready
to handle things and move on,

287
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,279
I wanted to return to service
and explain myself.

288
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,405
[chuckles wryly]

289
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,867
But it was too late.
My dad made up lies about me.

290
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,827
He used all his contacts

291
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,830
to get me fired from service.

292
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,542
He wants me to go back to him but…

293
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,837
[melancholy music continues]

294
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,798
- Gab.
- [chuckles] I'm okay.

295
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,008
Sorry, guys.

296
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,552
Um… No, I'm good.

297
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,971
That's just how we are
as father and daughter.

298
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,933
We're good at annoying each other.

299
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,143
[Gab exhales sharply]

300
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,021
Alright, I'm done. Enough of my story.

301
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,315
That's my life. It is what it is.

302
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,691
- [Tomas] It's okay.
- [chuckles]

303
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,569
We're still doing service, right?

304
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,657
You know, if we're being honest,

305
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,451
we're all jerks in our own way.

306
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,328
But these jerks…

307
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,454
[inhales deeply]

308
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,081
have a strong heart.

309
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,083
Like this. [chuckles]

310
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,752
[laughs]

311
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,464
But seriously, Andres,
we'll miss you, bro.

312
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,924
[Tomas chuckles]

313
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,134
Me too. I'll miss all of you.

314
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,053
[Andres] But it's fine.

315
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,847
We'll still see each other, right?

316
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,976
Maybe it'll be more fun to
hang out outside of work.

317
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,144
- Yeah.
- We'll be more relaxed.

318
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,814
- Missions can be exhausting.
- [laughter]

319
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,358
- This is more fun.
- [Tomas] Yeah, it is.

320
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,485
[Tomas] Although it's also
nice to have some action.

321
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,820
Cheers to that.

322
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,405
Do you play the guitar?

323
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,074
Is that yours, Andres?
What's with the guitar?

324
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,909
- Show us what you got.
- Come on.

325
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,620
- I heard you practicing.
- Go, Andres.

326
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,540
- [Gab] Play for us, Andres.
- [Miguel] Let's hear it.

327
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,167
- [Tomas] Go for it, bro.
- [Max] Come on.

328
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,461
If you don't, I'll play a song.

00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,387
No.

362
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,307
Let's wait for Contractor.
He'll tell us all about it.

363
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,683
[Tomas exhales sharply]

364
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,479
This is weird. I can't do this.
I'm not used to this, sir.

365
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,648
[exhales sharply] I miss Andres.

366
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,609
Who will comfort me now

367
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,778
when I'm having an anxiety attack.

368
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,031
No one will scold me or give me the stare

369
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,699
when I'm being noisy.

370
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,911
Well, Max is still here,
as well as you guys,

371
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,913
but still, it feels different.

372
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,084
Excuse me, mister.

373
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,212
Do you know where this place is?

374
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,757
- No, I don't know. Sorry.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

375
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,848
[engine revs]

376
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,810
[Greg] Andres.

377
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,230
Sir.

378
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,523
Where are you headed?

379
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,695
What are you doing here?

380
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,155
I was just attending to something.

381
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,868
We have a new contract.

382
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,619
I want you in.

383
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:29,710
[suspenseful music playing]

384
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,881
<i>Fifty million, bro.</i>

385
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,632
<i>If you want your father to be free,</i>

386
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,593
<i>it can be arranged.</i>

387
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,927
<i>This is Mt. Talimba.</i>

388
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,971
<i>It's the location</i>
<i>of Sameo Patel's hideout.</i>

389
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,056
<i>I need you and your whole team.</i>

390
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,225
<i>I need your help.</i>

391
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,020
<i>The goal is to eliminate Sameo Patel.</i>

392
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,479
<i>Are you in?</i>

393
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,565
<i>What did Mister Domeng say?</i>

394
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,401
<i>- How much is it?</i>
<i>- Twenty million pesos.</i>

395
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,279
<i>Where on earth can we get that money?</i>
