Your baby will be fine.

190
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,201
Your child will not die.

191
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,204

But he's returned to our room
to get our teammate's inhaler.

Who are you going to give that inhaler to?

279
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,606
This is my inhaler.

280
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,900
I have an asthma. It's mine.

281
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,611

[breathing heavily]
Are you… Are you really our ally?

290
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,601
Our coach said there's no way out.

291
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,102
There are guards everywhere.

292
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,605
Okay. Okay, kids.

293
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,607

I need you to breathe, okay?

295
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,569
Trust me.

296

And listen to me.

297
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,407
There's a way out, okay.

298
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,912
We're here to save you, okay?

299
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,414
Is your coach a man or a woman?

300
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,832
- He's a man.
- Okay.

301
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,334
We'll look for him.

302
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,002
But what matters is,

303
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:06,423
I help get you out of here safely. Okay?

304
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,133
Um… Before we leave,

305
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,886
grab anything that you can use
to defend yourself. Go.

306

Go. Something that you can carry.

307
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,933
Something light.

Now, I will bring you to Father.

367
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,906
You can tell him the truth!

368
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,033
[hesitates]

369
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,618
You'll get nothing from me.

370
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,620
Nothing, huh?

371
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,996
Nothing.

372
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,623
Even if I threaten to kill you?

373
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,166
Nothing?

374
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,167
Hmm?

375
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,212
- [thud]
- [grunting]

376
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,925
[suspenseful music continues]

377
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,718
- [door closes]
- [footsteps running]

378
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,803
No.

379
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,305
[gunshots]

380
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,015
[grunts]

381
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:11,733
- [groaning, breathing heavily]
- [water breaks]

382
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,819
- [Clara crying]
- [Andres] Sit down.

383
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,988
[sobbing]

384
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,700
[screams in pain]

385
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,996
[suspenseful music intensifies]

386
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,500
[groans, panting]

387
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,630
<i>I just want to find them.</i>

388
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,425
<i>We don't even know</i>
<i>who we are looking for.</i>

389
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,801
<i>- We're almost there.</i>
<i>- Where?</i>

390
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,428
<i>The tunnel where we are going to exit.</i>

391
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,429
<i>You have companions?</i>

392
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,722
<i>Yes, we are a team.</i>

393
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,223
<i>The followers of darkness…</i>

394
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,225
<i>They are testing your Father's goodness.</i>

395
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,226
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

396
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,227
[sobbing]

397
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,103
<i>Wolf, are you still there?</i>

398
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,021
<i>The baby is coming.</i>

399
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,023
<i>Is there anything in your</i>
<i>surroundings that you can use?</i>

400
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,609
<i>What matters is we save your baby.</i>

401
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,693
<i>Okay?</i>
