<i>Keep your eyes sharp.</i>

7
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,432
<i>They can't have gone far. Let's go! Hurry!</i>

8
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,308
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>It's over. We've lost comms.</i>

00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,103
<i>The money, Max… Let's go find it.</i>

10
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,105
<i>This is Emer.</i>

11
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>Your brother's so young.</i>

12
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:28,820
<i>If I'm with my group, I can earn money,</i>
<i>I can achieve something.</i>

13
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,780
<i>- How old are you, kid?</i>
<i>- Sixteen</i>

14
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>You still have so much ahead of you.</i>

15
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,660
<i>Leave that group</i>

16
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,830
<i>They have no other way</i>

17
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,832
<i>- We'll stay here for now.</i>
<i>- Ah, sir, anything.</i>

18
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,041
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

19
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:47,630

00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,902
Mm-hmm. [grunts, thuds]

25
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,821
[breathes heavily] I'm okay.

26
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,907

[Miguel grunts]

28
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,123
- Andres. Wait.
- Yes?

29
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,086
Are you still thinking about that girl?

30
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,505
Huh?

31
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,215
[breathes heavily]

32
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,093
I'm just wondering if we did
the right thing leaving her.

33
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,096
She made her choice.

34
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,226
What do you think happened?

35
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,812
Did she leave her brother behind?

36
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:32,360
Why Andres, did you leave Jun behind?

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,405
Huh?

38
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,244
He was too small.

39
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,789
It would've been more dangerous
if we crossed together.

40
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,375
[pensive music playing]

41
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,668
What a shame.

42
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:56,259
If he'd come with you,
you both could've made it.

Do you blame yourself…

49
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,823
for what happened to him?

50
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,867
Is that why you're like this?

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,957
[pensive music continues]

52
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,336
I hope she finds her brother.

53
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,048
Yeah.

54
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,010
You know, Andres,

55
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,472
you can't save everyone.

56
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,017
Remember that.

- [thuds]
- You know, this feels like a workout.

64
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,844
My uncle told me to
choose how I live, sir.

65
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,390
He never really told me…

66
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:31,354
He never really told me
what was right or wrong.

67
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,525
Damn, who…

68
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,945
Who even decides what's
right and wrong, huh?

69
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,029
Oops!

70
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,491

- [thuds]

71
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,909
You know, Tomas…

[both panting]

73
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,249
In the end, we all make our own choices.

74
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:59,048
It's up to you.
Right or wrong depends on your principles.

75
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,136
You're right, sir.

76
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,974
What about you, sir?
How many right choices have you made?

77
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,892
How many wrong?

78
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,229
I've lost count.

79
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,692
It makes sense, sir.

80
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,820
I guess you've made more
wrong ones too, like me.

81
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,031
Well…

82
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:30,496
We all know doing the
right thing is harder, sir.

83
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,790
It's harder to stay honorable.

84
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,419
Look at you, sir…

85
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,754
[pensive music playing]

86
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,632
You did the right thing,
but they still discharged you.

87
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,262
And your dad. He was on the right side,
yet he's the one in prison.

88
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,641
Oh… sorry, sir.

89
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,602
I didn't mean to.

90
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,856
Sometimes, my mouth just runs off
before I even know what’s right or wrong.

[dramatic music playing]

96
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,852
Looks like he's really pissed at me now.

97
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,230
Oh, dear.

98
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,065
Oh.

[dramatic music crescendos]

104
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,566
- [Max] Gab, it's not here.
- I know it's here. It's here.

105
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,193
I'm not giving up.

Do you see that?

109
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,079
- The money!
- The money! The money!

110
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,415
Yes! Thank you, Lord! Thank you!

111
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,542
- So? Can we head down now?
- Yeah!

112
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,753
Whoa, wait, Gab! That's dangerous!

113
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,672
Damn it.

It's fine! Wow, it's all here! [laughs]

[Gab] Whoo!

117
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,766
Hey, be careful!
Are you sure you can do that?

118
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,976
Yeah, no worries. It's close.

- [man 3] Dude.
- [man 1] We're so lucky today!

183
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,786
- There's more!
- This is a lot!

184
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,872
Hurry, there's more on top. Get them all!

185
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,041
[man 1] We're so lucky today!

186
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,084
Oh, wow.

187
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,752
[music fading]

188
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,254
[Apo groans]

189
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,339
I wonder where it is.

190
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,008
Oh, it's just here.

191
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,511
Ah…

192
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,554
[gasps]

193
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,181
[ominous music playing]

194
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,641
[breathes shakily]

195
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,893
[ominous music continues]

196
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,186
What…

197
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,064
[breathing shakily]

198
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:17,111
[unsettling music continues]

199
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,029
[Apo] <i>Pedro,</i>

200
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,408
<i>what is your son doing?</i>

201
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,204
<i>Where did he get all this money?</i>

202
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,208
[ominous music swells then fades]

203
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,795
[indistinct chattering, laughing]

204
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,225
Aren't these assholes
leaving yet, Captain?

205
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,187
Head home for now, Amado.

206
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,398
They'll probably be gone
by the time you wake up.

207
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,027
[foreboding music playing]

208
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,653
Watch out.

209
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:06,744
[foreboding music continues]

210
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,041
[radio beeps]

211
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,709
Did your men run into trouble earlier?

212
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,919
[beeps]

213
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,630
[Monching] Raul's men are all dead.

214
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,758
Those fools are trying to trick us.

215
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,053
They took a detour to avoid the Sitio.

216
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,012
[beeps]

217
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,224
[beeps]

218
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:33,145
Tell your men to block all the
exits around the mountain.

219
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:38,817
[foreboding music continues]

220
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,110
[beeps]

221
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:47,201
[foreboding music continues]

222
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,330
[JB, Tomas panting]

223
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,831
[Tomas grunts]

224
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,543
Let's rest here for now, Tomas.

225
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,836
[sighs sharply] Yes, sir.

226
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,213
All right.

227
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:03,467
[both grunting]

228
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,843
[Tomas exhales sharply]

229
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:10,891
[panting]

230
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:18,065
[breathing heavily]

231
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,567
Uh…

232
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:27,408
- [JB grunts, breathing heavily]
- [cicadas chirping]

233
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,909
Um…

234
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,161
Sir…

235
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,664
Uh… [sniffles]

236
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,208
I'm sorry. [chuckling softly]

237
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:42,006
I'm sorry for what I said
about you and your father.

238
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,467
Sir, it's fine if you
want to reprimand me now.

239
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,387
It's not a problem. I won't complain.

240
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,557
That's not a big deal, Tomas.
Stop being so dramatic.

241
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,434
[both chuckle]

242
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,519
Everything you've said is true.

243
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,566
It's hard to be kind in this world.

244
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,485
It's hard to live with honor.

245
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,323
There's always a cost.

246
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,533
[somber music playing]

247
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,035
[breathes deeply]

248
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,704
Sometimes, you have to
choose the wrong path.

249
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,167
[Tomas] For the sake of
your freedom and dignity.

250
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,336
[chuckles softly]

251
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,254
Sir…

252
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,965
[clears throat] No matter what happens…

253
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,593
whether you become a soldier again or not,

254
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,054
I will always respect you.

255
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,848
You're my idol. [chuckles]

256
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,561
[somber music continues]

257
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,648
[Tomas breathes deeply]

258
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,232
Thank you, Tomas.

259
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,737
How are you anyway?

260
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,406
How's your uncle doing?

261
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,495
He's good.

262
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,288
Actually, he's not.

263
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,958
That uncle of mine just won't listen.

264
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,919
He's probably going to jail
for running a scam.

265
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,548
That's why I really need this money.

266
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,927
I don't have a lot of it, unlike you, sir.

267
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,972
- [sniffs]
- That's not true, Tomas.

268
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,809
I need this badly, too.

269
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,020
But you're rich?

270
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,150
I need a huge amount of money, Tomas.

271
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,696
To set my father free.

272
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:34,410
[somber music continues]

273
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,162
[Tomas exhales heavily]

274
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,212
[exhales deeply]

275
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,507
- [jacket zips]
- Let's change here.

276
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,511
We'll stand out if we don't.

277
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,014
Where could the others be?

278
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,560
They could already be close
to the exit point.

279
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,396
[Miguel sighs]

280
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,611
I have to go now. I'll see you tomorrow.

281
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,947
- Alright.
- Take care.

282
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,118
- [Amado] Captain.
- Amado.

283
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,453
I'm going now.

284
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,788
- Be careful.
- I will.

285
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,710
[Monching] Who dared to
kill Sir Sameo and steal our money?

286
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,129
[scoffs] They've got guts.

287
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:32,092
[chuckles] That bastard Sameo's dead?

288
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,804
And your money's missing too?

289
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,431
Serves you right.

290
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,185
Are you happy? Are you?

291
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,020
Are you with those bastards, huh?!

292
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,106
I'm not with them, but yes..

293
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,735
I'm happy that your
drug lord master is dead!

294
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,862
- [gunshots]
- Aah!

295
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,989
- [Amado crying out in pain]
- [screaming]

296
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,741
Still happy, huh?!

297
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,744
[grunting]

298
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,079
[Benjie] Yes!

299
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,456
Sameo's dead!

300
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,917
That means no more aid for any of you!

301
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,753
[suspenseful music playing]

302
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,880
Now if you want money,

303
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,050
when the outsiders pass through here,

304
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,095
you must kill them.

305
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,014
And I will pay you.

306
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,726
Can I count on anyone here?

307
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,353
Answer!

308
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,273
[suspenseful music continues]

309
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,733
Count on us, sir.

310
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:46,667
[suspenseful music continues]

311
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,212
Help Amado!

312
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:59,054
[suspenseful music intensifies]

313
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,646
It's dangerous for us
to pass through there.

314
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,940
What could be happening there?

315
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:19,658
[suspenseful music continues]

316
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,120
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

317
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,288
- [gunshots]
- [scream]

318
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,123
<i>Those are gunshots, sir.</i>

319
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,208
- <i>Follow them!</i>
- Come with me, Emer!

320
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,585
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Let's leave this place.</i>

321
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,629
<i>Someone stole our money.</i>
<i>We have to get it back!</i>

322
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,842
<i>They have no other route except this one.</i>

323
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,304
<i>When the outsiders pass</i>
<i>through here, kill them.</i>

324
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,222
<i>You're the outsiders.</i>

325
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,808
<i>Just let us pass if you</i>
<i>don't want any problems.</i>

326
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,187
<i>Keep your eyes open. They're around here.</i>

327
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,939
<i>I shall return.</i>

328
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,691
<i>You can't get out of here now.</i>

329
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,319
<i>There's bounty on your heads.</i>
<i>They're after that money too.</i>

330
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,486
<i>Drop the bags!</i>
