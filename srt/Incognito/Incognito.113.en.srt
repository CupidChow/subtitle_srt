00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,389

<i>Tomas. I'll wait for you here, okay?</i>

15
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,528
<i>Dad, are you excited to go home?</i>

16
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,822

20
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,454
<i>Miguel, Manuel was the one who called.</i>
<i>There's a threat.</i>

21
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,957

I received a threat from Manuel.

We will stay alert, sir.

I know Manuel.

33

When he says something, he means it.

34
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,663
So this is high alert.

35
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,583
Sir, we took something from him, his son.

36
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,586
[Miguel] He wants something in return.

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,089
Now Manuel Aguinaldo will make us pay.

38
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,007

Wait. What does that mean?

42

It means we're not his only target.

But for now, all of you should be careful.

Copy.

- Do you remember, Max?
- What?

63
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:36,132
She'd always come between us.

64
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,302
[Teddy] She didn't want to be left out.

65
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,430
She always had to be part of everything.

Just let her be.

96
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,331
Dad, what's going on there?

Nothing.

98
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,962
I just finished signing my release papers.

99
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,174
Why, son?

100
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,427
Wait for me. Be careful.

101
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,345
Stay close to the guards there.

Alright. Wait for me.

105
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,695
Why? What's going on?

106
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,448
It's the El Cano.

[ominous music continues]

108

They've heard that I'm getting released…

109
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,593
so they want to finish me off?

110
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,098
I can't answer that,
Dad, but we need to be careful.

111
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,643
Okay, son.

112
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,978

You've gone crazy again.

119
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,258
What do you mean someone's following us?

No one's following us.
What are you talking about?

[Tomas] I'm serious, Uncle.
Please just check your surroundings.

122
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,766
Check if there's
anyone who's acting suspicious.

Excuse me, mister.

Yeah, Tom. So can you come home now?
