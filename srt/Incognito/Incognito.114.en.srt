188
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,296
<i>I am so proud of you.</i>

189

198
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,565
<i>Andres, someone's looking for you.</i>

199
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,649
<i>Who is it?</i>

200
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,904
<i>Give me all the channels</i>

201
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,655
<i>He got my team's families involved.</i>

202
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,199
<i>I can't just let that slide.</i>

203
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,659
<i>Sir, this has nothing to do</i>
<i>with work anymore. This is personal.</i>

204
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,913
<i>We've been suspecting</i>
<i>that place for a long time.</i>

205
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,207
<i>We think it's</i>
<i>a trafficking site run by El Cano</i>

206
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,626
<i>and headed by Manuel Aguinaldo.</i>

207

<i>I promise, Dad,</i>
<i>everything will not be in vain.</i>
