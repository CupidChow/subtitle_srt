When didians activate thegasps of bomb?

Devil Lord

10
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,300
He's going out.

11
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,760
An evilMarud!

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,220
That's why your nickname was Golden Reaver over others

13
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,380
?"

14
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,620
My mom has secretly hunted a python.

15
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,420
This is Tricky hurts

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,700

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,780

It's fine, When the enemy is Blarber

a baby

22
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,180
Dad, I remember it's 6.30.

23
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,460
I won't forget it.

24
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,580
Change clothes?

25
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,460
Do I have to change clothes?

26
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,500
If you want to change clothes,

27
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,460
I have to go home.

28
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,380
It's too troublesome.

29
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,940
I'll stop talking to you.

30
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,500
I'll go back to work.

31
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,380
Master.

32
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,420
Master.

33
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,380
This is the report from the hospital.

34
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,220
Have a look.

35
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,220
The poison of the oxygen.

36
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,340
Yes.

37
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,740
The doctor said that

38
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,420
Zhou Meibang died.

39
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,940
He was once in a coma.

40
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
But I don't know the reason for it.

41
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,940
It could be a coal.

42
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,580
Or it could be a head-to-head shot.

43
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,860
That is to say, the killer can

44
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,460
attack Zhou Meigao first.

45
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,180
After he is cured,

46
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,820
burn the coal and kill him.

47
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,700
Yes.

48
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,140
Okay, I know.

49
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,260
Master.

50
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,780
The person has arrived at the lab.

51
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,180
Lin Dacen.

52
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,940
I'm sorry to bother you.

53
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,980
I came here to see you.

54
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,260
Do you know why I came to see you?

55
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,540
Is it because of Zhou Meibang?

56
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Do you know him?

57
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,420
Yes.

58
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,980
Who doesn't know him?

59
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,420
The boss of the coffee shop.

60
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,820
Do you meet him often?

61
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Not very often.

62
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,340
I don't drink coffee with them.

63
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,940
I prefer to drink with myself.

64
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,860
What does it have to do with you and Zhou Meibang?

65
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,980
It has nothing to do with me.

66
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,940
I don't know him.

67
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
I don't know him.

68
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,860
I don't know him.

69
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,700
I don't know him.

70
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,700
I don't know him.

71
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,020
It has nothing to do with me.

72
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,740
I just know him.

73
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,020
You don't even remember

74
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,620
who you rent the house to, do you?

75
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,820
Yes.

76
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,380
I'm a landlord.

77
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,220
I'm a little investment in that house.

78
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,700
I don't have to do anything about it.

79
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,820
I forgot it even if you don't tell me.

80
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,620
It's a little investment to buy a house.

81
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,260
It's hard to imagine your income.

82
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,580
Do you want to ask

83
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,740
where you can save it?

84
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,020
I can't talk about saving it.

85
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,580
I have a design firm

86
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,780
to pick up some small work.

87
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,060
What design?

88
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,140
Advertising design?

89
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,100
Or

90
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,820
what kind of design do you want to build?

91
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,220
Do you know the price of the gold?

92
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,940
I designed it.

93
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,580
And the new Chen Tianchi art gallery.

94
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,340
I designed it.

95
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,180
I've never heard of it.

96
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,020
I don't care.

97
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,620
It's a little inappropriate to say this.

98
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,540
Your rent is in your room.

99
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,660
If you send it out,

100
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,100
who will dare to rent it?

101
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,020
If it's true,

102
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,300
the loss will be small.

103
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,220
By the way,

104
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,260
how much is the rent for the rent of

105
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,860
Zhong Meibao's rental house?

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,060
Actually, I don't care.

107
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,860
I just want to give it to the general manager.

108
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,260
After all, it's not a big deal.

109
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,620
You said you would buy a house

110
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,940
just to invest.

111
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,180
You have to look at the rental price.

112
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,740
Especially for your generation.

113
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,420
A small household's rent

114
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,540
is expensive.

115
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,580
It's not cheap.

116
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,780
Do you remember the price?

117
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
Mr. Lin.

118
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,260
How did you get the rent?

119
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,420
You don't know that.

120
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,820
Or you

121
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
didn't go to Zhong Meibao's house

122
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,660
to rent the house.

123
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,900
Can you give me a cup of water?

124
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,420
I have coffee.

125
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,540
Thank you.

126
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,180
Mr. Lin is quite cunning.

127
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,300
He needs to rest

128
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,540
when he talks about the key issue.

129
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,780
He even asked us to get him a cup of coffee.

130
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,140
He might want to be cold-hearted

131
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,260
and change his mind.

132
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,780
From the data of the household,

133
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,980
he and Zhong Meibao

134
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,380
lived in the same building.

135
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,180
Maybe they knew each other long ago.

136
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,780
I don't know why they hid it from us.

137
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,700
It's not good.

138
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,100
They are testing us.

139
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,980
Let's see how much we know.

140
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Now we know.

141
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,260
Maybe we need to change the rules later.

142
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,940
Are you going to the meeting at half past three?

143
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,700
How do you know?

144
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,980
I just called you.

145
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,620
You are right.

146
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,580
Let's get to work early.

147
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,020
Sir, I'm a little late.

148
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,940
You don't want to get off work early.

149
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,980
I'm still young.

150
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,940
Thank you for your coffee.

151
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,900
Sorry.

152
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,340
I've been having a hard time lately.

153
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,420
My brain is a little messy.

154
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,340
Don't mention it.

155
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,580
Do you want to rest?

156
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,740
No need.

157
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm just a little scared.

158
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,860
I'm afraid I'll suspect you

159
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,020
if you suspect me.

160
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,620
So I didn't tell you the truth.

161
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,860
I'll tell you the truth now.

162
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,980
I knew Zhong Meibao very little.

163
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,260
I didn't let him live in that house.

164
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,620
Just like this.

165
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,940
A little girl

166
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,860
comes to the big city to work.

167
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,060
It's not easy.

168
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,540
She just wants to help.

169
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,100
You said you knew Zhong Meibao very little.

170
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,780
Which one do you know?

171
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,140
The same building.

172
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,140
Up and down.

173
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,660
We're all worried about our family.

174
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,220
We're all worried about our family.

175
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,380
We're all worried about our family.

176
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,500
Have a meal.

177
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,220
I'm good at making decisions with them.

178
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,420
They must think I'm very close

179
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,860
because of this.

180
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,300
But it's because Zhong Meibao's mother

181
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,980
doesn't know what her mother does.

182
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,260
She's always at home at night

183
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,700
and always makes the neighbor say some good things.

184
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,100
Sister Fang.

185
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,100
Sister Fang.

186
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,380
I'm sorry for the two children today.

187
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,500
It's a little troublesome.

188
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,220
Go ahead.

189
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,940
Come on. Go.

190
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,540
Da San, go and eat.

191
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,460
Please come, Sister Fang.

192
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,060
I'm so worried.

193
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,220
They're so considerate.

194
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,060
They always let us eat at home.

195
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,540
Their mother is not at home.

196
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,260
My mother is poor.

197
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,380
She's also very caring.

198
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,940
The water and electricity bills

199
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,300
are all going to increase.

200
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,860
I only made two servings.

201
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,380
My mother gave me some money.

202
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,100
Where did you get enough?

203
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,780
Mom.

204
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,340
I didn't give my mom any money.

205
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,740
How about you add another dish?

206
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,220
Will it be wasted?

207
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,620
Romantic топ restaurant

208
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:24,860
Hi.

209
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,780
Want to have lunch?

210
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,140
Princess Xia,

211
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,660
hello Xia.

212
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,460
Done changing?

213
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,060
Too bad.

214
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,460
Ask me if there's anything we'd like to ask you.

215
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,180
Our family have a watch.

216
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,540
Ask me if you've seen it.

217
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,900
That's not strange.

218
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,780
You if the watch is broken.

219
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,260
How will I see it?

220
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,060
Sister Fang.

221
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,060
Every house and house

222
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,540
have yummy products stores.

223
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,900
No one is ever in a house.

224
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
That's why…

225
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,220
So you lost a watch

226
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,060
Is it?

227
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,660
Of course, there are thieves.

228
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,380
I don't know if it's a big steal

229
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,540
or a small steal.

230
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,900
What do you mean?

231
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,820
Our grandchild

232
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,460
studies at home every day.

233
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,140
He just wants to steal your stuff.

234
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,420
He has to have time.

235
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,820
If we lose something,

236
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,620
we'll have to come to your house to find it, okay?

237
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,660
I'll go find it first.

238
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,540
Why are you saying that?

239
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,500
I'll go find it now.

240
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,420
I'm not really interested in your house.

241
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,700
I'll go find it for you.

242
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,580
Right?

243
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,380
I'll go find it for you.

244
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,940
So,

245
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,380
you two are also a couple.

246
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,620
Is she your lover?

247
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,820
We were so young then.

248
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,700
We were so blind.

249
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,060
But we still can't

250
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,460
get over the love we have for each other.

251
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,980
Mei Bao,

252
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,980
I got a ticket.

253
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,740
Let's go in.

254
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,100
But, Da Xian,

255
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,620
I don't have a swimming suit.

256
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,060
What should we do?

257
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,180
Why don't you go in yourself?

258
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,220
I'm not going.

259
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,100
No.

260
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,420
Let's go in together.

261
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,820
Let me think of a way.

262
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,220
Miss,

263
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,820
what do you want?

264
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
I want a chocolate ice cream.

265
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,620
Chocolate ice cream?

266
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,820
I want milk.

267
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Milk?

268
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
But I want chocolate.

269
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,420
I want milk.

270
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,220
Then,

271
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,820
I want a ice cream.

272
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,420
Two of them are in the same box.

273
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:09,820
I don't want that.

274
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,020
I don't want that.

275
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,420
This kid.

276
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,620
Thank you, Da San.

277
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,420
This is my favorite pink.

278
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
Do I look good?

279
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,820
Yes.

280
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,420
Look.

281
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
Isn't this enough?

282
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,620
It's fine if it's enough.

283
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,420
I'm a little scared.

284
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,620
It's fine.

285
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,620
I'll teach you.

286
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,380
Wait.

287
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,780
Me and you.

288
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,180
Silly me.

289
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,620
I don't have a chance for you in my hometown.

290
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,180
Next time...

291
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,680
You're always like this

292
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,300
You did make me so happy

293
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,380
All because I loved you

294
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,580
Amulet

295
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,540
What are you stealing?

296
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,140
Stealing our watch.

297
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,340
Our two kids never steal anything from others.

298
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,980
Don't lie to me.

299
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,380
This is so funny.

300
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,540
You love stealing so much.

301
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
Your daughter is learning from you.

302
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,540
She's so good at raising the child.

303
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,700
What are you stealing?

304
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,940
Stealing people.

305
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,780
You stole the kid.

306
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,980
Of course, you stole it.

307
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,300
If it weren't for our new aunt

308
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,340
playing with them in Zhong Mei Bao,

309
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,100
the watch would fall out of the bag.

310
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,900
I would never have thought about it.

311
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,620
Your daughter suddenly hid the watch

312
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,580
in the bag.

313
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,700
Maybe it's your daughter

314
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,900
who intentionally put the watch

315
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,100
in our Mei Bao's bag

316
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
and gave it to her.

317
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,700
Okay.

318
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,020
You think it's okay to take away your daughter's innocence?

319
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,100
Let's go and search.

320
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,300
Let's go.

321
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
Let's go.

322
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
Let's go.

323
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,300
Let's go.

324
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Let's go.

325
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Let's go.

326
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,500
This is my room.

327
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,700
What are you doing?

328
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,900
Let's go and steal our things.

329
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
You...

330
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,300
No.

331
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,900
What is this?

332
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,700
Come here and take a look.

333
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Come here and take a look.

334
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,300
Did you find it?

335
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:15,900
Take a look.

336
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,100
Take a look.

337
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,100
What is this?

338
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,900
You told me you didn't steal anything.

339
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,500
You said you didn't steal anything.

340
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,300
You said you didn't steal anything.

341
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
I told you that their child is a thief.

342
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,300
What did you steal from their child?

343
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,100
Mei Bao.

344
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,300
Come here.

345
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Come here.

346
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,900
You...

347
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,300
These things...

348
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,700
Are you stealing them?

349
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,300
You...

350
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,900
Education is good.

351
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,100
Otherwise, we won't have any more.

352
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,900
Let's go.

353
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
And I tell you,

354
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,700
you'd better move out of here.

355
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,300
If you do this,

356
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,900
it's not good for our child.

357
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,700
Let's go.

358
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
I told you to stay out of this.

359
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,900
I finally took a little bit of your time here.

360
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,300
You're so mean.

361
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:53,900
You...

362
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,300
You...

363
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
You...

364
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,700
When I grow up,

365
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,300
I must buy a big house.

366
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,700
I'll put everything in the box.

367
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,900
The computer, the computer, the fire extinguisher.

368
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,700
Why would a little elf like her

369
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,900
come here to steal?

370
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,500
She's just a kid.

371
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,900
She's just messing around.

372
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Since she's just messing around,

373
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,700
why would her family

374
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,300
move out of here?

375
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,100
I think it's because of her mother.

376
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,900
Everyone thinks her mother stole something.

377
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,900
So she stole something.

378
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
This girl is not easy.

379
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,700
Yes.

380
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,300
So I let her live in my house.

381
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Because they were really

382
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,700
miserable and miserable when they were young.

383
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,500
They wanted to take care of me.

384
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,100
If she had stolen something from me since I was a kid,

385
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,100
how could you be so worried

386
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,300
and let her live in my house?

387
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,700
That's the past.

388
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,700
And they were really coincidental.

389
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,100
In another way,

390
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,500
you're not easy either.

391
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,300
I can't say that.

392
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,100
So we lived together.

393
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
After all, our family is a family of knowledge.

394
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,100
Didn't you say your mother

395
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,500
was a financial advisor to others?

396
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,900
I said she was my father.

397
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,300
She's a teacher.

398
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,700
She passed away very early.

399
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,300
My mother can't do anything.

400
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,500
So she had to go out to be a teacher.

401
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Yes, yes.

402
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,900
Then let's not talk about your living problem.

403
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Can you tell us

404
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,900
how you and Zhong Mei Bao

405
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,300
met?

406
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,100
About two years ago,

407
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
I got married that day.

408
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
You invited her to your wedding?

409
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,100
How could that be?

410
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,900
I'm her family's architecture teacher.

411
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,900
I'm a newbie architecture teacher.

412
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,100
My wedding is a birthday party

413
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,500
of the architecture community.

414
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,300
I mean,

415
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,700
in that kind of occasion,

416
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,900
I can't invite someone

417
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,700
who's not related to me.

418
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Right?

419
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
We just want to ask

420
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
how you two met.

421
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
I got drunk that day when I got married.

422
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
I called her.

423
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
She told me that she was moving out.

424
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
I want to find a job opportunity.

425
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
That's it.

426
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,700
She should be very trusted.

427
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,700
Otherwise, she wouldn't contact you.

428
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Right?

429
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
Yes.

430
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Maybe I should take care of her since I was a kid.

431
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
She thinks I'm more close to her.

432
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
She also wants to take care of me

433
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
and Rosé.

434
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,700
She's very considerate.

435
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
That's great.

436
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
You're not only a young talent,

437
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
but also a good example.

438
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,700
You're not that good at talent.

439
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Okay.

440
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Are you sure you're right?

441
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Sign here.

442
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,700
Okay.

443
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
Thank you for

444
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
working with us.

445
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
No, I shouldn't.

446
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Well...

447
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,700
Do you really like her?

448
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
No.

449
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
No way.

450
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Can I leave now?

451
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Sure.

452
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
We'll visit you in a few days.

453
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
We'll know about some new things.

454
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Okay.

455
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Even if we're in trouble,

456
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
I want to hand you a ride.

457
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
Okay?

458
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,700
You're this late!

459
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,700
Master, I think Lin Da Sen

460
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,700
always gives me a feeling that I'm not reliable.

461
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
What do you think?

462
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,700
What do I think?

463
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
I think he's quite shy.

464
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,700
He's shy.

465
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
He's shy.

466
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
I'm not that strong at this time.

467
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,700
I can't stand it when I hold him like this.

468
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
You're not feeling well?

469
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
I mean

470
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
the head of Zhong Mei Bao is seriously injured.

471
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Yes.

472
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,700
A person can get married to another person.

473
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
This person must be very strong.

474
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
You're going to work.

475
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Master, I'll go to the machine first.

476
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Hello?

477
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Where are you?

478
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
This time, we're here

479
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
to make a professional 805 hospital

480
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
for the Mancheng 805 Group.

481
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
So we must get something unique.

482
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,700
What's the most important thing about Yizhiling's design?

483
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
It's romantic.

484
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,700
But the design of Tian'e's feather is really too risky.

485
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,700
And the skill level is too high.

486
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
The difficulty level is also

487
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
to give us a digital brand.

488
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Yizhiling is better than this case.

489
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Yizhiling, what do you think?

490
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
Yizhiling.

491
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
You really don't like people, do you?

492
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Yizhiling.

493
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Yizhiling.

494
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Yizhiling.

495
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Yizhiling.

496
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Yizhiling.

497
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Yizhiling.

498
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Hello?

499
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Look.

500
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Why don't you respond to this name?

501
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
I'm not used to it.

502
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
I'm just making a training for you.

503
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Half of my friends

504
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,700
are foreigners.

505
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
They've been calling this name for a long time.

506
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
You just married me.

507
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
I've been working for three days.

508
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
How simple is that?

509
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
It's not like a Negro.

510
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Negro is not bad.

511
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
It's like American and a Bargain.

512
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
It's so easy to remember.

513
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Anyway, I don't care.

514
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
When you get married,

515
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
you must call Yizhiling your father.

516
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,700
My father said that

517
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,700
this name is very good.

518
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
It's always the same.

519
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Actually, you can bring your father to try it.

520
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
I don't need to come.

521
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
What's wrong? Are you angry?

522
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
No.

523
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,700
Try this.

524
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
Don't be angry.

525
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Why?

526
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Try it.

527
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
How is it?

528
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,700
Is it delicious?

529
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
It's so delicious.

530
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
It's like a fish sauce.

531
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
You've never tried it?

532
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
I don't like it. It's delicious.

533
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
If you don't like it,

534
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
you'll get your hair damaged.

535
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
What's this?

536
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
It's a golden fish.

537
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
It's good.

538
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
It's rich.

539
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
It's more delicious.

540
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Okay.

541
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
Let's change the fish sauce

542
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
into golden fish sauce.

543
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
I wanted to say

544
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
that there's a good way to eat it.

545
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
So that's what

546
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
the soy bean sauce means?

547
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Your mother

548
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
really likes it.

549
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
Then don't change it.

550
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
That's it.

551
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
I'll use it later.

552
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Hello.

553
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
I'm the boss, Patrick.

554
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
How are you?

555
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,700
The boss

556
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,700
is making a big deal of money.

557
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
I'm the boss.

558
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
I'm the boss.

559
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Then that's it.

560
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Get the new teeth.

561
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Little Bao,

562
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
stop it.

563
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
Let uncle take a rest.

564
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,700
It's okay.

565
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
Dad,

566
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
do you want your grandson

567
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,700
or your granddaughter?

568
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Man is a living man.

569
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
A girl is a good girl.

570
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
She's considerate.

571
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,700
She's a good girl.

572
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Let me give you a birthday gift.

573
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Right?

574
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,700
Da Sen.

575
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Do you like men or girls?

576
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Da Sen.

577
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
I like them.

578
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Let me tell you something.

579
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,700
I'll come back later.

580
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
Dad,

581
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
here's your new year.

582
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
Come and have a look.

583
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
Dad, how do you like it?

584
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Da Sen.

585
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Da Sen.

586
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
I've prepared a dress

587
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
for your mother.

588
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,700
Mom.

589
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
This is from the Italian brand.

590
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
I think your mother

591
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
must like it.

592
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Mom,

593
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
don't be so polite.

594
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,700
My mother has her own dress.

595
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Actually,

596
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
this is not polite.

597
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Your wedding,

598
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Molly and Dad

599
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
came to find her many old friends.

600
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,700
They all have a rich family.

601
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Molly is her

602
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
favorite daughter.

603
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
She must

604
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
marry her out of love.

605
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
So,

606
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
the most important thing

607
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
is the face.

608
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
I've seen your mother

609
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
a few times.

610
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
I think

611
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,700
she's a good girl.

612
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
She's

613
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,700
a little casual

614
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,700
on the dress.

615
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
I'm sorry

616
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
for making you feel guilty.

617
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
It's not a guilty feeling.

618
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Your mother

619
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
is a hard worker.

620
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
She's a hard worker.

621
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
She's a hard worker.

622
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,700
She's a hard worker.

623
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
She's a hard worker.

624
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Now, you've learned

625
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
how to lock the door.

626
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
You married a good wife.

627
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
She must be satisfied.

628
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Sit down.

629
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,700
I have something to tell you.

630
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Last time,

631
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
I met your mother.

632
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
I asked her

633
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
to give birth to eight children.

634
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,700
She found someone to count them.

635
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Your mother

636
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
is also a hard worker.

637
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
She's a hard worker.

638
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
So, your father...

639
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
I'll tell you the truth.

640
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,700
The master of the calculation

641
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,700
suggested that

642
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
when you get married,

643
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
your mother shouldn't be a cook.

644
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
Because the person who

645
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
makes you happy

646
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
will be happy.

647
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
It's not good for your father.

648
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Okay.

649
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
You should do it.

650
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
You should do it.

651
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
That's it.

652
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
Okay.

653
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,700
When you get married,

654
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
why do you have a five-tall dress?

655
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
That's because

656
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,700
I don't have

657
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,700
your expensive dress.

658
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,700
The dress you just wore

659
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
is like a dress with half a dress.

660
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
I'll give you three of them.

661
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
What's the difference?

662
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Da Sen.

663
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
I want six of them.

664
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
I want six of them.

665
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
You should prepare six of them for me.

666
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Okay. Six of them next time.

667
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Six of them next time.

668
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,700
What? Six of them next time?

669
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
I don't have any next time.

670
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,700
You're being too harsh.

671
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
Don't mention him.

672
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Da Sen.

673
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Mom.

674
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
Mom, it's late.

675
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
It's okay.

676
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
It's okay.

677
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,700
There's a clothing market nearby.

678
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,700
I picked a few fabrics.

679
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
I'm going to make new clothes.

680
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
You wear them when you get married.

681
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,700
Look.

682
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
This is a kind of dress.

683
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
This is a kind of green.

684
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
I like this kind of dress

685
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,700
the most when I was young.

686
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,700
I know.

687
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,700
I know.

688
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
You remember?

689
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
It's nice.

690
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Mom.

691
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
Mom.

692
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Qian Jia Mu asked me to give you this dress.

693
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
It's an Italian brand.

694
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
Qian Jia Mu gave it to me.

695
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Yes.

696
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
It's so expensive.

697
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,700
How much is it?

698
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
It's not cheap.

699
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
It's not cheap.

700
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Look at the packaging.

701
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700
I can't even open it.

702
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,700
How much is it?

703
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Look.

704
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,700
Mom.

705
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Yes.

706
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
I want to tell you.

707
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,700
What?

708
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Tell me.

709
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,700
Mu Li's dad said that

710
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
during the wedding,

711
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
he had a lot of friends coming.

712
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
I'm a guest.

713
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,700
And a lot of foreign friends are coming.

714
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
So the host may not be able to sit down.

715
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,700
And then,

716
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
can we not be the host?

717
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Okay. Thank you.

718
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Why?

719
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
Mom.

720
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
It's okay.

721
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
I'll write it down.

722
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
It's okay.

723
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
It's okay.

724
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
It's okay.

725
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
As long as you're fine,

726
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
I can sit on other tables.

727
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
I'm quite relaxed.

728
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,700
I'm not lying to you.

729
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
I don't want to sit with them.

730
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
I'm very stubborn.

731
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
Really.

732
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Let's eat.

733
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Look.

734
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Eat.

735
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Today,

736
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
my daughter

737
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
is getting married.

738
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
It's also a good time

739
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
for us to meet.

740
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
The guests in the night

741
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
are all here.

742
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
The guests in the middle and the bottom

743
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
are all here.

744
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
And my old colleagues

745
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,700
and old friends

746
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
who are also here.

747
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
The experts

748
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,700
are also here.

749
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
I'm here

750
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
to express my gratitude.

751
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
We're not very normal now.

752
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
We love you more than anyone else.

753
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
We're happy.

754
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
And

755
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
I hope that you

756
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,700
will give my daughter

757
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
the new office

758
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
of the Da Sen

759
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
in the competitive industry

760
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
to protect the company.

761
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Thank you again.

762
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
Meryl

763
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
is my most beloved little girl.

764
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,700
Da Sen

765
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,700
is my most proud student.

766
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
You can walk together today.

767
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
You should be grateful for your fate.

768
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
And you should be grateful

769
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
for the people who raised you

770
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
and taught you.

771
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Da Sen

772
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
as your teacher

773
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
and your father,

774
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,700
I will be more

775
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,700
independent

776
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,700
in the family and the business.

777
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,700
I will be responsible for my life

778
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,700
and also

779
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,700
for Meryl.

780
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
I'm sure

781
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
you will.

782
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Good.

783
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
You're so good.

784
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Do you know

785
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
what this means?

786
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
What's sent is

787
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
you're good to her.

788
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
She makes you have everything.

789
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
If you don't,

790
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
she'll let you lose everything.

791
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
Come on.

792
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
Welcome everyone.

793
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
Thank you.

794
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
Congratulations.

795
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
Congratulations.

796
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
Congratulations.

797
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Congratulations.

798
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
Congratulations.

799
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,700
Chen Guo.

800
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
I'm going to sleep.

801
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
I'm not sure if you'll be able to go to bed.

802
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Please take care of yourself.

803
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
I'm good.

804
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,700
Do you like it?

805
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,700
Yes, I do.

806
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,700
I like it.

807
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
It will make you feel comfortable.

808
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
That's good.

809
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Da Sen

810
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,700
you like children,

811
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,740
I'll arrange for more kids to be with you.

812
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,180
I'm just happy.

813
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,380
Happy, happy.

814
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,100
So happy.

815
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,060
You sit down.

816
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,060
You always do this.

817
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,140
Yeah.

818
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,900
I love to eat.

819
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,700
Take good care of yourself.

820
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,220
Okay.

821
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,220
Take care of yourself.

822
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,980
Are you okay?

823
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,580
Okay.

824
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,780
Go back to work.

825
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,180
Sorry, I'm late.

826
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,860
You eat too.

827
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,100
Don't eat too much.

828
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,900
Why are you here?

829
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,060
I'm here to see you.

830
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,220
Hurry up.

831
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,100
Sorry, mom.

832
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,500
I'll ask Da Sheng to go there.

833
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,220
I'll come with you later.

834
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,060
Then sit down.

835
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,860
We're leaving.

836
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,660
Okay, okay.

837
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,140
Let's go.

838
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,860
Come on.

839
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,300
I'll go with you.

840
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,060
Okay.

841
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,100
I'll go with you.

842
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Okay.

843
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,020
Okay.

844
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,980
Come on.

845
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,580
Dong Zi,

846
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,300
aren't you going up?

847
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,020
I'll take Da Sheng up.

848
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,460
Okay.

849
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,260
Da Sheng, go up.

850
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,260
Are you waiting for me?

851
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,060
I'm wearing a pair of high-waist shoes.

852
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,660
I can't walk.

853
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,700
I'm late.

854
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,540
No.

855
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,500
You look really good today.

856
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,260
Really?

857
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,380
I feel uncomfortable.

858
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,700
And I'm fat.

859
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,260
No, no.

860
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,300
You look really good.

861
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:04,980
Let's go.

862
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
I've waited for you for three days.

863
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,420
Okay.

864
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,340
No, no, no.

865
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,100
Let's go.

866
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,260
Hello, master.

867
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:14,820
How is it?

868
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,140
Do you have any new progress?

869
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,900
I...

870
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
I...

871
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,380
I'll call you later, master.

872
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,100
Okay, bye.

873
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
You're so busy.

874
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,980
It's okay.

875
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Let's go out.

876
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,900
How about you go first?

877
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,580
What about your family?

878
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,740
No, I can explain.

879
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,180
Really?

880
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,980
It's okay.

881
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,500
I'm leaving.

882
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,580
Bye.

883
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,380
You're leaving?

884
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,900
Hurry up.

885
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,220
Call me when you're done.

886
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,260
Bye.

887
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,740
Bye.

888
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,420
What are you talking about?

889
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,180
You're a kid.

890
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,060
I didn't get you.

891
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,620
How can you wear this kind of clothes?

892
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,940
What's wrong with this kind of clothes?

893
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,060
Is this the clothes you wear at your age?

894
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,820
Do you know what the consequences

895
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,140
of your clothes running outside?

896
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,740
Zhong Jiangu, you're so ridiculous.

897
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,980
Don't talk nonsense.

898
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,060
Master,

899
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,860
what are you doing?

900
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,420
Stand up and let me see.

901
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,340
Get up.

902
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,340
Look at you.

903
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,220
You're so violent.

904
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,780
You're a criminal.

905
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,140
Master,

906
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,660
you're so biased.

907
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,020
What do you mean by criminal?

908
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,420
A criminal is a criminal.

909
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,460
It should be the perpetrators.

910
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,820
How can we blame girls for wearing this kind of clothes?

911
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,620
That's right.

912
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,500
Okay, go over there.

913
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,140
Wait for me.

914
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660
Keep your belly.

915
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,620
Master, what are you doing?

916
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,700
You want me to come over for a shopping?

917
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,820
Mom, look at this.

918
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,300
What's this?

919
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,380
A small sign.

920
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,740
Do you see it?

921
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,540
Is this the window of Zhongmei Bao's house?

922
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,260
Yes.

923
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,140
The brand of the North House is very small.

924
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,820
Only one place is sold for the whole box.

925
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,740
Mr. Zhui,

926
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,180
you're so lucky.

927
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,380
Your two daughters

928
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,700
are here to watch the hotel with you.

929
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,380
We're police.

930
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,860
What do you need to cooperate with?

931
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,500
We're doing a case.

932
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,300
Excuse me.

933
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,020
Have you seen this person?

934
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,220
He knows him.

935
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,140
Mr. Lin.

936
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,860
He's our VIP.

937
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,300
VIP?

938
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,100
He's been spending a lot here.

939
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,980
Of course.

940
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,060
He bought it by himself.

941
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,940
He introduced many clients

942
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,420
to the clients before and after.

943
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,100
He's a construction designer.

944
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,140
His friends are

945
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,300
more intelligent.

946
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,580
So he has to spend money on our products.

947
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,460
Such an important client.

948
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,020
Is your shop really good?

949
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,940
Of course.

950
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,180
We're the first in the world.

951
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,540
Even his kitchen

952
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,500
is our product.

953
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,820
How do you know it's a kitchen?

954
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,260
I'm sure you know.

955
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,180
The address he sent

956
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,820
is the same area as his.

957
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,100
I called him.

958
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,460
I said,

959
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,660
did the name of the house be wrong?

960
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,620
He said no.

961
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,660
He said the house

962
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,060
will be used to rent.

963
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,540
How about you

964
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,300
take a look at the clients?

965
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,140
Okay. Thank you.

966
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,140
Hello, everyone.

967
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,140
You're the one who's in charge of the shop, right?

968
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,740
Master.

969
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,420
I see.

970
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,020
This is not

971
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,020
a relationship between Zhou Wei Bao and Lin Da Zun.

972
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,220
If you rent the house,

973
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,020
don't say that you don't want to rent it.

974
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,900
Even if you rent the house,

975
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,700
it's impossible to

976
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,020
fit such a high-level bed.

977
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,100
Right?

978
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,780
You're in the same team

979
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,980
as the other guys.

980
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,420
You're so bold.

981
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,820
It seems

982
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,020
I have to meet

983
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,220
this Lin Da Jian.

984
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,420
I'm so tired.

985
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,220
I'm almost tired.

986
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
Lin Da Zun.

987
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,820
Go and take off my make-up.

988
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,020
I won't.

989
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,020
You won't take off my make-up?

990
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,820
I really won't.

991
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,020
Take that.

992
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,220
The paper towel.

993
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,820
You don't know the paper towel?

994
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,020
And the round make-up.

995
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,620
It's so thick on your face.

996
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,620
Go.

997
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,620
Go.

998
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,020
Okay.

999
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
On that table.

1000
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,020
Go.

1001
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,420
I'm almost sleepy.

1002
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Is this it?

1003
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Where is it?

1004
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,820
You can't see it.

1005
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,820
It's on my face.

1006
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,420
It's here.

1007
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
Here.

1008
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
Okay.

1009
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420
Don't move.

1010
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,420
What's this?

1011
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,820
It's not this.

1012
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,420
It's not this.

1013
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,420
The round one.

1014
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,820
The round one.

1015
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,420
Where is it?

1016
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,420
Where is it?

1017
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
Where is it?

1018
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
Where is it?

1019
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Where is it?

1020
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Where is it?

1021
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,420
Where is it?

1022
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
Where is it?

1023
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,420
Where is it?

1024
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
Where is it?

1025
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,420
Where is it?

1026
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,420
Where is it?

1027
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
Where is it?

1028
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Where is it?

1029
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
Where is it?

1030
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,420
Where is it?

1031
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,420
Where is it?

1032
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,420
Where is it?

1033
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
Where is it?

1034
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Where is it?

1035
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,420
Where is it?

1036
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
Where is it?

1037
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,420
Where is it?

1038
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
Where is it?

1039
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
Where is it?

1040
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,420
Where is it?

1041
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
Where is it?

1042
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,420
Where is it?

1043
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
Where is it?

1044
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,420
Where is it?

1045
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
Where is it?

1046
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,420
Hello.

1047
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Where are you?

1048
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,420
Brother Daz,

1049
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,420
it's me, Meibao.

1050
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Brother Daz.

1051
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
Brother Daz.

1052
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,420
Brother Daz.

1053
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,420
Brother Daz.

1054
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,420
Brother Daz.

1055
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,420
Brother Daz.

1056
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,420
Brother Daz.

1057
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Brother Daz.
