00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
The set of rear attack

00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,980
Episode 9

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,700
Beat and stop

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,560
Northwest girl

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,300
Yes

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,860
Let the girls wander through nature

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,780
And move, Smart Girl

8
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,420
You can't run away

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,100
city

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,400
Fly

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,640
Life isソユ

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,340
Come back

13
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,340
The End

14
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,340
The End

15
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,340
Episode 1

16
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,340
Zhong Mei Bao, isn't that your child?

17
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,340
He's the child from our distant relative.

18
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,340
Why did you bring him here?

19
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,340
That's what happened,

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,340
because our child is about to be born.

21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,340
And I heard that this child is not good at teaching.

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,340
I'm afraid that our daughter will be ruined.

23
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,340
You must have a plan to take care of the child.

24
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,340
Our school is the school of children.

25
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,340
The education system is also a strategy.

26
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,340
A Jun,

27
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,340
leaving you and Auntie Li's those years

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,340
is the most dangerous day in my life.

29
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,340
The End

30
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,340
Wake up.

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,340
Let me help you cut your hair.

32
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,340
Come down.

33
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,340
Come down quickly.

34
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,340
Be careful.

35
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,340
Hurry and go get it.

36
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,340
I'll show you something.

37
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,340
If the old witch finds out,

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,340
she'll be like this.

39
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Look, it's a sword.

40
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,340
This is all my treasure.

41
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,340
I'll show you how much I cut my hair.

42
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,340
My hair is like a dog's.

43
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,340
What's your name?

44
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,340
My name is Ding Xiaoli.

45
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
I'm Zhong Mei Bao.

46
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,340
It's okay.

47
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Don't worry.

48
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,340
Xiaoli's hands are fine.

49
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,340
Look at it.

50
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,340
If you think it's bad,

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
tell me.

52
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,340
This is it.

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,340
My goodness.

54
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,340
But do you know

55
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,340
I didn't expect

56
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,340
when the old angel was in this most dangerous time,

57
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,340
he gave me two lights

58
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,340
and asked me to give it to the most important friend in my life.

59
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,340
Please help me.

60
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,340
I told you.

61
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,340
The old angel almost saw us.

62
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
You're a coward.

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
What's this?

64
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,340
Stop it.

65
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Come and get it.

66
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,340
What?

67
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,340
I found it.

68
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,340
I found one.

69
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,340
Ding Xiaoli's dormitory is so popular.

70
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,340
Here's another one.

71
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,340
Ding Xiaoli is dressing up for the body.

72
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,340
It's so popular.

73
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,340
I knew they would write me.

74
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
I can't blame them.

75
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,340
Didn't the principal say

76
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,340
the people who don't know how to dress up will be punished?

77
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,340
He's the principal.

78
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,340
He wants us to report to the security.

79
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,340
He's a pervert.

80
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,340
Here's a good one.

81
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,340
Come here.

82
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,340
These are...

83
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,340
I think they're the principal's collection.

84
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,340
Didn't your brother learn piano?

85
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,340
Let's take this away.

86
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,340
This isn't good.

87
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,340
What's this?

88
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,340
Besides,

89
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,340
the principal told us

90
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,340
we can't listen to popular music.

91
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,340
We should listen to classical music.

92
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,340
We should play the piano.

93
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,340
He asked us to play the piano.

94
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,340
There are so many.

95
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
I can't find them.

96
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,340
Hurry up.

97
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,340
Hurry up.

98
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,340
Hurry up.

99
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Some classmates reported

100
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,340
that you three entered the principal's office.

101
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,340
I'll ask you one last time.

102
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,340
Who stole the principal's stuff?

103
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,340
They didn't say anything, did they?

104
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,340
Then do as the old rule says.

105
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,340
The person who stole the stuff first

106
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,340
can be punished.

107
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,340
If the thief stands out,

108
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,340
I'll be punished.

109
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
You're punished.

110
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,340
You're really a piece of cake.

111
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,340
Since you three admit your mistakes,

112
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,340
you three will be punished.

113
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,340
You said someone can be punished

114
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,340
by someone else.

115
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,340
How can you be punished?

116
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,340
Sir, he's lying.

117
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,340
I'm the one who's the one who's the thief.

118
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
They're all lying.

119
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
I'm the one who's the one who's the one.

120
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,340
It has nothing to do with them.

121
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,340
Enough.

122
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,340
Shut up.

123
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,340
The principal isn't a cold-blooded person.

124
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
How about this?

125
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,340
You three each give me a reason

126
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,340
to prove that you're more worthy of being punished than others.

127
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,340
I'll let go of the other two

128
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,340
for the best reason.

129
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
You start first.

130
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,340
I know my dad doesn't like girls.

131
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,340
He likes boys more.

132
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,340
Since he was a kid,

133
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,340
he doesn't agree with all my decisions.

134
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,340
I just wanted to make him angry,

135
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,340
so I kicked him out of the house

136
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,340
and got him married to Xiaoliu.

137
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,340
Since he likes boys,

138
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,340
I'll show him

139
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,340
all the things that boys can do.

140
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
Finally,

141
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,340
he's willing to give me a ride

142
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,340
to this place.

143
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
Guys,

144
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,340
do you think Li Mo Li

145
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
is unfilial?

146
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,340
Yes.

147
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,340
Next.

148
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,340
I always put on makeup at school,

149
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,340
dye my hair,

150
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,340
and all my classmates mocked me.

151
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,340
They said I was a bad girl.

152
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,340
I fought with them,

153
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,340
threw bricks on their windows,

154
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,340
but they all said it was not wrong.

155
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,340
I'm just a girl who's not stingy.

156
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
Guys,

157
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,340
do you think Ding Xiaoling

158
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,340
is very unfilial?

159
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,340
Yes.

160
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,340
Next.

161
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
I don't have a parents.

162
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,340
This is also called a reason.

163
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,340
It seems that you want to keep yourself

164
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,340
and abandon your friends.

165
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
I mean

166
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,340
if you punish them,

167
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,340
Xiaoliu's mother will punish you.

168
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,340
Mo Li's father will punish you for your life,

169
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,340
but I'm different from them.

170
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,340
I don't know who my father is.

171
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,340
My mother married a bastard,

172
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,340
and she was killed.

173
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,340
I was sent in

174
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,340
to avenge my father's death

175
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,340
for revenge.

176
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,340
So,

177
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,340
no matter how you torture me,

178
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,340
I won't cause you any trouble.

179
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,340
It seems that

180
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,340
it's your best reason.

181
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,340
Sir,

182
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,340
what kind of dog-fucking reason is this?

183
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
I won the fight.

184
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
No, I won the fight.

185
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,340
Shut up.

186
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,340
Come with me.

187
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
Ding Xiaoling.

188
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,340
Mo Li, come here.

189
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,340
Mo Li.

190
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
Mo Li.

191
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Mo Li.

192
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,340
Are you okay?

193
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,340
Does it hurt?

194
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
I'm fine.

195
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,340
It's all my fault.

196
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,340
I shouldn't have stolen your things.

197
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,340
It's my fault.

198
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,340
If it wasn't for my makeup,

199
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,340
it wouldn't have happened.

200
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,340
You're right.

201
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,340
It's your fault.

202
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,340
I've been punished.

203
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,340
Why did you come after me?

204
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,340
Look,

205
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,340
I'm getting thinner now.

206
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
You're getting thinner too.

207
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,340
You're so bad.

208
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
And,

209
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,340
don't blame yourself for being a bad guy.

210
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,340
Your father is also wrong.

211
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,340
And you.

212
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,340
You don't care about others' eyes, do you?

213
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,340
You should think about

214
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
the person who's very bad at the two-star-small thing.

215
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,340
He's the worst.

216
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,340
Mei Bao.

217
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,340
You don't have a family.

218
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
Xiaoling and I

219
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,340
have always been your family.

220
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,340
We've been together for a lifetime.

221
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,340
It's so painful.

222
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
Mo Lishou's injury.

223
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,340
The hospital checked it out.

224
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,340
It might have hurt the child.

225
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,340
His father was very angry after he found out.

226
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,340
He went to the police station to report.

227
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,340
He was almost blown away by the school.

228
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
Don't cry.

229
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,340
Go back and contact him.

230
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,340
Go back and contact me.

231
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,340
But I didn't expect that

232
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,340
the person

233
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,340
would appear in my life again.

234
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Mei Bao.

235
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,340
Let's go home.

236
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
I only knew I was going to stop running.

237
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,340
It seemed like a kind of escape.

238
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
In my mind,

239
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,340
there was only one thing.

240
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,340
I couldn't be found by him.

241
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
I couldn't.

242
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,340
But no matter where I went,

243
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,340
he seemed to find me.

244
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,340
He tried to get your information from me.

245
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
So he forgave me

246
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,340
for not contacting you for so long.

247
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Because I was really scared

248
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,340
that he would appear in your life again.

249
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,340
At that time, I told myself

250
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
that even if I had been running for my whole life,

251
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,340
I couldn't let him find you through me.

252
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
What made me feel that

253
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
I heard that you had already

254
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,340
passed the music school.

255
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,340
You and Aunt Li also changed your name.

256
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
Your new life.

257
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,340
I'm sorry, you're still so hot.

258
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,340
I worked in various coffee shops.

259
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,340
I started learning from making coffee.

260
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,340
I was able to make desserts.

261
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,340
That's how I've lived my life for years.

262
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,340
The coffee you wanted was so good.

263
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
The number of times he found me

264
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,340
was getting less and less.

265
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,340
My life seemed to have improved.

266
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,340
Maybe you think

267
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,340
I've lost your life.

268
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,340
But actually,

269
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,340
I've been following you

270
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
in my own way.

271
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
I've seen

272
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,340
all your growth.

273
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,340
In my heart,

274
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
you've never left me.

275
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
After hearing that,

276
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
did you have any

277
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
any flaws in the concert?

278
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
A little flaw?

279
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
Wait a minute.

280
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,340
I'm sorry.

281
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
Did you have any flaws

282
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
in the whole concert?

283
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
There are only some tickets

284
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
in the middle.

285
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,340
Do you need any?

286
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
Sure.

287
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
Please try to

288
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,340
follow me.

289
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,340
How much?

290
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,340
900 yuan.

291
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,340
900 yuan for the later ones?

292
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
Yes.

293
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
Now it's this price.

294
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,340
Thank you.

295
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
Seeing your performance,

296
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,340
it's getting better and better.

297
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,340
I'm very happy.

298
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,340
Take care.

299
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
Take care.

300
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,340
Take care.

301
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,340
I don't know

302
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,140
I don't know how many times I've thought about

303
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,620
how you looked like after growing up on the stage.

304
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,860
That moment, I realized

305
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,820
that I was just like a toy.

306
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,940
Delicious

307
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,180
Like cookies

308
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,540
Mac Bing

309
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,160
Mac Bing

310
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,340
I don't care which city I've been to these years.

311
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,340
I can find me every month.

312
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,340
So I think...

313
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,340
But there's no way to hide like this.

314
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
When can you hide?

315
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340
But I don't have any other way now.

316
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,340
I don't want to be like Li Lian.

317
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,340
I don't want to be like Li Lian.

318
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,340
I'm a little worried about him now.

319
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,340
But he's getting better.

320
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,340
For the past ten years,

321
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
Jun has been doing well

322
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,340
and is good at getting married.

323
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,340
He eats well and sleeps well.

324
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,340
Because you're his only place in life.

325
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,340
Are you really going to stay with him?

326
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,340
Aunt Li,

327
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,340
I really hope Jun can forget about this.

328
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,340
Forget about Ye Yongyuan.

329
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
He can only live in this way

330
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
in the real world.

331
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
When will you start living your own life?

332
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,340
Will there be more ways

333
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,340
when the three of us are together?

334
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,340
I'm not better than you.

335
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
I'll give you our contact information.

336
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,340
Okay?

337
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
I'll wait for you with Jun.

338
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,340
After talking to Aunt Yan,

339
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,340
I started to think about

340
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,340
the day when the end of the show.

341
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,340
I would have been with you.

342
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,340
Coming.

343
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,340
Coming.

344
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,340
Coming.

345
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,340
Coming.

346
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Hi.

347
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,340
Hi.

348
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,340
It's you.

349
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
Hi.

350
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,340
It's you.

351
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
Sit down.

352
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
I'll tell you.

353
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,340
Come here.

354
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
I brought you music.

355
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
I'm so tired today.

356
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340
Thank you.

357
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
I'm so tired.

358
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
I'm getting married.

359
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,340
You're so happy this time.

360
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
I'm so happy.

361
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,340
Hurry up.

362
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
You're so busy.

363
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
Come on.

364
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,340
What if you get a bad one?

365
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Hurry up.

366
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
Come on.

367
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,340
You.

368
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,340
Come on.

369
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,340
Let's drink.

370
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
Cheers.

371
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,340
Thank you.

372
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,340
If not for you,

373
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,340
I might not be this good.

374
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,340
What's wrong?

375
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,340
Drink more.

376
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,340
Mei Bao, Xiaoli.

377
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,340
Take your hands off.

378
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,340
Take your hands off.

379
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,340
You two

380
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,340
are my life.

381
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,340
The most important person.

382
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,340
What's wrong with you?

383
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
You're wearing a wedding dress.

384
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,340
There's another person.

385
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
Did you forget?

386
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,340
I forgot.

387
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
I just got married to you.

388
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,340
She...

389
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,340
No.

390
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
I know.

391
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
She's right.

392
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
It's over.

393
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
It's over.

394
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,340
Hello.

395
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,340
Hello, Brother Da Shan.

396
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,340
What's up?

397
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,340
I heard you got married today.

398
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
Why didn't you tell me?

399
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,340
Mei Bao.

400
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,340
It's not funny.

401
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,340
I got it.

402
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,340
Don't say that.

403
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,340
Okay.

404
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,340
Mo Li asked me to call you.

405
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,340
He said he forgot to tell you

406
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,340
how much he loves you.

407
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,340
Super!

408
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340
Super!

409
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,340
Super!

410
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
Super!

411
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Super!

412
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
Super!

413
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
Super!

414
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,340
Super!

415
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
Super!

416
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,340
Super!

417
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
Super!

418
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,340
Give it to me.

419
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,340
Hello.

420
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
Hello, Brother Da Shan.

421
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,340
It's me.

422
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,340
Wife.

423
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,340
You've worked hard

424
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
for today's wedding.

425
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
It's okay.

426
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,340
It's okay.

427
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,340
I can't

428
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,340
go to

429
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,340
your mother's house.

430
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,340
It's okay.

431
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,340
Hello, I'm going to

432
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,340
have a talk with your sister.

433
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,340
I'll go back to the toilet.

434
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,340
You're going to the toilet, right?

435
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,340
It's okay.

436
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,340
But don't come back too late.

437
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,340
Okay.

438
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,340
Bye.

439
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,340
Bye.

440
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
Mei Bao,

441
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,340
I've already got married.

442
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,340
Xiaoling has talked about so many men.

443
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
I've talked about so many men.

444
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
You've talked about so many men.

445
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,340
I've never had a boyfriend, okay?

446
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,340
No.

447
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,340
I've talked about so many men.

448
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,340
I've talked about so many men.

449
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,340
Xiaoling,

450
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
is it not a disadvantage?

451
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,340
Everyone said

452
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,340
Super!

453
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,340
Super!

454
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
What are you doing?

455
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,340
Miss, do you have any interest in this store?

456
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
Yes.

457
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
Then take a look.

458
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
Okay.

459
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,340
Tell me if you want to rent it.

460
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,340
Okay, thank you.

461
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,340
Let's go.

462
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
What's the situation?

463
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,340
What's the situation?

464
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
I remember that

465
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
I suddenly remembered

466
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
that someone said that

467
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,340
when he was a kid,

468
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,340
he wanted to make a coffee shop

469
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,340
and then he was in a hurry

470
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,340
to invite his friends.

471
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,340
Then he said,

472
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
right,

473
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,340
I've been in the military service for so many years.

474
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
Don't always make a daydream.

475
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,340
You have to make a real action.

476
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,340
That's right.

477
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,340
Right?

478
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
I'm with Da Sen now.

479
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,340
I suddenly felt that

480
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
maybe God let me come to this city

481
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,340
at this time

482
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,340
and come to my friend's house.

483
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,340
I came to this shop

484
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,340
just to tell me

485
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,340
that it's time to change.

486
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,340
When I'm coming to your group,

487
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,340
I can live with the person I love the most.

488
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,340
I can do what I like the most.

489
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,340
But these are not

490
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
a dream that is not to be achieved.

491
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,340
Instead, it's reality.

492
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,340
An Jun,

493
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
I know you're acting in the outside world.

494
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,340
But I want you to know

495
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,340
this decision first.

496
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,340
So I wrote this letter for you.

497
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,340
Maybe it's a little bit awkward.

498
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,340
But actually,

499
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,340
there are many things I want to tell you.

500
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,340
Excuse me.

501
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,340
Are you looking for a movie?

502
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,340
Sister.

503
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
Sister.

504
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,340
I'll give you my address.

505
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,340
When are you going to open the movie?

506
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,340
When the time comes,

507
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,340
you can

508
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,340
call Aunt Yaya to help.

509
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,340
Come on.

510
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
Open it.

511
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
Sister.

512
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
Sister.

513
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Officer Chong.

514
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,340
Did I have to kill him?

515
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,340
No.

516
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
And do you know

517
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,340
you did this on purpose

518
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,340
to hurt him?

519
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,340
You need to take responsibility.

520
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,340
I'm sorry.

521
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,340
I'm sorry.

522
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,340
I'm sorry.

523
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,340
I'm sorry.

524
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,340
I'm sorry.

525
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,340
I'm sorry.

526
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,340
It's all my fault.

527
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,340
If I hadn't moved here,

528
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
nothing would have happened.

529
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,340
When Zhong Wei Bao decided to move to Shuang He,

530
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,340
did he think

531
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,340
the danger of the actors

532
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
would be exposed?

533
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,340
He didn't eat the food that Aunt Yaya cooked.

534
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,340
Eat more.

535
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,340
What's wrong?

536
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,340
Sister.

537
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,340
Can you

538
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
help me with this?

539
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,340
I discussed this with Aunt Yaya before.

540
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,340
But I think we should be more cautious now.

541
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
I'm going to arrange the work

542
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,340
in the neighborhood today.

543
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
So that we can

544
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,340
at least

545
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,340
go out.

546
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,340
Jun,

547
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,340
you're very stable now.

548
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,340
Don't you know

549
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,340
your company

550
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
can't be exposed?

551
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
I know what you're thinking.

552
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,340
But you need to know

553
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
that you're a professional now.

554
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
You need to forget

555
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,340
everything that was done before.

556
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,340
Including Yan Yong Yuan,

557
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,340
including Zhong Mei Bao.

558
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,340
You need to

559
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,340
erase all of these names

560
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,340
in your memory.

561
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,340
Drink some soup.

562
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
But no matter what,

563
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,340
we're family.

564
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,340
Although we can't meet often now,

565
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
we'll always be by your side.

566
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,340
All right.

567
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,340
Let's eat.

568
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,340
It's useless to say that

569
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,340
the evidence is not useful.

570
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,340
It's all the memories

571
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,340
of her and her sister.

572
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
Yan Yong Yuan.

573
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,340
Master.

574
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,340
Master, look.

575
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
Captain Dong,

576
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
someone brought me here.

577
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
Sit down.

578
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,340
Yan Yong Yuan.

579
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,340
Today, we invited you here

580
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,340
mainly because

581
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,340
we found that

582
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
in the recent year,

583
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
you haven't recorded

584
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
any daily life.

585
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,340
You haven't made a train,

586
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,340
and you haven't lived in a hotel.

587
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,340
Your phone number

588
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,340
is automatically消耗

589
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
due to the fee.

590
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,340
You don't even have

591
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
any money to move.

592
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,340
Where have you been

593
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
in the past year?

594
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
Zhong Mei Bao

595
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,340
locked me up.

596
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,340
Where did he lock you up?

597
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
At home.

598
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
Why didn't you say it earlier?

599
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,340
He has two accomplices.

600
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,340
I'm afraid that

601
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,340
they will take revenge.

602
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,340
Who?

603
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,340
I don't know who they are.

604
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
Look at this.

605
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,340
The accomplices you said

606
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,340
are they in these people?

607
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,340
Yan Yong Yuan said

608
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,340
you and Ding Xiaoling

609
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,340
were involved in Zhong Mei Bao's murder.

610
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
You even

611
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,340
locked him up

612
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
in Zhong Mei Bao's room.

613
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
Is that right?

614
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
He's lying.

615
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,340
I didn't lock him up.

616
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
He locked me up.

617
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,340
So,

618
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
you admit that you locked him up.

619
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,340
Is that right?

620
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
Because of Yan Yong Yuan's investigation,

621
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,340
Ye Shujun

622
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,340
could only be involved in these business

623
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
and even get a job.

624
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,340
After Mei Bao found out about this,

625
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,340
he kept on

626
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
taking care of Yan Yong Yuan.

627
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
So, Yan Yong Yuan

628
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,340
started to find

629
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,340
Mei Bao's trouble.

630
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,340
Enough.

631
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,340
You're playing very high-level now.

632
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
Get up.

633
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
It's very comfortable.

634
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,340
This bed is very expensive.

635
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,340
And these furniture.

636
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,340
Why are you talking so much?

637
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
Take them away.

638
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,340
You took a lot of money

639
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,340
from A Jing, right?

640
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,340
This is the 100,000 yuan you want.

641
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,340
I'm begging you.

642
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,340
This is the last time.

643
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,340
You'll be punished by the law sooner or later.

644
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,340
The last time

645
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,340
is not the time you said it.

646
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,340
It's like

647
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,340
you're like

648
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
your mother.

649
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,340
You're a dirty bitch.

650
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,340
What are you doing?

651
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,340
You think we don't dare to report to the police?

652
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
You're a man.

653
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,340
Li Guilan.

654
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,340
Wait.

655
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,340
You're a scumbag.

656
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,340
Excuse me.

657
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
You're a beautiful girl.

658
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
It's me.

659
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,340
You were in the same place

660
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
as the one who sold the children.

661
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,340
Please cooperate to accept our investigation.

662
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
What do you want?

663
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
You're a scumbag.

664
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,340
Why did you go to get Aunt Ye?

665
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,340
Aunt Ye?

666
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
You said Li Guilan, right?

667
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,340
I didn't get her.

668
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,340
I didn't get her.

669
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,340
It's a hot-blooded group of immigrants.

670
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
It's not important.

671
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
It must be you.

672
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,340
But I can

673
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,340
tell you the police

674
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,340
as the background of the second family.

675
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,340
That means

676
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,340
it's a misunderstanding.

677
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,340
Li Guilan can stop working.

678
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,340
Tell me.

679
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,340
How much money do you want this time?

680
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,340
How much?

681
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,340
I want to take a step back this time.

682
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
One thousand thousand.

683
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,340
One thousand thousand? Are you crazy?

684
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
There are quite a lot of things going on.

685
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
But

686
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,340
you can work hard.

687
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,340
Your brother's future

688
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
and your Guilan

689
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
don't need to work hard.

690
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,340
You can buy it one by one.

691
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,340
You're so stupid.

692
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
Let go of me.

693
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,340
Let go of me.

694
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
Let go of me.

695
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,340
We were in a fight at that time.

696
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,340
I saw Aunt Ye

697
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
playing the game of beauty.

698
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,340
Let go of her.

699
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,340
Let go of me.

700
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,340
Let go of me.

701
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
Don't hit her.

702
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Don't hit her.

703
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Hit her.

704
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
Under the circumstances,

705
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
I married Yan Yu.

706
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,340
I married Yan Yu.

707
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,340
I was anxious

708
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
and I married Yan Yu.

709
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
Are you sure?

710
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,340
Yan Yu didn't say that.

711
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
He promised me that it was Zhou Meibao.

712
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,340
Meibao.

713
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
Meibao.

714
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
Meibao.

715
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
Meibao, stop it.

716
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
I'll kill him.

717
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,340
I locked Yan Yu up.

718
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,340
Really?

719
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,340
But Ding Xiaoling said

720
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,340
it was my idea.

721
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,340
Meibao locked Yan Yu up.

722
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,340
It was Zhou Meibao's idea, right?

723
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
Why did you lock him up?

724
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Is he dead?

725
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
He's still alive.

726
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,340
I'm going to kill him.

727
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,340
No.

728
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
I'm going to kill him.

729
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Xiaoling.

730
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
No.

731
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
No.

732
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
If he was sent to the hospital,

733
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,340
he would be killed.

734
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
He would be killed

735
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,340
if he didn't become a murderer.

736
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,340
If he wasn't dead,

737
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
he would continue to be like me.

738
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Ajun should have a good life.

739
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,340
I don't want him to be a burden anymore.

740
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,340
That means

741
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,340
at that time,

742
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Zhou Meibao decided

743
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
to marry Yan Yu.

744
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,340
I've said it many times.

745
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
It was me.

746
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,340
I locked him up.

747
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
I locked him up.

748
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,340
Because we didn't know

749
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,340
whether he was dead or alive.

750
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,340
It was either for Meibao

751
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,340
or for Ye Shujun.

752
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,340
This is the best way.

753
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,340
There's one more thing.

754
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,340
If Yan Yu is in this prison,

755
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
Meibao must be the first one

756
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
to be suspected.

757
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,340
We have to find a way

758
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
to find out the truth.

759
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
I have a way.

760
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,340
When I was shopping with Meibao,

761
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,340
I often bought the same clothes and shoes.

762
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
The day he was dressed up,

763
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
my family had the same suit.

764
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
So I returned to my family

765
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,340
and changed my clothes.

766
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,340
I dressed up as Meibao

767
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,340
and appeared in the surveillance camera.

768
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
I had time to deal with Yan Yu.

769
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,340
I don't understand.

770
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,340
Why didn't you go to the rooftop

771
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,340
and make a statement

772
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
without the scene?

773
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,340
Why did you

774
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,340
pretend to be him

775
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,340
in such a big mess?

776
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,340
Because we needed

777
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,340
a person's help.

778
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,340
We needed Meibao to help.

779
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
Actually,

780
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
everyone has his own secret.

781
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,340
I know you like Meibao.

782
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,340
I also know

783
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
you are hiding some secrets from him.

784
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
But have you ever thought about it?

785
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,340
Are you really helping them

786
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
in this way?

787
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
Because in my opinion,

788
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
you are doing these things

789
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,340
more like helping the murderer.

790
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,340
Now,

791
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
Ding Xiaolin and Li Moly

792
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
have already admitted

793
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,340
the fact that they are close to Yan Yu.

794
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
If I were you,

795
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
I would definitely

796
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
go to the court to prove it.

797
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
It's Yan Yu's fault

798
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
that Yan Yu killed Zhong Beibao.

799
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,340
It doesn't matter

800
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
what the others do with this.

801
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
Mr. Xue,

802
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
can you

803
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,340
think about it again?

804
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
Tell me everything

805
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,340
you know.

806
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,340
Meibao,

807
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,340
you are the one who won.

808
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
Thank you.

809
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,340
I'm sorry

810
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,340
for running so late.

811
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,340
The other shop is closed.

812
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,340
It's okay.

813
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Do you want me to help you?

814
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
Do you want me to help you?

815
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,340
Just some messy things

816
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,340
in the kitchen.

817
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
I can do it myself.

818
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Okay.

819
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,340
Then you can call me anytime.

820
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
I'll have some food

821
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
tonight.

822
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,340
Okay, thank you.

823
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,340
I'm leaving then.

824
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,340
Bye.

825
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,340
Hello, Mo Li.

826
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,340
We are almost done here.

827
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,340
The court is under the control of

828
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
how you are going to

829
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,340
move Yan Yu's life

830
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,340
to Zhong Beibao's house

831
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,340
under the other's eyes.

832
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
I'm not quite sure about that.

833
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Actually,

834
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,340
I was

835
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,340
trying to get the money

836
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,340
from the money

837
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
that I got.

838
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
But I was too busy

839
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
to get the money.

840
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
I was too busy

841
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
to get the money.

842
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
I was too busy

843
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,340
to get the money.

844
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,340
Usually I could

845
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,300
use the money

846
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
I'm getting to know

847
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,340
later that I was outside.

848
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,340
But

849
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,340
we didn't know

850
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
what to do anymore.

851
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,340
That's why

852
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,340
we did something

853
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
I thought God might have

854
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
� broken our engagement.

855
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,340
What a special day.

856
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,340
Now he is my fiancée,

857
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,100
After the store that day, I saw Mei Bao

858
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,340
taking a big luggage box and moving to the big building.

859
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:39,740
Mei Bao, what are you doing? I'll help you.

860
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,540
It's okay. I can do it myself. I can do it.

861
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,340
The elevator is not needed. It's 20 floors.

862
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,740
It's okay. I can really do it.

863
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,340
By the way, thank you for those things.

864
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:46,940
Let me help you.

865
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,940
You don't have to help me.

866
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Don't be so polite.

867
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,340
I'm really fine.

868
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,140
Come, let me help you.

869
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
Go.

870
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,340
Let's go.

871
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
Let's go.

872
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,940
We're here.

873
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,940
It's hard.

874
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,940
It's okay.

875
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,940
Let's go this way.

876
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
Okay.

877
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,940
Thank you.

878
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
Thank you.

879
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,940
Thank you.

880
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,940
Thank you.

881
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,940
Let's go.

882
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
Let's go.

883
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,940
Mei Bao told me everything.

884
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,340
She did it

885
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,940
and she had no choice.

886
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,340
She wanted to let herself go

887
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,740
and let her brother get away from the burden.

888
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,340
On that night,

889
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,540
why did you and Zhong Mei Bao

890
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,340
appear at the same time?

891
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,740
Is this your plan?

892
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,740
No.

893
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,740
I'm not.

894
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,740
I'm not.

895
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,740
That's right.

896
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,540
That's actually an accident.

897
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,540
Mei Bao, come up.

898
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,740
I'll be there soon.

899
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,140
Okay.

900
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,540
My husband is a little uncomfortable.

901
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
I'm going back.

902
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,140
Don't you want to see me?

903
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,940
I can't see him now.

904
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,940
I want to go back.

905
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,940
I'll take you back.

906
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,940
Okay.

907
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,540
Mr. Lin, long time no see.

908
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,740
What a coincidence.

909
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,740
You're here to see me.

910
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,740
Yes.

911
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,340
Happy New Year.

912
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,340
Happy New Year.

913
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,740
By the way, Mo Li,

914
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,740
it's been a long time since I met my father.

915
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,740
How's he?

916
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,740
He's fine.

917
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,740
We're leaving now.

918
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,740
Wait a minute.

919
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,740
Wait a minute.

920
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,740
I just changed my phone.

921
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,740
Can you call him?

922
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,740
Happy New Year.

923
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,740
Happy New Year.

924
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,740
Happy New Year.

925
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,740
Happy New Year.

926
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
Happy New Year.

927
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,740
He's a big uncle.

928
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,740
Look at my foot.

929
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,740
He's so cute.

930
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
So cute.

931
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,740
He's so cute.

932
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,740
Happy New Year.

933
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,740
I love you.

934
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,740
No difference is the age between two.

935
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,740
Five.

936
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,740
Five.

937
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,740
That's it for our dayz.

938
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,260
You two go have a

939
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,980
little dinner.

940
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,780
Don't fight.

941
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:50,980
Don't fight.

942
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,780
Are you okay?

943
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,180
I'm fine.

944
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,380
Ladies and gentlemen,

945
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,780
let's continue to appreciate the new year.

946
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,380
Okay?

947
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,780
Happy New Year.

948
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,580
Wish you all the best.

949
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,780
So, Zhong Mei Bao

950
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,180
is not the lover of Mr. Lin?

951
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,980
Mr. Lin Mo Yu,

952
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,580
you once said

953
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,980
that Mr. Lin and Zhong Mei Bao are in love.

954
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,580
According to our investigation,

955
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,580
the house Zhong Mei Bao lives in

956
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,180
was moved by the villagers and the people.

957
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,380
You lied to us before.

958
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,780
So, are you ready to tell the truth?

959
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,380
We had been in the hospital for half a year.

960
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,380
One day, Mei Bao told me

961
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,180
that the house she lives in

962
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,780
might be sold by the landlord.

963
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,380
She's going to prepare for the move.

964
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,180
I want the house.

965
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,780
Please contact the owner.

966
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,980
No problem.

967
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,780
But to be honest,

968
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,780
the price of the house is a bit high.

969
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,580
How about this?

970
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,980
I'll ask you again.

971
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,580
Let's see if you can help me.

972
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:55,980
I'll check the house.

973
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,580
No need to ask.

974
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,780
I don't want to see the house.

975
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,380
Please contact the owner.

976
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,180
Thank you.

977
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,180
Okay.

978
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,580
Ma'am,

979
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,180
look at the wall.

980
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,780
This is it.

981
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,180
Let's take a look.

982
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,580
By the way,

983
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,580
Mr. Lin,

984
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
who lives in the house

985
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,780
downstairs and upstairs?

986
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,780
Who lives here?

987
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,580
The one who lives in the house in 2002

988
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
is Miss Wu from the school.

989
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,980
No one else lives in the house.

990
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,180
Actually, the owner

991
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,180
wanted to sell the house.

992
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,380
It's because the price is high.

993
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,180
He didn't even sell it till now.

994
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,580
At first,

995
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Lin didn't let me

996
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,980
hang out the house.

997
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,580
He said he wanted to invest.

998
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,980
But the house is a bit high now.

999
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,580
He wanted to stay for a while.

1000
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,380
He wanted to sell it after the house is closed.

1001
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,380
Did you believe him at that time?

1002
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,980
Actually, I didn't believe anything.

1003
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,980
Since he likes me,

1004
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,380
I'm willing to do something

1005
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,380
for the person I like.

1006
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,180
Help!

1007
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,980
Help!

1008
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,980
Then,

1009
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:14,980
what you said before,

1010
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:15,980
we should go to the 3rd floor

1011
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,380
by the air-conditioning hall.

1012
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,580
It's a lie.

1013
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,180
How can we do it?

1014
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,980
Miss Wu, can you recall

1015
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,380
what's wrong with Zhou Meibao

1016
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,380
before he was born?

1017
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,180
Zhou Meibao?

1018
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,180
Zhou Meibao?

1019
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,180
Zhou Meibao?

1020
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,780
Zhou Meibao?

1021
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,180
Zhou Meibao?

1022
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,580
Zhou Meibao?

1023
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,980
I want to go home.

1024
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,780
I want to go home.

1025
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,980
Zhou Meibao?

1026
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,980
I want to go home.

1027
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,580
You can go to the 3rd floor too.

1028
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,980
Go to the 3rd floor.

1029
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,780
Zhou Meibao?

1030
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,780
I want to go home.

1031
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,580
Zhou Meibao?

1032
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,980
This is the fever medicine.

1033
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,780
Are you okay?

1034
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,380
Why do you want to eat it?

1035
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,380
I'm fine after I die.

1036
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,580
You love to eat.

1037
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,980
I'll put it here.

1038
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,580
You're so mean.

1039
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,380
I'm telling you,

1040
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,580
you can't blame me for my whole life.

1041
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,180
One day,

1042
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,980
you'll let me go.

1043
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,780
You'll be so happy.

1044
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,380
You'll be so happy

1045
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,580
that you'll get everything you need.

1046
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,980
You'll be ruined in a moment.

1047
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,380
So I'm telling you,

1048
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,380
I'm telling you to kill me.

1049
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,180
Otherwise,

1050
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,380
you'll die yourself.

1051
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,780
You'll die yourself.

1052
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,980
Zhou Meibao!

1053
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,580
Zhou Meibao,

1054
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,180
you and her,

1055
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,180
you'll be in my sight.

1056
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,580
I can't take it anymore.

1057
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,780
I can't blame her for my whole life.

1058
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,180
She's like a weak woman.

1059
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,780
She's been pestering me since I was a kid.

1060
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,980
I've been trying so hard

1061
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,180
to get rid of her.

1062
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,380
Why can't she get rid of me?

1063
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,780
She's become a part of my life.

1064
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,580
Yin Yue,

1065
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,380
tell me, what can I do?

1066
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,980
Why should I take it seriously?

1067
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,980
Why?

1068
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,980
Why should I take it seriously?

1069
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,780
I should make a choice, right?

1070
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,980
To end this?

1071
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,980
I'm sure

1072
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,180
that Yan Youyuan

1073
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,180
is the murderer who killed He Meibao.

1074
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,380
Although Mei Bao asked me to go to Yan Youyuan,

1075
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,980
I'm sure he's the murderer who killed He Meibao.

1076
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,380
But Yan Youyuan

1077
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,380
saved Mei Bao's life.

1078
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,580
Where are you when the case is over?

1079
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,380
When Mei Bao was in trouble,

1080
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,180
we were listening to Ye Shujing's piano performance.

1081
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,380
So we were all absent at that time.

1082
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,980
Yan Youyuan must have killed him.

1083
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,980
I admit that we were in a relationship.

1084
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,580
But it's just that it means that he's still in the scene.

1085
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,580
Isn't it obvious that he's the murderer?

1086
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,580
Actually, that morning,

1087
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,580
Mei Bao sent us three tickets to the concert.

1088
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,780
But I felt a little strange

1089
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,580
when I came to the scene.

1090
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,180
Why didn't I see Mei Bao?

1091
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,580
They put the medicine in my room.

1092
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,980
They let me sleep in a secret room every day.

1093
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,380
I didn't have any strength to resist.

1094
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,580
One day,

1095
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,980
when I woke up,

1096
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,780
what are you doing?

1097
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,380
What are you doing?

1098
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,580
This nightmare is finally going to end.

1099
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,180
Mei.

1100
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,780
Are you okay?

1101
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,980
I'm fine.

1102
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,580
I'm really fine.

1103
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,180
Don't worry. I'm really fine.

1104
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,380
No need. I'm really fine.

1105
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,180
It's probably because I was in a coma.

1106
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,580
I was too slow to breathe.

1107
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,580
I was still alive.

1108
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,180
Mei Bao.

1109
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,780
Mei Bao.

1110
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,180
What's the smell?

1111
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,380
Mei Bao.

1112
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,380
Mei Bao.

1113
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,780
Mei Bao.

1114
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,180
Mei Bao.

1115
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,980
Are you sure you saw them?

1116
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,980
Yes, they are.

1117
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,580
We didn't meet them.

1118
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,980
We were watching the show.

1119
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,180
The show ended at 10 o'clock.

1120
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,180
But you were in the ambulance at that time.

1121
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,580
We...

1122
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,180
We left in the middle of the day.

1123
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,580
Because Mei Bao's phone was not working.

1124
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,780
We were worried about what happened to her.

1125
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,380
When we came back,

1126
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,580
Lu Xia had a lot of cars.

1127
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,580
Did you come back before or after the hotel?

1128
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,580
Did you hear that?

1129
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,580
Yes.

1130
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,580
The elevator can't be used tomorrow.

1131
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:13,780
Chongqing,

1132
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,780
Li Mo Li is a pregnant woman.

1133
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,580
How could a pregnant woman climb the stairs 20 times?

1134
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,580
Right?

1135
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,580
What kind of clothes did they wear?

1136
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,980
One person wears pink clothes.

1137
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,180
The other wears black clothes.

1138
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,380
The other wears pink clothes.

1139
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,180
The elevator shows

1140
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,180
the same as Yan Yong Yuan's.

1141
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,780
You are indeed at the top of the elevator.

1142
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,980
Your wife has admitted it.

1143
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,380
You didn't sell the house to Zhong Mei Bao.

1144
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,780
You didn't give her money.

1145
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,980
You two are not the real family.

1146
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,980
You made up all these.

1147
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,980
You know what?

1148
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,980
You are likely to be a laborer.

1149
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,380
Do you want your child

1150
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,380
to have no mother in the future?

1151
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,780
Okay.

1152
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,780
Zhong Jin Wan,

1153
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,380
Mo Li and I have been together for a long time.

1154
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,380
We have finally met now.

1155
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,780
He has finally given birth to my child.

1156
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,580
I have no choice.

1157
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,780
I want to help him.

1158
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,980
I want to protect him.

1159
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,580
I think he should protect our family.

1160
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:08,980
Mo Li!

1161
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,980
Mo Li!

1162
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,380
Don't do this.

1163
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,780
Get up.

1164
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,380
Get up.

1165
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,380
Don't do this.

1166
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,380
Don't do this.

1167
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,380
Don't do this.

1168
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,780
Da Si, hurry up and help me.

1169
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:21,980
Wife.

1170
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:22,780
I'm sorry.

1171
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:23,780
Wife.

1172
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:24,780
Don't do this.

1173
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,380
Wife.

1174
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,180
Da Si, help him to the hospital.

1175
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,380
I will explain to you later.

1176
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,780
I will explain to you later.

1177
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:31,980
Wife.

1178
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:32,980
Wife.

1179
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,580
Wife.

1180
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:33,980
Da Si.

1181
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:34,580
Da Si.

1182
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,380
Wife.

1183
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,780
Wife.

1184
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:38,980
I'm here.

1185
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,780
I'm here.

1186
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:41,980
Let's go.

1187
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,380
Before you save Chen Jinxin,

1188
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,780
Mo Li told me everything.

1189
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,580
Then do you know he committed a crime?

1190
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,380
Wife.

1191
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,580
Wife.

1192
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,180
Wife.

1193
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,180
Wife.

1194
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,180
You didn't save so much money for investment.

1195
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,380
You bought this house

1196
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,580
not to pay for the house rent, right?

1197
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,580
Wife.

1198
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,580
I found a way to drink.

1199
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,580
When Jinxin comes,

1200
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,980
he will be in your head soon.

1201
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,580
I will be a bad guy.

1202
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,380
You will be a criminal.

1203
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,180
For the sake of your child,

1204
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,380
I will deal with it.

1205
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,980
Wife, I'm sorry.

1206
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,980
I'm sorry.

1207
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:46,780
Don't worry.

1208
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,380
Don't worry.

1209
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,580
Wife.

1210
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,580
We will come back.

1211
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,980
Move.

1212
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:24,980
Move.

1213
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,180
I know what you are doing.

1214
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,580
If anything happens,

1215
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,980
I will tell you at the most.

1216
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,980
I will tell you at the most.

1217
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,580
Bao Luo,

1218
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,980
I'm sorry.

1219
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,580
I didn't mean to kill you.

1220
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,580
We saw the surveillance video.

1221
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,980
The clothes you wore that day

1222
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,380
were completely linked to the description of Yan Yongyuan.

1223
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,580
So,

1224
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,980
Yan Yongyuan is sure to meet you.

1225
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,180
You still insist

1226
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,380
that you haven't appeared in the crime scene, right?

1227
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,580
Your husband just now

1228
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,580
admitted that

1229
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,580
he took away all the fingerprints

1230
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,780
on the crime scene.

1231
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,180
You knew the truth.

1232
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,180
Why didn't you tell me?

1233
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,180
If I told you the truth,

1234
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,380
you would make the criminal laugh.

1235
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,380
What should I do?

1236
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,780
You should tell me more.

1237
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,180
This way, we can know

1238
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,180
if the bad guy did something bad.

1239
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,180
I want to ask you.

1240
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,180
Do you think this is a good idea?

1241
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,580
Yes.

1242
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,380
I think it's a good idea.

1243
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,380
Can you ask me

1244
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,580
if you think it's fair

1245
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,380
to do anything in this world?

1246
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,380
Can justice really get a reward?

1247
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,580
You just need to tell me the truth.

1248
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,780
I have nothing to say.

1249
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,180
Miss,

1250
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,380
do you remember what you said

1251
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,180
when you sat here for the first time?

1252
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,180
I asked you

1253
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,380
what your opinion on Zhong Mei Bao was.

1254
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,980
Do you remember how you answered me?

1255
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,180
He is not a person in this world.

1256
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,780
So I have no hatred for him.

1257
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,580
Whether he is alive or dead,

1258
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,780
it has nothing to do with me.

1259
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,380
Miss Li,

1260
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:59,780
can you say the same thing again?

1261
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,580
Can you say it again?

1262
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,780
Does Zhong Mei Bao have nothing to do with you?

1263
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,580
Can I go to the washroom?

1264
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,380
Yes.

1265
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:18,780
Yes.

1266
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,380
Cheng Xin.

1267
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:48,980
Cheng Xin.

1268
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,980
Zhong Mei Bao

1269
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,980
is the most important person in my life.

1270
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,380
He is alive and dead,

1271
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,780
and has nothing to do with me.

1272
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,580
Why does he keep saying the same thing?

1273
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:26,180
Because Mei Bao wanted to die with Yong Yan.

1274
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,380
He didn't want to love us.

1275
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,180
He didn't want his father to be in the hands of that bastard.

1276
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,180
I can't say the truth.

1277
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,780
If I say the truth,

1278
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,580
he won't be a murderer.

1279
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:48,580
Can you say the same thing again?

1280
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,780
He did so many things,

1281
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:54,580
and he is the most important person in this world.

1282
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,580
Yes.

1283
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,380
Miss Li,

1284
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:59,980
I am not a judge.

1285
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,780
I don't think I have sinned.

1286
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,580
Jiang Qing Guan,

1287
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,780
why did you come to the police station?

1288
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,780
You are doing this to hurt people, right?

1289
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,780
Mei Bao is my family.

1290
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,780
What will you do if you are me?

1291
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,780
I have seen those photos.

1292
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,780
I know what Yan Yong Yan did to her.

1293
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,980
I promise you,

1294
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,780
we won't let anyone go.

1295
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,780
Tell me.

1296
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,780
Tell me what you saw that night.

1297
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,780
Master.

1298
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,380
If what Yan Yong Yan said is true,

1299
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:15,180
Ding Xiaoling, Li Mo Li, and Zhong Mei Bao,

1300
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,980
they are in a relationship and begging for her.

1301
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,380
What will they do?

1302
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,780
The North告人 Zhong Mei Bao,

1303
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:32,180
Li Mo Li and Ding Xiaoling were sentenced to sentence for illegal crime.

1304
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,980
They were forced to hurt the victim.

1305
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,980
Zhong Mei Bao was killed for being broken.

1306
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,380
They were forced to be punished.

1307
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,780
Xie Bao Luo, Li Da Sen, and Li Mo Yu

1308
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,380
were sentenced for illegal crime and illegal crime.

1309
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,980
They were sentenced for being killed by Zhong Mei Bao.

1310
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:52,980
They were not forced to be executed.

1311
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,980
What about Yan Yong Yan?

1312
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,980
He is innocent.

1313
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:10,980
So in this case,

1314
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,580
all the good people are guilty.

1315
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,980
The bad people are going to be released for being illegal.

1316
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:17,980
Right?

1317
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,780
As a police,

1318
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:22,980
we need to find evidence.

1319
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,980
The police are going to arrest the victim.

1320
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,980
The police are going to arrest the victim.

1321
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,980
The police are going to arrest the victim.

1322
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,980
The police are going to arrest the victim.

1323
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,980
The police are going to arrest the victim.

1324
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,980
The police are going to arrest the victim.

1325
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,980
