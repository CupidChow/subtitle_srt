Episode 1

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Baby, we're home.

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thank you.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We have to leave.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Who is it?

6
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The Show

7
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're finally here?

8
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not talking about you.

9
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No big deal.

10
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why are you here?

11
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Didn't you know you were staying at your grandma's house for two days?

12
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I saw you working overtime every day.

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I was afraid you wouldn't be able to bear me.

14
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is the oil.

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is the vitamin B.

16
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is the vitamin A.

17
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Remember to eat.

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay.

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You don't have to care about me.

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Go to school.

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't have to go to school today.

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm going to the airport.

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What for?

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're going to Lijiang for a trip to the school.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Lijiang?

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're too busy.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't see you.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How can I tell you?

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then you should tell me.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No, you can't go.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why?

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Grandma agreed.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's so chaotic outside.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What if someone else does?

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is the school's collective activity.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No, you can't go.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Anyway, you can't go.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, I have to go today.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm worried if you go.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You just stay at home.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you hear me?

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're getting older.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If my dad is still here,

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
he will definitely let me go.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What's this?

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why are you talking to your dad?

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What's wrong?

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm here to tell you.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There's a buyer in the black pepper store.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What's the bottom line?

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't know yet.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The boss said he's never seen that person.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He asked me to go there at 5 o'clock to have a meeting.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
When will the doctor come?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
About an hour or so.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
An hour or so?

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, I'll go out first.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Master,

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
it's not his dad.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
When did I say I was his dad?

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I knew you were going to run.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Did you take me to the bathroom?

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've called the school.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They said you're not going.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why are you doing this?

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you know what you're worried about?

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What?

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Because the outside world is very dangerous.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Look at the murder case I'm in now.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A young girl like that

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
was killed in vain.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
There are thousands of people in this city.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can't let me out of the door

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
because one of them is dead.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's because you're not a teenager.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
When you grow up,

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you can do whatever you want.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Other kids are not teenagers.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why can't they?

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They are them. You are them.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What are you doing?

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What are you doing?

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Zhong Jingguo,

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I understand your worries.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But I've grown up now.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I can already take care of myself.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I hope you can understand this.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Ye, thank you for coming.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's okay.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm here today

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to tell the public about Yan Yongxuan.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Mr. Ye,

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Mr. Ye,

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
relax.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Talk slowly.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Two years ago,

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I held the first wedding banquet.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Ye Shujun!

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Xiaojun!

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Xiaojun!

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I know you don't like to talk to the media.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But for this show,

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you have to make some publicity.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I just want to talk about the piano.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I really don't want to break the road.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I understand.

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Can you not understand this?

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But we are now

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the same family of piano.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We can't be as high as before.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Besides,

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
if you don't make publicity,

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
no one will notice

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the classical music in the future.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's a pity.

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Besides,

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
can you take care of your family

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
more than a few years ago?

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's go out and have a look.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I promise you,

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll let them

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
have a show in five minutes.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Everyone, let's go back.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is the dance studio.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let's go back.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Come on!

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Come on!

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Come on!

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Come on!

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Come on!

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Come on!

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Xiaojun,

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll go upstairs with you.

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm a little worried.

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's okay.

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I've already prepared myself.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The show will be officially out in a few days.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You should have a good rest these two days.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ah Jun.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yi You.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You're so good.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's expensive, right?

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's really a surprise.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I remind you,

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
there's a birthday party here.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I told you.

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It seems like I'm doing something bad.

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
A layer of care,

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
high-level.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No wonder your sister

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
keeps forcing you to practice piano every day.

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What are you doing here?

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What am I doing?

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I just want to see

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
my son.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're leaning on the wall,

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll call the police.

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're so good.

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I just want to ask

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
do you know

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
where your sister lives?

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know.

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We're family.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We should be together.

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Keep it well.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This photo is a lot from me.

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You can keep it for a few years.

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's too late today.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Dad,

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
you can't go in.

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Have a good rest.

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
See you next time.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Dad.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Is that photo

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
your sister's?

183
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
She said she wouldn't give money

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
if she didn't.

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
She wants to take all the photos.

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Then did you give it to her?

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is the last time.

189
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Did you pay the debt?

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Almost.

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Almost.

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is my last chance.

193
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's all?

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's okay.

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're so famous.

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You can just buy a piano.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's over two thousand.

198
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The money will come.

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Sister,

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm here to accompany you

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
to learn how to play the piano.

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's so hard.

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Look,

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
look.

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Isn't this Ye Shujun?

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Ye Shujun?

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Look.

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No way.

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He's the one who

212
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
only wants to take part in the concert.

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah.

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He just came to play the piano.

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It feels so awkward.

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He's an artist.

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Why is he so bad-tempered?

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Well,

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
as long as you give him more money,

220
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
don't let him play on the floor.

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He's just playing on the wall.

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Look, the piano is so cheap.

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We've seen him perform before.

224
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Let me tell you,

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
we can't take business anymore.

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You know what?

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You're a musician.

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You have to keep your sense of mystery.

229
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Otherwise,

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
the price will be very high.

231
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You know what?

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If you really need money,

233
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
you can borrow from the company.

234
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't want to borrow money from the company.

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You just need to help me

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
to perform in the 30th concert every year.

237
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
How many?

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
30?

239
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You have to pay for the 30th concert.

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're my lover.

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The doctor has already taken care of it.

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're the general manager of the management.

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The next thing is to perform at the concert.

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Don't say that you've earned money.

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Don't even think about playing the piano.

246
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Don't you want to do this?

247
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So...

248
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Hello, sister.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What's up?

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Junyan,

251
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
what's wrong with your hand?

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Nothing.

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Don't keep it from me.

254
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Auntie Bi has already shown me the video.

255
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Well,

256
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
maybe

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
there's a lot of play.

258
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You've been missing money recently.

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I just want to earn more money.

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Junyan, don't keep it from me.

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You always tell me

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
whether that person has already looked for you.

263
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't know.

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Sister, don't care.

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's all money.

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What's money?

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You always tell me

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
how much money you want.

269
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I have something to do.

270
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's not talk about this, okay?

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Are you really afraid

272
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
that he'll be able to lock you up

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
all his life?

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Jun, why don't we call the police?

275
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's not a way to get down there.

276
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Sister, I've already said it.

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't want to talk about this.

278
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No, you really want...

279
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Jun!

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So,

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
after Zhou Mei Bao knew about this,

282
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
did you know about this?

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I wanted to solve it myself,

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but I didn't tell her.

285
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I thought I could just tell Yan Yong Yuan

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
to return the debt.

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But I found out later

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that I had to go back to the police.

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was so worried

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
that I had to go back to the police.

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I was so worried that

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I had to go back to the police.

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I was so worried that

294
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I found out later that

295
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
when someone started to track you down,

296
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
he would never stop.

297
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If I had listened to you,

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I would have called the police directly.

299
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You and your sister

300
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
rarely meet,

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and you don't often contact each other.

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Why is that?

303
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We agreed.

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't contact me

305
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
when there's nothing urgent.

306
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
In case you get caught.

307
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We all came here

308
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
to know each other.

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Mr. Ye,

310
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
if you don't mind,

311
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
can you tell us

312
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
when those photos were taken?

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Did you listen to me?

314
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Did you listen to me?

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Did you listen to me?

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Or did you take photos?

317
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm listening.

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm listening.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm listening.

320
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm listening.

321
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm listening.

322
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm listening.

323
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm listening.

324
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm listening.

325
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm listening.

326
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm listening.

327
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm listening.

328
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm listening.

329
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm listening.

330
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
One year ago,

331
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yan Yongyan finally found my sister.

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Because of my sister's death,

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I didn't give her.

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Later, I got a call.

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
He said if I don't give her money,

336
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
he'll kill my sister.

337
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
My sister said,

338
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
she was just kidding.

339
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
She told me not to be afraid.

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I didn't expect that.

341
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's over.

342
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Thank you.

343
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Goodbye.

344
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Master.

345
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yan Yongyan

346
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
is a man of joy,

347
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
who follows,

348
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
fears,

349
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and is not afraid of anything.

350
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
He also has a lot of murderous actions.

351
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He is really

352
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the biggest suspect

353
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
in this case.

354
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
After seeing Ye Meili,

355
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I sent Li to check on him.

356
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But it's very strange.

357
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He disappeared

358
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
a year ago.

359
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He didn't do anything.

360
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He's the most dangerous suspect?

361
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Even if he wanted to kill Zhong Meibo,

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
he didn't have to hide

363
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
a year in advance.

364
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
He might think

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
he disappeared in advance.

366
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
In this way,

367
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
he won't find anything

368
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
that happened later.

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
No matter what,

370
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
he's in a hurry now.

371
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We have to find him first.

372
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Master,

373
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
can we send the notice?

374
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Why are you here suddenly?

375
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hurry up.

376
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I came today.

377
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Why are you so nervous?

378
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Did something happen?

379
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Did you come here just now?

380
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No.

381
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Did anyone come with you?

382
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No.

383
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What happened?

384
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Nothing.

385
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm scared.

386
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Maybe I'm too nervous.

387
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What?

388
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Why are you here?

389
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Don't be afraid.

390
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I just want you to help me.

391
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I have nothing to help you.

392
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You know

393
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
how Mei Bao died.

394
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't know anything.

395
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Don't be ridiculous.

396
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm innocent.

397
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You can't blame me.

398
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm innocent.

399
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What are you doing?

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm innocent.

401
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm innocent.

402
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Let go of me.

403
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let go of me.

404
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Help me, okay?

405
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I owe you a favor.

406
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No, Zhong Gui.

407
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're trying to make me feel bad.

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You know these basic procedures very well.

409
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I can't help you

410
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
with this.

411
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I know

412
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
it's not appropriate.

413
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But he's been missing for a long time.

414
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If he doesn't catch him this time,

415
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
we can't break this case.

416
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm not helping you.

417
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
If what Uncle Ye said

418
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
can't prove that he has murderous acts,

419
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
the most important thing is that he has a motive.

420
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And if he really knows who the killer is,

421
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
why didn't he call the police

422
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and have to make a mistake?

423
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
How about this?

424
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
As long as you give me a proof

425
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
that I can get it,

426
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'll make him a criminal first.

427
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,800
The criminal weiterhin

428
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
andoutezint song

429
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
My good friend,

430
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
this is in the English!

431
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Everyone has taken an assessment first,

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,200
including Tianning as the listener and Miao-alie as the 123-教权.

433
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,000
In some cases you have an misfortune with HRgrunts,

434
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and they'll perform the necessary tricks on you.

435
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,240
One person uses good Exercise and

436
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,040
three other members use the same performance to account for

437
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,760
because of the crowd.

438
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,360
That person is like the actor you've been looking for.

439
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,480
Actor.

440
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,000
No.

441
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,120
Let's go.

442
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,160
Is it a real crime?

443
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,520
Who is the police officer?

444
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,880
It seems to be the officer.

445
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,880
Wait.

446
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,120
So,

447
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,120
they didn't call the police?

448
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,200
No.

449
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's go.

450
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,840
I was on the road

451
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,320
and saw some of the teachers of the Ban family.

452
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,440
The Ban family

453
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,840
signed an agreement with our building.

454
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,560
So all the teachers of the Ban family

455
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,160
have registered for the photo in the room.

456
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,320
But there was one of them.

457
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,200
I'm sure they haven't registered.

458
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,080
Later, I suddenly remembered.

459
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,360
This person

460
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,480
used to come to find Mei Bao.

461
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,280
He's also seen Mei Bao's house.

462
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
He signed the agreement.

463
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
How many buildings did he go to?

464
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,600
16.

465
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,920
Isn't that the building where

466
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,280
Mr. Lin and his family live?

467
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,760
Let's go.

468
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,320
Let's go.

469
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,280
You saw him?

470
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,280
Mei Bao,

471
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,320
I want you to help me.

472
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,760
I don't have anything to help you.

473
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
You know Mei Bao is dead.

474
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,920
We don't know anything.

475
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,160
Zhang Hai, don't talk nonsense.

476
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,440
I don't know why he's dead.

477
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,360
Let go of me.

478
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,560
Let go of me.

479
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,160
Mrs. Lin.

480
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Are you okay?

481
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Let go of me.

482
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Don't run.

483
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,960
Don't run.

484
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,520
Don't run.

485
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,440
Don't run.

486
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Don't run.

487
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Yan Tu, I'm not a kid.

488
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,040
Are you blind?

489
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Are you blind?

490
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,040
I'm sorry.

491
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
I'm sorry.

492
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
I'm sorry.

493
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
I'm not a ghost.

494
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
I'm not a ghost.

495
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
I'm not a ghost.

496
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,120
You said Yan Yu Yuan

497
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,600
once found Zhong Mei Bao.

498
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,600
When was he?

499
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,520
About a year ago.

500
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
I was

501
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,920
registered in the front desk.

502
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,800
Why didn't you mention him to us?

503
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,760
Officer Zhong,

504
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,360
you're used to looking for my tea.

505
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,080
I'm just used to it.

506
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,400
I don't believe you.

507
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,720
I've been to Mei Bao's room for many times.

508
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,400
I can't mention everyone to you.

509
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,920
If Jin Er didn't hear it today,

510
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,600
I wouldn't have thought of him.

511
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
He's the murderer.

512
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,920
This is ножengbou,

513
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,540
the source of his murder.

514
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,920
He has been to킹 Partnership,

515
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,860
Young Master pandemic

516
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,160
for years.

517
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
If I'm not mistaken,

518
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,520
he's another guy

519
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,080
who opened this hotel.

520
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,760
Who was murdered?

521
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,640
What?

522
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,240
Pretty nice.

523
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,920
You attended.

524
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,400
I was just係ght to visit him.

525
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,600
1903 C-2-6-7.

526
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,400
C-2-1-3.

527
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,400
That's interesting.

528
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
It's okay.

529
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,400
The child is fine now.

530
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,400
Do you think we...

531
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Someone's knocking on the door.

532
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
Let me have a look.

533
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,200
Hello.

534
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Hello, Mrs. Lei.

535
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,000
We heard someone is coming to investigate with you.

536
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,800
Please come in, please.

537
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,000
Thank you.

538
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Please come in.

539
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Hello.

540
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Do you know why that person came to you?

541
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
How would I know? I don't even know him.

542
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,000
He said he was Miss Zhong's father.

543
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I heard Miss Zhong's story before.

544
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,400
It's not good to talk about it.

545
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,000
Did he tell you anything?

546
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Probably he said the police suspect he was a murderer.

547
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,600
But he didn't kill anyone.

548
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,000
We wanted to help him.

549
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's so obvious.

550
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,600
Why should I help him?

551
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,000
Mrs. Lin.

552
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,000
Do you know Miss Ding?

553
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,000
Yes.

554
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,400
But I'm not very familiar with her.

555
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,400
Give me a hug. Thank you.

556
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,400
We live in the same building.

557
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,800
We met each other at the first floor.

558
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,000
We know each other.

559
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,200
By the way,

560
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,800
I'd like to ask you two to come here.

561
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,400
Did you get any progress in the security case?

562
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I'm sorry.

563
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,800
We can't reveal the case to anyone.

564
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,800
It's okay.

565
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Tell me.

566
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,000
The case will be solved soon.

567
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,000
It will be solved soon?

568
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
Who is the murderer?

569
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Zhong Mei Bao has a brother.

570
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Do you know him?

571
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
No.

572
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
I've never heard of him.

573
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
His brother

574
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,000
has a brother named Ji Fu.

575
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,000
That's the one.

576
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,000
He's a very likely murderer.

577
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,000
But we still need to find a witness.

578
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,600
Okay.

579
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
If there's nothing else,

580
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,600
don't bother.

581
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,400
We'll leave first.

582
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,000
Don't worry.

583
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,600
We'll keep this neighborhood safe.

584
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,800
Okay.

585
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,800
Thank you.

586
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,200
This way, please.

587
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,400
Thank you.

588
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,200
Thank you for your trouble.

589
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,000
Your mom ran away.

590
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
She's dead.

591
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,800
Ji Fu.

592
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,000
Why did you tell them?

593
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,000
They must know something.

594
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
I'll tell them.

595
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,400
He'll come up.

596
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,300
Do you know bunch of things?

597
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,700
Ja呵.

598
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,400
My mother's waiting for me at the right time.

599
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,300
Stop them.

600
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,300
They are incredibly quick.

601
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,480
Who are you?

602
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:19,620
Who are you,

603
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,620
If you remember me, you are like my clothes.

604
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,620
The End

605
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,620
Wake up!

606
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,620
I have a general.

607
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,620
This is too cruel.

608
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,620
What kind of person can do such a thing?

609
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,620
I am not attacking your

610
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,620
Why?

611
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,620
Zhu Meibang is like this when he dies.

612
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,620
Because we can't prove that this photo was taken by Yan Yuwen.

613
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,620
We can't prove that Zhu Meibang is the person in this photo.

614
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,620
I know that this evidence is not sufficient.

615
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,620
But we just want to send a notice.

616
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,620
The purpose is to catch Yan Yuwen and ask him questions.

617
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,620
We don't want to make him guilty.

618
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,620
It's not enough.

619
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,620
Because we can't find Yan Yuwen's fingerprints on the scene.

620
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,620
So you have to prove that this evidence is very powerful.

621
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,620
Yan Yuwen must have left.

622
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
He must have left Shuanghe.

623
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,620
Captain Zhuang, this is the photocopier of the picture you asked me to find.

624
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Xiaoyang.

625
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
Thank you.

626
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,620
Xiaoyang, look.

627
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,620
This time, it's Zhongli Bao's room.

628
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,620
This is the room of Zhongli Bao's house.

629
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,620
This is the room of Wu Mingyue.

630
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,620
Look, this is 1903.

631
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,620
Control.

632
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,620
This is 2004.

633
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
Control.

634
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,620
This is 2103.

635
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,620
Control.

636
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,620
In addition to Wu Mingyue,

637
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,620
Zhongmeibao's main room,

638
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,620
the main room and the side room are all controlled.

639
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,620
But we saw these rooms on the list.

640
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
This month started to be sold.

641
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,620
These three rooms have been closed for more than a year.

642
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,620
Although the owner has violated the law of the forest and the rain,

643
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,620
he has not kept these three rooms in his hand.

644
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,620
That is to say,

645
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,620
he deliberately let these three rooms be closed.

646
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,620
Why?

647
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,620
If you say this is 2004,

648
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,620
I can think of a way.

649
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,620
Because he will be in charge of this room

650
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,620
and climb to Zhongmeibao's house.

651
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,620
Then why is it upstairs and downstairs?

652
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,620
The owner of the room is my name.

653
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,620
This is the phone call record of Zhongmeibao's previous phone.

654
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,620
In addition to Lin Dacen,

655
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,620
Xie Bao Luo,

656
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,620
there is a very popular call card.

657
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,620
The person who is in charge of the house is the owner of the room.

658
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
Hello.

659
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
Did we get cheated by them?

660
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,620
What does it mean to go to Wu Mingyue?

661
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,620
According to the original understanding,

662
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,620
Zhongmeibao and Lin Dacen should be the relationship of the thief.

663
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,620
Is it possible that these people did this

664
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,620
to cover up their real relationship?

665
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,620
If they all turn this relationship back,

666
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
what will happen to the situation?

667
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,620
What is their relationship with you?

668
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,620
The owner told you that he will be here soon, right?

669
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
Yes, he said so.

670
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,620
Trumpets.

671
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Report each team.

672
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,620
Report each team.

673
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Are you ready now?

674
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
How about Li?

675
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,620
가능�1.

676
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:28,620
The Pre medically arrival of Road B will be successfullyWhich equal to 1 The majority of the ambegan ctry write How to control all together

677
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,620
Don't laugh it off.

678
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,620
Be delicious!

679
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,140
I feel better

680
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,700
Alright達達!!

681
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,740
Captain, remember to find the EHD

682
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,260
I can see you

683
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,200
They told me to lock down

684
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,500
Map got change

685
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,420
Chef got change

686
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,780
Mongoose is locked

687
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,820
shirts first

688
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,660
Hai, setup

689
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,660
Are you sure?

690
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Why is he staying in there for so long?

691
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,160
Wang, go and have a look.

692
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,160
I'll be right back.

693
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Captain Zhou, Captain Zhou, the car is about to take off.

694
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Xun, move.

695
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Captain Zhou, the car is about to take off.

696
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
Captain Zhou.

697
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
Let's go.

698
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Okay, hold on.

699
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Captain Zhou, move.

700
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,060
Captain Zhou, the car typos are all registered.

701
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,660
Have a good look.

702
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,660
Director Cheng,

703
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
for 我的工作室,

704
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,660
it's only because of a cleaning list.

705
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,060
Otherwise I will be omitted as well.

706
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,060
Thank you for your cooperation.

707
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,060
You can leave now.

708
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,060
Officer, this is a piece of...

709
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,060
The boss will return the money to you.

710
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,060
Thank you for your cooperation.

711
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,060
I've been gone for a long time.

712
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
Thank you for your cooperation.

713
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,060
This Xia Liufei is even worse.

714
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
He's not going back to the company.

715
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,060
This Xia Liufei is even worse.

716
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,060
How much did he spend on the money?

717
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,060
Eight thousand.

718
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,060
Eight thousand?

719
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
Such a expensive thing.

720
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,060
Who dares to touch it?

721
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Look up.

722
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,060
I'm sorry.

723
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,060
What?

724
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
I'm sorry.

725
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
I'm sorry.

726
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,060
I'm sorry.

727
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
I'm sorry.

728
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,060
I'm sorry.

729
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,060
How is it?

730
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,060
Is this evidence okay?

731
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
The agency said it was their negligence.

732
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
They only checked the windpipe.

733
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,060
They didn't check the video.

734
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,060
Fortunately, the previous actor died.

735
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,060
So the recording of his death was recorded in the system.

736
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,060
It's a bit worse than expected.

737
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,060
The current director of the company,

738
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,060
Wang Xitong,

739
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,060
is here to take care of you.

740
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,060
The official document

741
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,060
will be sent tonight.

742
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,060
Okay, I got it.

743
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,060
Zuo Li.

744
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,060
You go to the system to get the body.

745
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,060
The engineer is here.

746
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,060
Send the patient to Liufei directly.

747
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,060
Okay.

748
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,060
Captain Feng.

749
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,060
Someone is looking for you.

750
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,060
Who?

751
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,060
I'm sorry.

752
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I really didn't kill anyone.

753
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,060
I didn't kill Li Bao.

754
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,060
We were all cheated by Li Bao.

755
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,060
I'm sorry.

756
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,060
