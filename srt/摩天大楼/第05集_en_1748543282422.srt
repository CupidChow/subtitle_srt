The second generation of the show is on the second generation of the show.

5
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
When Zhicun and Cai Qiang come out,

6
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
there will be a lot of clues.

7
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
They should be here by now.

8
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
They should be in the classroom.

9
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Captain Zhuang, I have something to ask you.

10
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
What is it?

11
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
It's about the Du Cha group.

12
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
Wait for me inside.

13
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
It's like this.

14
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
The director told me to tell you that

15
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,040
the Du Cha group's conversation time is fixed.

16
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,040
It's too late to take the time.

17
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Why are you out?

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
There is no one outside the classroom.

19
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Okay, I got it.

20
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
You go back to work.

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
What is that boy called?

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,040
He is a senior in high school and a self-proclaimed student.

23
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
I am the middle class, Li Meng Yu.

24
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
He doesn't have my number.

25
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Excuse me.

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Excuse me.

27
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Sir, why are you here?

28
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Well, I am here to see the middle class.

29
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,040
I am here to introduce you to my house.

30
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
This is an advertisement.

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
I want to...

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Excuse me.

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
The novel is on the top.

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Remember to call me.

35
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Li Meng Yu.

36
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Li Meng Yu.

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Here.

38
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
The middle class.

39
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
This way.

40
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
The area here

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,040
is not very good for the third-gen.

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Sir, Sir.

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
This is...

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
I am Yang.

45
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Hello, Sir.

46
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Let's start.

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Are you the salesman here

48
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
when the building is open?

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Yes.

50
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
Yes.

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
So you opened the middle class

52
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
and did the business here?

53
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
Yes.

54
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Yes.

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
You are the first to open the building.

56
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
First?

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
First.

58
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Then you should know Zhong Mei Bao.

59
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Yes.

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Yes.

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
Is it because he wants to know your house?

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Yes.

63
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Sir.

64
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
When you answer the question,

65
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
just say it once.

66
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Don't repeat it.

67
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
Okay.

68
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Sorry.

69
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
Sorry.

70
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
I am used to it.

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Except for the house,

72
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,040
do you have any other connections with Zhong Mei Bao?

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
I sometimes go to his shop to buy coffee.

74
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Except for coffee,

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
I don't talk about anything.

76
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
I can say something.

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
But I don't know anything.

78
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Then you should know Xie Bao Luo.

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Is it that Bao An?

80
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Yes.

81
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
What do you think

82
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
he has something to do with Zhong Mei Bao?

83
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
He is a friend.

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Sometimes I see them

85
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
walking together.

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
What about others?

87
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Besides this,

88
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
do they have any intimate activities?

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
No.

90
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Do you know Lin Da Sen?

91
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Lin Da...

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
I mean B-Dou.

93
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
I know him.

94
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Then what do you think

95
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
he has something to do with Zhong Mei Bao?

96
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Isn't he Feng Dong?

97
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Have you seen them together?

98
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Let me think.

99
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
No.

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Thank you for your cooperation.

101
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
I didn't expect it to end so quickly.

102
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Zhong,

103
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
don't be so polite with me.

104
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
I should have done it.

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
If we have new clues,

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
I will contact you.

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
No problem.

108
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,040
I will try my best to cooperate.

109
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
By the way,

110
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
if you want to buy a house,

111
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
contact me.

112
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
The only person in the high-end industry

113
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
is the middle-class.

114
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Mr. Lin.

115
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Thank you. I have a house.

116
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
No need.

117
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Give it to me.

118
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Here.

119
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
There is my phone.

120
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Call me anytime.

121
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
No need to send it.

122
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
No need to send it.

123
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
This person

124
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
is not so good.

125
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
He is very cooperative.

126
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Cooperative?

127
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
People like him

128
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
are very polite on the surface.

129
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
He must be sincere.

130
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
What kind of person is he?

131
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Yes.

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
He is very polite.

133
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
So,

134
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
are we going to pass them?

135
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
No hurry.

136
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
They have been here for a while.

137
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
They can't ask for anything.

138
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Let's check their address first.

139
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
You go back to the office.

140
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Check their information first.

141
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
You don't want to go with me?

142
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I have something to do.

143
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Master,

144
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
you are going to see

145
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
the people from the city center, right?

146
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
They are looking for you.

147
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
What is it?

148
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
You don't need to hurry.

149
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Hey!

150
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
No Zhai處 there.

151
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,040
No Zhai!

152
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Did you find him?

153
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
I don't think so.

154
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
She is a good拍攝 man.

155
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Don't constellation me!

156
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Whatbereich?

157
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
It's in the taxi прок.

158
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
It's in the taxiisini.

159
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,680
Sir, you said that this building is a three-story building.

160
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,240
Can it really be three-story?

161
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,520
Of course. The planning map can be found online.

162
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,680
From here to the subway station, the car will take five minutes.

163
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
Mr. Zhuo, I asked for a murder case.

164
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,880
Is the治安 not good?

165
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,960
It's nothing.

166
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,760
I just got back from the police station.

167
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,880
The police have confirmed that this is a murder.

168
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,760
The murderer is his boyfriend.

169
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,920
He's been released for a while.

170
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
Does this治安 have anything to do with it?

171
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,880
I like this house.

172
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,200
And it's a three-story building.

173
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,280
What do you think?

174
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,440
It's good.

175
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
You can buy it.

176
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
Okay, I'll send you.

177
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,160
I forgot my keys to the office.

178
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,720
I met a client today.

179
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,600
He's very funny.

180
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,840
I told him that

181
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,480
from here to the subway station, the car will take five minutes.

182
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,800
He's very happy.

183
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Do you think he's a fool?

184
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,240
The car will take five minutes.

185
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,880
Isn't it just a half hour walk?

186
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
And

187
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,040
even the three-story building

188
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,480
doesn't know what it means.

189
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,400
Three-story building.

190
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,200
That means that the three subway stations

191
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,080
are not close, so it's a three-story building.

192
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,840
No, I'm really tired today.

193
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,120
I need to add one more piece of medicine.

194
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,720
I'll go take a shower first.

195
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,360
Thank you.

196
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,040
The police called me today.

197
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
It took me five minutes to get there.

198
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
I've been walking for half an hour.

199
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
You didn't find any fingerprints?

200
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
How is that possible?

201
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
I don't know what's going on.

202
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Anyway, there's no one.

203
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Did you say that there was no one in?

204
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
How did you graduate from the police academy?

205
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,040
At least you have your own fingerprints in the room.

206
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Oh, right.

207
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
So the murderer removed the fingerprints?

208
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Of course!

209
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
You go to the scene and check it out.

210
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,040
See if there's any missing.

211
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
No, there's no missing.

212
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
We've checked all the places where the murderer could be.

213
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Then let's find the place where the murderer couldn't be found.

214
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Have you checked the sky board?

215
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Have you checked the light source?

216
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Have you checked the stairs?

217
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Well...

218
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Go!

219
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
What's his attitude?

220
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm sorry.

221
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Forget it.

222
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Anyway, we may not see him for a while.

223
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Master!

224
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Master!

225
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Why are you so angry?

226
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,040
Did the people from the traffic police force hurt you?

227
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
It's nothing.

228
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
I've told you everything.

229
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Let's wait for the results.

230
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
What's the matter?

231
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Forget it.

232
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
I won't tell you.

233
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,040
What did you check yesterday?

234
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
Although Lin Mo Yu didn't make any money,

235
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
there's a report.

236
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Interesting.

237
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Shall we call him back?

238
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Master is calling him back.

239
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Why don't you go with him?

241
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Officer Liang, this way please.

242
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
I usually look at you.

243
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
You look serious.

244
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,040
You look different when you're wearing a dress.

245
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
You want to see the little fox, right?

246
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Yes.

247
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
What do you think?

248
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Well...

249
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Is it a little fox?

250
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Why? I think it's quite big.

251
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
It's a good shape.

252
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
So it's quite big.

253
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,040
Maybe the bedroom is a little smaller.

254
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
But most of your life time

255
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
is outside the bedroom, right?

256
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
Where is the closet?

257
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
This is the closet.

258
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
The closet?

259
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,040
So this shape...

260
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Is it this one?

261
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Yes, it's this one.

262
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
This is the 0.2-inch model.

263
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
We're now at the 7.2-inch model.

264
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,040
80, 29, 20, and 20-inch models are the same.

265
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
If you want to make the floor a little higher,

266
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
I have a key.

267
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
You can take a look.

268
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,040
But I personally think the 7.2-inch model is good.

269
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Although the floor is a little lower,

270
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
but the room is good.

271
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
You can see it.

272
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Yes, the kindergarten is very nice.

273
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,040
You have so many keys.

274
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
How can I tell you?

275
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,040
This building is basically a half of the building.

276
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,040
The people in the house call me the owner of the building.

277
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
What do you mean?

278
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
The owner of the building.

279
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,040
So you can enter all the key rooms.

280
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,040
As long as the owner is not found.

281
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
The 23rd floor is Ding Xiaoling, right?

282
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Excuse me.

283
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
I'm sorry.

284
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Sorry, I can't show up here.

285
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Zhang, you can start recording.

286
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Miss Ding, can you tell me what your relationship with Lin Mengyu is?

287
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
My relationship with her.

288
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Once.

289
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,040
We found out that you have a wallet with four doors.

290
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
It's all a misunderstanding.

291
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
I have no bad intentions.

292
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,040
So what's the situation?

293
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Someone reported last June that you and Lin Mengyu were quarreling.

294
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
What's the matter?

295
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
You sent someone else home.

296
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,040
What are you doing here?

297
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
What else can I do?

298
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Who is this?

299
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Miss.

300
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Come here.

301
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Miss.

302
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
Come here.

303
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
I hope you feel uncomfortable.

304
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Let me hear it.

305
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Listen to me.

306
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Look, you haven't fixed it yet.

307
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
You don't have any water.

308
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
I have water.

309
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
I'll have a drink first.

310
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
Thank you.

311
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Miss Lin, wait for me.

312
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Come in right now.

313
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Master, I want to talk to you.

314
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
What?

315
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
I knew it when you came.

316
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Hello?

317
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Who is it?

318
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Do you know that you are in my car?

319
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Okay, I'll take the car right away.

320
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
I'll take the car.

321
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Don't be angry.

322
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Master is back.

323
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Don't be angry.

324
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Get changed.

325
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

326
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
I'll be right back.

327
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Be quick.

328
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Okay.

329
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
According to the law, the law is the second law.

330
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
The illegal theft of a friend is a strong profit.

331
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
It is best to remember the game.

332
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
What crime do I have?

333
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
What did I have?

334
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
What did I have?

335
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
You have taken my heart.

336
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
You have taken my soul.

337
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
I think the one who wanted to be known about this is you,

338
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,040
you choose to make people forget you.

339
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Brothers, fighting.

340
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Subscribe.

341
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Sister, give me your guitar.

342
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Don't forget.

343
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Our piece for today.

344
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,240
Come with me!

345
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,000
Shorke...

346
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,480
Go ahead and pick up that police over there.

347
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
In that case, thank you.

348
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,320
That was what happened...

349
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,960
Check status.

350
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
Come here.

351
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
He's here.

352
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Hey!

353
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
What's going on?

354
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
And then?

355
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,960
He's a lawyer, so he's going to sue us for the case.

356
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Yes.

357
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
I'm already trapped in the house with two thieves.

358
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,960
You can bring more police officers here.

359
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Thank you.

360
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,360
Mr. Wang, you misunderstood.

361
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,760
Why do you treat me as a thief?

362
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Me?

363
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Lin.

364
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
I know you're Lin.

365
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,360
To be honest, if you don't wear your clothes,

366
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,760
I really don't know who you are.

367
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Hey, think about it.

368
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,960
Why are you still bothering the police?

369
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
How about this?

370
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,360
Call the police and don't bother them, okay?

371
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,160
Why? I'm telling you.

372
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,760
I must get the police to arrest you today.

373
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Oh, right. You're the one who's in charge of my car, right?

374
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,160
You're very experienced.

375
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,360
You must have thought I would call you and ask you to get in the car, right?

376
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
No. I don't want to call you.

377
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Let me tell you.

378
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Your car has been taken away by the tow company.

379
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,160
I don't know where it's taken.

380
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,960
Just wait for the police to come and arrest you.

381
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,160
No, the police can't arrest you.

382
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Because you've been arrested by the police.

383
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,760
Mr. Wang, I'm just a little girl.

384
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,160
Girl? You're also a girl.

385
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,360
Do you have any responsibility?

386
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,560
I gave you the key to bring a client to my house.

387
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Not to bring these women who are not even three.

388
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
You're making a mess in my house.

389
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Hey, listen to him.

390
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Why are you talking?

391
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Aren't you just asking for your house?

392
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,760
Are you crazy?

393
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
You're so ridiculous.

394
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,960
Mr. Xiaoting, are you sorry?

395
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
You're a woman.

396
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,360
You're not even a little bit.

397
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,960
You've been in my room for a long time.

398
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,360
Calm down.

399
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,960
Calm down?

400
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm calm.

401
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,760
Listen to me.

402
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
I've been looking for you.

403
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,560
At least the police have been arresting you for a few days.

404
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,360
Then I'll tell the court about it.

405
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,560
But the point of the matter is not here.

406
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,760
The point of the matter is that you will be killed for this.

407
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,360
Why?

408
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,560
Because I'll tell all the reporters about this.

409
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,760
I've thought about the news topic.

410
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,560
It's called the surprise.

411
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,560
The middle class actually did this in your room.

412
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,360
Mr. Wang, I'm sorry.

413
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Don't say sorry to me.

414
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,560
Just wait for the court to pass the verdict.

415
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Okay?

416
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,360
Mr. Wang, I admit the verdict.

417
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,560
I'm worried about myself.

418
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,160
It's your house and the child.

419
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,960
Why?

420
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,560
I mentioned about the house.

421
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
It's the buyer's market.

422
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,960
The buyer has a lot of options.

423
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,760
If the house is in a relationship...

424
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,160
Have you ever been in danger?

425
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,360
If it's not sold, it's not sold.

426
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
I've been waiting for a few months.

427
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,760
Can you wait?

428
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,360
Can you wait for the child?

429
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,760
You sell this house just to buy a house in the city.

430
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,160
It's about to be in September.

431
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,360
If you can't sell it,

432
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,760
your child won't be able to go to the middle school.

433
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,960
The government will pay for it.

434
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,360
Sell the house, save money, save money.

435
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,160
And I can also pay for you.

436
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,360
I can pay for you anytime.

437
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
No need to pay.

438
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,160
Hello?

439
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,360
Police?

440
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,760
You've arrived.

441
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,360
A is in room 0503.

442
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,560
Yes.

443
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,960
But...

444
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,360
You don't need to come up.

445
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,160
Sorry.

446
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,760
I made a mistake.

447
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
I'm sorry.

448
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,960
Sorry for bothering you.

449
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,160
The middle school fee is 1340,520.

450
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
Go yourself.

451
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm scared.

452
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
I'm scared. I'm okay.

453
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,760
I'm okay.

454
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,560
I think we should...

455
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,960
We can't do this anymore.

456
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,360
We can't do this anymore.

457
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,560
Lin, I think we should...

458
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,360
We should have more money.

459
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,160
What's the road today?

460
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
I'm tired of playing.

461
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,360
Let's go.

462
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,160
What's going on?

463
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,560
Stop playing.

464
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,760
Let's go.

465
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,360
Let's go.

466
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,360
Never sleep.

467
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,720
Don't be anymore.

468
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,360
F noite of five 20 per day

469
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
I'll go.

470
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
I'll go.

471
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
How could you look at me like that?

472
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
You're so weird.

473
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
I'm looking at you.

474
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
I just want to see

475
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
which one is real you.

476
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
How could you?

477
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
I want to see

478
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
what's in your mind.

479
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
You're so free.

480
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
Unlike me.

481
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
I used to be different.

482
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
I used to care about others.

483
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
My dad passed away when I was a kid.

484
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
My mom changed her family.

485
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Her boyfriend is 30 years older.

486
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
My classmates all laughed at me

487
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
saying that my mom helped me with the money.

488
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Although I know

489
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
my mom really loves that person,

490
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
I feel so embarrassed and angry.

491
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,360
I fought with those classmates.

492
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Then I was sent to private school.

493
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,360
Luckily, I met two good friends there.

494
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
They taught me

495
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
how to ignore others' eyes

496
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
and how to live by myself.

497
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Okay, okay, I'm done with the story.

498
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
I'll sleep for a while.

499
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
You know, she's pretty nice to you.

500
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Then why do you want to break up with her?

501
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Marry me.

502
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
What are you laughing at?

503
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
I don't know how to marry you.

504
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Why?

505
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Xiaoling.

506
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Xiaoling, why?

507
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
I like you, but I don't love you as much.

508
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
We're happy together, right?

509
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Yes, we're happy, but not like this.

510
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
You think too much.

511
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
No, if you don't like me,

512
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
I'll hit you with a knife.

513
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
You're so stupid.

514
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,520
Why are you with me?

515
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,320
I just like to play games.

516
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,840
And you are like these clothes.

517
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,360
It's just a tool in my game.

518
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,960
Xiaoling.

519
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,360
Xiaoling, if you say so,

520
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,640
it's a little too much.

521
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
I'm too much.

522
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,680
Let me ask you.

523
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
Do you really think I will give up

524
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,200
and get married with your wife?

525
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,080
I do.

526
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,480
Then you are a bastard.

527
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,800
I won't marry a bastard.

528
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,560
Do you know?

529
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,400
How will you get married

530
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,480
if you are so stubborn?

531
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,080
You will divorce your wife for me now.

532
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,080
In the future,

533
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,840
you will divorce me

534
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,960
for other women.

535
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,120
Why do you like her so much?

536
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,000
I think we are a common person.

537
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
We feel like a numbness to the real world.

538
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,840
Now we are in a happy mood

539
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,880
for the other world.

540
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
I found out

541
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
that she went to Europe

542
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
to travel to travel.

543
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
She must have been

544
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
a part of the trip.

545
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
It seems that she really got rid of it.

546
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Yes.

547
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
I'm still the same.

548
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
I know.

549
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
What do you know?

550
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
I know.

551
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
I know.

552
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
We are here.

553
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
We are here.

554
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
This is the house of the

555
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
1204.

556
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
Yes.

557
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
This is a good house.

558
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
I think

559
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
there is a place

560
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
that can be a

561
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,360
very practical

562
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
house.

563
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Take a look.

564
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,360
What is that sound?

565
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,360
Is the house

566
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
a little bit unfeeling?

567
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Yes.

568
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,360
It's like this.

569
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
Because

570
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
the reason for the lack of design

571
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
is indeed a little bit unfeeling.

572
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
This house

573
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
may be a little bit more obvious.

574
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
The owner knows

575
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
that so his house

576
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
is a little bit cheaper than others.

577
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
The lack of design?

578
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
It's just a little bit.

579
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Actually, it's okay.

580
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Sometimes we

581
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
can't hear

582
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
this side.

583
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Yes, it's okay here.

584
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
It's okay here.

585
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
By the way,

586
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
I asked him in the mail.

587
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Why did you choose

588
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
Lin Meng Yu?

589
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
What's special about her?

590
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Nothing special.

591
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
I just need time

592
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
and she doesn't need it.

593
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
But she has something

594
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
that's quite strange.

595
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
I thought

596
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
she was playing with cats.

597
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Why did she come to our house?

598
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Of course, she's not here.

599
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
But this is the safest place.

600
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
I have to go.

601
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Lin.

602
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
No.

603
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
No.

604
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Mom, you're not coming again?

605
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,360
Let's go.

606
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
I'm not coming.

607
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
No, no, no.

608
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Mom,

609
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
why are you here today?

610
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Look, it's so hot.

611
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
I brought you a meal.

612
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
I'll change it for you.

613
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Mom, I've grown up.

614
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
I'm really...

615
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,360
I can wait.

616
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
It's okay.

617
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,360
You can rest for a while.

618
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
I'll change it for you.

619
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
No, mom.

620
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
I'm really...

621
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
I can change it myself.

622
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
It's so good.

623
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
If you want,

624
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,360
you can call your mom.

625
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Aunt Zhang

626
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
told you yesterday...

627
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
You can call yourself.

628
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
It's okay.

629
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
How safe is it?

630
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Okay.

631
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Okay.

632
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Okay.

633
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Bye.

634
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Bye.

635
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Mom, do you know?

636
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
Lin, my mom is gone.

637
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Lin.

638
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,360
Lin.

639
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Lin.

640
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Lin, you're out.

641
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Lin.

642
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
I've been looking for him for a long time.

643
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
He just disappeared in my house.

644
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,360
It's strange.

645
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Did he ask you to climb down

646
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
while you're not paying attention?

647
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Officer Zhong,

648
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
my house is on the 23rd floor.

649
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
How did you leave our house that day?

650
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
You know what?

651
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,360
In the magic world,

652
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
there's a rule

653
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
and a rule.

654
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
It's the most important rule.

655
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
It's the secret of magic.

656
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,360
Don't tell anyone.

657
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I'm going in.

658
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Officer Liang,

659
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
I recommended you the way

660
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
we all went there.

661
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
Are you satisfied?

662
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
I'll think about it.

663
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
You want to talk to your boyfriend, right?

664
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
No.

665
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,360
I'm not.

666
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
I'm still living by myself.

667
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
If you live by yourself,

668
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
I can recommend you to your aunt.

669
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
You don't have to worry about your family.

670
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
You can work without worries.

671
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,360
I know your concerns.

672
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Last year, I was in a mess

673
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
because of this news.

674
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
The house price fell.

675
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
So the business has a new rule.

676
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
All the aunties who come to work

677
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
must be in the business.

678
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,360
And they have to do background investigation.

679
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
No problem.

680
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
What happened last year?

681
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
You don't know what happened last year, right?

682
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
It's okay.

683
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
You don't have to worry about it.

684
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Mrs. Lin.

685
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,360
Mrs. Lin, take care.

686
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Do you know her?

687
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
Yes.

688
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,360
She bought a small house

689
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
in my house.

690
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
She didn't keep it.

691
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Isn't that house

692
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
under the name of Lin Daxin?

693
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Did she know?

694
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
She did.

695
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
The house of Lin Daxin

696
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
is all done by Lin Daxin.

697
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Mrs. Lin, I have to see someone else.

698
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
How about we do it today?

699
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Okay.

700
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
You go first.

701
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,360
Okay.

702
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
I'll call you when I'm done.

703
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,360
The design of the zero-colour fox is missing.

704
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
I want to see the beauty of the city.

705
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Yes.

706
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
I've checked it.

707
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
I've checked it.

708
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
I'll call you when I'm done.

709
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Xiaoyang, why are you here?

710
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
I just passed by.

711
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
How is it?

712
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Did you find anything?

713
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
We checked everything.

714
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
But we couldn't find anything.

715
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Go back and tell your master

716
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
that we really did our best this time.

717
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
What are you looking at?

718
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
I have an idea.

719
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
It might be a bit strange.

720
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
Have you checked this one?

721
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
This one?

722
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Not yet.

723
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Miss Ding.

724
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
Miss Ding.

725
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
What's this?

726
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Officer Yang.

727
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Which fox do you like?

728
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
I'll help you to check it.

729
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
I think the zero-colour fox in the west

730
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,360
is quite good.

731
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,360
But it's not as good as the one in the east.

732
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
I think it's better to check it.

733
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
I've checked it.

734
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
I've checked it.

735
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
I've checked it.

736
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
I've checked it.

737
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
I've checked it.

738
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
I've checked it.

739
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
I've checked it.

740
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
I've checked it.

741
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
I've checked it.

742
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
It's not bad.

743
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
But I think there's a little bit of a lack.

744
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
I think it's not quite suitable for the sound.

745
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
I feel like I can hear people talking in the room.

746
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,360
I don't really recommend you to live in the C-4.

747
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,360
Are you sure that's the sound of a person?

748
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
What do you mean?

749
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
Yuan Xin Chu told me on the phone

750
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
that the house...

751
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
was haunted.

752
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Hunted?

753
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
No way.

754
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
What's the hell is this haunted house?

755
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
The haunted house is awesome.

756
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
It's not divided into dark and dark.

757
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
It appears at any time.

758
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,360
How do you think the haunted house is haunted?

759
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
It's just that

760
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,360
our house has been

761
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,360
making strange noises lately.

762
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,360
But if the air is dry,

763
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,360
the sound of wood or the floor

764
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
could be heard.

765
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
It's just a little noise.

766
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Don't scare yourself.

767
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Yes, I know.

768
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
But other than the strange sound of our house,

769
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
I can hear some noises.

770
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,360
For example,

771
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
when I wake up in the morning,

772
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
I put this thing here.

773
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
But when I get home from work,

774
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
this thing will go to another place.

775
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Don't you want to get in?

776
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
It shouldn't be.

777
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,360
I've checked it.

778
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
I didn't lose anything.

779
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
I didn't lose money.

780
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
I thought I'd put the money on the table.

781
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
Then you're mistaken.

782
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Actually, this thing

783
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
was originally placed in the same place.

784
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,360
No way.

785
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
One day,

786
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,360
I found a box of toothpaste

787
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
in the refrigerator.

788
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
How could I remember it wrong?

789
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
It's a little strange.

790
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
I think

791
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
that thing

792
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
wants to send me some signals.

793
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
But I haven't figured it out yet.

794
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
And the strangest thing is,

795
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
except for moving my stuff,

796
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,360
it will send me signals.

797
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
What's wrong with sending it?

798
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Actually, one night,

799
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
I felt a little uncomfortable.

800
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
I was in bed for a long time

801
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,360
before I fell asleep.

802
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Then when I woke up in the middle of the night,

803
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
I found that my bed

804
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
had a cup of mint tea.

805
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Is this mint tea

806
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
a secret function?

807
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Do you eat the medicine

808
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
and dream about it?

809
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
I never eat the medicine.

810
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
I don't have any.

811
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
And

812
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
I don't have any.

813
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
And

814
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,360
I never have any.

815
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
When did this happen?

816
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,360
At the end of last year.

817
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
No.

818
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
It happened two days ago.

819
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Because during that period,

820
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
we were participating

821
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
in the anniversary party.

822
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
So we were together

823
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
during the break.

824
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Anniversary party?

825
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,360
Did the news of the treasure

826
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,360
in the previous one

827
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,360
be on the anniversary party?

828
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Yes, that's right.

829
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
I'm sorry for the phone call.

830
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Sorry.

831
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Hello?

832
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Hello, Xiaoyang.

833
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
We found it.

834
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Really?

835
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
It's exactly the same as you think.

836
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
We got a lot of questions

837
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,360
in the library.

838
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Who do you suspect

839
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
in the previous anniversary party?

840
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
I want to discuss

841
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,360
their questions first.

842
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
This will be faster.

843
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
Actually, we have

844
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,360
all the questions about the suspect.

845
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
Please check

846
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
for me

847
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Lin Dacen and Xie Baolova.

848
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
These two suspects are the most important.

849
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Actually, we got a lot of questions

850
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
in the previous anniversary party.

851
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Two people?

852
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
I remember this.

853
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
The exchange of money

854
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
was organized by Lin Mo Yu.

855
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
He invited the whole building

856
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
to participate in the party.

857
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
He drank, talked,

858
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
watched the fireworks.

859
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
That's it.

860
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
What happened to the report?

861
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,360
A few police officers

862
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
took an aunt away.

863
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
An aunt?

864
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
She took a body of an aunt.

865
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Do you know this aunt?

866
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
No.

867
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
But I often see her in the building.

868
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
I heard a lot of people

869
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
talking about her.

870
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
Excuse me, your name is Ye Meili.

871
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
It's me.

872
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,360
Police.

873
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,360
According to the group report,

874
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
we found that

875
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
you were in the 15-year-old

876
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
and bought a child.

877
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,360
Please cooperate with us to investigate.

878
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
The police

879
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,360
and the police

880
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
were in the 15-year-old

881
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
and bought a child.

882
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
The suspect was Ye Mo Yu.

883
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
He was a family doctor

884
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
who bought a child for many years.

885
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
Yesterday,

886
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
the police reported that

887
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
a car accident

888
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
occurred in the high-level apartment

889
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
of Ye Mo's work.

890
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Are you Ye Shujun?

891
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,360
Do you know him?

892
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,360
He finally found you.

893
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,360
Master,

894
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
are you reading this news material?

895
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
When did you come back?

896
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
I just came back.

897
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,360
I heard the director say that

898
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,360
you were a good guy.

899
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,360
You did a great job.

900
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
Master,

901
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
we have now

902
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,360
two people's fingerprints.

903
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
I think

904
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
it must be

905
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
one of Lin Da-sen

906
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
and Xie Bao Luo.

907
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Who do you think it is?

908
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,360
It's hard to judge now.

909
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Xiaoyang,

910
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,360
you think it's possible

911
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,360
to judge a woman

912
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
in a woman's way?

913
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
It must be Lin Da-sen.

914
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,360
Why?

915
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,360
Because he's a scumbag.

916
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Xiaoyang,

917
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,360
you can't judge a case

918
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
with personal preference.

919
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
You can't use your feelings.

920
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
I don't know

921
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
what you like.

922
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
I think

923
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Xie Bao Luo's potential is high.

924
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Why?

925
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
I think he's annoying.

926
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Master,

927
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
remember to call.

928
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
I'm busy.

929
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
Hello?

930
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
Hello,

931
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
Officer Yang,

932
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
I'm Xiaoli,

933
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,360
a reporter.

934
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
We just found

935
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
one person's fingerprints.

936
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
The other person's fingerprints

937
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
must be the one

938
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
you haven't learned.

939
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
So we didn't find it.

940
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,360
We need to expand the採集 range

941
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
to find the fingerprints

942
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
in the building.

943
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,360
We might need a few days.

944
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Who's this person?

945
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
According to our current team,

946
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
this person is...

947
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
I invited you back today

948
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
mainly because

949
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
I found your fingerprints

950
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
in Zhong Mei Bao's room.

951
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
I hope you can explain to us

952
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
what's more,

953
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
can you tell us

954
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
about the last year's

955
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
anniversary of the meeting?

956
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
What exactly happened?

957
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,360
The End

958
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,360
The End

959
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,360
The End

960
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
The End

961
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
The End

962
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
The End

963
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,360
The End
