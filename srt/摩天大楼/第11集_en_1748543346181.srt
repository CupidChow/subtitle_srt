1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
beg for your love

2
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,980
I just want you to know that in the future,

3
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,460
all these things will come to an end by chance.

4
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,300
We don't have enough time.

5
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,260
Some weekend we can meet in exchange for bed.

6
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,980
We'll move out this weekend.

7
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,180
He must have left for Renская all those days.

8
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,820
Right now.

9
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,300
Hello, sister.

10
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,100
What's up?

11
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,220
Hello, Jingya.

12
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,300
Are you coming to join the training?

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,100
Yes.

14
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,500
I'm on the stage.

15
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,700
What's wrong?

16
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,780
Nothing.

17
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,220
I just want to tell you

18
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,460
that you should practice

19
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,220
and eat well every day.

20
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,420
Take good care of yourself.

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,060
Sister.

22
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,260
You called me to tell me this.

23
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,420
Actually, I've been saying this

24
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,540
for so many years.

25
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,220
But I just want to

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,540
say it again.

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,580
This sentence

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,380
is the most important to me.

29
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,740
That's good.

30
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,620
Go now.

31
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,740
Yes.

32
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,700
What?

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,820
Bye.

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,820
Bye.

35
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,780
What's wrong?

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,700
Your phone.

37
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,180
Sorry.

38
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,740
Can I go everyday?

39
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,260
along with life

40
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,700
lovely fans

41
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,540
Hello.

42
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,140
Mr Ye has been represented recently.

43
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,340
He's in a very bad state.

44
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,900
You need to consider his every action.

45
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,220
Do not be so upset, okay?

46
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,820
Yes, looks good.

47
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,940
Mr Ye.

48
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,940
Ah, we went to the medical room before

49
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,780
meeting your,

50
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,700
is it called Yamao River?

51
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,020
Mr Ye.

52
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,100
He said,

53
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,860
you have a sister,

54
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,860
Can you tell us about the two of you?

55
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,860
Also, you've been discussing with us for many times.

56
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,860
What do you want to hide?

57
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,860
Please don't be so careless.

58
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,860
You didn't even say anything.

59
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,860
You just considered Mr. Ye as a criminal.

60
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
Do you understand?

61
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,860
This case is not solved.

62
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
It's not solved.

63
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
If it's solved one day,

64
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,860
his sister's death will be a big deal.

65
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,860
Maybe his mother-in-law

66
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,860
won't have to stay in prison.

67
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,860
Do you know how much pressure he has?

68
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,860
We have six rounds of trials and six rounds.

69
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
Do you know?

70
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,860
Do you think his life is more important than his performance?

71
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,860
No, it's not my fault.

72
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,860
I shouldn't have stolen the piano.

73
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,860
I was the one who stole the piano.

74
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,860
They were dead.

75
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,860
That's right.

76
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,860
Please tell us.

77
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,860
What are you talking about?

78
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,860
Can you stop arguing?

79
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,860
Stop arguing.

80
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,860
Can I talk to you alone?

81
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Have you been to see Mrs. Ye recently?

82
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,860
Yes.

83
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,860
I told her that she was wronged.

84
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,860
I have found a lawyer.

85
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,860
I will definitely take her home.

86
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
I heard from Mrs. Ye that

87
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,860
your sister and brother

88
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,860
have always been your family.

89
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,860
All your sister did

90
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,860
was to make you a wife.

91
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
Now that she is in a state of grief,

92
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,860
I think it's hard for you to accept her.

93
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,860
I heard that every time you attend a concert,

94
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,860
you will have three positions.

95
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
I guess

96
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,860
you are one for Mrs. Ye,

97
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,860
one for sister,

98
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,860
and one for whom?

99
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
Mr. Ye,

100
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,860
it's okay. Don't be nervous.

101
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
It's not a question.

102
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
Just say whatever you want.

103
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,860
Master,

104
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,860
give me some time.

105
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,860
I want to talk to him alone.

106
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
Okay.

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Okay.

108
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
Can you hear me?

109
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,860
If we are going to study,

110
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,860
he won't die.

111
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,860
Have you learned how to play the piano?

112
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,860
No.

113
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,860
You want to play it so much?

114
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,860
What do you mean?

115
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Then you have decided.

116
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,860
Why did you lie to him for ten dollars?

117
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,860
I didn't lie.

118
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,860
My brother

119
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,860
will play it when he hears it.

120
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,860
He is a genius.

121
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,860
You are so bad.

122
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,860
Can you play the piano?

123
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
I can.

124
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,860
Mrs. Wusheng

125
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,860
You had amazing London's〜

126
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
How was that?

127
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
Thoroughly fallen down?

128
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Full drop.

129
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,860
人?

130
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,860
It's all my fault.

131
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,860
No, you lied.

132
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
I didn't lie.

133
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
You are good at playing music.

134
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,860
He never empress.

135
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
He rarely empress.

136
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,860
He did!

137
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,580
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,740
Chou Mei Bao,

139
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,220
why can't you go with me?

140
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,340
Tell me,

141
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,380
is it because I have money for you?

142
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,700
You're jealous of me?

143
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,420
I'm not jealous of you.

144
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,100
I'll say it again.

145
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,620
I'm not lying.

146
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,020
I told you,

147
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,620
my brother, he'll talk

148
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,820
when he hears it.

149
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,860
Actually,

150
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,740
he's not that good.

151
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,860
You can learn from him.

152
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,180
I'll go home

153
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,780
and play with him for two hours.

154
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,780
And I can't play well.

155
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,300
I'm so good at this.

156
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,220
If I can let you play with him,

157
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,780
how will you repay me?

158
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,620
Parents' Day

159
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,340
Mom needs you toenails.

160
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,420
The baby has to beетровtho get reproduce.

161
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,860
Can you?

162
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,580
It should be fine.

163
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,580
Although there isn't a problem,

164
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,500
I'll just go to home.

165
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I'm fine for now.

166
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,740
When could you

167
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,900
introduce the baby to your mother?

168
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,740
She will try to take her up to erg Ellina.

169
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,740
We are going to leave now.

170
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,740
We are going to leave now.

171
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,740
Your grandma is also a Chinese.

172
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,740
Can you see my husband?

173
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,740
He said that he would be more polite than others.

174
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Listen to me.

175
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,740
Listen to me.

176
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
Take care of your grandma.

177
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,740
Wei Wei, are you hungry?

178
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
I'll get you something to eat.

179
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
Let's talk.

180
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,740
No, I'll continue to talk.

181
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Okay.

182
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,740
I'll get you something to eat.

183
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:25,220
By the way,

184
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,420
you are a花-n kenntub,

185
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,420
Aren't you here to eat, Wei Wei?

186
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,420
What are enjoyable are upsetting.

187
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,420
Po 안녕하세요 qué?

188
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,420
普通話呢.

189
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,620
You know, my doorknob,

190
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:44,620
You are like a light,

191
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,620
with the scent of the hot,

192
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,240
Look!

193
00:11:49,680 --> 00:12:12,660
Did you�

194
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,380
take it?

195
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,080
You'll be nine.

196
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,740
This earpiece will go there.

197
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,860
I'll show you.

198
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,380
Turn things around.

199
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,420
Turn them around.

200
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,700
That's makes incorrect.

201
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,700
The first one is the one with the most beautiful and beautiful scenery.

202
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,700
The second one is the one with the most beautiful and beautiful scenery.

203
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,700
The third one is the one with the most beautiful and beautiful scenery.

204
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,700
The fourth one is the one with the most beautiful and beautiful scenery.

205
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,700
The fifth one is the one with the most beautiful and beautiful scenery.

206
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,700
The fifth one is the one with the most beautiful and beautiful scenery.

207
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Grandma, I'm here.

208
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,700
Why are you back?

209
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
I'm going back to China.

210
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,700
Wei Wei, your teacher Zhang is playing piano for you.

211
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
It's Teacher Wu.

212
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Oh.

213
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Say it. Who are you two thinking about?

214
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,700
It's me.

215
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,700
So Wei Wei's money is spent on you, isn't it?

216
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
Yes.

217
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,700
I can use it to buy food and toys.

218
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
Where's your parents?

219
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,700
My mom is cooking all day. I can't find them.

220
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Where's your dad?

221
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,700
We don't have a dad.

222
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Since your parents don't care about you, I can only ask your teacher to help you.

223
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,700
Wei Wei, I'll let you transfer next week.

224
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,700
I can't let you stay with such a child.

225
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Thank you.

226
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
What are you doing? Eat ice.

227
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,700
I don't eat ice. I don't practice piano.

228
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,700
Why?

229
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Because we were sold out because of piano.

230
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
It's not like that.

231
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Let's go swimming.

232
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
No.

233
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
You can't do anything.

234
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,700
You can't give me money. I'm angry.

235
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,700
If you're happy when you play piano,

236
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
then don't care about anything.

237
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
You should focus on playing piano.

238
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Your sister learned piano for you.

239
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,700
You really have a lot of benefits.

240
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,700
I entrusted her.

241
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Sometimes I think

242
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,700
if she didn't love me that much, I would be fine.

243
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Maybe she has a real life.

244
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:37,700
If I were you, I would find a way to find out the real brother and avenge my sister.

245
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Only one person in this world will hurt my sister.

246
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,700
I don't need to think about this person.

247
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Why are you so sure?

248
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Can you tell me who she is?

249
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Hey, this is a lot of money.

250
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
What do you think?

251
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
The ticket inside is so good.

252
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,700
I think you should at least make ten thousand yuan for this.

253
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,700
Not a big deal.

254
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Ten thousand?

255
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Twenty thousand?

256
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
Maybe fifty thousand?

257
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
I just calculated it.

258
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
The price of the ticket inside

259
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
will not be so much if it is added together.

260
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Why are you so rich?

261
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,700
The income of the performance is just a small part.

262
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,700
And there are sponsors, advertising companies, and some cultural supplementary companies.

263
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,700
At least ten thousand.

264
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,700
How can you think of such a person?

265
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,700
The murderer you are talking about

266
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,700
is not your father.

267
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Are you afraid of what?

268
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,700
I don't want to talk about it.

269
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,700
Don't you want to avenge your sister?

270
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Only you can save Yan Youyuan now.

271
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
I really don't want to.

272
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,700
I don't want to.

273
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,700
I really don't want to.

274
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,700
I know. I will apologize to her manager.

275
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
That's right. That's right.

276
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
That's right. That's right.

277
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
That's not right.

278
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Guo Liufei, you also came all the way from Xunren.

279
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Don't you make mistakes?

280
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Why do you have to make mistakes on me?

281
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
But I did not make any mistakes.

282
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,700
It's not you.

283
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
It seems like it's true.

284
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Anyway, I mean to say that

285
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Xiao Yang is a person who has a lot of potential.

286
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
I have been teaching him.

287
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
He is starting to reflect on himself.

288
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,700
How about this?

289
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Just ask him to be on the table.

290
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Okay?

291
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
Master.

292
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
I heard that manager agreed to be mine.

293
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,700
It's okay. Let's eat.

294
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Master, did Ye Shujun not accept our contract?

295
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
No.

296
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Sorry, master. It's all my fault.

297
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,700
We didn't make any profit.

298
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
We didn't make any profit.

299
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
At least we know that

300
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Ye Shujun has such a high economic value.

301
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
And from the current investigation results,

302
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,700
his father is a greedy person.

303
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Think about it.

304
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
Once he knows his own biological son,

305
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,700
he can earn millions of dollars in a show.

306
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Let him go.

307
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
That's good.

308
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Let's eat.

309
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,700
What are you afraid of?

310
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Don't you want to avenge your sister?

311
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Only you can repay Yan Yongyuan now.

312
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Xiaojun, are you feeling better?

313
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
It's okay.

314
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
He didn't treat me well.

315
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,700
I've already told the police that I've complained to the police.

316
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
They won't bother you anymore.

317
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
You should rest at home.

318
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,700
You should calm down.

319
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Okay. I got it.

320
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Xiaojun.

321
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Let me talk to you again.

322
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Why do we have to go away?

323
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,820
Shit.

324
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,700
There will be aまた.

325
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,700
Explain it.

326
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,700
She's right.

327
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,200
Where is it?

328
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,200
Is someone there?

329
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,960
What's going on, of course.

330
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,620
Sorry if it can't drive you at home.

331
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,620
Sir.

332
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,980
I'm here for one witness 77いうこと.

333
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,820
My brother really loves playing piano and hip-hop.

334
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,280
Pleaseンネ°A day with him.

335
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,280
Talk to him before going to the witness 77.

336
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,400
No.

337
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,020
It's my cons张.

338
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,820
I can't bear to talk about it.

339
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,780
Sister,

340
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,820
why is the piano

341
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,020
not accurate

342
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,460
in the second F?

343
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,820
Qiu Bai Yao,

344
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,860
your ears are really sharp.

345
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,260
Boss,

346
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,020
since you don't need this,

347
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,420
why don't you sell it to me?

348
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,060
Do you know how much this piano costs?

349
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,940
I only have 953 yuan here.

350
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,740
These are all the money

351
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,140
we made for others.

352
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,300
I'm the one who made this piano.

353
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
He's playing it every day.

354
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,580
How can I sell it?

355
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,700
Come on, take a picture.

356
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,900
Everyone, go back.

357
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,500
I can play this song too.

358
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,340
Qiu Bai Yao,

359
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,580
can you play the piano?

360
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,540
I don't have a piano.

361
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,780
I can play it.

362
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,540
If you can play it,

363
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,100
this piano is yours.

364
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,980
Okay.

365
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:36,500
Let piece this, let piece this, you piece this.

366
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,540
Master,

367
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,260
I don't get it.

368
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,660
Why are you here instead of us?

369
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,000
People

370
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,440
don't leave real fast.

371
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,860
They've been away for so long

372
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,700
since the Chinese New Year's Eve.

373
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,500
Are you sure someone remembers them?

374
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,860
What's your name?

375
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,340
Master.

376
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,220
What can I do for you?

377
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,540
You've been complaining so much recently.

378
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,220
Did you quarrel with your boyfriend?

379
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,140
To be honest,

380
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,340
the kids started to develop from middle school.

381
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,580
Almost a year.

382
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,860
It's really hard for you to let me

383
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,020
use photos to recognize them.

384
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,900
I'm sorry.

385
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,060
By the way,

386
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,220
do you have a piano teacher?

387
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,460
Don't say that.

388
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,140
We often can't find anyone

389
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,340
even in music classes.

390
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,940
Can you go and see

391
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,340
your music classroom?

392
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,100
Sure.

393
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,300
We'll teach there.

394
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,220
Let's go.

395
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,580
Hello, teacher.

396
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,380
This is the music classroom of our school.

397
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,620
The kids here

398
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,780
can learn English and math well.

399
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,660
When someone teaches them,

400
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,700
they jump around.

401
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,500
When no one is in the music class,

402
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,700
they change their mind.

403
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,580
This...

404
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,460
piano.

405
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,540
This is Mr. Song's

406
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,700
music class.

407
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,740
He used it once.

408
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,940
Actually, what we asked you

409
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,980
is a kid who can play piano.

410
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,100
There aren't many kids like this

411
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,340
in your town, right?

412
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,860
It seems that there's a boy.

413
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,420
He was in our school's

414
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,700
Mid-Autumn Festival.

415
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,060
He said he had a show.

416
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,420
So we moved the piano

417
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,580
and used it.

418
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,220
Just think about it.

419
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,700
Is this boy

420
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,340
the one on the picture?

421
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,700
I remember this.

422
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,860
I really can't remember

423
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,340
this man.

424
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,900
Why don't you go and ask Mr. Song?

425
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,220
Maybe he knows.

426
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,540
Thank you.

427
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,060
What's going on?

428
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,860
Is something wrong?

429
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,180
Sir.

430
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,860
We are from the Mancheng Xun Group.

431
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,860
I want to ask you about someone.

432
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,860
I know a lot of people in this town.

433
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,860
Do you remember this photo?

434
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
His name is Ye Shujun.

435
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,860
This is his current photo.

436
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Do you still have any impression?

437
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,860
As long as you see these two children's eyes,

438
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,860
you will know that they are the good children of the two single children.

439
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,860
Unfortunately, their father is a devil.

440
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,860
You knew this person very early on?

441
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
Of course I knew.

442
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,860
The whole town knows that he is a bastard.

443
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,860
He left his hometown for so many years.

444
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,860
He suddenly brought his wife and child back.

445
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,860
He is a bastard.

446
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,860
He is a bastard.

447
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,860
He is a bastard.

448
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,860
He suddenly brought his wife and child back.

449
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,860
If I knew that he treated these two children like this,

450
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,860
I wouldn't...

451
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,860
Can you play a song for me?

452
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
What is this?

453
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,860
You are so annoying.

454
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,860
How dare you spend my money to buy this?

455
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,860
Who spent your money?

456
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
It's not my money.

457
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,860
It's not your money.

458
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,860
It's not your money.

459
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,860
I just wanted it.

460
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,860
You learned to play hide-and-seek with two people.

461
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Let's change the rules today, okay?

462
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,860
If one person makes a mistake,

463
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
we will punish another person, okay?

464
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Today is the day to see who is the culprit.

465
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,860
Let's punish her today, okay?

466
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Let's punish her.

467
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,860
Let's punish her.

468
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,860
Get out.

469
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,860
Get up.

470
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
Get out.

471
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,860
Get out.

472
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Let's punish her.

473
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,860
Let's punish her.

474
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,860
How did you know her father's behavior?

475
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,860
She was beaten like this.

476
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,860
The whole town is pity on these two children.

477
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,860
Sometimes my brother came here to hide.

478
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,860
He chased her over.

479
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,860
He was so arrogant in front of the whole town.

480
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,860
It's not easy for her to be like this.

481
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,860
Don't kill me, Gang Qin.

482
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
I said it.

483
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,860
If I make a mistake, I will punish another person.

484
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,860
Are you going to play with Gang Qin today?

485
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,860
Are you?

486
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,860
Are you going to play with her?

487
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
Are you going to play with her?

488
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,860
Are you going to play with her?

489
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Are you going to play with her?

490
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
Are you going to play with her?

491
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,860
Are you going to play with my brother?

492
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,860
Did you say that?

493
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,860
Go.

494
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,860
You don't move, brother.

495
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,860
Then we will be sisters.

496
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Go.

497
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,860
Go.

498
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,860
Brother.

499
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,860
Brother.

500
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,860
Brother.

501
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
Brother.

502
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
Brother.

503
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,860
Brother.

504
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,060
Not easy to solve thisagar present

505
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,260
No reason

506
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,960
No conclusion

507
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,720
Not a solution

508
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,060
So many years he has been afraid

509
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,500
So many stories

510
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,080
In the past, not long

511
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,080
Their whole family Afghanistan

512
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,000
Tu goodbye

513
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,760
Pull symbol out

514
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,680
I cheaper bought that piano

515
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,960
Too bad

516
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
It's not like it's a big deal.

517
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Shimei asked about a matter of carelessness.

518
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,560
How did you

519
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
put the current piano artist Jun

520
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,960
and the kid on the photo

521
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
on the number?

522
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
We took the photo just now

523
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
and showed it to her.

524
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
She didn't believe

525
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
it was the same person.

526
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
To be honest,

527
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
it's because she came to see me

528
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
a few years ago.

529
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
She said she wanted to bring that piano

530
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
back to me

531
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
and make it a few years.

532
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Jun.

533
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Jun.

534
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Jun.

535
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
I think he's dead.

536
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Jun.

537
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
I'm protecting you.

538
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
I'm protecting you.

539
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Jun.

540
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Okay.

541
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Thank you.

542
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
Chen Shihua.

543
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
You really don't eat?

544
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
I don't eat.

545
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
What are you thinking about?

546
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Although there's something

547
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
that I've been feeling.

548
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
But

549
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
I still don't want to believe

550
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
that it's true.

551
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
These little places are all closed.

552
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
The domestic violence

553
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
is basically a matter of speed.

554
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
But I think

555
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
it's not just a simple report.

556
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
Hello.

557
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Hello.

558
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Officer Zhang.

559
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
I'm Yan Shujing.

560
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Can we talk?

561
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Hello.

562
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Hello.

563
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Hello.

564
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Hello.

565
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Hello.

566
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Hello.
