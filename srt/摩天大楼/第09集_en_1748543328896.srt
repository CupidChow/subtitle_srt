1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
engaging you

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,980
or

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,900
I

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,020
wish

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,180
you two

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,920
Shihng who has become

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,400
''How do you not love me''

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,940
Hua

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,460
I don't care

10
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:55,820
Hua

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,660
Sister, I'm eating vegetarian food and not meat.

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,660
Can I not eat this dish?

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,700
I'm in trouble.

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,580
You're new here?

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,660
It's my first day here.

16
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,700
What are you doing?

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,020
What are you doing?

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,820
You're not in the restaurant?

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,620
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:14,940
I...

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,060
What are you talking about?

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,060
What are you two doing?

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,620
Don't say anything.

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,420
Look at her.

25
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,940
Talk nicely.

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,460
I... I don't believe it.

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,540
Have you finished your meal?

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,380
Go now.

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,140
She doesn't want meat.

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,900
I'll eat it.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,380
Didn't you say you couldn't come?

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,860
You're on your way back.

33
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,460
What happened?

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,140
Thank you.

35
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,980
Be quiet.

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
Be quiet.

37
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,780
Get in.

38
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,780
Use your strength.

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,500
Put the stuff away.

40
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,380
Where did you get this?

41
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,740
You even read books.

42
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,140
You said

43
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,660
you were happy to see a good person

44
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
here.

45
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,580
Wei Li,

46
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,180
your son is so filial.

47
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,860
He doesn't come to see you every day.

48
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,020
Unlike my son,

49
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,700
he hasn't come to see me for months.

50
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,180
Don't say that.

51
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,820
Don't say that.

52
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,180
He's not her son.

53
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,820
He's a kid who's been brought here.

54
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,940
Don't be sad.

55
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,900
Really?

56
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,660
Yes.

57
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,820
Wei Li,

58
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,340
The story of Mr.Huang's death

59
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,180
Look at this

60
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,780
Why are you so far away from me?

61
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,580
Come closer

62
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,180
Come come come, sit down

63
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,780
Look

64
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,380
What's wrong?

65
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,580
Nothing

66
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,580
Thank you, master

67
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,980
Master, look at this

68
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,980
Is it good for Zhou Meibao and Ye Meili

69
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,580
to be together?

70
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,580
Don't you think it's a little too good?

71
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,380
A aunt is actually close to the relationship

72
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,180
It's not like this

73
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,980
Is it true?

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,980
How is Ye Meili's background investigation?

75
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,780
We only know that

76
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,780
After Ye Meili came to the double-checked room

77
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,980
She has been working for aunt Baojing

78
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,580
As for the previous situation

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,180
We are still contacting local police to investigate

80
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,180
That kid who was sold by the ghost

81
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,380
is also ready to investigate

82
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,980
Ok

83
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,380
How is Ye Meili's true feelings?

84
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,980
There is no news yet

85
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,380
But I will go and urge her

86
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,780
Master, I also think

87
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,380
We can't see Ye Meili for a while

88
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,980
Why don't we go to visit her first

89
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,180
and get her familiar with her?

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,980
After all, there are more than ten people in this building

91
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,180
Have you ever hired her?

92
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,580
This idea is good

93
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,980
Sister Fei, I haven't seen you for a long time

94
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,780
Yes

95
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,780
I feel very close to everyone when I come back this time

96
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,380
You should take care of her more in the future

97
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,580
Let's have a meal together

98
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,180
Ok

99
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,180
Why is she back?

100
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,380
I heard it's a promotion

101
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,380
Now it's the head of the administrative team

102
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,780
Come to investigate the work

103
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,780
Really?

104
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,780
I didn't expect that

105
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,980
Sister, don't wipe it

106
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,380
You have already wiped it for you

107
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,980
It's very clean now

108
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
It's a little dirty

109
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,380
Sister

110
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,380
Sister

111
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,580
Sister, don't wipe it

112
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,580
Don't wipe it

113
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,980
It's ok

114
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,780
It's ok

115
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,980
You are a kind person

116
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,980
A good person will have a good hug

117
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,180
If a good person has a good hug

118
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,780
Why don't you let go?

119
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,580
You and your husband are making frauds

120
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,380
You have made our whole village a mess

121
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,580
You are so miserable

122
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,980
Why don't you be a good person at that time?

123
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,780
We have already ruined it

124
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,180
We know we are wrong

125
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,380
At that time, we were also reckless

126
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,780
We did that thing

127
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
Don't come here

128
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,180
Don't give me fake news

129
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,180
What are you doing?

130
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,780
Xiaoyang, I've told you many times

131
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,580
I don't want to help you speed up

132
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,580
The young man said

133
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,980
You are a cross-court case

134
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,380
There are many obstacles

135
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,380
This time

136
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,180
I know

137
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,980
So I want to ask you to help me think of a way

138
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,380
Can you be faster?

139
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,580
You

140
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,780
How about looking for a leader

141
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,780
See if they can help you to learn

142
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,580
I don't know any leaders

143
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,580
No, do you know?

144
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,580
I know

145
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,980
Yes, I know Zhong Deng

146
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,980
He should be

147
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,580
Xiaolai

148
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,380
Do you have anything else to help me to learn?

149
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,180
If not, I will

150
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,180
No, no, no

151
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,180
He just asked you for something

152
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,980
Xiaoyang

153
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,580
I haven't seen you before

154
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,380
Hello, I am from Xinjiang

155
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
My name is Yang Ruisin

156
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,580
Hello, my name is Liu Fei

157
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,980
We used to be in the team

158
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,980
Introduce yourself

159
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,380
Xiaoyang is a disciple of Zhong Weixin

160
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,180
Liu Fei, your senior sister

161
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,580
Senior sister

162
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,580
I was also in the team when I first came

163
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,180
Now it's great

164
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,180
I used to be called a senior sister

165
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,780
What should I call in the future

166
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,580
Liu Zhi, right

167
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,580
You don't change

168
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,380
No, I don't

169
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,180
You don't even dare to say yes

170
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,580
You still call me senior sister

171
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,580
By the way, what do you want to talk to me about?

172
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,180
Yes, yes, just now

173
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,980
Just now, he has something to do

174
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,580
I'm telling you

175
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,180
Your senior sister is the most famous person in our team

176
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,380
What's the matter, you ask him

177
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,980
I have something to do

178
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,780
You go and talk to yourself

179
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,380
Let's go

180
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,180
He doesn't know

181
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,980
Thank you, sister

182
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,980
But let's eat together later

183
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,580
Why can't you coordinate

184
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,380
Not coordinate

185
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,580
We have to talk about the procedure

186
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,780
You are also involved in this case

187
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,780
Yes, my master asked me to do the procedure

188
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,180
Zhong Le is always busy with things

189
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,980
You can still remember the beginning and end

190
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,380
Actually it's quite a waste of resources

191
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,980
There are many people in this case

192
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,380
Especially close to the dead

193
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,580
Have you found out

194
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,780
Where is the family

195
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,980
I found it

196
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,780
So there is no need to be so anxious

197
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,780
To meet a family with no family with a dead person

198
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,100
Any family with a family of family

199
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,780
Our case is in the process

200
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,980
Don't be your master's bad

201
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,380
How about this

202
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,580
Don't worry

203
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,980
I'll go and evaluate it first

204
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,580
If he is suspicious

205
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,980
I'll apply for you immediately

206
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,380
Really

207
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Thank you

208
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,180
How is Zhong recently

209
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,580
That

210
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,380
The thing about Xin Saoer

211
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,780
Is it true

212
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,580
I don't know either

213
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,580
I'm waiting for the final investigation now

214
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,980
Then do you think

215
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,380
I am involved in such a thing

216
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,580
I think it doesn't mean anything

217
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,380
Isn't it just a evidence to be a police officer

218
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,780
The truth that has been proved by evidence

219
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,380
Is considered the truth of the truth

220
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,380
Right

221
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,980
How much to eat

222
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,580
Jia

223
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,580
We hurt a lot of people

224
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,180
But finally the family

225
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,580
Two dogs fell down

226
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,780
The family's child

227
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,780
Three or five years old

228
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,780
Three or five years old

229
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,180
You said you made so many mistakes

230
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,180
After you go out

231
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,380
What else can you do

232
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,980
As long as you love you can forgive you

233
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,180
You can start over

234
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,180
Don't cry, eat quickly

235
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
sister

236
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,780
I heard

237
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
A lot of things happened in your house

238
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,780
The cold has gone out

239
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,780
If you need help, call me anytime

240
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,380
Thank you for your kindness

241
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
For this life

242
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,780
I'm afraid I can only rely on myself

243
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,780
Look at you

244
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,780
Can't you only eat vegetable if you can't stand it?

245
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,780
Come eat some pork

246
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
sister

247
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,780
He can't get married

248
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,780
I know

249
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,780
I just want to see him eat meat

250
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,780
How about it

251
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,780
Don't be mad

252
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,780
Ye Meili

253
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,780
He killed a lot of people in our village

254
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,780
I asked him to eat some meat

255
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,780
Come eat some meat

256
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,780
Eat

257
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,780
Don't eat

258
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,780
Don't mind it, okay

259
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,500
It's not good.

260
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,860
I believe you've already

261
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,220
eaten this piece of meat.

262
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,220
I'm going to give it to him.

263
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,900
Don't make a fuss.

264
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,740
I don't want him to eat it.

265
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,540
Is he eating it or not?

266
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,260
Don't eat it.

267
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,420
Forget it.

268
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,060
Eat it.

269
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,940
I'll eat it.

270
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,500
Eat it.

271
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Is it good?

272
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,260
Come on.

273
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,860
One more piece.

274
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,100
One more bite.

275
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,300
One more bite.

276
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,420
What are you pretending to be?

277
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,820
Aren't you eating meat too?

278
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,060
You're not eating it all day.

279
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,100
You're just a hypocrite.

280
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,020
What are you doing?

281
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,980
Sun Wei, why are you here again?

282
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,340
You're all here.

283
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,140
Come with me.

284
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,380
Hurry up.

285
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,740
What's wrong?

286
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,500
Come on.

287
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,220
Come with me.

288
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,860
Come.

289
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,500
I'll be back.

290
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,220
Are you okay?

291
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,940
They canceled my fake business.

292
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,140
That's too much.

293
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,940
Didn't you say you'd be there next month?

294
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,260
We'll be together

295
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,700
for the next year.

296
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,740
It's okay.

297
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,020
You can go there soon.

298
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,420
Miss Lu.

299
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,700
Mr. Chen.

300
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:58,940
And Detective Zhong.

301
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,100
You should have someone

302
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,300
anüssel before you.

303
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,060
You didn't go there.

304
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,100
You came here for work.

305
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,820
Isn't that right?

306
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,620
I'm afraid there are others.

307
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,020
You didn't go there last year.

308
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,340
Don't try to sum it up.

309
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,940
Yes, it's because of the case.

310
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,540
During the case, you had a concern for her, right?

311
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,340
No.

312
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,540
I didn't have a concern for her.

313
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,940
Then, are you all working and meeting?

314
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,940
Director Zhong, I believe you are very clear.

315
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,540
Our conversation today is very important to your career.

316
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,140
Moreover, when the other party reported,

317
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,140
they also provided video evidence.

318
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,140
So, your answer is very important.

319
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,940
I hope you can make the right choice.

320
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,140
Yes.

321
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,340
Excuse me, do you have any meeting with the private sector outside of work?

322
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,140
We only met once.

323
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,140
And at that time, we had already solved the case.

324
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,940
Director Zhong, can you hear me out?

325
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,540
Director Zhong.

326
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,340
I told you everything I could.

327
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,740
Don't come to me again, okay?

328
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,140
Director Zhong, listen to me. My husband is really innocent.

329
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,340
Everyone in their company knows that

330
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,940
that woman wanted to take her as the general manager, so that's why she framed him.

331
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,940
This case is full of evidence.

332
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,540
I will report it to the local police immediately.

333
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,740
If you think he is really innocent, you should find a legal solution.

334
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,140
Director Zhong, please help me.

335
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
Okay, okay, listen to me.

336
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,340
Are you okay?

337
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,940
Get up quickly. Are you okay?

338
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,540
Get up quickly.

339
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,540
Director Zhong, it's really not easy for us to get to this point.

340
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,340
If he really wasn't sentenced,

341
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,140
our future will be over, Director Zhong.

342
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,740
We still have a child.

343
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,540
I heard how my child will be seen in school.

344
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,540
You think your family is very important, right?

345
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,240
Your child is very important.

346
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,740
But have you ever thought about the victim's family

347
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,940
and her parents?

348
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,340
Okay, don't cry. Get up quickly.

349
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,940
Are you okay?

350
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,140
Director Zhong, what are you doing?

351
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,540
Why are you hitting me?

352
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,640
What are you doing?

353
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,340
He is hitting me, save him!

354
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,540
What are you doing?

355
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,140
Take a picture of him! He is hitting me!

356
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,540
Take a picture of him!

357
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,340
Director Zhong, I'm going to sue you!

358
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm going to sue you for being a criminal!

359
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,940
You don't know that after this incident was reported,

360
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,740
the police's reputation has caused a bad influence.

361
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,540
I know.

362
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,340
If we can't find the evidence to prove your innocence,

363
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,340
it's not that simple to stop.

364
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,940
Go.

365
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,140
Why are you always helping me?

366
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,940
Move aside.

367
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,140
Move aside.

368
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,140
I said move aside!

369
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,340
I'm sorry.

370
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,140
Excuse me, the moment you touched me,

371
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,740
you were the one who was in the police station.

372
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Are you from the hospital?

373
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,340
Master,

374
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,340
let's go and check on him.

375
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,340
Hello.

376
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,540
Hello.

377
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,340
We have a date with Miss Zhuang from 2602.

378
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:10,940
Okay.

379
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,340
You can go directly.

380
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,140
Thank you.

381
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,340
You're welcome.

382
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,540
This auntie, I think she is different from others.

383
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,740
Aunt Ye is very good.

384
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,940
Usually, the big and small ones are all her.

385
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,540
The small ones are also her.

386
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,340
For example, our wards,

387
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,540
she is...

388
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,540
She is...

389
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,340
For example, our wards,

390
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,740
she is always cleaning up.

391
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
How do you think?

392
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,540
I also want to pet a dog.

393
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,340
Our auntie Ye is very good at cooking.

394
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,940
Our family is also very satisfied with her.

395
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,540
Aunt Ye is very good at cooking.

396
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,940
I just wonder if she wants to feed me on purpose.

397
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,340
Whether it's a lunch or a Western meal,

398
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,340
she won't do it.

399
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,940
I really don't think she is a person.

400
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,340
But she's a very good auntie.

401
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,940
I also want to pet her.

402
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,340
I find it strange.

403
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,940
A perfect person like her can't be an auntie.

404
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,340
What is the matter with her?

405
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,540
She is very good at cooking.

406
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,740
Hey, babe.

407
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,540
Hey.

408
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,940
Are there any guests tonight?

409
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,540
Actually, they are police.

410
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,340
They just came to ask a few questions about Michelle.

411
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,540
About Michelle?

412
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,940
We miss her. How are you doing?

413
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,940
I forgot to say.

414
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,940
It's Michael. Pleasure to meet you.

415
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,740
Hi, hi.

416
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,340
She was just relaxed. She was perfect.

417
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,140
I mean,

418
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,840
we've been here for a long time.

419
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,240
We spoke so much.

420
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,440
I just don't believe that she could be a criminal.

421
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,040
Really.

422
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,240
So, do you guys talk in English?

423
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,040
Yeah.

424
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,240
Yeah, she's great English.

425
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,240
Spoke all the time.

426
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,240
She was here for so long.

427
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,840
She was great.

428
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,640
She could do everything.

429
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,240
I mean, but this...

430
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,840
Master.

431
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,240
It's late.

432
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,640
Shouldn't we go back?

433
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,040
We'll leave after the last house.

434
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,240
What's up?

435
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Do you have a date?

436
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,040
No.

437
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
I'm just working as a priority.

438
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Aunt Yi is a very strict person.

439
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,640
She helped me

440
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,840
to organize the books on the bookshelf.

441
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,040
I think she's different from other aunties.

442
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,040
She should be a cultured person.

443
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,440
Oh, right.

444
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,040
I was really scared by something like that.

445
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,440
What's the matter?

446
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,240
One time, my friend brought her child to our house to play.

447
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,040
Lin Lin.

448
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Here you are again.

449
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,640
I came here to see you.

450
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,440
Hello.

451
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
How are you doing these days?

452
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,840
I'm fine.

453
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Don't get upset.

454
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,240
Just play.

455
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,240
I don't care.

456
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,640
Come on.

457
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,440
Let me tell you.

458
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Look at your eyes.

459
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
They look good.

460
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
They're okay.

461
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,240
Aunt, they're okay.

462
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
They're really good.

463
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,840
Mom, what's this?

464
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
Talk to me.

465
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,440
And, let me tell you.

466
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,840
I saw a company.

467
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm so hungry.

468
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
The...

469
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
The...

470
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,040
You can't eat these.

471
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,040
It's raw.

472
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Don't be so sweet.

473
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
You must buy it.

474
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,240
You'll regret it if you don't.

475
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,040
The water is very good.

476
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,840
It must be.

477
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
It's really beautiful.

478
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,640
I'm so strict.

479
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Mom, I want to eat this.

480
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
I can't open it.

481
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,040
You're going to eat soon.

482
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,640
What kind of chips are you eating?

483
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,640
You're so annoying.

484
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,440
I'm talking to aunt.

485
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Let me tell you.

486
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,840
Her design

487
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,840
seems to be from the French designer.

488
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:37,920
The

489
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
Li Uliang!

490
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Li Uliang!

491
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,240
Li Uliang!

492
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,040
What's wrong?

493
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,840
Come here.

494
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,640
Take this.

495
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Take it.

496
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,640
What's wrong?

497
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,640
Hurry up.

498
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,440
I'll call Li Uliang.

499
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
I'll call 120.

500
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,240
What did he do later?

501
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Li Uliang!

502
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,040
My wife.

503
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,640
Call the police.

504
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
I'll give you one.

505
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Hurry up.

506
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,640
Okay.

507
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Okay.

508
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Li Uliang.

509
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I've called 120.

510
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,840
They said they'll be here soon.

511
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Open it.

512
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
What are you doing?

513
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
If you don't want her to die,

514
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
just trust me.

515
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
Son.

516
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
What's wrong?

517
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
What's wrong?

518
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
What's wrong?

519
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
What's wrong?

520
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
What's wrong?

521
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
What's wrong?

522
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
Li Uliang.

523
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
Fortunately, my son is safe.

524
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Doctor, be careful.

525
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
We should cook less.

526
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,440
What was Ye Meili doing before?

527
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
I'm curious.

528
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
How is Li Uliang?

529
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
The doctor said he's fine.

530
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
I'm telling you.

531
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
I went to the hospital

532
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
and found out that

533
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
your aunt

534
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
is the life-saving benefactor

535
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
of our family.

536
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
What did the doctor say?

537
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
He said he thought

538
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
there was a professional

539
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
rescue agent at the scene.

540
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Fortunately, the emergency food

541
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
was served.

542
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
He was really unlucky.

543
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Your aunt is amazing.

544
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
Mrs. Xuan.

545
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Hello.

546
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
I was wearing clothes.

547
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
How is Liang?

548
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
It's all good.

549
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
Thank you, aunt.

550
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Aunt Ye.

551
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Why do you have

552
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
such a professional medical knowledge?

553
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
I worked at a doctor's place before.

554
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
I learned a little

555
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
about the emergency relief method.

556
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
I didn't expect

557
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
he would use it.

558
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
Then sit down and talk.

559
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
I'm hungry.

560
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
I prepared two dishes.

561
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
You guys talk slowly.

562
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
Okay.

563
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Aunt Ye is really not in a hurry.

564
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
When are you going to

565
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
stop talking to me?

566
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
I'll pay for it.

567
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Such a difficult emergency skill,

568
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
even if you learn it,

569
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
you won't dare to do it.

570
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
Do you believe in what he said?

571
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Since you know

572
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
he's lying,

573
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
why do you still have to

574
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
invite him

575
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
to be your aunt?

576
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
He didn't do anything wrong.

577
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
The cleaning of the cleaning at home

578
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
was also delicious.

579
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
He saved my child.

580
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
I don't mind

581
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
what he used to do.

582
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Bye.

583
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
How is it?

584
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Let me see.

585
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Ye Meili,

586
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
Li Guilan,

587
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
and Shuang He Yi graduated from the Academy.

588
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
After graduation,

589
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
he went to Xinlong County

590
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
to take the hospital treatment.

591
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
He also became the first

592
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
foreign doctor in the local county hospital.

593
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Xinlong County?

594
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Isn't Xinlong County

595
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
the county where

596
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
Zhong Yunbang lived?

597
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
What a coincidence.

598
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
It seems

599
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
we should go back to this aunt as soon as possible.

600
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
But what should we do

601
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
with the procedure?

602
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Didn't you go to ask Xiaolei

603
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
in the afternoon?

604
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
What did she say?

605
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
She asked me to find

606
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
a leader to help her.

607
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Leader?

608
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Who?

609
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
Liu Fei.

610
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Uncle,

611
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
do you know her?

612
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Why don't you tell her?

613
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
I don't want to.

614
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
She has to be sincere

615
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
in everything she does.

616
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
She spent time on the medical exam.

617
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
What else can she do?

618
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
So,

619
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
don't think

620
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
about finding her help in private.

621
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
I'll go alone.

622
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Oh, don't be silly.

623
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
I'll pass you a message.

624
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
The test of the car is final.

625
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Let's go.

626
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
I was telling you

627
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,440
that the agency

628
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,440
had explained

629
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,460
Thanks.

630
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,460
What's so good about it?

631
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,160
If I try to help you,

632
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,720
a person due toской

633
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,440
will notice when he makes mistakes.

634
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Congratulations.

635
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,960
I want you too.

636
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,840
It's so good.

637
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,120
She called Liu Meng to come!

638
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,920
I'm warning you.

639
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,640
Okay.

640
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Hello, Director.

641
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,840
Mr. Zhou.

642
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,920
The person who sent the investigation team told me

643
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,720
that the final result will be announced next week.

644
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,720
You must give me a detailed report these days.

645
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,600
Don't be reckless.

646
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,520
Okay, Director.

647
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,400
I heard that

648
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,920
the current evidence is very bad to you.

649
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,800
Anyway,

650
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,520
prepare a psychological report first.

651
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,480
Okay.

652
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,320
Okay.

653
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,640
Okay.

654
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,920
Hello.

655
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,720
Or you are just mad.

656
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,320
I need to see the principal now.

657
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:27,720
I'm sorry.

658
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Ai Xin.

659
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,120
The principal is with me and vegetables and research.

660
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,320
Why can't 조심 meses be my Herausforder?

661
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,420
The teacher

662
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,580
I'm sorry.

663
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,420
It's so late.

664
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,380
I'm afraid you'll call me.

665
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,580
It's okay.

666
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
When you called me,

667
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,580
I was already here.

668
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,580
Sit down.

669
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
One more cup of coke.

670
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
Thank you.

671
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,580
What's the matter?

672
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,580
I lost my voice

673
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,580
and was called by the leader this afternoon.

674
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,580
I heard it from the back door.

675
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,580
He was really framed by that person.

676
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,580
What do you think of this?

677
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,580
I think it's a good idea.

678
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,740
What do you think of this?

679
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
Actually, it's really hard for our women

680
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,740
to fight in society.

681
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
They always encounter

682
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
many unfair treatment.

683
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,740
I have a friend.

684
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,740
He's on a company's front desk.

685
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
As long as they have a problem,

686
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
they'll call him to drink with him.

687
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,740
It's like they're doing something wrong.

688
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
I can understand that.

689
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,740
Now women are getting higher and higher

690
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
in society.

691
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,540
It's not because they've got

692
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,540
a person's support,

693
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,540
but because women

694
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,540
keep trying to get it.

695
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,540
Just like the news we saw before.

696
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
We've done so much.

697
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
We've done so much.

698
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,700
We've done so much.

699
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
We're doing this to make women

700
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,700
stop being oppressed in the market.

701
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
But if someone uses this,

702
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,700
then everything we've done

703
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,700
will be wasted.

704
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,700
You're exactly the same as everyone else.

705
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
You're like a college student.

706
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Do you know

707
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
I'm like your master's nephew

708
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
because of this?

709
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Why?

710
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Because I've reminded him before.

711
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,700
I told him that

712
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
he's not just a lawyer,

713
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,700
but also a former wife.

714
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
This relationship is very complicated.

715
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,860
Don't say it's a meeting.

716
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
You shouldn't say anything else.

717
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
You'd better not learn from him.

718
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
I didn't learn from him.

719
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,860
You came to see me today

720
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,860
because you didn't want

721
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,860
to leave the city without a hitch?

722
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,860
I just

723
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
I hope you don't

724
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
let me take care of you

725
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,860
when you're in the評.

726
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,860
Don't worry about that.

727
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,860
I won't take my personal feelings

728
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,860
to work.

729
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,860
And someone told me

730
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,860
about this.

731
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,860
I'll answer it

732
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,860
tomorrow.

733
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,860
Really?

734
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,860
Thank you.

735
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,860
It's okay.

736
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,860
Who told you that?

737
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,860
Let me ask you.

738
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,860
What do you think

739
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
your master is like?

740
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
A good person.

741
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,860
Didn't I tell you

742
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,860
I wanted to help him?

743
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,020
I'll handle it.

744
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,020
I just told you

745
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,020
he told me to come here.

746
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,020
Sorry,

747
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,020
I was too busy with the shooting.

748
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,020
How is it?

749
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,020
My apprentice is very strict.

750
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,020
Sit down.

751
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,020
Enough.

752
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,020
You two talk.

753
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,020
I have to go.

754
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,020
You're so pitiful.

755
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,020
I'm just afraid of you.

756
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
Why did Liu Fei

757
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
steal so long?

758
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Don't be so quiet.

759
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,660
He's all alone.

760
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,660
He'll be tied up.

761
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,860
Where's办 Guan Yue?

762
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
Feel like he's pretty.

763
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,860
How is he?

764
