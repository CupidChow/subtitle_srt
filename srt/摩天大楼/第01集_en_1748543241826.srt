1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
Subbers survived the experienced victims

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,700
seas, ice, fire.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,360
uyin Fancy

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,540
centimeters

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,060
exceptions

6
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,980
The First Love

7
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,440
B sooner than later

8
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,860
it will help our people move into this country and fix the problems

9
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,700
We are doing our best to improve and our people will live on

10
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,900
This is what our people look like

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,500
It's acceptable

12
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,020
People have very bad experiences

13
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,340
I'll go find my boss.

14
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,180
Go, go, go.

15
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,980
Why are you still like this? Help me.

16
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,340
Mei Bao, the coffee shop is closed.

17
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,180
The phone is not on. I'll go check it out.

18
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,860
No, no.

19
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,260
You said there are so many floors.

20
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,740
What should we do?

21
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,060
To be honest, I've lived in this big building for so many years.

22
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,060
It's still the first floor in my mind.

23
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,420
I think there's another floor.

24
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,020
Boss, I'm here.

25
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,020
Mei Bao.

26
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,020
Mei Bao!

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,020
Mei Bao.

28
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,020
Mei Bao.

29
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,020
Mei Bao.

30
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,020
Sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,020
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,020
I'm sorry, Mei Bao.

33
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,020
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,020
Mei Bao.

35
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,020
Mei Bao, you're so annoying.

36
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,020
The Great Hall of the Demon Heaven

37
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,020
Episode 07

38
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
Master.

39
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,020
The dead man is Zhong Mei Bao.

40
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
He's 29 years old.

41
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,020
He's the boss of the coffee shop at the bottom of the building.

42
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,020
He's been living in the Demon Heaven for two years.

43
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,020
He said he's very busy with work.

44
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,020
He doesn't usually rest at home.

45
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,020
He doesn't usually leave this building.

46
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
You remember a lot.

47
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,020
Come, come.

48
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,020
Tell me what you think of the scene.

49
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,020
The dead man has no injuries other than his head injury.

50
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,020
He has no injuries.

51
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,020
He has no scars.

52
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,020
The whole environment in this room

53
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
is not damaged.

54
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,020
The murderer must be familiar with the layout of this room.

55
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,020
As for how the head injury was caused,

56
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,020
I'm not sure.

57
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,020
If it was done by someone else,

58
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
it could be a murder case.

59
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,020
But we need to wait for further investigation.

60
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,020
What do you think?

61
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,020
I think...

62
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
I think it's a murder.

63
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
Why?

64
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,020
Didn't you see how the dead man looks like?

65
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
Is he beautiful?

66
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Beautiful?

67
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,020
Beautiful girls usually have emotional problems.

68
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,020
Master, you're a bit suspicious.

69
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
Did you find the dead man's phone?

70
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,020
No.

71
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,020
He must have been taken away by the murderer.

72
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,020
Did he see the camera?

73
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,020
Yes, the technical department is organizing it.

74
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,020
But they told us not to give too much hope.

75
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
What do you mean?

76
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,020
The area of the camera is very limited.

77
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,020
It's said that a few years ago,

78
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,020
there was a resistance to protect the privacy.

79
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,020
So the housekeeper took all the cameras in the corridor.

80
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,020
Now there are only the elevator and the hall.

81
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
These public areas.

82
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
These rich people are just too many.

83
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,020
How is the relationship between the dead man and the person?

84
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,020
At present, I only know that

85
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,020
he has a good relationship with the neighbor.

86
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Other people didn't hear that he has any friends.

87
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,020
And his family is not in the office.

88
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,020
I haven't contacted him yet.

89
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,020
Check it out.

90
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
As long as you know him,

91
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,020
who is the first one to find the person?

92
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,020
It's a security guard from the housekeeper.

93
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,020
The police said that he was a big tiger.

94
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,020
They said that he was the one who killed him.

95
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Let's start with him.

96
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
Captain Zhong.

97
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,020
Captain Zhong.

98
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020
Yes?

99
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,020
Your daughter told me to tell you that

100
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,020
she finished writing her work.

101
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,020
When will you go home?

102
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,020
Right away.

103
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
My daughter?

104
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
Where are you?

105
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,020
Where did you go?

106
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,020
I went to the kitchen to make some food.

107
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
Is there anything that you want to tell me?

108
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
No.

109
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
I'm just going to tell you.

110
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
Director Zhao.

111
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
Just let me know.

112
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
I'll go to the kitchen.

113
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
I can't leave without telling you.

114
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Okay.

115
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,020
There is only one person in the room.

116
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,020
Do you know who the person is?

117
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
I know you.

118
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
I know you.

119
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
I know you.

120
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
I know you.

121
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
I know you.

122
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
I know you.

123
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,020
I know you.

124
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,020
I know you.

125
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
I know you.

126
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,020
I know you.

127
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,020
I know you.

128
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,020
I know you.

129
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,020
I know you.

130
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,020
In my home, people are killed.

131
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,020
It's so dangerous outside.

132
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,020
Zhong Jingguo,

133
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,020
why do you scare me every day?

134
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,020
You're a police officer.

135
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,020
You'll have a lot of dangerous things.

136
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,020
It doesn't mean

137
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,020
the world is dangerous.

138
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,020
What's your attitude?

139
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,020
I'm worried about you.

140
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,020
Listen,

141
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,020
don't tell me that

142
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,020
you'll stay in the dorm

143
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,020
after you get into college.

144
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,020
Just stay in the dorm

145
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,020
and live in the dorm.

146
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,020
It's annoying.

147
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,020
Go away.

148
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,020
Wait a minute. I'll send you off.

149
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
Xiao Yang, I'll leave the line to you.

150
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
I'll send you off.

151
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
Don't you eat?

152
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
No, I'm on a diet.

153
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,020
I'll order it myself.

154
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,020
Buddy,

155
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,020
it's time for dinner.

156
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,020
I'll order it for you.

157
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
What's his name?

158
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,020
Xie Baoluo.

159
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
Xie Baoluo?

160
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,020
It's time for dinner.

161
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
I'll order it for you.

162
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,020
I'll stay here for a long time.

163
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,020
It won't be too fast anyway.

164
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
Thank you.

165
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,020
You're welcome.

166
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
You can start.

167
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Okay.

168
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,020
May I ask

169
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,020
what duty you're in the company?

170
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,020
Security.

171
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,020
But our security

172
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,020
is different from other companies.

173
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
We can't do anything.

174
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,020
Do you want to cook or noodles?

175
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,020
I can do anything.

176
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
For example?

177
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,020
For example,

178
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,020
the previous loan,

179
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
the time-lapse,

180
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
the daily patrol,

181
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
and so on.

182
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Anyway, for the client,

183
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,020
no matter what they encounter,

184
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,020
as long as we find the security,

185
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,020
we'll be fine.

186
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,020
Do you want to add more?

187
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,020
Is your building

188
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
required for all visitors

189
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
to go to the front desk to register for the check?

190
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,020
If the client brings it in,

191
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,020
you don't need to register.

192
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,020
The night of the case?

193
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
Is there a visitor

194
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
who brings it in?

195
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,020
There are three people in the picture.

196
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,020
At 6 o'clock,

197
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,020
Mr. Ma from A802

198
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
and a girl

199
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020
from a white circle

200
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,020
came in together.

201
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
At 7 o'clock,

202
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
Miss Shen from B3105

203
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
came down

204
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,020
and met a middle-aged man.

205
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,020
At 8 o'clock,

206
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
Mr. Chen from D1103

207
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
and a man

208
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,020
with a hat came in.

209
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
Is it gone?

210
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,020
It's gone.

211
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,020
Why are you so clear?

212
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
This is our job.

213
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
We're standing on the front desk.

214
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,020
It looks like a white shirt,

215
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
but actually,

216
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,020
we have to look at

217
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,020
all the people who have been here for years.

218
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,020
I heard that you were the one

219
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
who killed

220
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,020
the person

221
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
in front of the police that night.

222
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,020
Yes.

223
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,020
But I mean,

224
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,020
I didn't really kill him.

225
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,020
I was

226
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,020
too excited at that time.

227
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,020
I felt sorry for Maibao.

228
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,020
Why?

229
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,020
Because I was responsible for the patrol that day.

230
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,020
But I didn't find any suspiciousness.

231
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,020
If it wasn't for my work,

232
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,020
Maibao wouldn't have left.

233
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
So,

234
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
you said that

235
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,020
because of your responsibility?

236
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
If our little district security

237
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
was so responsible

238
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,020
like you,

239
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,020
are you close to the victim?

240
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,020
He's just a friend.

241
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,020
How did you become friends?

242
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,020
That day,

243
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,020
Xiao Xue was also a shopkeeper.

244
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
Do you go to the shop often?

245
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,020
No.

246
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
In the impression,

247
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,020
there are only these two.

248
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
Hello.

249
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,020
I just moved in.

250
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,020
The agent said that

251
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
he put my keys and the door card

252
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
on the front desk.

253
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,020
Please take a look for me.

254
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,020
Come on.

255
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
Please take a look at the evidence.

256
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
Okay.

257
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,020
Your room number is...

258
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,020
C-Dome 2003.

259
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,020
Miss Zhong, right?

260
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,020
Yes.

261
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
Please wait a moment.

262
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,020
This is your key and the door card.

263
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
Please sign here.

264
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,020
Have the staff of the moving company arrived?

265
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
They also need to register the evidence.

266
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,020
I didn't invite the moving company.

267
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
I just want one box.

268
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,020
I can take it myself.

269
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,020
No moving company.

270
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
But the elevator is on the floor today.

271
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,020
The elevator can't be used.

272
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
You have to go to the 20th floor.

273
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,020
It's okay.

274
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
I can take it myself.

275
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
Here.

276
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,020
Okay.

277
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
Thank you.

278
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,020
How about I help you?

279
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,020
It's okay. I can take it myself.

280
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,020
It's okay.

281
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,020
You're welcome.

282
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,020
Here.

283
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,020
Thank you.

284
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,020
I'll help you.

285
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,020
You're kindhearted.

286
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,020
Because I often move.

287
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,020
I have to move once or twice a month

288
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,020
in the morning.

289
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,020
Sometimes I have to close the city.

290
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,020
So I don't buy much.

291
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,020
I only have a few clothes inside.

292
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,020
I can wear it.

293
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
I can wear it.

294
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,020
What about this time?

295
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
I have to see the situation.

296
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,020
I'll see if I can work well.

297
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
The company is nearby.

298
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
I want to open a coffee shop

299
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,020
downstairs with my friends.

300
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,020
Is it the Abo Coffee Shop?

301
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,020
You know it.

302
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,020
We haven't opened yet.

303
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,020
You've been pretending to be shy

304
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,020
during the previous time.

305
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,020
You often have customers

306
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
to come to our place to complain.

307
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,020
Sorry.

308
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,020
Excuse me.

309
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,020
How long have you been here?

310
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
About three months.

311
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
What about you?

312
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
I've been here for more than ten years.

313
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,020
I started when I was in college.

314
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,020
Which college are you from?

315
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,020
Mancheng University.

316
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
Such a good school.

317
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
I can't tell.

318
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
I'm a famous college graduate.

319
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
I'm from the bank manager

320
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
and I'm from the small district security.

321
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
There must be something wrong.

322
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
Yes, there is.

323
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,020
It's not related to this case.

324
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,020
I feel like you're a story-teller.

325
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,020
Do you want to hear my story?

326
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
Do you want to say it?

327
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
As a security guard,

328
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,020
I care about this business.

329
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,020
I'm a good person.

330
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,020
As a security guard,

331
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,020
I care about every resident in this big city.

332
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
But on the contrary,

333
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,020
Han Shao has a resident

334
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
who cares about our life.

335
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
Many people don't even know

336
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,020
my name.

337
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,020
But people now seem to be like this.

338
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,020
They watch the show every day.

339
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,020
They talk about other things

340
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,020
besides the building.

341
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
But they don't know

342
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,020
who the next door is.

343
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,020
But Mei Bao is different from them.

344
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,020
She cares more about the people around her.

345
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
Then what did you talk to Mei Bao about?

346
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
About what happened five years ago.

347
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,020
I was still young.

348
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
I was crazy.

349
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
I decided that everything

350
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,020
would only get better.

351
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,020
You're back.

352
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,020
You're back.

353
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,020
Hello,

354
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,020
what are you doing for me?

355
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
The wedding company

356
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
has two plans for today.

357
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,020
Which one do you think we should choose?

358
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
The one with the sweetest one.

359
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Can you not be so stingy?

360
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,020
We still need to buy a house.

361
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,020
The money for the house is enough.

362
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,020
The previous one was enough.

363
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,020
But today,

364
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
I found this.

365
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,020
The big building.

366
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,020
The price of this house is good.

367
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
Although the area is a little far away,

368
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,020
it is said that the next time we will pass the subway,

369
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,020
there will be a lot of potential.

370
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,020
Wow.

371
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,020
The building is so high.

372
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,020
I thought you only like cheap goods.

373
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Look at the fire in the 4G.

374
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,020
This 4G is much better than the 3G we saw today.

375
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
Is it enough for us?

376
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,020
It's almost there.

377
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,020
But

378
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,020
our bank recently launched a consumer loan.

379
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,020
I plan to bring it out.

380
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
That's enough to pay the money.

381
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,020
But I heard that the consumer loan

382
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
is not allowed to buy a house.

383
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,020
It's okay.

384
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,020
No one is checking.

385
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,020
And now,

386
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,020
many people are using this method to make a profit.

387
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
Really?

388
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,020
Anyway,

389
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,020
if I can really listen to this little thing,

390
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,020
I will be happy.

391
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
Are you happy?

392
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,020
Yes.

393
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,020
Second, please.

394
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,020
Now, let me tell you about the design of the forest.

395
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
And the shape of the lake.

396
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
Our design room in the forest

397
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,020
is the design room of the famous Hong Kong design room.

398
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,020
It's surrounded by the design of the whole Mo Tian Da.

399
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
The shape of the lake is A-shaped, B-shaped,

400
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
C-shaped and D-shaped.

401
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
The shape of the A-shaped and B-shaped are big shapes.

402
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
What about the two of them?

403
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,020
The other two are small shapes of A-shaped and B-shaped.

404
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
You still have small shapes?

405
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
I didn't say that earlier.

406
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
Is it not good to have small shapes?

407
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
Actually, Mr. is thinking that

408
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
the small shapes of the south-south-western part

409
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
will be very messy.

410
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
Yes.

411
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,020
Actually, you don't need to worry about it at all.

412
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,020
C-shaped and B-shaped

413
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,020
and A-shaped B-shaped

414
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,020
are completely separated.

415
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
You have to draw cards when you enter and exit.

416
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,020
So you can completely understand

417
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,020
the two independent small areas.

418
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Five years ago,

419
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,020
we thought that the future would only be better and better.

420
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,020
Wait a minute.

421
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,020
Five years ago,

422
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020
how many houses did you earn in the middle of the year?

423
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,020
I thought that

424
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,020
if I buy a house,

425
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,020
marry it,

426
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
and have a child,

427
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,020
my life will be like this.

428
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
Please sign it.

429
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,020
Thank you.

430
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,020
You are welcome.

431
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
I'm sorry.

432
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
I'm sorry.

433
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
I'm sorry.

434
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
I'm sorry.

435
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,020
I'm sorry.

436
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,020
I'm sorry.

437
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,020
I'm sorry.

438
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
I'm sorry.

439
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,020
I'm sorry.

440
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,020
I'm sorry.

441
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,020
I'm sorry.

442
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,020
I'm sorry.

443
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,020
I'm sorry.

444
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,020
I'm sorry.

445
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
I'm sorry.

446
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,020
I'm sorry.

447
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,020
I'm sorry.

448
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,020
I'm sorry.

449
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
I'm sorry.

450
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,020
I'm sorry.

451
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,020
I'm sorry.

452
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,020
I'm sorry.

453
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,020
I'm sorry.

454
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,020
I'm sorry.

455
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,020
I'm sorry.

456
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,020
I'm sorry.

457
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
I'm sorry.

458
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:23,020
Xia Zhai,

459
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
back in the past,

460
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,020
her husband

461
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
LongУ

462
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,020
Wang Li Juan.

463
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,020
Erĸ

464
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,180
How about we pay the money first?

465
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,260
How much?

466
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,220
10,000 yuan a day.

467
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,220
10,000 yuan?

468
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,260
Why is it so expensive?

469
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,940
Why don't you guys talk first?

470
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,620
Thank you.

471
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,860
How about buying an electric-powered taxi?

472
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,880
My mother isn't asking so many questions.

473
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,280
She doesn't know about getting aó

474
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,060
My mom doesn't know.

475
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,480
You may think they're knowing what they're doing.

476
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,180
I don't know what else to do.

477
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,340
You can't take my mom to the bright spot, Dearest.

478
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,860
But let me tell you,

479
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,020
I've done the surgery.

480
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,020
At the time, she left a lot of blood on the scene.

481
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,020
If they were ordinary people, I wouldn't have charged them.

482
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,020
But their family looks like a real poor man.

483
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,020
It's okay.

484
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,020
We have insurance.

485
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,020
Hello.

486
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
Hello.

487
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,020
Thank you.

488
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,020
The hospital is taking our money again.

489
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,020
Can you help us with the money?

490
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,020
I've paid 20,000 yuan a few days ago.

491
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
Yes.

492
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,020
That's the fee for the ICU.

493
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,020
The hospital needs the payment.

494
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
I don't have any cash right now.

495
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,020
You can contact my insurance company.

496
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
They'll pay for you.

497
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,020
I've contacted the insurance company.

498
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,020
The operation is very troublesome.

499
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
How about you come in?

500
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,020
I don't have that much money right now.

501
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
I'll help you with the payment.

502
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
I'm a little busy. I'll hang up.

503
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,020
Okay.

504
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,020
It's okay.

505
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,020
What's wrong?

506
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Didn't I already help you with the insurance company?

507
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,020
I'm fine.

508
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,020
He didn't pay for the treatment.

509
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,020
Why are you only here for a moment?

510
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,020
Why don't you eat first?

511
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,020
You eat first.

512
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,020
I'm not very hungry.

513
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,020
Okay. I'll eat first.

514
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,020
Just continue.

515
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
You said you didn't hit a person.

516
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
Then?

517
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,020
You can't tell by the road.

518
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,020
When the victim found out the car was coming to him,

519
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,020
he didn't stop.

520
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,020
Instead, he was at home.

521
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
It's a bit unusual.

522
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,020
I heard that the family condition of the victim is very difficult.

523
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,020
This also led to the victim's condition of life.

524
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,020
It's not good.

525
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Maybe...

526
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
Maybe he wanted to commit suicide.

527
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,020
Or he said he was a fool.

528
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,020
A fool?

529
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,020
The compensation of the car will only show you wrong places.

530
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
Mr. Xie,

531
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,020
I'll tell you later.

532
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,020
You have to report their fraud first.

533
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,020
And then you'll be punished.

534
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,520
no

535
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
thanks

536
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
Hello, I'm the official,

537
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,020
Mr. Xie comes.

538
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
Get out.

539
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,020
Be calm.

540
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,020
I willless to pay you.

541
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Don't spare me.

542
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
Get out.

543
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,020
Don't beà

544
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Remember to rest.

545
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
Get out.

546
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,140
I'm sorry.

547
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,140
She's not very stable.

548
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Hello.

549
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
We'd like to talk to you.

550
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Mr. Han.

551
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
My parents died when I was very young.

552
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,100
So...

553
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
I can understand your feelings.

554
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
I've never had a husband since I was a kid.

555
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
If there were no those two kids,

556
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,180
I might not believe them.

557
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,180
Three hundred thousand?

558
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,180
Is that good for them?

559
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Let me ask you.

560
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
As long as we make a deal with them,

561
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
they won't go to the court to sue us.

562
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
Yes.

563
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
But think about it.

564
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
Three hundred thousand.

565
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,180
Even if we deduct the insurance,

566
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,180
we can't get so much now.

567
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,180
We just bought a house.

568
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,180
Didn't we...

569
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
haven't paid the teacher yet?

570
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
No.

571
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,180
We can't pay the teacher yet.

572
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,180
We can't pay the teacher yet.

573
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,260
Haven't paid the teacher yet?

574
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
What do you want?

575
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,260
Don't tell me you won't buy it.

576
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,260
No.

577
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
I still want to buy the house.

578
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
I just want to...

579
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,260
I want to change the A-4G to B-3G.

580
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,260
I'll change it to bigger one when I have money.

581
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
Actually, I don't think you two

582
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,260
are unhappy about this.

583
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
I personally think that

584
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,340
the B-3G that we need

585
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,340
is more suitable for your marriage.

586
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,340
Although the area is a little smaller,

587
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,340
but you think that

588
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,340
it's better for you to rent and sell.

589
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,340
Right?

590
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,340
You can go.

591
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,340
Hello.

592
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,340
Mr. Wenqi, something happened?

593
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,340
My brother-in-law suddenly left home this morning.

594
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
I just sent him to the hospital.

595
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,340
But he may be in a coma

596
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,340
after work.

597
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,340
So I thought of you at the first time.

598
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,420
I want to ask you

599
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,420
if you can help us again.

600
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,420
How much do you need?

601
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,420
I think it's about 15,000 yuan.

602
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
Hello.

603
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,420
Mr. Wenqi.

604
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
Hello.

605
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,420
Hello.

606
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,420
Xiaoqiu, it's me, Bao Lu.

607
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I sold out my last two B-3G.

608
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Please take a look at my record.

609
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Why is it not here today?

610
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
There's something wrong with Xiaoqiu.

611
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
It seems to be your fault.

612
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Don't do that.

613
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
I want to see Mr. Wenqi.

614
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Don't do that.

615
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
I want to see Mr. Wenqi.

616
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Mr. Wenqi.

617
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
What are you doing?

618
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Mr. Wenqi.

619
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
You need to help us.

620
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Thank you.

621
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Mr. Wenqi.

622
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Please don't talk.

623
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Mr. Wenqi.

624
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
What happened?

625
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Mr. Wenqi.

626
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Mr. Wenqi.

627
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Mr. Wenqi.

628
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
You said that

629
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,580
it's just too much pressure in my heart.

630
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,580
It must be because of my sister's death.

631
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,580
The hospital has made us

632
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,580
a long-term treatment.

633
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,580
Thank you.

634
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,580
Please help us.

635
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
I have 200,000 yuan.

636
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,580
I just...

637
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,580
I just gave you 12,000 yuan.

638
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
12,000 yuan?

639
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,580
I don't have enough.

640
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
I only have 200,000 yuan.

641
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,580
I beg you.

642
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,580
I beg you.

643
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,580
1.9 million.

644
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,580
Where do we go to spend so much money?

645
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
I told you that

646
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,660
I don't have a good family anymore.

647
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
I'm so sure that you don't know

648
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,660
what I'm saying.

649
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
Now, we're doomed.

650
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
1.9 million.

651
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,660
The deducted pay is strong.

652
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,660
12,000.

653
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,660
The deducted pay is the most.

654
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,660
Even if you have 1 million,

655
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,740
you'll have a lot of money.

656
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,740
Fortunately, the job you were in

657
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,740
was good.

658
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,740
The income of the bank is not low.

659
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
Mr. Hu,

660
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
Mr. Hu, please come over.

661
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
Because of your government,

662
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,740
the procuratorate

663
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,820
came here to check your financial flow.

664
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
As a result,

665
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,820
they found a loan from a consumer.

666
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
You bought the house.

667
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
You even sent the Bureau of the General Investigation

668
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
to take action.

669
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,820
You're using your power to attack the employees

670
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,820
and break the rules.

671
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,820
Bao Luo,

672
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,820
I've already

673
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,820
taken up the share for you.

674
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820
But I hope you can

675
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,820
take the initiative to resign.

676
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,820
Mr. Hu,

677
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
I'm sorry.

678
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
I'm sorry.

679
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
I'm sorry.

680
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,820
I'm sorry.

681
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,820
I'm sorry.

682
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
I'm sorry.

683
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,820
I'm sorry.

684
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
I'm sorry.

685
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,820
I'm sorry.

686
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
I'm sorry.

687
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
I'm sorry.

688
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,820
I'm sorry.

689
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
I'm sorry.

690
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
I'm sorry.

691
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,820
I'm sorry.

692
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
I'm sorry.

693
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
I'm sorry.

694
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,820
I'm sorry.

695
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,820
I'm sorry.

696
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
I'm sorry.

697
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
I'm sorry.

698
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,820
I'm sorry.

699
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
I'm sorry.

700
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
I'm sorry.

701
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,820
I'm sorry.

702
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,820
I'm sorry.

703
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,820
I'm sorry.

704
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
I'm sorry.

705
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,820
What?

706
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,820
It's Mr. Lin.

707
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,820
I used to buy a house here.

708
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,020
My name is Xie Bao Luo.

709
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,820
I remember.

710
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,820
You bought a set of closed-door houses.

711
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
Yes.

712
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,860
I have something to problem you.

713
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,860
I've been in a hurry to take the money

714
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,820
and want to return the house.

715
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,820
I wonder if I can work.

716
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
Sure.

717
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,300
But you have to pay the rent according to the contract.

718
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,500
It's not a big deal.

719
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
It's okay.

720
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,660
I really need money.

721
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,660
Just do it.

722
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,100
Okay.

723
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,740
I'll do my best, Mr. Xie.

724
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Okay.

725
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,660
If you really sell this house,

726
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,540
our household will be in trouble.

727
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,700
What should we do in the future?

728
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
What about the kids?

729
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,940
Can we not solve this problem?

730
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,940
Xie Baoruo.

731
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,820
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

732
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,140
You should be very clean when you give the money to that person.

733
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,700
You don't know how many days you've been in this.

734
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,260
I've killed two children's mother.

735
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,780
It's all right to pay as much as you can.

736
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,900
Are you crazy? Are you blind?

737
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,580
Do you know what it feels like to have a mother?

738
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,100
Baoruo, don't be angry, okay?

739
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,060
I mean, if you think you don't have enough money,

740
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,740
I'll give you money.

741
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,620
I'll give you money.

742
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,740
We can still buy more.

743
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,660
Let's do this.

744
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,420
We won't

745
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
get married.

746
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,920
Zeng Living andconomy

747
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,500
innik-velopes

748
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,860
she already chose to face all

749
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,980
my life together with you.

750
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,180
I think she loves you.

751
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,980
Well…

752
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,580
You don't want her to take

753
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,900
this mistake with me.

754
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,580
What you higher-media towards her

755
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,140
is definitely better than mine.

756
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,120
And then you had a relationship with her.

757
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,300
I posted a WeChat on her WeChat and

758
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,860
in turn she was blacked out.

759
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:51,860
I think as long as he remembers me, I will be disturbing him.

760
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,860
In his world, I don't need him anymore.

761
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,860
Just leave him.

762
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,860
What a pity.

763
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,860
Such a good person.

764
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
There are so many houses.

765
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
If you keep doing this for two more years,

766
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,860
you can still be a little bit more lively after the compensation.

767
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,860
So Zhong Mei Bao,

768
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:24,860
you must have been touched by the story of the seventh ghost god.

769
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,860
He didn't say anything.

770
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,860
He came to hug me.

771
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,860
I suddenly felt relieved.

772
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
Hugged you?

773
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
Then?

774
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
Yes.

775
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,860
What then?

776
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
Look.

777
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,860
Second Master.

778
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,860
You helped him to organize the luggage.

779
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,860
Then, he entered his room in a good way.

780
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,860
Thank you.

781
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,860
Then...

782
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,860
What nonsense are you talking about?

783
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,860
I'm not the same person as Mei Bao.

784
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,860
We are close.

785
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,860
I sent him to the door and he left.

786
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,860
Really?

787
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
Excuse me.

788
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,860
This is your second police officer.

789
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,860
Thank you.

790
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
Captain Zhong, this is the food.

791
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,860
Here you are.

792
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,860
Okay.

793
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,860
Master, it's all right.

794
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,860
Eat.

795
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
Let's take a break.

796
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,860
Xiao Yang, don't you drink water?

797
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,860
He seems to have something to say to you.

798
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Master.

799
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
What? Are you tired?

800
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
No.

801
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,860
Did you call me out?

802
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
Did I?

803
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,860
No.

804
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,860
What do you think of Xie Bao Luo?

805
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,860
I think he is quite pitiful.

806
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,860
He ruined his life.

807
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,860
Poor people are not filial.

808
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,860
No way.

809
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,860
He looks like a man.

810
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,860
He is a man of the past.

811
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,860
No way.

812
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,860
He looks very honest.

813
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,860
He told the story.

814
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,860
Among the stories he told,

815
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,860
I'm touched by some of them.

816
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Which ones?

817
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
For example,

818
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,860
he took the WeChat of his ex-girlfriend

819
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,860
and made him do it to stop bothering him.

820
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,860
Look at this.

821
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,860
The ex-girlfriend of Xie Bao Luo, Sun Ting.

822
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,860
You can read this part.

823
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,860
The ex-boyfriend of Sun Ting

824
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,860
called on the 10th of October,

825
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,860
and said he had been with Xie Bao Luo for over three days.

826
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,860
He sent a police officer to the office on the way to the mountain.

827
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,860
He was in a hurry to meet the two of them.

828
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
Thanks for your cooperation.

829
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,860
How long do we have to talk?

830
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,860
Not long.

831
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,860
You said you told your story to Zhong Mei Bao.

832
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,860
He gave you a hug.

833
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,860
Yes.

834
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,860
What kind of hug?

835
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,860
What do you mean?

836
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,860
Is it a love hug or a hug of a polite man?

837
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,860
Is it a tight hug or a light hug?

838
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,860
Is it important?

839
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
It's important.

840
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,860
I need to know the relationship between you and the victim.

841
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,860
Didn't I just say that we are friends?

842
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
Come, stand up.

843
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,860
I'll change the way.

844
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,860
A stranger hugged you for the first time.

845
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
I'm not normal.

846
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,860
Don't talk nonsense.

847
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Xiao Yang, take off your glasses.

848
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,860
Now you are Zhong Mei Bao.

849
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,860
I want to know if Zhong Mei Bao is trying to seduce you.

850
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,860
No.

851
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,860
No.

852
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,860
What did you think of the eyebrows?

853
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,860
He is not that kind of person.

854
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
You are quite temperamental.

855
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
Now you know the distance is so late.

856
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,860
When you were with 1.9 million,

857
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,860
why didn't you even dare to let go?

858
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
Let me ask you one more time.

859
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,860
You and Zhong Mei Bao are friends.

860
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,860
I said we are friends.

861
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,860
We are friends.

862
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,860
Have you finished?

863
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,860
Can I leave?

864
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
Yes.

865
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,860
I'll sign for you.

866
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,860
No.

867
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,860
Do you still miss him?

868
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,080
It's 3 o'clock.

869
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,320
Okay.

870
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,260
Okay.

871
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,580
I trust you

872
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,920
Got it.

873
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,260
Thank you.

874
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,760
This is okay.

875
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,080
Put it here.

876
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,680
Okay.

877
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,500
Look, I forgot to bring the light when her eyes closed.

878
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,900
It's actually

879
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,940
more

880
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,300
long andweek.

881
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,820
Do you feel like defended?

882
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,820
Now that you can find trap,

883
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,940
whenм Should Yuzheng go outside?

884
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,940
I don't know what I want to tell you.

885
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,940
Master, I found out one thing.

886
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,940
The last time the big-time model shop in the small area of the building in the day was a year ago.

887
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,940
But Zhou Meibao moved here two years ago.

888
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,940
He's not well. Maybe he's mistaken.

889
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
Then he's lying.
