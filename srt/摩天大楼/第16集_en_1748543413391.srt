1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,820
Love cannot be president, time cannot be

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:45,760
Although it is a trick for us to have so-keeping

3
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,120
Set Fire

4
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Everything you and Mei fired

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,640
finally half of them

6
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,120
are gone

7
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,680
Therefore

8
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,160
I suggest

9
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,220
I suggest that you情 Are all your life

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:13,980
Are all your life

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,620
lost

12
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,420
My lord, you will be the one who will die.

13
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,820
You will be the one who will die.

14
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,980
You will be the one who will die!

15
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,780
The End

16
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,260
I can't tell the truth.

17
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,500
If I tell the truth,

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,860
I will be the one who will die.

19
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,700
You didn't take the picture of the past, did you?

20
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,540
Take a selfie in your room.

21
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,260
Give me a three-point pen.

22
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,580
The End

23
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,540
Who took the picture of you?

24
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,900
Is there a man in the room?

25
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,940
Officer, can you help me out?

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,300
Okay, take a rest.

27
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,460
Have a meal.

28
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,460
Have a meal.

29
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,580
What?

30
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,580
You know,

31
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,060
as a police officer,

32
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,020
don't say that a good person is a bad person.

33
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,980
Do you think

34
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,380
you have a bad person?

35
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,140
He is a bad person

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,980
from an ordinary person's point of view.

37
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,660
Then what about from the police's point of view?

38
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,100
Police?

39
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,220
What do you mean by that?

40
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,420
From the beginning,

41
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,380
the police should not judge who is a good person.

42
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,260
Our job is to prove whether he has committed the crime

43
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,380
or not.

44
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,380
But I was the police officer at the time,

45
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,420
just to prove myself,

46
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,020
to report the safety of the police.

47
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,660
If we let the police officers continue to be the criminals,

48
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,500
we will be in danger.

49
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,460
Qiao Yan,

50
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,780
sometimes,

51
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,060
when you do the right thing,

52
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,620
the more important thing is to do the right thing.

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,020
Have you heard of it?

54
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,100
I used to

55
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,820
kill a partner of mine.

56
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,780
At that time,

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,740
I and my partner

58
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,580
were chasing a group of murderers.

59
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,380
We were both in the same group.

60
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,660
I chased that man.

61
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,380
My colleague was on the other side of the road.

62
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,980
That man

63
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,500
was on the other side of the road.

64
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,380
I wanted to help my colleague,

65
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,220
but he told me...

66
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,180
Don't care about me.

67
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,380
Save him.

68
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,580
He insisted on saving me.

69
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,220
Go.

70
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,780
The most vicious murder suspect

71
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,980
on the other side

72
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,980
is the good partner of the common company.

73
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,820
If it were you,

74
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,900
who would you choose?

75
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,380
If it were you,

76
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,180
I would choose to save you.

77
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,940
If it really was like that,

78
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,020
I hope you would be the suspect.

79
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,700
Because this is the case.

80
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,060
I don't want to be the suspect.

81
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,660
I don't want to be the suspect.

82
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,980
That's the right time.

83
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,220
The police always put the murderer

84
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,180
in the first place.

85
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,660
Whether he's a good or a bad person,

86
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,020
because in front of the law,

87
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,980
people are equal.

88
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,980
Before the court is announced,

89
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,340
even if he's a suspect,

90
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
he will have the same opinion as others.

91
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,260
If I give you another chance

92
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,780
to choose again,

93
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
will you still leave your partner?

94
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,680
O-Okay.

95
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,260
I would like to talk to you quickly.

96
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,340
Good.

97
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,860
He's my partner.

98
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,980
He's a girl.

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,040
His behavior

100
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
is mild and bawdy.

101
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
I think such a great partner

102
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,900
will benefit you.

103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,440
I admit that

104
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,880
I was esse tit Zwimosen's husband.

105
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,840
If it's true,

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,280
it's not worth it.

107
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,600
Unlike me,

108
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,320
I'm always in a daze.

109
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,120
Sometimes,

110
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,800
I feel that I can have her as a partner.

111
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,720
It's the biggest thing in my life.

112
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,400
You know what?

113
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,480
Sometimes, I keep thinking

114
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,000
that the person I saved

115
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,800
was me, Zhong Qiang.

116
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,560
How nice he is.

117
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,800
And

118
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
he has a daughter.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
Unlike me,

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,680
I'm a family member.

121
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,640
I don't have any worries

122
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,000
when I leave.

123
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,960
So, Xiaoxiao...

124
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,320
Her name is Zhou.

125
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,440
So,

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,960
we can only do what we should

127
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,640
when something happens.

128
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,040
Because you can't predict

129
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,280
the result.

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,200
I don't think

131
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,960
I had any other choice.

132
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,600
No.

133
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,280
Know you can't get it.

135
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,960
I'm letting you go.

136
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm going to your room.

137
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
I'll drive you there.

138
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
I'll be right back.

139
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,660
Go.

140
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,020
Allow me to ashes.

141
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,140
Xiaowen.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,860
Why do you run like this?

143
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Xiao Xiao's father won't leave.

144
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,880
You don't have to be like this now.

145
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,880
You can find so many reasons to be panic.

146
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
You can comfort yourself.

147
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Master,

148
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
I've been with you for so long.

149
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Every single case is like a mess.

150
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
I didn't understand at first.

151
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
Why?

152
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
I finally understood today.

153
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
You're afraid you'll be too confused.

154
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,880
You're afraid to face the choices again.

155
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
Because you've been with me for so many years,

156
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
you can't face yourself at all.

157
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
I'm different from you.

158
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
I should face myself.

159
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
I have another choice.

160
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
What do you want to do?

161
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
I want to be a justice.

162
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Xiao Yang,

163
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
I don't care what Li Mo Di said to you.

164
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,880
But we have to be honest.

165
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
You know what?

166
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
It's not about love.

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
You know, the people in the building

168
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,880
are all guilty because of love.

169
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Do you want to be their brother?

170
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
I'm not hungry.

171
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
I'm going to go.

172
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
Actually,

173
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
before Mei Bao was born,

174
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
her situation in love was not good.

175
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
So she committed suicide.

176
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
She wanted to take Yan Yong Yuan away.

177
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,880
We were really too much.

178
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,880
We just wanted to tell her

179
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,880
not to think so much.

180
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
But,

181
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
I don't know how she got through

182
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
the pain and pressure.

183
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Officer Yang,

184
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,880
if she decides to commit suicide on the day

185
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
she's killed,

186
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
there's still another possibility

187
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
in the world she's in.

188
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
How good would that be?

189
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
I don't know.

190
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
I don't know.

191
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
I don't know.

192
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
I don't know.

193
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
I don't know.

194
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
I don't know.

195
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
I don't know.

196
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
I don't know.

197
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
I don't know.

198
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
I don't know.

199
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
I don't know.

200
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
I don't know.

201
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
I don't know.

202
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
I don't know.

203
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
I don't know.

204
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
I don't know.

205
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
I don't know.

206
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Second,

207
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
what are you doing here?

208
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,720
But...

209
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,240
My father did us a good job

210
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:21,760
Let's emergency

211
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
I don't want to be a cop.

212
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
You don't have to.

213
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,760
I can't take care of you.

214
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
My family can take care of me.

215
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Actually, I don't like you being a cop.

216
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm busy all day.

217
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
I don't have time to take a break.

218
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Sometimes, I feel like

219
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
I have to do something bad

220
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
and catch you.

221
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Fortunately,

222
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I can have a chat in a room

223
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
for hours, not like now.

224
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
I can't talk for five minutes

225
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
even if I meet you every day.

226
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
But if you still want to continue,

227
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
I promise you that

228
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
from now on,

229
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
I won't be any burden to you.

230
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
I don't remember what you said.

231
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
I don't know how many times I heard you

232
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
dream of being a cop.

233
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
I can feel that

234
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
you really love this job.

235
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
I don't believe

236
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
you will give up easily

237
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
if you encounter some problems.

238
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
I won't give up.

239
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
This is not

240
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
the way I like Yang Rui-sen.

241
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
You are so selfish.

242
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
You are not selfish.

243
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
You are a great worker.

244
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
But I want to say sorry to you.

245
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
I always make trouble for you

246
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
when I cook.

247
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
What are you doing?

248
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
I am at the hotel.

249
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
Show me the photo.

250
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
A pen.

251
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Don't send me the address.

252
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
What are you doing?

253
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
I am at the hotel.

254
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Show me the photo.

255
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Use pen and paper.

256
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Don't send me the address.

257
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Alright.

258
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Let's do something early.

259
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
We can see the results.

260
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,620
It's caused by nature and sw creeping people.

261
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,120
Mr. Zhen lenset and real né.

262
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,920
It's like a realisesti swarina lenset.

263
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,240
Perfect.

264
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Should I do justice or rightful things?

265
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,940
Did you see Yang?

266
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,040
No, I didn't. I didn't answer his phone.

267
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,840
No need to call him anymore.

268
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,240
Captain Zhong, I have something to tell you.

269
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,440
There's good news that your sexual harassment is cancelled.

270
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Who cancelled it?

271
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,240
That lawyer.

272
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,440
I heard that he found out that his husband was not only harassing other people,

273
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,840
but also stealing.

274
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,040
He divorced his husband in the end.

275
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,440
Later, he wrote a letter to the bureau to frame him up.

276
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,240
He confessed his wrongdoings to the public.

277
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
He's so conscience.

278
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,240
But your case was taken as a warning.

279
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,840
They are going to report it to the bureau.

280
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,440
So let's not be too hasty.

281
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,440
Your life this year may be in a mess.

282
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,640
This is already the case. Don't think too much.

283
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,440
Okay, let's start.

284
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Let's start first.

285
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,040
How about we wait a little longer? We're still missing one person.

286
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,040
Sorry, Boss.

287
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,840
I've prepared the files in the file.

288
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,440
Xiao Li, let's start.

289
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,040
Okay.

290
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
The victim, Zhong Mei Bao, died in a case.

291
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,240
She was released on October 20, 2019,

292
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,040
and was suspended from the investigation and investigation of the suspect on July 7.

293
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,240
The result of the trial is reported as follows.

294
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,040
The victim, Zhong Mei Bao, died at 29 years old.

295
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,640
The suspect, Yun Nan Sheng, is a man of the word.

296
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,040
He's a man of the word.

297
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,440
After the investigation,

298
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,040
the cause of death is the person who was shot by the head.

299
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,240
He was killed by a bullet.

300
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,440
The victim was killed before he was born.

301
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,040
He was killed by a bullet.

302
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,440
The world...

303
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
So...

304
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,240
This is the truth, right?

305
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,640
We're sorry.

306
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,040
I want to go see Sister again.

307
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Before the fire,

308
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,440
we can arrange for you to see her for the last time.

309
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,440
We'll also find a suit in her room.

310
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
We'll change the one on her body.

311
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,840
It's uncomfortable to see her in front of you.

312
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,840
Why do I feel uncomfortable?

313
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,640
What did my sister wear when she died?

314
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Tell me!

315
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,640
This is the dress Yan Yong Yuan took in the photo.

316
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,040
Why?

317
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Why?

318
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Why?

319
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Why?

320
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Why?

321
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Why?

322
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Why?

323
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Didn't I tell you?

324
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Jiang Huo Yu is a man of the word.

325
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
He's going to kill others.

326
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Why?

327
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Why?

328
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Why?

329
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Master.

330
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Do you remember?

333
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
When Zhou Mei Bao died,

334
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,040
we didn't reveal the truth, right?

335
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Definitely not.

336
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Before the case, we can't reveal the truth.

337
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Do you remember Shen Mian Qi's testimony?

338
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
He Lian Si

339
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,440
was going to choose the most beautiful way to die.

340
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,440
He died so beautifully.

341
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
How did he know?

342
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
I guessed it.

343
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
You guessed it?

344
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
A woman like him

345
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,440
usually knows how to dress up and seduce men.

346
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,440
So he doesn't know what kind of clothes he wears when he dies.

347
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
According to the client of the coffee shop,

348
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
Zhou Mei Bao usually works at the office.

349
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Not only does she wear makeup, but also her makeup.

350
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I've seen her clothes.

351
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Her clothes are very conservative.

352
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
Her colors are also very plain.

353
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
She can't even talk about her paintings.

354
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Lin Meng Yu told me.

355
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Why did he tell you this?

356
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Didn't I tell you before?

357
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
After he lost his sleep,

358
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
he kept talking to me.

359
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
How did he tell you?

360
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
He said that when he passed by the door of Zhou Mei Bao's house,

361
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
he saw the door was open.

362
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Ding Xiaoling was also inside.

363
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,240
He walked in and saw Zhou Mei Bao lying on the floor.

364
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
He was already dead.

365
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
But his face was very red.

366
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
It seemed that he was wearing powder.

367
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
He also wore a princess dress with a lace.

368
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
It looked like a doll.

369
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Although Lin and I divorced,

370
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
we were still close.

371
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,240
I was also afraid that you would suspect him.

372
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,240
So I didn't say these things before.

373
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,640
He remains still.

374
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,440
So you even thought

375
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,240
that it was again adding emergencies to me?

376
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,540
It is true.

377
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,040
Hello?

378
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,760
This is new your?

379
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
The seal of the dress?

380
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,600
The seal of the dress?

381
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,240
The air conditioner.

382
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:30,660
Birthday

383
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,760
Hello?

384
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,740
Can I help you?

385
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,240
Hello, Sir.

386
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,240
My best wishes to everyone.

387
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,200
the victim has any feelings for the crime

388
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,080
and the words you hid in the previous interrogation

389
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,960
are also to bear the legal responsibility.

390
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,400
Officer Yang, what do you mean?

391
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,040
I've never cooperated with you

392
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,120
in every interrogation

393
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,000
I've ever asked.

394
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,280
Now it seems

395
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,040
that I'm the criminal.

396
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,080
It's just a matter of time before the crime.

397
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,720
Yes.

398
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,800
Zhong Mei Bao is dead.

399
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,240
She's so pitiful.

400
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,200
Everyone loves her.

401
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
Everyone wants to be her witness.

402
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What about me?

403
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,720
Has anyone ever been pitiful to me?

404
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
You're a woman too.

405
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,960
Think about it from my point of view.

406
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Am I not a victim?

407
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,120
My life

408
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,360
and my whole life

409
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,000
are destroyed by them.

410
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
It's all over.

411
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,400
It's over.

412
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,120
There was a news a while ago.

413
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,440
I don't know if you saw it.

414
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,400
A girl

415
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,240
was beaten by a stranger

416
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,720
by a stranger

417
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,760
near the bar.

418
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,000
I saw the news.

419
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,600
That man was too heavy.

420
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,320
He was not a person.

421
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,120
Many people on the Internet

422
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,320
are scolding that man.

423
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,520
But there are other reasons.

424
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,920
The dress is so short.

425
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
It's worth it.

426
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,720
The blouse

427
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,680
must not be a good woman.

428
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,520
She's so late

429
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,680
and she's afraid to go on a night trip.

430
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,760
She doesn't know how to drive.

431
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Do you think a girl

432
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
is more sexy

433
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,520
and makes men feel guilty

434
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,760
and forced to live?

435
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,520
Of course not.

436
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,800
Do you think a girl

437
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,960
is more beautiful

438
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
and makes men fall in love?

439
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,080
It's a man who's wrong.

440
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,760
It's a man who's hurt.

441
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,080
But why do most people

442
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,000
always get used to

443
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,760
pushing all the blame

444
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,080
on women?

445
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,080
Miss Shen, do you remember what you said?

446
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,920
You said

447
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,680
every woman

448
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,440
like Zhong Mei Bao

449
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,960
was attracted by her

450
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,880
because of the men in the wedding.

451
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,320
So she even

452
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,640
chose the most beautiful way

453
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,920
to die.

454
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,280
Does it

455
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,800
meanduce

456
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,600
you'reoring him?

457
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,880
Do you know worthako Zhong Mei Bao?

458
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,760
Do you get it now?

459
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,120
Do you understand

460
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
why he was wearing

461
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,520
such an stuff to commit suicide?

462
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,720
Do you realize

463
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
what kind of meaning they have.

464
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Do you really think

465
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Zhong Mei Bao should have been the one who caused all this?

466
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
Officer Yang,

467
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Zhong Mei Bao,

468
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
but not the one who committed suicide.

469
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
I called Lao Lin that day.

470
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
His phone was always on the wrong side.

471
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
I turned it off.

472
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
I came to the coffee shop and found Zhong Mei Bao.

473
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
He was not in the shop either.

474
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
I was so unhappy

475
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
that I thought they might be together.

476
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
What are you doing?

477
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
What are you doing?

478
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Everything is about to end.

479
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Your mom is here.

480
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
What are you doing?

481
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Your mom is here.

482
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
My mom is here.

483
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Your mom is here.

484
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Your mom is here.

485
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
She is here.

486
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
You are here.

487
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Your mom is here.

488
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,920
I'm sorry.

489
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
I'm sorry.

490
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Wei Fang.

491
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
Wei Fang.

492
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
Wei Fang.

493
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Wei Fang.

494
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Wei Fang.

495
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Wei Fang.

496
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
Wei Fang.

497
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Wei Fang.

498
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Wei Fang.

499
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Wei Fang.

500
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Wei Fang, I'm sorry.

501
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,520
I...

502
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,160
What are you talking about?

503
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,600
I quit my job with other options after the schoolIf you tried work in this e-sports industry,

504
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,140
I'm happy.

505
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,080
Shuts up

506
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,840
Oh

507
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,040
What should I do, after fullTHW me,

508
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,300
I can't take it anymore.

509
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,520
Nope

510
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,800
Ms. Xiuming

511
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,500
Hurry up

512
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,060
Yes.

513
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,460
I'm on the stage.

514
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,660
What's wrong?

515
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,060
Nothing.

516
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,060
I just want to tell you

517
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,420
that I want you to practice

518
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,220
and have a good rest

519
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,420
every day.

520
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:07,940
Sister,

521
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,980
you called me

522
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,180
to tell me about this.

523
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Actually, I've been saying this

524
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,660
for so many years.

525
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,620
But...

526
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,100
I just want to tell you again.

527
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,740
Sister.

528
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,180
This sentence

529
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,900
is the most important to me.

530
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,260
That's good.

531
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,660
Go now.

532
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,340
Jun.

533
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,300
What?

534
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,260
Goodbye.

535
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,060
Goodbye.

536
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,540
Jing Cut And Perraman

537
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,340
collecting things.

538
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,060
What's wrong?

539
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,860
My phone.

540
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,260
Give it to me.

541
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,740
Hello, sister.

542
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,660
Are you okay?

543
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,940
I'm fine.

544
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,100
But you always say

545
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,420
that you're fine.

546
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,900
I'm fine.

547
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,860
Don't worry.

548
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,300
Now,

549
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,620
don't think about anything.

550
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,260
Focus on doing your best

551
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
to do your best.

552
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,340
Don't worry.

553
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,060
That's good.

554
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,900
I was on the stage just now.

555
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,220
I suddenly found out

556
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,820
that I was actually

557
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,380
looking for you in the search for you.

558
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,700
I think I finally figured it out.

559
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,780
I want you to listen to me

560
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,900
with your bright eyes.

561
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,580
We can

562
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,140
open up our hearts

563
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,740
under the sunshine that we live every day.

564
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,020
He did those things.

565
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,780
He's not our fault.

566
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,620
And...

567
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,100
And I've grown up.

568
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,100
I'm stronger too.

569
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,500
Even without your protection,

570
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,900
I can face him.

571
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,460
That day...

572
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,180
You didn't

573
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,260
change anything

574
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,540
for me.

575
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,740
Sister,

576
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,700
are you still busy?

577
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,740
I'm trying.

578
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,740
I've never been

579
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,180
doing this for anyone.

580
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,660
I just want him to listen to you.

581
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,580
Keep my phone.

582
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,700
I'll only talk to you

583
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,700
tonight.

584
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,260
You know that, right?

585
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,380
I think I understand.

586
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,500
I don't deserve to be

587
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,580
so selfish for you.

588
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,820
I don't deserve to be

589
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,980
a fool for you.

590
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,580
Your photos

591
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,460
can't threaten us anymore.

592
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,420
If you can't get out,

593
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,820
that's just your habit.

594
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,020
It's not ours.

595
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,420
I'll go to the police station tomorrow.

596
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,340
We have no relationship

597
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,500
between us.

598
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,580
You can go.

599
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,540
Go.

600
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,660
Are youように

601
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,500
a fool?

602
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,140
Just like your mom.

603
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,100
Do you remember?

604
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,140
You left

605
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,960
everything to sistemas

606
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,860
even now.

607
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,460
The whole world thinks

608
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,500
you're a suicide.

609
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,180
Including

610
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,060
your brother,

611
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,340
and Ah Jun.

612
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,740
I forgot to tell you.

613
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,940
Jun.

614
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,540
He won't leave me forever.

615
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,100
He will always be my

616
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,500
good son.

617
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
Mei Bao.

618
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,740
Mei Bao, are you there?

619
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,340
Mei Bao.

620
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
Mei Bao.

621
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,740
What's wrong?

622
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,140
Mei Bao.

623
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,140
Mei Bao.

624
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
Mei Bao.

625
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,540
Mei Bao.

626
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,540
Mei Bao.

627
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,540
Mei Bao.

628
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,540
Mei Bao.

629
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,140
Mei Bao.

630
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,740
Mei Bao.

631
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,140
Xiao Lin. Xiao Lin.

632
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,540
No.

633
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,740
Let me see.

634
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,340
But don't worry.

635
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,940
There won't be a third or fourth power.

636
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,740
Be careful.

637
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,740
Be careful.

638
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,340
You...

639
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,340
Sorry.

640
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,740
I have something else to do.

641
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,340
I'll go downstairs.

642
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,340
Sorry.

643
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,940
Mei Bao.

644
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,740
Mei Bao.

645
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,740
What's wrong?

646
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,540
Why are you lying here?

647
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,140
What are you doing here?

648
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,340
Xiao Lin, what's wrong with you?

649
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,540
Why are you lying here?

650
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,540
Mei Bao.

651
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,740
Mei Bao, look at me.

652
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,740
Dead.

653
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,740
Dead.

654
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,540
Why don't you call the police?

655
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,740
It's okay.

656
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,740
Xiao Lin.

657
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,340
Who was that?

658
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,740
What happened to the kitchen box?

659
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,540
Why is he dead?

660
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,140
Tell me.

661
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,540
You can't even protect me.

662
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,540
You go.

663
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,140
Go.

664
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,740
Xiao Lin.

665
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,540
Go.

666
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,740
Xiao Lin.

667
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,940
Xiao Lin, don't be so stubborn.

668
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,340
You're the one

669
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,340
who knows me the most in this world.

670
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,340
Right?

671
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,740
For you,

672
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,540
I can help you with anything.

673
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,940
Be careful.

674
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,340
Tell me.

675
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,340
Where are you?

676
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,940
Xiao Lin.

677
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,340
My stomach hurts.

678
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,340
It hurts.

679
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,340
Call the police.

680
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,540
Xiao Hong.

681
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,740
Xiao Lin.

682
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,940
Xiao Hong.

683
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,740
Xiao Lin.

684
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,380
Officer -♪Come on, come on, my love Gee statute tabiiplane~! Prove that you are breathing in ya-ya-ya!

685
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,240
Hold your breath, won't you?

686
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,140
Okay.

687
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,460
Please hold your breath!

688
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,140
Stop there!

689
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,140
Mo Li!

690
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:18,640
Mo Li.

691
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,940
Mo Li!

692
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,500
對了ы written, tightening the guard.

693
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,340
The captain, hurry up and help him time.

694
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,140

695
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,140

699
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,300
Come in.

700
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,340
It's your first time here.

701
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,920
Yes.

702
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,580
Make danger to the public,

703
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,580
or the entertainment industry.

704
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,500
Report to the kaikoko department

705
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,960
to commit arrest

706
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,180
by conscience of the injury.

707
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,480
Yes, sir.

708
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,100
Officer Yao,

709
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,660
you did a good job.

710
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,140
Let's do justice.

711
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,300
bean

712
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,860
Lu Xiao

713
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,660
Do you still recall

714
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,300
the darkest day in your life?

715
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,980
Perhaps you lost it.

716
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,780
Maybe it's a tragedy.

717
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,460
Maybe it's a pain.

718
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,300
I feel like I've become a transparent person.

719
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,260
No one will see you.

720
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,460
You even took yourself

721
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,180
from the crowd.

722
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,580
The world around you

723
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,820
is not related to you.

724
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,540
Step by step,

725
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,620
the more you're in the dark,

726
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,060
the more you're in the dark.

727
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,020
But we always need someone else's kindness.

728
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,020
I'm worried about you.

729
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,660
When you're not looking,

730
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,420
if anyone tries to take you away,

731
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,500
please don't refuse.

732
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,580
Because he'll take you out of the dark

733
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,340
and leave the garden

734
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,460
and return to the world I was in.

735
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,940
The World of the Dead

736
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,940
Episode 4

737
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,740
As long as you hold his hand tightly,

738
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,780
don't let go easily.

739
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,740
You'll find that

740
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,300
the world you haven't seen for a long time

741
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,060
is a little better than before.

742
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,460
Episode 12

743
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:40,020
The first time I saw you, I was so happy

744
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,020
I was so happy

745
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,020
I was so happy

746
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,020
I was so happy

747
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,020
I was so happy

748
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,020
I was so happy

749
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,020
I was so happy

750
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,020
I was so happy

751
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,020
I was so happy

752
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,020
I was so happy

753
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:10,020
I felt so happy

754
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,020
distorted

755
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,020
I like it

756
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,020
These sleepless nights

757
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,020
The first step is to make the dough into a round shape.

758
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,020
Then, roll it into a round shape.

759
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,020
Then, roll it into a round shape.

760
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,020
Then, roll it into a round shape.

761
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,020
Then, roll it into a round shape.

762
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,020
Then, roll it into a round shape.

763
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,020
Then, roll it into a round shape.

764
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,020
