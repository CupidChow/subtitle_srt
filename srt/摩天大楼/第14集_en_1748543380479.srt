1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He was betrayed by his fans.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now he is the same as the music god.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He was separated from his family.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He has been left for many years.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He only found his own identity.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tonight,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the past of the ancient and ancient gods

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is the confession of the sad father.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
How many fathers can this couple

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
meet again?

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's witness it together.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let love be the main thing.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let love return to you.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Welcome back to love.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's welcome this father with applause.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's welcome this father with applause.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A popstar train that faked feud and stopped 365TRY.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A pop boy meets him at Internet

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
willing to be its leader.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Who is the nicknames of the original one?

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Copy and paste will be answered later.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,560
It's a problem.

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,520
It's quite popular recently.

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,120
Yes.

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,560
A woman's father

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
participated in this show.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,560
He also said that

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,680
after the woman became a celebrity,

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
I don't care about her.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,800
Get to work.

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,040
Xiao Xiao,

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,160
I asked you to investigate the show.

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,160
You won't become a fan of this show, right?

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,360
Master.

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,440
Look at your show.

43
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,360
Mr. Li,

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,520
why do you want to go to this class?

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,000
Because I don't want to go to work.

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,160
Can you not go to work after learning this?

47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,040
Anyway, I've taught a few girlfriends before.

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,840
They give me a lot of money.

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
And I want to break up later.

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
They also keep pestering me.

51
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,680
What did they teach you?

52
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,000
The POA

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,240
is the writing of the pick-up artist.

54
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Some people are used to

55
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,120
transferring it to a pop expert.

56
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,480
In fact, it should be considered

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,520
a psychological control

58
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,720
that is considered to be a psychological control.

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,400
In general, it can be called

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,240
five steps.

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,400
Master.

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
Let's re-enact the words of the actress.

63
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
Is it just right to

64
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,120
be a part of the POA?

65
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,520
First, the first step is to establish your personality.

66
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,280
That is, your personal image.

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,440
But there are several types of this.

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
Let's take the common one.

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
The king model is the father's personality.

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,600
That is to say, you work hard.

71
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,560
You are very hardworking.

72
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,840
I am the one who hurt the most in our company.

73
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
I am a personal guardian.

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
You don't mind, right?

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,600
I want to deal with you.

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,800
Or a warm man.

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,520
Let him stay if the child likes it.

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,960
Then the second step is to establish your personality.

79
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,120
Even if I just said that

80
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,080
I am a boss.

81
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
But in fact, I am a liar.

82
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,280
Then I lied to many people.

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,320
Today I am going to be a heavy person.

84
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,040
I will take you to the prison.

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Then suddenly I tell you

86
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,840
that I have also been hurt.

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,960
And I was hurt a lot.

88
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,440
I am a little driver.

89
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,280
The company driver's company is in trouble.

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
The salary can't be sent out.

91
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,640
So I became like this now.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,840
So you mean

93
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,120
there is a turning point in the image, right?

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,320
It's almost the same.

95
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,560
I have something to say.

96
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,960
You must be very sincere.

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
You have to let him know.

98
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,040
Let him think that he is the only one in the world

99
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,240
who understands you.

100
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,000
I will work hard to get up.

101
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,400
Let's think about it.

102
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,320
It's a good life.

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,240
The third step is to establish your contract.

104
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,160
Since you like me,

105
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,640
you can't lie to me.

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,520
Let's not do this business, okay?

107
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,720
Let's not go to so many men every day, okay?

108
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,760
Don't worry.

109
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,920
I won't leave you.

110
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,440
The fourth step is to think about the contract.

111
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,080
It's to catch the person who is responsible for the wrong death.

112
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
For example, we made a promise.

113
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
He lied to me.

114
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,920
What should I do?

115
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
He is noisy.

116
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,640
He is scolding me.

117
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,520
He is being harsh.

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,800
Let him know him well.

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,240
The problem between me and him

120
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,760
is totally because of his fault.

121
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,640
You are so cheap.

122
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,000
You are so cheap.

123
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,600
Who is he?

124
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,280
How can you promise me?

125
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,000
You are so bad.

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,640
You are so bad.

127
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,400
Come out.

128
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,080
Come out.

129
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,120
What kind of reaction will the other person have?

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,240
Well,

131
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
basically,

132
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
he will leave the wrong person

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
and leave the person who is responsible for the wrong death.

134
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,440
I will have a good life with you.

135
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,000
But I will tell him this time.

136
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,080
I can give you the last chance.

137
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,760
Usually,

138
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,080
you can control him

139
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,840
as you like.

140
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,680
And the last and most important person.

141
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
You have to think of a way

142
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,560
to kill him for you willingly.

143
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,320
I can't believe you anymore.

144
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,200
I don't know.

145
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,960
Don't do this.

146
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,760
Look, go away.

147
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,320
I will kill myself.

148
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,280
If someone wants to kill you,

149
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,960
he will listen to you.

150
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,680
And he won't leave you for the rest of his life.

151
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,280
The biggest point of this story is

152
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,680
Yan Yongyuan's image.

153
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,240
He has described himself as a victim.

154
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,240
Master,

155
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,160
if the plot is not changed,

156
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
how about we

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
make Yan Yongyuan

158
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,960
the image of Yan Jun and Ye Meili?

159
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
What will happen?

160
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,800
This is my name.

161
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,000
I want to tell you.

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
I know who you are.

163
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,520
Master,

164
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,320
do you remember a Hong Konger

165
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,880
who always came to our room?

166
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
Master,

167
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,280
do you remember

168
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,680
the Hong Konger who always came to our room?

169
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,600
I

170
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,760
want to give him a few hues.

171
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,760
Didn't we say we would eat together?

172
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,960
We promised him.

173
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,320
You are so stupid.

174
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,480
Where are you going?

175
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,400
Master,

176
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,520
I told you yesterday

177
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,920
I would go to practice.

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,960
Let's end this work,

179
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,200
okay?

180
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
You are always

181
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
a man to me.

182
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,280
Do you think

183
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,160
I am happy?

184
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,280
No!

185
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,000
I can't believe you anymore.

186
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,320
You want to kill me?

187
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,360
Okay?

188
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,520
You can kill me.

189
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,360
If the PEA theory is really successful,

190
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,840
Yan Yongyuan will know

191
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,120
how to control a woman

192
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,040
from the spirit.

193
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,320
He won't just

194
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,280
kill one person.

195
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,360
What do you mean?

196
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,880
In addition to the end,

197
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,640
there are other victims.

198
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,000
If we can find them

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,520
and search for their evidence,

200
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
we will have a reason

201
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,600
to re-enact Yan Yongyuan.

202
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,120
Good.

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,480
Then you can

204
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,600
take the PEA as evidence.

205
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,640
You can see

206
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,800
if the judge will be arrested.

207
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,840
But you are right.

208
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
We can't

209
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,600
listen to Yan Yongyuan's words.

210
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,240
Captain,

211
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,800
the data from the police station

212
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,400
has been sent here.

213
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,200
So fast?

214
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,400
Such a small place.

215
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,360
There are few people

216
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,400
who opened the company earlier.

217
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,640
But it's not like they are

218
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,000
just in time.

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,640
You can find them

220
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,200
as you like.

221
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,800
Okay.

222
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,960
Master,

223
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,400
the time and place

224
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,800
that Yan Yongyuan is talking about

225
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,200
is basically the same as the data.

226
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't you have any new points?

227
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,600
This small company

228
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,920
is the sponsor of

229
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,400
the company's chairman,

230
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,360
Wang Hong.

231
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,360
Such a famous female entrepreneur

232
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,560
would do business in such a small place?

233
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
Yan Yongyuan said

234
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,320
that the company

235
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,200
was opened by his former boss.

236
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,080
He also

237
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,360
treated that boss as a driver.

238
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,600
Could it be that

239
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,760
the former boss

240
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,160
is Wang Hong?

241
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,160
Can we find out

242
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,800
where Wang Hong is now?

243
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,360
I don't know.

244
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,520
Where is Wang Hong?

245
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
The headquarters of Huasheng Group

246
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,920
seems to have a pair of pairs.

247
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,320
Let's go and ask them.

248
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Love's story is warm and you and me.

249
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
This is a live broadcast

250
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,560
for you

251
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,760
by Shuanghe Wei.

252
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,120
Let love be the main character.

253
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,960
Let love return to you.

254
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,360
I am the chairman of the company.

255
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,720
First, let's welcome

256
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,120
our happy teacher today,

257
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,720
famous love expert,

258
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,960
Ms. Yang Lili.

259
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,360
The new student, Ms. Zhang Xiaoting.

260
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,960
And our legal consultant,

261
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,160
Mr. Zhou Hongwei.

262
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Today, our client

263
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
is an old man

264
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,160
who is six years old.

265
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,560
Mr. Yan Yongyuan.

266
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,160
He just found

267
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,360
a lost son a while ago.

268
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
This person is not someone else.

269
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
He is the young piano player

270
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,560
who is currently

271
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,160
playing the piano.

272
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Ye Shujun.

273
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
He met his family again

274
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,960
and was happy.

275
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,920
But why

276
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,160
does Mr. Ye

277
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,400
not want to

278
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
meet his father?

279
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,360
First, let's invite Mr. Yan

280
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,160
to tell us his story.

281
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,960
Comrade, I am really sorry.

282
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,360
Mr. Wang is really not here.

283
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,960
Please don't make me feel uncomfortable.

284
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,560
Our legal consultant will be here soon.

285
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,160
He will cooperate with you.

286
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,960
Do you know

287
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,360
where Mr. Wang is now?

288
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
I really don't know.

289
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,760
You don't know? You can ask him.

290
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Hello, Mr. Wang.

291
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,160
We are from the city of Mancheng.

292
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,360
We have a case

293
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,760
that needs your cooperation with us.

294
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,560
Sorry, I said it just now.

295
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,360
We will come down soon.

296
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,560
It's okay.

297
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,360
I am willing to cooperate with you.

298
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,960
But I am really busy.

299
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,760
Why don't you

300
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,960
ask my secretary to come back for a while?

301
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,760
Okay?

302
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,560
I am really busy.

303
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,360
Sorry.

304
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Mr. Wang,

305
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,960
do you still have any impression

306
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,360
of Yan Yongyuan?

307
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
He is a young man.

308
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
He is a young man.

309
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
He is a young man.

310
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,560
He is a young man.

311
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,960
Yan Yongyuan

312
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,960
we are looking at the murder case.

313
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,160
We found that Yan Yongyuan

314
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,960
has other problems

315
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,760
between Beihai people.

316
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,560
It must be a girl.

317
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,860
Why are you laughing so much?

318
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,760
I know this person terribly.

319
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,560
It is ethical for women

320
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,760
to get sauce on her nose.

321
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,360
Then I will not do 소리 argion.

322
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,060
Yan Yongyuan said

323
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,160
the Family Mood

324
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,360
Later, she met a woman and was cheated by her.

325
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,080
It led to her company's bankruptcy

326
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,480
and she was involved in the lawsuit.

327
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Let me interrupt.

328
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,720
She said she was cheated by a woman.

329
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,280
She said she was in a lot of trouble.

330
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,960
How is that possible?

331
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,040
She herself is a master of cheating women.

332
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,320
If you don't mind,

333
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,680
can you tell us about the situation at that time?

334
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
At that time,

335
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,280
she was the driver of our family.

336
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,960
She saw me as a widow.

337
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,160
She was so hard-working

338
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,160
and she was very warm to me.

339
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,520
She was always helping me with big and small things.

340
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,360
She also dealt with many personal matters for me.

341
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,800
Later, she was in a long time.

342
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,960
I fell in love with her slowly.

343
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,800
Then what happened?

344
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,600
She took my money

345
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,520
and spent it on the flower field.

346
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,040
I was very busy at that time.

347
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,200
I went with her.

348
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,400
Later, she became a family member

349
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,280
and found a little girl in the room.

350
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,920
She was also with me.

351
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,560
Yan Yongyuan said

352
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,440
that her company was bankrupt

353
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,960
and she was in a relationship with someone else.

354
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,040
It was all because of her.

355
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,480
I don't know what happened between them.

356
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,760
I only know that Yan Yongyuan

357
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,560
was in a mess with some people.

358
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
They were not businessmen.

359
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
One day, she proposed to me

360
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,480
to work in the top floor of the flower field.

361
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,360
I didn't agree to her death.

362
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,880
I didn't expect her to threaten me.

363
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,640
To get rid of her,

364
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,880
I gave her a small company.

365
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,240
So, you had a record of the change of the law?

366
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,320
Yes.

367
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,680
Now, I remember it's quite a happy thing.

368
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,880
Luckily, I didn't go with her.

369
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,160
Otherwise, the company would be ruined.

370
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,360
Maybe, I can't keep my life.

371
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,960
Look at that little girl.

372
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
She was forced to death.

373
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
She was forced to death?

374
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,160
She committed suicide.

375
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,120
It was so complicated at that time.

376
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Yan Yongyuan was in the apartment.

377
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,720
She was in a relationship with someone else.

378
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,440
We found out the record.

379
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,600
She is your father.

380
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,280
She asked someone to talk to her.

381
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,840
She said she wanted to see me.

382
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,760
Will you forgive me?

383
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,160
You need to forgive me for many things.

384
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,320
I don't know which one you are talking about.

385
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,880
That girl is so naughty.

386
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,640
Zhong Jie.

387
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,720
She doesn't blame me for being a ghost.

388
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,840
And she wants to marry me.

389
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,640
That girl is her style.

390
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,480
Okay.

391
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,960
I'm not interested in your private life.

392
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,000
Tell me.

393
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,400
You came to see me today.

394
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,400
What's the matter?

395
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,960
I hope you can give me another chance to change my mind.

396
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,560
Please.

397
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,920
Okay.

398
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,480
After you leave here,

399
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,280
I'll arrange for you to be a driver for our company.

400
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
Driver?

401
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,920
Is there any problem?

402
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,640
Forget it.

403
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,120
Hong.

404
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Don't forget.

405
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,960
How did I help you when you were in trouble?

406
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,080
I have a lot of benefits for the company.

407
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,080
Do you want to threaten me?

408
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,240
My company's tax problem has been solved.

409
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,440
It's you.

410
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,880
The old people who have been using the company's money

411
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,480
are enough to make the old people wear it.

412
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
Do you want to be here?

413
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,680
You can't go out for the rest of your life.

414
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,080
I didn't mean that.

415
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,680
I just want to tell you that

416
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,400
I don't want to see you again.

417
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,320
Hong.

418
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm leaving.

419
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,920
What are you doing?

420
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,560
Hong.

421
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,760
What are you doing, Mr. Yan?

422
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,360
Get back to work.

423
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,400
Hurry up.

424
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,600
31525.

425
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,760
What's the matter?

426
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
315204.

427
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,640
What are you doing?

428
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,440
Get in.

429
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,520
Who is he?

430
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,000
Why are you bothering me?

431
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,800
Who are you? What are you doing?

432
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,640
Who are you?

433
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,200
What are you doing?

434
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,080
You've been out for half a year.

435
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,800
Get back here.

436
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,880
Get back here.

437
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,760
Don't bother me.

438
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,360
Get back here.

439
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,360
Go.

440
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,440
Get back here.

441
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,320
After many years,

442
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,640
I heard that little girl died.

443
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,360
I was not surprised at all.

444
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,160
Because I know that person's style very well.

445
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,200
I don't know how much that little girl

446
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,160
suffered from me.

447
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,800
I feel sorry for her.

448
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,240
Okay.

449
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,280
I see.

450
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,000
Okay.

451
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,520
What's wrong with your foot?

452
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,640
My leg is numb.

453
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Xiao Li confirmed it with Yan.

454
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,000
The case of Zhong Jie's death at the building,

455
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,720
the conclusion was suicide.

456
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,240
Did you not suspect Yan Yong Yuan

457
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,800
in the case of the case?

458
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,160
Of course I did.

459
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
But I think that

460
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Zhong Jie was often tortured.

461
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,520
He didn't want to contact the child.

462
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,280
He committed suicide under the decision.

463
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,760
And then he never found any evidence.

464
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,400
So...

465
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
Even if he didn't kill anyone,

466
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,320
he must have been tortured by him.

467
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,160
Another news from the case

468
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,000
said that on the day of Zhong Jie's death,

469
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,640
Yan Yong Yuan was shot in the head.

470
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
What a coincidence.

471
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,240
Who is the murderer?

472
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,920
That's interesting.

473
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,280
Yan Yong Yuan didn't report the case.

474
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,760
The person who sent the police

475
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,200
got the information of the hospital's report.

476
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,560
He contacted him.

477
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,600
What did he say?

478
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,720
He said it was an accident.

479
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,080
He was so excited

480
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,800
that he died in the end.

481
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
He was so excited that he hurt himself.

482
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Are you kidding me?

483
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm so worried.

484
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,320
Yes.

485
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,240
Let's ask Yan Meili about it.

486
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,120
We're a little nervous.

487
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,640
How about this?

488
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,920
Let's split up.

489
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,920
Son.

490
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,080
They said they contacted you.

491
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,800
They don't know if you will come tonight.

492
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
I just want to tell you.

493
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,480
During your growth,

494
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,400
I had many accidents.

495
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,040
But no matter what,

496
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,480
I always hoped you could learn from it.

497
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
Do you remember how much I

498
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,520
spent on you

499
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,720
to buy you that piano?

500
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,720
If you see this show again,

501
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,000
I just want to tell you a word.

502
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,200
Give me another chance,

503
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,760
okay?

504
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,160
I believe your life

505
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,520
will be passed down to him by our show.

506
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,800
Mr. Yan,

507
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,920
I heard that you have a daughter

508
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,720
who is not worried about you.

509
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,200
There was an accident recently.

510
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,760
Her name is Mei Bao.

511
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,040
Jun.

512
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,160
Mei Bao has left.

513
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,360
In this world,

514
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,880
I only have you.

515
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,640
I'm your only family.

516
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,880
I'm your only family.

517
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm your only family.

518
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,560
I know

519
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,000
you might have wronged me.

520
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,800
At that time,

521
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,640
why did you give up?

522
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,600
But do you know that

523
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,280
in order to take you to the city,

524
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,960
I asked for your sister,

525
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,040
your mother-in-law.

526
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,760
She...

527
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,640
She made me suffer.

528
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,600
She...

529
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,280
She stole my unknowingly hair bowl.

530
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,120
Just...

531
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,040
Da Xu Xia blond.

532
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,360
Brother, I'm dying retired!

533
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,200
I know

534
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,120
I'm not a qualified husband.

535
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,960
Son,

536
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,280
give me another chance

537
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I can see you.

538
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
I'm so happy.

539
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
This is a story that is really a story of a real person.

540
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I believe that every audience here is curious about it.

541
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Will this lonely music god,

542
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
will appear on the scene today?

543
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Don't leave.

544
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
I'll introduce it to you after the ad is done.

545
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,600
The End

546
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Yes, she was indeed stabbed.

547
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Can you tell me about the situation at that time?

548
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Mei Bao.

549
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Auntie, you must promise me that you can be the top of the class in the future.

550
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
I couldn't stop Mei Bao at that time.

551
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I thought she would go to the hospital to see her mother.

552
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
So after the fire broke out,

553
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
we immediately came back.

554
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Doctor Li, you finally came.

555
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
But you are already in a hurry.

556
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
The fire has been set up.

557
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
There are still many people waiting for you to take care of the child.

558
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Be good.

559
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I'll take care of it later.

560
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Let's go. I'll go to the other side to make it better.

561
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Xiaoyu.

562
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Where is the waiting room?

563
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Is the new apartment too flat?

564
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Has Mei Bao come?

565
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
The patient is coming.

566
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Let's go.

567
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Doctor Li, let me report to you about the patient's current situation.

568
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

569
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
He is Yan Yong Yuan. He is 42 years old.

570
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
He is 36.1 cm in height.

571
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Although he is not very tall,

572
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
he is still very tall.

573
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
He is not very tall.

574
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Doctor Li.

575
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Director Li, I'm a emergency.

576
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Please send an external doctor to bring him here.

577
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
I can't do this anymore.

578
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
No, Director Li. This person is...

579
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
He is too old-fashioned.

580
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,600
His muscle is quite big, so I'm not sure.

581
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
He's so old-fashioned.

582
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,600
His muscle is quite big, so I'm not sure.

583
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
So,

584
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
you saved Yan Yong Yuan?

585
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,640
That Li Guilan.

586
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,360
It's not me.

587
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,160
This.

588
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,760
Zheng Xin, look.

589
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,360
Why don't you have any interest in being a cop?

590
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,560
Who told me personally?

591
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,640
Xiao Jun is ill.

592
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,840
He won't reveal it to the media.

593
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,560
Miss Cao, don't be so excited.

594
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,040
I can guarantee that Xiao Jun

595
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,200
is not from our company.

596
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,760
Who are you?

597
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Yan Wuyuan, right?

598
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,760
I'm too emotional.

599
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
I'm not suitable for being a doctor.

600
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,360
I can understand.

601
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Then,

602
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
did you contact Zhong Beibao?

603
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
I promise

604
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,760
we will be together.

605
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,560
From now on,

606
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,560
we will never be apart.

607
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,560
Okay?

608
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
After many years, I found out that

609
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,760
that night, Mei Bao went to Zhong Jie's hometown.

610
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,760
He wanted to report to his relatives.

611
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,360
But it didn't last long.

612
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,560
The relatives heard the real message.

613
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,360
Yan Wuyuan said

614
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,560
Mei Bao was the one who told him

615
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
that he was a cop.

616
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
He was a cop.

617
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
He was a cop.

618
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
He was a cop.

619
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
He was a cop.

620
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
He was a cop.

621
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
He was a cop.

622
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
He was a cop.

623
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
He was a cop.

624
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
He was a cop.

625
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
He was a cop.

626
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
He was a cop.

627
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
They thought that the child was a cop.

628
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
So they sent him

629
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,560
to a private school.

630
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
Then, did Zhong Beibao

631
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
not contact you during school?

632
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,560
That school is a complete technical management.

633
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
There won't be any contact

634
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,560
between the students and the outside.

635
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
The outside people

636
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
wouldn't know what happened inside.

637
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Later, I asked Mei Bao

638
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
how he was doing.

639
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
He was just a little bit worried.

640
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
I don't understand.

641
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
If the people in town

642
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
were all sent by Yan Wuyuan,

643
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Zhong Beibao was injured.

644
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Why didn't Yan Wuyuan

645
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
call the police?

646
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Officer Yang,

647
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
you are a cop.

648
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
You know

649
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
more than I do

650
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
what you think.

651
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
I don't believe

652
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Zhong Jiehui will kill himself.

653
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Xiaojun,

654
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
you should go back to your room to rest.

655
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
I'll handle this.

656
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
It's okay.

657
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
I feel better now.

658
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
It's all my fault.

659
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
I shouldn't have pulled you in.

660
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
Now,

661
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
all the performances are cancelled.

662
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,560
A lot of advertisers

663
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
are going to terminate our contract

664
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,560
and make us pay for losses.

665
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
It's okay.

666
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
It's not your fault.

667
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
I know Yan Wuyuan too well.

668
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
No matter how I avoid her,

669
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
she won't let me go.

670
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
These things

671
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
will be ruled out by her

672
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
sooner or later.

673
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Mr. Ye,

674
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
I'm here to say sorry to you.

675
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
I didn't expect

676
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
that I could make you

677
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
so emotional

678
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
yesterday.

679
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
I'm sorry.

680
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Officer Zhong,

681
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
I have a question.

682
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Go ahead.

683
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Do you still have the confidence

684
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
to get Yan Wuyuan back?

685
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Yes.

686
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
I hope you can get Yan Wuyuan back.

687
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Okay.

688
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
We are investigating new evidence.

689
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Once we find it,

690
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
we will investigate it immediately.

691
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
What if we can't find the new evidence?

692
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
My mother

693
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
is a good girl.

694
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
I want to go to this show.

695
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Are you crazy?

696
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
I was originally

697
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
a crazy girl.

698
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
No, Xiaojun.

699
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
You know I'm not like that.

700
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
I should have gone to face her myself.

701
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Look.

702
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
We have already

703
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
taken the public and public companies to get rid of fire.

704
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
So listen to me.

705
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
It's best to keep silence now.

706
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Yes, Mr. Ye.

707
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
I think you should think about it.

708
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
It's not too serious.

709
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
It's not necessary

710
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
to make a big deal out of it.

711
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
This is very obvious.

712
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
It's a kind of

713
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Sudeger-Mozong-Horzheng.

714
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
It often deals with the victim

715
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
and the victim.

716
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
It's a kind of strange balance.

717
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
In these cases,

718
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
the defendant refused to be a public company.

719
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Mr. Ye, as a victim,

720
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
has been protecting the defendant

721
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
for the crime.

722
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
In fact, the sentence

723
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
is considered to be a crime.

724
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Considering the psychological condition

725
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
of the victim,

726
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
during the trial,

727
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
the defendant will not consider the sentence.

728
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
After all, whether it's the law

729
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
or the blood relationship,

730
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Mr. Yan

731
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
is Mr. Ye's father.

732
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
Mr. Yan, I'm sorry.

733
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Mr. Ye.

734
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
I have something to tell you.

735
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
In this case,

736
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
our program

737
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
aims to help solve

738
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
your family problem,

739
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
to achieve the harmony of the family.

740
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
So when you are talking,

741
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
you must pay attention to the wrong words

742
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
and make a little trouble again.

743
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
I pay attention to it.

744
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
That's great.

745
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Thank you.

746
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
The other thing is about him.

747
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Will he come to the scene today?

748
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
I can't tell you now.

749
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
We are going to introduce him to the stage.

750
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
He will come.

751
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
But he is my son.

752
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Let love be the main.

753
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Let love return to you.

754
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Welcome back to love.

755
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Mr. Yan, let's give him a big hand.

756
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Let's welcome this father to the stage.

757
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Xiaoyang,

758
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
I just got news.

759
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
The owner of the company

760
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,560
bought a ticket to Africa tomorrow morning.

761
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
He might really want to run away.

762
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
Director,

763
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
we are

764
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
the victims of the program.

765
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
No problem.

766
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
Don't worry.

767
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
The old grudge we have made

768
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
has already been fought

769
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
on your Hong Kong account.

770
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Don't worry.

771
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Are you going to move to Hong Kong?

772
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Yes.

773
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
I have a relative.

774
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
He went there early in the morning.

775
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
He is getting older.

776
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
He asked me to accompany him.

777
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
We also found out

778
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
that his flight is not straight.

779
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
It's in Hong Kong.

780
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
And it takes 10 hours to transfer time.

781
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
I was so worried.

782
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
There are so many flight tickets to Africa in Hong Kong.

783
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Why did he take so long

784
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
to fly for the middle and short time?

785
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm sorry, sir.

786
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Please adjust your phone to the camera.

787
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Okay.

788
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
You can't move.

789
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
I'm really sorry.

790
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
It's so troublesome.

791
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
When Yuan Yongyan was in the capital,

792
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
his colleague was a Hong Kong resident.

793
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Yes.

794
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
To keep him safe,

795
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
he had to transfer money

796
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
to the account of Hong Kong

797
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
and then transfer it.

798
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
He must still have money in his account.

799
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
He went to Hong Kong for 10 hours

800
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
to transfer the money.

801
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Then he fled.

802
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Do you remember how much

803
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
I spent on you

804
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
to buy you a new piano?

805
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Son,

806
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
if you want to watch this show,

807
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
I just want to tell you a story.

808
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Hello, sir.

809
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Sir.

810
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Have you called the car?

811
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Don't call it. I'll go to the toilet.

812
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
Who are you?

813
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Who?

814
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Have you forgotten your boyfriend?

815
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
He's just a kid.

816
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
He's such a kid.

817
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,560
He's just like my nephew.

818
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
How old is your nephew?

819
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
He's seven or eight years old.

820
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Sorry to disturb you.

821
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Sorry to disturb you.

822
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Ms. Cao.

823
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
This is your director.

824
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Hello, director.

825
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Ms. Cao.

826
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Hello.

827
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
This is Mr. Ye.

828
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
Mr. Ye.

829
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Thank you so much for today.

830
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
I didn't expect that you,

831
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
a famous artist,

832
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
would come to our show.

833
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
What do you mean?

834
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
We don't mean anything else.

835
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
It's said that our show

836
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
is very popular.

837
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
As long as you've been on this show,

838
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
you'll definitely be on the show.

839
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
We don't need to be on the show.

840
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Really?

841
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Before we get on the stage,

842
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
I have something to ask you.

843
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Mr. Ye.

844
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
What's your plan for today?

845
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Will it be

846
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
the father and sister?

847
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Or will you continue to be on the show?

848
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Why are we still on the stage?

849
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
It's okay.

850
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,560
It's better this way.

851
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,560
Our audience

852
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
will like this kind of

853
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
real love.

854
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Your father doesn't know you're coming.

855
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
We're going to make

856
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
a surprise for you.

857
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
I want to prepare it for you.

858
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Okay.

859
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
How long do we have?

860
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
About five minutes.

861
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,560
After five minutes,

862
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
you can go to the concert hall

863
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
and come on stage.

864
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Okay?

865
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Okay. I got it.

866
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Five minutes later.

867
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Okay.

868
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,560
You're not taking a break?

869
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
Okay.

870
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
See you later.

871
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,560
No need to be on the show.

872
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
I want to be alone.

873
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Okay.

874
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
I'll go out.

875
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Hurry up.

876
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Have you seen the audience?

877
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
No.

878
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Be careful.

879
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Welcome back to the love side.

880
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Mr. Yan,

881
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
you and your son

882
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
have been separated for so many years.

883
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
What else do you want to say

884
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
to your son?

885
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
I know

886
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,560
I'm a father who doesn't deserve it.

887
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,560
But I really want to see my son.

888
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
He's a man of his word.

889
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Who would want to see

890
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
his son who's been working hard

891
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
and raising his son

892
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
to someone else

893
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,560
and give him to someone else?

894
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Yes.

895
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,560
He's now a piano player.

896
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,560
But...

897
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Is he a criminal?

898
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,560
I've discovered his music talent since I was a kid.

899
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
I've been working hard

900
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,560
to earn money to buy him a piano.

901
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
You've been here for so many years.

902
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Mr. Jiang.

903
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
Have you seen Xiao Jun?

904
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
No. What's wrong?

905
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
He's gone.

906
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
I can't contact him.

907
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
What should I do?

908
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
My goodness.

909
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,560
What my father said is self-evident.

910
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
Will Ye Shujun

911
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
come to our stage today?

912
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Mr. Yan,

913
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,560
please come to the center of our stage.

914
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Okay.

915
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Xiao Yang.

916
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
I didn't see you just now.

917
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
What's wrong?

918
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
I know the photo of Wu Mingyue.

919
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
It's the age group.

920
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
What?

921
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
What did you say?

922
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Zhou Meibao was already a teenager.

923
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
But the photo of the kid

924
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,560
looked like he was the youngest.

925
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
So...

926
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,560
That kid named Yao Yao

927
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
is not Zhou Meibao.

928
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,560
Five, four, three, two, one.

929
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,560
Hurry up.

930
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Hurry up.

931
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
My name is Zhou Meibao.

932
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Now,

933
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
I want to tell you again.

934
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
This story.

935
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
I want to tell you again.

936
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
I want to tell you again.

937
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
I want to tell you again.

938
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
I want to tell you again.

939
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
I want to tell you again.

940
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
I want to tell you again.

941
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
I want to tell you again.
