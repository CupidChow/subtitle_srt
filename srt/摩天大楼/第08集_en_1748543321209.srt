00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yourau, you first.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You first.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You killed people, didn't you?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You sl Prophet thero救他沒有自殺.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You murdered people?

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,120
Oh, god!

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,760
Oh?

31
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,160
Oh?

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,320
To fweog the beauty of the soul,

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,480
I do still hear the packaging sound

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,720
as you are feeling that she is in pain

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,720
it hurts

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Time has made Meiyu a young girl with a strong will.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The cruel and cruel Zang Hun Gu

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
has never changed her beauty.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She has been waiting for a chance.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And that chance has become closer to her.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sorry, Yan Hu.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
People are still afraid of dying.

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,000
I remain where I am.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Meiyu,

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
close the door.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's beautiful.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Xiaoyang.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Xiaoyang, I'll go home after cleaning the dishes.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Remember to lock the door.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's so late. You haven't gone home yet?

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Next time.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Then you can go back to work.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Be careful.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thank you.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're not home with Xiaoxiao tonight.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What are you doing here?

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I want to ask you something.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Did you add Xiaoxiao's WeChat last time?

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let me have a look.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What?

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Can you see her friend Xuan?

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why?

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't see her.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll keep an eye on you.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Then I can't let you see her.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You don't respect the person you love.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You deserve to be kept an eye on.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let me have a look.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How can a girl like you

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
have a manly life?

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Why don't you go to work after this?

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Didn't you ask me to finish this?

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You can go back.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Otherwise, your boyfriend will be unhappy.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're already unhappy.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Last time, you didn't answer the phone.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
After you went back,

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I had a night's sleep.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I just got a call.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll go back now.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't work.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She cares about you.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I work for her.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's good to have a job.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm young and just like you.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But don't let your best friend

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
be with you.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Otherwise, in the future...

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Mr. Jiang.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If you keep going like this,

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I won't be able to leave tomorrow.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Mr. Jiang.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Xiao Yang.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I have a question for you.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why did you become a police officer?

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
For justice.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
For Cheng Ke Yang Shan.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't care about

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the things that you have to protect

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
for a thousand years.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Then continue to work for

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the justice officer.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll go back to play.

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Aren't you afraid of me?

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,240
mode

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,200
혼 lens

113
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
is the strongest mode

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,640
She got what she desires

115
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,240
except for a queen who is represent of the throne.

116
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,360
And she grew up

117
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,980
and wants to play bright and bright

118
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,260
all the gracious beings at her lab時香娘

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're finally here.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yinghu, you're really here.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Junchen!

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Junchen!

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Junchen!

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Junchen!

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The sisters of many years have experienced the endless hardships.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They finally meet.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Be careful!

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But how could their movement escape the evil eye?

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I thought you should learn to be obedient.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll give you another chance.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Or you'll all die.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Go!

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Get them!

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Be careful, Wu Jun!

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Run!

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Be careful!

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No!

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Be careful!

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We'll all die!

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Go!

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Sister!

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Stop the arrow!

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Sister!

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The two sisters of many years have experienced the endless hardships.

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't you understand?

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How many people have sacrificed?

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You only love me.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I promise you,

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll change your brother's freedom.

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You'll be with me.

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You'll be the one who loves me.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
At that moment,

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Meiyu suddenly felt that she was in a hot mood.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
She was surrounded by a strange emotion.

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Then,

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
the noble Fairy Princess

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
fell in love with the evil devil in hell.

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Morning.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're awake.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You won't sleep all night, right?

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Breakfast.

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So,

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
what did you notice?

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Meiyu grew up and was taken back by the devil.

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He helped the noble and the noble Princess

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
to save his brother.

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He took his brother away.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But he was taken by the devil.

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Then?

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Then, the devil was tortured by him.

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Then?

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Then,

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Meiyu fell in love with the devil.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Really?

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I also find it strange.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But I saw many netizens

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
who supported Meiyu.

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They said that her loneliness and pain

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
caused her to be so cruel

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
because she couldn't get Meiyu's love.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They said she was a person who was so cruel.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Who are they?

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
A few thousand-year-old devil

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
raised a girl for her age.

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
To prevent her from leaving,

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
she tortured people around her.

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm telling you, from the legal level,

189
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the devil

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
at least put down a few teams

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to threaten the public.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They forced her to go to the hospital.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They wanted to hurt her.

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The most important thing is to threaten the girl.

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
By the way, master,

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
did the team have any clues?

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I've checked it before.

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
His case is indeed not the same.

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
His parents are all teachers in the town.

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
When Zhou Meibao was born,

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
they were already over 50.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's not right.

203
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I remember Xie Baolo said

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
when Zhou Meibao's mother was 17 years old,

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
she gave birth to him.

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's complicated.

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
In the town,

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
there are many materials in the file.

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
They didn't have any information on the computer.

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Maybe it's the data from the book.

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I've contacted the police.

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They'll give us new information later.

213
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then why did Wu Mingyue check it?

214
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sir.

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know him.

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Sorry.

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Have you seen him?

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm in charge of his novel.

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He just stopped picking up the phone.

220
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's when I came.

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,040
I have no choice.

222
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,160
I don't agree with the public.

223
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,560
I don't dare to let you go.

224
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,480
It's a rule.

225
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,160
Okay.

226
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,480
Tell Wenyu.

227
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,800
If he doesn't come out,

228
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,440
we'll wait for him to get his way.

229
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,240
Yes.

230
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,160
Yang Tianbo.

231
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,320
What's wrong?

232
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,000
There's a small talk on the upstairs.

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Someone's looking for him every day.

234
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,560
The one at the doorstep?

235
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,280
Yes.

236
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,240
Everyone's looking for him.

237
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,120
I'm not seeing him.

238
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,400
I'm still pregnant.

239
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,360
What do you think?

240
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,040
What's your problem today?

241
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,960
There are a few more things to do.

242
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,360
I'll go to the police station and check them.

243
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,720
Do your work.

244
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,680
I'll help you.

245
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,160
Okay.

246
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,840
Thank you.

247
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,400
Miss Wu.

248
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,240
Didn't I tell you not to come up?

249
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,040
Do you remember me?

250
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm Yang Rui Sen.

251
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
I have something to ask you.

252
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,720
Please help me.

253
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,640
I told you before.

254
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,480
I can't help you with anything else.

255
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,360
Miss Wu.

256
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
You're the only one who can help me.

257
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,960
It's about the process.

258
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,320
Miss Wu, where are we going?

259
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,600
To clean up.

260
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,520
Actually, I came here today

261
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,960
to talk to you about the third step of the novel.

262
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,680
The third step of the novel?

263
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,880
That woman came from the dark

264
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,800
and left in the dark.

265
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,760
After the case,

266
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,200
we found a special manuscript

267
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
in the garden of the primary school.

268
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,720
I think it should be

269
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,960
the third part of the novel.

270
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,280
The novel is just a novel.

271
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,040
Why do you always say

272
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,400
there are clues in it?

273
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,680
I'm writing a novel.

274
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,840
It's not a lie.

275
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Actually,

276
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,040
I came here to talk to you about the fourth step of the novel.

277
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,520
After reading your novel,

278
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,760
I really want to know

279
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,640
what the ending is.

280
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,000
Meiyu.

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,800
That woman who disappeared

282
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,760
is she?

283
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,680
Did Mo Yan change her rule?

284
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,600
She took Meiyu to the forest with her?

285
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,640
That's not possible.

286
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,760
It's too obvious.

287
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,560
She's always the devil.

288
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,280
How can she change her rule so easily?

289
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,440
Yes.

290
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,760
So why would Meiyu fall in love with her?

291
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,720
Actually, do you know that?

292
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,240
I...

293
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,200
I actually like Meiyu very much.

294
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,800
So I've been sleeping for a long time.

295
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,600
But I still can't accept

296
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,280
that Meiyu fell in love with Mo Yan.

297
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I think

298
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,640
it's not my fault

299
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,200
to think so alone.

300
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,400
Do you know that?

301
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
The extent of being alone can bear

302
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,960
the fear

303
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,160
of being alone

304
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
is a fragile bottom line.

305
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,480
When someone

306
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,560
has taken over your life,

307
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,880
you don't know

308
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,480
how to entrust your life to him.

309
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,360
But after a long time,

310
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,800
you eat, drink,

311
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,560
and even breathe.

312
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,560
You think it's his kindness to you.

313
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,560
Finally, you're afraid of him.

314
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,760
I'm grateful for what I've done.

315
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,920
Finally, you're a burden.

316
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,760
This kind of love

317
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,720
is not something everyone can understand and support.

318
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,640
Sige,

319
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,680
is it really too cruel?

320
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,680
You're so cruel to Meiyu.

321
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,560
Everything

322
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,760
is a choice made for him.

323
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,920
And he's the worst.

324
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,280
I'm not like that.

325
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,280
Someone encouraged me

326
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,560
to go through the same pain

327
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,360
and avoid the problem.

328
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,680
I have to go out for a walk.

329
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,320
Go with me.

330
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,480
I've been saying

331
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,760
it's not appropriate

332
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,280
to wait until the right day.

333
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,520
But those are just excuses.

334
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
I just don't have the courage.

335
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,960
Maybe today

336
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,360
is the best day.

337
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,160
Okay, I got it.

338
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,360
The information I mentioned

339
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,560
can you find them?

340
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,680
Okay.

341
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,720
Send me the information you can find.

342
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Okay.

343
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,560
Captain Zhong.

344
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,120
Captain Zhong.

345
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,280
I've found the information

346
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,520
of the factory in the city of Linzhi.

347
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,920
I've got the information.

348
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,720
This owner is from the foreign country.

349
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
And he sold the phone number

350
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,720
of the country.

351
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,320
So we can't contact him for now.

352
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,920
But I found a suspect.

353
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,720
According to the information

354
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,040
of the owner,

355
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,240
he sold the house

356
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,320
half a year ago.

357
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,680
But he's been staying in the country.

358
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,440
It's not like what Lin Mengyu said.

359
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,760
Because the owner is abroad,

360
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,280
so he can't be a customer.

361
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,760
Okay, I got it.

362
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,240
Let's go.

363
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,120
Okay.

364
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Are you okay?

365
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
You're right.

366
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Mingyun always makes the choice for him.

367
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Mingyun.

368
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
He's more brave than we thought.

369
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Officer Yang.

370
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
You should be a brave person, too.

371
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Officer Yang.

372
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
Send me your email.

373
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
I really don't want to

374
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
use the third step in the picture.

375
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Since you want to know

376
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
the story behind it,

377
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
I'll send it to you.

378
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Okay.

379
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Sir.

380
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Yes.

381
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
You're back.

382
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
I got a bowl of kowtow.

383
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
It's so good.

384
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Here.

385
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Yan Jun.

386
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Zhong Weibao's household is fake.

387
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
His mother was in middle school.

388
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
She didn't graduate from high school.

389
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
But his father was a transfer.

390
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Because he had a family,

391
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
he couldn't marry Zhong Jie.

392
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,120
So they found a husband

393
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
without a child

394
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
in the town.

395
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
They helped him to get a family.

396
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Zhong Jie was a little girl

397
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
and he was a little grumpy.

398
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
He knew a lot of people,

399
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
so he found it easily.

400
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
So, what Xiaolou said is true.

401
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Yan Jun is Zhong Weibao's

402
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
brother in the same mother's house.

403
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Zhong Jie died a few years ago.

404
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
The nurse showed that

405
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
he had a son named Yan Jun.

406
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
His husband is Yan Yuwen.

407
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
I think it's the father-in-law

408
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
of Xiaolou.

409
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
The nurses

410
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
must have found a new clue.

411
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
I have a busy night.

412
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,120
I'll call my grandma.

413
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
No need.

414
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
You've been home for days.

415
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Go home early.

416
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Go to bed early.

417
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,120
I'm in a state of

418
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
bad luck.

419
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Why do you suddenly have this idea?

420
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
I really have no inspiration.

421
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I really can't write anything.

422
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
Xiaolou is a man

423
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
who doesn't dare to leave the house.

424
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
I don't want to be a writer

425
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
in the society.

426
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
You should give yourself more time

427
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
to think about it.

428
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
I'm not a writer.

429
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
I'm a writer.

430
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
I'm a writer.

431
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
I'm a writer.

432
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
I'm a writer.

433
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
I'm a writer.

434
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
I'm a writer.

435
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
I'm a writer.

436
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
I'm a writer.

437
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
I'm a writer.

438
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
I'm a writer.

439
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
I'm a writer.

440
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
I'm a writer.

441
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
I'm a writer.

442
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
I'm a writer.

443
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
I'm a writer.

444
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
I'm a writer.

445
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
You should give yourself more time.

446
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
I told you before

447
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
that

448
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
I still have someone

449
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
who can be like you.

450
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
He's very fragile.

451
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
He's very sensitive.

452
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
But he's good at

453
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
doing things

454
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
in his field.

455
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Who?

456
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
By the way,

457
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,920
It is somewhat第二波

458
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,600
If it changes,

459
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,640
Let's see

460
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
It todos

461
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,280
How to pay publishing

462
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,920
Let's try

463
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,680
Don't go.

464
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,840
I've found it.

465
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,800
Let's go in.

466
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,400
Mr. Chen?

467
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
I've found him.

468
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,960
Go.

469
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,080
Very clear.

470
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,400
Use it, here.

471
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,680
Excuse me.

472
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,000
Excuse me.

473
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,280
Can I ask you something?

474
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,400
What is this?

475
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
You don't care at all.

476
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,960
Just accept it and have a look at this.

477
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
It seems that

478
00:23:46,840 --> 00:24:10,480
there is unknown

479
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,680
Every time you a slave,

480
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,220
may a path be fun for him.

481
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,960
Any time you can,

482
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,460
single folks like Yin H mud

483
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,600
and trouble against each other.

484
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,720
When you have taken Messi's drug,

485
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,300
you will have to spend a lot

486
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,880
as she was only good for his marriage.

487
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,360
Ten thousand Darts

488
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
They are the most precious princesses.

489
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Today, they will become the bride of the Demon Lord.

490
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,360
The Demon Lord is satisfied with the scenery in front of him.

491
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,360
His face is full of spring breeze and the lake is full of snow.

492
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
His face is filled with gentle smiles.

493
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,360
The two are standing on a high hall.

494
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,360
They are like the most attractive people in the world.

495
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Go.

496
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
I understand what you said.

497
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,360
It feels like I was taken by fear.

498
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Why don't I tell you my story first?

499
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,360
My daughter and I used to be close.

500
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
We met each other.

501
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Her mother met a man.

502
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
That man was very bad.

503
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,360
But her mother thought that was love.

504
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
That man's arrival

505
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
made her a younger brother.

506
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
He was cute.

507
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,360
But her father always thought about them.

508
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
So in the process of time,

509
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,360
she found that her father was always watching her.

510
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,360
One day,

511
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,360
a girl in the water

512
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,360
found her father's clothes with her hand.

513
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,360
She didn't know when her father was sleeping next to her.

514
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,360
She was like a long-awaited nightmare.

515
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,360
She was afraid.

516
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,360
But she didn't dare to say anything.

517
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Things like this happen every day.

518
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
She looked at her mother.

519
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
But she never dared to tell anyone.

520
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
She knew that her mother loved her father.

521
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
She was afraid that her mother would hate herself.

522
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
As long as a girl is against her father,

523
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
she would torture her and her brother.

524
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Mr. Ji told her that

525
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
every child should love their father.

526
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
She was more and more afraid.

527
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
She didn't know when she started to believe

528
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
what this man said.

529
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
This thought made her feel bad.

530
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
She started to feel that everything was her fault.

531
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
You are a cruel person.

532
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
But I am a writer.

533
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Isn't there a twist in good stories?

534
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
Do you want to listen to my version?

535
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Or do you want to be more persuasive?

536
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,360
I don't understand what love is.

537
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
She looked at her mother being beaten up by Ji Fu.

538
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
She felt that

539
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
she didn't say anything.

540
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
As long as she kept listening to Ji Fu,

541
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
she wouldn't be sad.

542
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
Her brother wouldn't be hurt.

543
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
She didn't want to be hurt.

544
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
She didn't want to be hurt.

545
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
She didn't want to be hurt.

546
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,360
She only forced her to believe what Ji Fu said.

547
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,360
She could endure everything Ji Fu did to herself.

548
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
She could continue to live.

549
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
She was not handsome at all.

550
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
She was cursed.

551
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
She was lying.

552
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
This is not your fault.

553
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,360
It's her.

554
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,360
But that writer.

555
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
He is a criminal.

556
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
He is a criminal.

557
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
You have to believe me.

558
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
You will be punished.

559
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
You don't have to bear it.

560
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
You really don't have to bear it.

561
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,360
Brother.

562
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
Brother.

563
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Brother.

564
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
That woman.

565
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
She left the darkness.

566
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
She left the darkness again.

567
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Xiangyun State

568
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
finally has a new king.

569
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
