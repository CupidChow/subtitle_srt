2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,520
We will watch the top of the executives.

3
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,560
I know I can't handle you tea.

4
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,440
I will accept any responsibility.

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
Mei Bao!

7
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Mei Bao!

8
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Mei Bao!

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,440
The End

10
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Xiangyun Empire

11
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,440
was a famous pearl in the fairy world.

12
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,640
It's located in Kunyun Mountain.

13
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Although it's small,

14
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,440
it has a beautiful scenery

15
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
around Xiangyun.

16
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,400
The Qin Dynasty was also the first

17
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,640
to be respected by the Heavenly Lord.

18
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,440
The country that was sold in the year

19
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,040
was gradually taken by the Xiangyun Empire

20
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,440
to the fairy world.

21
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,240
It was only because the country left a pair of twins.

22
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,440
They were born together.

23
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,040
And these two children

24
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,480
still have the most respected

25
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,040
silver eyes in the fairy world.

26
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
But no one has ever thought that

27
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,640
these beautiful eyes

28
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,640
were the most evil devil.

29
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,640
The End

30
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,440
The most respected princess of Xiangyun Empire

31
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,040
and the emperor of the city of Juncheng

32
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,040
grew up in the beautiful Kunyun Mountain.

33
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,040
I caught you!

34
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,640
Jinchen, I'll teach you to go back.

35
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,440
It was closed in the dark circle

36
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,040
and 500 people were killed.

37
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
Finally, the wind blew out.

38
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,840
He grew up again.

39
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
The evil devil was in chaos.

40
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,840
The Xiangyun Empire that lost its protection

41
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,640
was destined to be able to escape this trap.

42
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
The Demon Lord has found us.

43
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,040
Mother, save us!

44
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Let go of us!

45
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,640
Feiyan, Jinchen!

46
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,840
Let me have a look.

47
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,040
What a beautiful eyes.

48
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
You are the princess of the beauty.

49
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,640
Comrade, this is the most evil devil

50
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,440
in the fairy world.

51
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,240
Mother, you said you loved me.

52
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,840
Please let her go.

53
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
They are just children.

54
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,240
I love you.

55
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,640
But you have low blood pressure.

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,640
You have been abandoning me all along.

57
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,640
I will wait for her to grow up

58
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,640
and become my queen.

59
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
I will make you

60
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,640
the most righteous blood and glory

61
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,040
in my country.

62
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,040
Let her be the most precious heir

63
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,640
to the Demon Realm.

64
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,640
Xiu Xiao, you evil devil!

65
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,640
The precious princess

66
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,640
will marry me perfectly.

67
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,440
Don't you hear?

68
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
It's okay.

69
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,840
Jinchen, Feiyan!

70
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,840
Mother, please let go of them.

71
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,840
Let me do anything.

72
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,440
Please let go of them.

73
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,040
Mother, please let go of them.

74
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,040
Please let go of them.

75
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Zhu Xiao!

76
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,440
I will listen to you.

77
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,040
I will be your queen.

78
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,040
Let go of Jinchen.

79
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,440
What are you looking at?

80
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,840
What are you doing, master?

81
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,040
You scared me to death.

82
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
You didn't agree to it.

83
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,240
You should have been a devil.

84
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
I can't do anything.

85
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,440
This Wumin Moon is so mysterious.

86
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,640
She doesn't go out and has no friends.

87
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,040
Before we take her in,

88
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,640
I need to know her.

89
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,040
I can think of a way

90
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,640
to know her best.

91
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,640
What did you see?

92
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
I just started to see her.

93
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,840
But I feel like

94
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
I'm almost like a normal student.

95
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
In a space of a dormitory,

96
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
there are six gods, demons and demons.

97
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,040
A fairy was sealed

98
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
by the Demon King for hundreds of years

99
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,240
and gained freedom.

100
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Okay, okay.

101
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
I'm not interested in the story.

102
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
What's the point?

103
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
The point...

104
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,240
I haven't seen the point.

105
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,440
I told you I just started to see her.

106
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,640
Master, do you know

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,040
that this novel is very popular now?

108
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,440
Although it only came out in the second part,

109
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,640
it will soon be released into a TV series.

110
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,840
It's said that now,

111
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,040
the current few little flowers

112
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,840
are taking the lead of this series

113
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,240
and taking the lead of the first snow.

114
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Everyone is looking forward to the third part of the play.

115
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,640
It should have been a TV show last month,

116
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
but it's not out yet.

117
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
Xiao Yu, are you on the way?

118
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,840
I know this novel.

119
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
Many girls are watching it.

120
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,040
You're a kid. Don't be so picky.

121
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
You should go to the school.

122
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,840
I'll be there in time.

123
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
I know.

124
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
I'll go to the school. I'll be there soon.

125
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,240
Master, what are you doing?

126
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Respect others' privacy, okay?

127
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,040
What privacy and respect do kids have?

128
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,840
Besides,

129
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,440
didn't you hear the case of the person next door?

130
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,240
There are too many people here.

131
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,640
They're all for the sake of the girl.

132
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,240
I'm doing this for her.

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,040
Look, look.

134
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,840
What kind of people are they?

135
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,040
Look at this.

136
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,240
It's the little fool of the nightclub.

137
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,440
Master,

138
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,440
this is a popular Internet celebrity recently, okay?

139
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
What are you talking about?

140
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,640
Look, are you in a relationship?

141
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
It's quite normal here.

142
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,440
It's normal?

143
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
It's not normal.

144
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Let me see.

145
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
What are you doing?

146
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
You're annoying.

147
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,640
Kid.

148
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Why aren't you going to class?

149
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,840
Hurry up. Don't be late.

150
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,440
Sis, let's add a WeChat.

151
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,040
If Zhong Jing Guo bullies you,

152
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,840
tell me.

153
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,240
I'll teach him.

154
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
Okay.

155
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
I didn't bully him.

156
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,840
Okay.

157
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm leaving.

158
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,440
Bye-bye.

159
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Who? Who? Who?

160
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,240
Be careful on the way.

161
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,240
He's been kicked out.

162
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
We just talked about it.

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,640
About Wu Ming Yue.

164
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Wu Ming Yue wrote this third novel.

165
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,040
I was wondering if Zhong Mei Bao's death

166
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,640
would have affected him.

167
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,440
That's possible.

168
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,040
And according to Lin Nassin,

169
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,240
he and Zhong Mei Bao

170
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,840
have a key to each other's home.

171
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,040
This relationship is definitely not normal.

172
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,240
Instead of guessing,

173
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,640
why don't we go to him and see him?

174
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,840
But I saw on the Internet that he seems to have some psychological problems.

175
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,240
He never goes out.

176
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,440
If I think he goes out,

177
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,440
I think it's a bit difficult.

178
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,040
Thank you.

179
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,440
Thank you.

180
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,640
Miss Wu,

181
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,840
there was a murder case next to you.

182
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
You should know it.

183
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,440
We came here today

184
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
to learn about

185
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,440
the situation of Zhong Mei Bao's death.

186
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,440
According to our investigation,

187
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,240
you seem to be familiar with

188
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,040
the key to each other's home.

189
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,640
Is that right?

190
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,840
You have the key to each other's home.

191
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,040
That means you are good friends.

192
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Right?

193
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,240
That's just your guess.

194
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,240
Then how do you know Zhong Mei Bao?

195
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,440
You may not be able to see it.

196
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,240
Actually, I have some problems with my mind.

197
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,440
At that time, I was at home.

198
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,840
The weather was drier.

199
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,040
I...

200
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
I...

201
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,840
You are bleeding.

202
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,440
At that time, my situation was not good.

203
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,040
Miss Wu, are you okay?

204
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Sit down.

205
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Sit down.

206
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,840
I'm here.

207
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,040
I'm not going out.

208
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,240
I'm not going out.

209
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,040
I'm not going out.

210
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,440
Auntie, there's no way.

211
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,840
I'm going to the neighbor's home.

212
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,440
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

213
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,640
So Zhong Mei Bao is going out at this time?

214
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,240
Yes.

215
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,640
Then what kind of person is Zhong Mei Bao?

216
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,040
A good person.

217
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,240
As a writer,

218
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,640
using such a word to describe someone

219
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,840
is it a little too simple?

220
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,240
Can you use your rich vocabulary

221
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,640
to describe us?

222
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,440
Do you want to do it?

223
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,640
Relax.

224
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,240
Relax.

225
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
In my old novels,

226
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,840
I would also have a good description.

227
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,640
The skin of the elephant's teeth,

228
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,640
the soft and smooth double lip,

229
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,440
under the long and dense eyelashes,

230
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,640
is a gentle and clean eye.

231
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,040
I always thought that such a person

232
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,640
was only in the novel.

233
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,240
Mei Bao

234
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,440
is such a good person.

235
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,640
Is this the level of harmony between the two?

236
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,040
She seems to be very experienced in this kind of situation.

237
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Mei Bao told me

238
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,240
that she had a family that had similar circumstances with me.

239
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,240
So I thought of looking for her to help.

240
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,640
She and your aunt are very close.

241
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,440
We hired an aunt.

242
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,440
That's all? You're not even a friend?

243
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,640
I won't call her my friend.

244
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,840
Our relationship is more special.

245
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,040
What's special?

246
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,240
I can't stand it.

247
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,440
Miss Wu,

248
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,640
no matter how you and Zhou Wei Bao's relationship

249
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,840
should be determined.

250
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,440
But what I heard from you just now,

251
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,040
I can feel that

252
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,240
she has given you a lot of comfort in her heart.

253
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,040
She has given you a lot of comfort in her heart.

254
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,640
She even relied on her.

255
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,440
She is such a good person.

256
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,040
She has faced such a cruel ending.

257
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,440
Don't you want to let Zhen Xiong know the truth?

258
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,240
It's not that easy.

259
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,640
So you must know something.

260
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,040
Or you just want to know the result.

261
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,640
How is that possible?

262
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,040
Then why did you hide it?

263
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,440
Miss Wu, do you know about the Du Lu Men's Carport?

264
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,840
What? What's special?

265
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,240
You mean the writer of the cold blood?

266
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,840
Do you know the crime behind this book?

267
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,640
I didn't expect that as a police officer,

268
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,240
I didn't know about these classic crime cases.

269
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,840
In 1959,

270
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,240
a farm owner of a country

271
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,240
was killed in a car accident

272
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
in the United States.

273
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
The murderer was found very soon.

274
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,240
This murderer caught the attention of Carport.

275
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Because he found that

276
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
he and his partner had a similar encounter.

277
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,240
Carport spent six years to investigate this case.

278
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,240
He eventually became the most famous person in the world.

279
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,240
The murderer was under pressure and neglect.

280
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
He was in a very complicated situation.

281
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
He gave Carport a lot of inspiration.

282
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
So the cold blood he created

283
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,240
became the most successful representative.

284
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
After the execution of the case,

285
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Carport couldn't write such a wonderful text.

286
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Cold blood became the last piece of the novel.

287
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Miss Wu, do you want to say

288
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,240
that your novel has something to do with this case?

289
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Is it related to this case?

290
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Are you trying to give your inspiration

291
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
to Zhong Mei Bao in the dark?

292
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
I didn't say that.

293
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
I just think

294
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
the way to the hospital

295
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
should be my last work.

296
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
The patient with a concussion

297
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
will think of the dangers of various places

298
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
when he is in a strange environment.

299
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
It's dangerous.

300
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
It also causes anxiety and panic.

301
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
It's easy to say that he doesn't dare to go out.

302
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
But according to this information from Wu Ming Yue,

303
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
his situation is much more complicated than this.

304
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Do you think the building is closed?

305
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
How do you feel that every resident

306
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
is not a normal person?

307
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,240
Master, what does he mean by what he said today?

308
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
He said a lot.

309
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,240
But he's too much of a use to us.

310
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Is his novel

311
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
related to our case?

312
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
I've already mentioned this before.

313
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Some people will lie

314
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
and they will lie to themselves.

315
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Wu Ming Yue is so special.

316
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
He's a writer.

317
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
But some things are true.

318
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Some things are imagined.

319
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
We can't make a conclusion at once.

320
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
I'm not sure about anything else.

321
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Anyway, I'm more interested in

322
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
this director auntie now.

323
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
But the application is not approved for now.

324
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
If we want to interrogate her,

325
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
we have to think of another way.

326
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
I'll call you later.

327
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
I'll be late.

328
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Hang up.

329
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Okay, you can get off work.

330
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Okay.

331
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,240
After you finish reading the two novels,

332
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
write me a report tomorrow.

333
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
I'll finish reading them all tonight.

334
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
You said it.

335
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
This is the only way to understand Wu Ming Yue.

336
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
I'm very familiar with this point.

337
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
I can't read such novels.

338
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Give me two books.

339
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
After all,

340
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,240
I've never read any of the characters.

341
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,240
I'll go back to the show.

342
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,240
You shall not pass.

343
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,240
The demon king who has been blessed with a beautiful day

344
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,240
has become more and more evil.

345
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
He is more and more evil.

346
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
He is more and more mature.

347
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,420
The beauty於就不顧你的造物主

348
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,200
is so evil and she is bound to hire you.

349
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,240
You've dominated other's beauty and exorcism

350
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,240
through a velocity they have established

351
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
with others.

352
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Princess,

353
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,360
This is the treasure of the Zheng State of Canglan.

354
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,080
The Demon Lord has spent three days in the blood war for him.

355
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,240
He also lost a guardian beast.

356
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Look at how good the Demon Lord is to you.

357
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,160
No matter what the Demon Lord does,

358
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,560
he can't see the beautiful smile.

359
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,880
He finally lost his patience.

360
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Let me taste the most precious blood in the world.

361
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,440
What kind of death is it?

362
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,440
You, you, come over here.

363
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Let me go.

364
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Where are you going?

365
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Let me go. What have you done to my brother?

366
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,840
Aren't you the guest who hates to see me?

367
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Then let him go and see him.

368
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,440
You bastard. Let me go.

369
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,840
It seems that I treat you so well.

370
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,840
After that day,

371
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,440
Meiyu never saw the Demon Lord again.

372
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,840
Meiyu was sent out of the Xiangyun State.

373
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
He crossed the mountains and rivers

374
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,440
and was buried in the Soul Valley with a group of criminals.

375
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,040
He was buried in the Soul Valley in the end of the world.

376
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,440
He was the first to use the world to punish criminals.

377
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,640
Now, the Demon Lord has sent all the people

378
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
from his own place here.

379
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,440
Since childhood, he has lived in the beauty of the palace in Huali.

380
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,440
This time, he really entered the hell.

381
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,040
The criminals in the Soul Valley were imprisoned

382
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,920
every day and night to make the soldiers of the Demon Lord

383
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
build weapons.

384
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,920
They will be killed if they are a little bit more.

385
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Don't shoot. Hurry up.

386
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Many people lost their lives in the black and fake iron field.

387
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Meiyu was desperate.

388
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,920
He was able to press the heavy stone on his back.

389
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,920
His body was already in a state of emergency.

390
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,920
He couldn't hold on any longer.

391
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
What useless thing!

392
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,920
The pain he was expecting didn't come.

393
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
A soulmate helped him to press this side.

394
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Thank you.

395
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
I'm looking for death.

396
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Meiyu was worried about the injured soulmate.

397
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,920
He followed him all the way to a dead end.

398
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,920
There was a broken bone of the body.

399
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,920
His injuries were even more serious.

400
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,920
Meiyu came to the herb store to treat them.

401
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,920
He shared his food with them.

402
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Under his mental treatment,

403
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,920
two demons recovered.

404
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Meiyu was with the spirit and the immortal.

405
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,920
He spent a long time here.

406
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Rui San.

407
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Rui San.

408
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
Rui San.

409
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
Coming.

410
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
What are you doing?

411
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Why are you here?

412
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
The movie is on the set.

413
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Don't be angry.

414
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
I'll finish reading it.

415
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
I'll report it tomorrow.

416
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
You're busy.

417
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
The criminals are waiting for you.

418
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,920
Do you know how hard it is to get tickets for this movie?

419
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,920
I don't think you've seen it.

420
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
What do you know?

421
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,920
I've watched the original movie ten times.

422
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Although it's a magic movie,

423
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,920
it's changed according to the real story.

424
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,920
The author's parents were locked in a toilet.

425
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,660
The most concentrated person was the

426
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:52,920
ghost.

427
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
So the story that happened to the director

428
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
was based on his parents' real experience.

429
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Don't you see that there are

430
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
spirits and human beings inside?

431
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
They're all real people.

432
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
What did you say?

433
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,920
The spirits and human beings are all shadows.

434
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
They're real people.

435
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
I'm so excited.

436
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Don't.

437
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Wait for me.

438
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
I'll call him.

439
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
I'll call him.

440
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Hello, master.

441
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
Master.

442
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Is there a brother in the book?

443
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
I think I know what's going on.

444
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
Okay, okay.

445
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
I'll be right back.

446
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Be safe.

447
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Master.

448
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Master.

449
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Master.

450
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
What are you thinking about?

451
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Master.

452
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Wu Mingyue wrote this novel about

453
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
the ghost and human beings.

454
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
It's the story of Zhong Mei Bao.

455
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,920
She's like a inspiration

456
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
from the story of Kabot.

457
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
The story of Zhong Mei Bao

458
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
doesn't show any of her brothers and sisters.

459
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
But according to

460
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,920
Xie Baoruo and Lin Daqin's confession,

461
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
she has a younger brother named Jun.

462
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
In this story,

463
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
there's a younger brother named Jun Chen.

464
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
I didn't understand the story

465
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
at first.

466
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
But if she's the one who's been

467
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
hiding the two of them,

468
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
it's easy to understand.

469
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Then the two of them

470
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
must be close to

471
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Zhong Mei Bao.

472
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
You just finished reading the first part.

473
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
You kept reading it.

474
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
And then you found the answer.

475
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
But I think

476
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
the most important part

477
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,920
should be in the third part.

478
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,920
When can we see the third part?

479
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Here.

480
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
What's that?

481
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
When we saw

482
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
the Wuming Moon,

483
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
I kept thinking

484
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
it seems that the witness

485
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
mentioned this to us.

486
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
This is what we found

487
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
in the flower garden in the Anfa District.

488
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Could it be

489
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
the third part?

490
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Why did you write such a paper?

491
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
There's a lot of meaning

492
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
in writing such a paper.

493
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
You should study it more.

494
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Study it.

495
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
I'm leaving.

496
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
I met a psychologist.

497
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
He told me

498
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
that this paper can be used

499
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
to relieve anxiety.

500
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Try it.

501
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
I think this pen is quite big.

502
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Look.

503
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
A novelist.

504
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Don't use his sister's novel.

505
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Now,

506
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
the writer uses computers.

507
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Who else uses pens?

508
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
It seems that it has a little effect.

509
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
I'm sorry.

510
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
I'm sorry.

511
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
I'm sorry.

512
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
I'm sorry.

513
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
I'm sorry.

514
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
Li Yan.

515
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Can you tell me

516
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,920
how you became like this?

517
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
It's okay.

518
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
If you don't want to say it,

519
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
you don't say it.

520
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
I won't force you.

521
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,920
I'm a very curious person.

522
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
I like running around,

523
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
traveling around.

524
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Because I think that

525
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
meeting different people,

526
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
meeting different things,

527
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
can bring me different emotions.

528
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
But my fiancee and my husband are the same.

529
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
He likes to stay at home,

530
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
to get a computer,

531
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
to play games.

532
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
Anyway, it's not a big deal.

533
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
I'm not a big fan of you.

534
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
I'm just a fan of you.

535
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
I'm not a fan of you.

536
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Anyway, it's not a big deal.

537
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
You're back.

538
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
I've been back for a long time.

539
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
What are you doing?

540
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
He always has a lot of weird concerns.

541
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
He's a pilot.

542
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
But he's afraid of falling down.

543
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
He's afraid of falling down on the road,

544
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
and afraid of being pushed to death.

545
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,920
I used to be a little bit

546
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
over the age of a person.

547
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Because I think that

548
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
he's just a coward.

549
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,920
I forced him to go on that trip.

550
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
I was on the car,

551
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
and he didn't see me.

552
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
I'll tell you everything.

553
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
What about you?

554
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
I thought about it carefully.

555
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
How about I go or not?

556
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
Why? You promised me

557
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
that you'd go on a trip with me

558
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
once a year.

559
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
It's really dangerous to be a pilot.

560
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
You don't have to go.

561
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,920
Flying is the safest communication tool.

562
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
You're just a good speaker.

563
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,920
I only knew that time.

564
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
How brave he was for me.

565
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Okay, I'll go.

566
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Then you should talk to him.

567
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
That's all for today.

568
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Okay.

569
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

570
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:41,960
LTC

571
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,180
Do not talk.

572
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,560
How many times have I had the chance to meet the flying bird

573
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
in my life?

574
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,360
How many times have I had the chance to be bitten by a fart on the road?

575
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,680
How many times have I had the chance to meet a person

576
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,280
who is so innocent and kill people?

577
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,720
Later, I became like a fiancée.

578
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,520
I was afraid of being reborn.

579
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,520
I was afraid of seeing the human being.

580
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,680
In my head,

581
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,680
I can always be in fear of his face.

582
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,560
It's all over.

583
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,560
It won't happen again.

584
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,280
But I think you can't stay at home.

585
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,280
You can't avoid the problem.

586
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Everyone is facing the pain.

587
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
Come with me.

588
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,680
Let's change the weather.

589
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,680
One day.

590
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
I don't know.

591
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,280
It's not suitable for today.

592
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,680
Maybe today is the most suitable day.

593
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,280
I told you I won't go out.

594
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Believe me.

595
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,880
No matter what happens,

596
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,280
I will be by your side.

597
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,480
I will be with you.

598
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,480
Come with me.

599
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
You are with me.

600
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,880
You are so relaxed.

601
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
Have you ever seen someone die in front of you?

602
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,880
Do you know?

603
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,880
I just left this house.

604
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,680
I will feel that I will also face the same thing.

605
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,880
I can't breathe at all.

606
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Do you know what it feels like to be surrounded by fear?

607
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,040
Do you want to hear my story?

608
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,440
Maybe I can't imagine something

609
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,640
that I can't imagine.

610
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,040
I am also working hard.

611
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
I understand what you are talking about.

612
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,640
It feels like being surrounded by fear.

613
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,640
But I have to say something first.

614
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,240
If you are interested,

615
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,240
if you can understand me,

616
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,840
just take a step back.

617
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,440
I am not afraid of you.

618
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,640
I am not afraid of you.

619
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,040
I am not afraid of you.

620
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,440
I am not afraid of you.

621
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,040
I am not afraid of you.

622
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,440
I am not afraid of you.

623
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,040
I am not afraid of you.

624
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,640
I am not afraid of you.

625
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,240
I am not afraid of you.

626
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,040
I am not afraid of you.

627
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,640
I am not afraid of you.

628
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
I am not afraid of you.

629
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
I am not afraid of you.

630
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
I am not afraid of you.

631
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
I am not afraid of you.

632
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
I am not afraid of you.

633
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
I am not afraid of you.

634
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,400
I am not afraid of you.

635
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
You and I

636
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
And I know

637
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,640
Wherever I will go

638
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,640
You are the only one

639
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,640
I will go anywhere I know

640
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,640
Wherever I will go

641
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:03,640
You are the only one

642
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,640
I will go anywhere I know

643
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,640
Wherever I will go

644
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,640
You are the only one

645
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,640
I will go anywhere I know

646
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
You carry your load

647
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,640
Wherever you go this time I know

648
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,720
We're the Auschwahl

649
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
I'm sorry.

650
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
I'm sorry.

651
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
I'm sorry.

652
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
I'm sorry.

653
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
I'm sorry.

654
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
I'm sorry.

655
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
I'm sorry.

656
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
I'm sorry.

658
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
I'm sorry.

659
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
I'm sorry.

660
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
I'm sorry.

661
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
I'm sorry.

662
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
I'm sorry.
