Episode 19

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,140
Doctor Xie

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,040
The Wavering Lion

5
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,260
Inila with the fractured head

6
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,920
Today's最初

7
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,640
Okay.

8
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,600
Are you used to

9
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,840
calling us Ye Meili

10
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,880
as your wife?

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,320
Or Li Guilan?

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,200
Ye Meili.

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,600
When did you

14
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,760
get to know Mr. Zhong Bei?

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,080
About ten years ago.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,840
I just graduated from the medical school.

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,800
I was sent to the Heart and Dragon County Hospital.

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
I was there for a test.

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,840
Dr. Li, I'll take care of this.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,560
There's a patient waiting for you.

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,280
Okay.

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,060
Wifey As

23
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,040
How did you get in?

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,760
You were injured.

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,800
Fix theaged hand.

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
And the Mohammad kidney.

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,600
The period cannot be content.

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,720
All thestanding on my face was fallen.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,760
My mother beat me.

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,880
Don't worry.

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,160
I can solve it.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,640
Go tell me the result.

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,680
It doesn't look good to you.

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Xiaoyu, take care of it.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Doctor,

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,680
I just need to take a break from the wound.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
You don't have to do the skin care.

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Just take it directly.

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
It's very professional.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
You often come here.

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Take a break from it.

42
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
I'll go out and take a break.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Take a breath.

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Why is the book so painful?

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
It's not published on the Internet, right?

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
The child is also interested in this story.

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
I'm not a child.

48
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,680
The book p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p

49
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Doctor,

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,680
can I ask you a question?

51
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
What question?

52
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,400
What's wrong?

53
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,720
After the wedding,

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
how about the man and the woman?

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,240
Do you still have any idea?

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,600
Just let the adults know.

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,880
Next time your dad hits your mom,

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,040
you'll be in trouble.

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,160
He's not my dad.

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,080
Wei Bao,

61
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm leaving.

62
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,680
Thank you.

63
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,520
For a doctor who has been treated for a few hours,

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,160
there are two situations that will make things difficult.

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,440
One is that the doctor is too much.

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,800
We'll ask

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,200
whether we should report to the police in time.

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,880
Most of the doctors

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
won't be charged

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,840
because of the detention or the penalty.

71
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,600
Instead, they'll be afraid of coming to the hospital

72
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,880
because of our report.

73
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,000
They'll miss the best time

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
and lose their lives.

75
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,520
Another one is the victim of the report.

76
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,480
We'll also ask

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,640
whether we should let the police report in time.

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,120
It's hard to make a decision.

79
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,760
Many people think

80
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,560
this is a family matter.

81
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,240
But it's actually already a law.

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,160
Sometimes,

83
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,160
we think we're standing on the side of the victim.

84
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,600
But they think

85
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,960
we're doing something else.

86
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,960
Who's the doctor tonight?

87
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,200
Your dad.

88
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,400
Another doctor.

89
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,200
You're so nice.

90
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,960
I'll bring you some food and drinks.

91
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,160
Such a clear idea.

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,160
Doctor Li.

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,800
Dr. Li.

94
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,320
Did you find the third patient?

95
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,080
Yes.

96
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,280
Here you are.

97
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,720
You said the director is so clear.

98
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,280
He's new here.

99
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,560
I think

100
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,080
it's because we're in the classroom

101
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,000
and other doctors are not married.

102
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
He's the only one who's too young.

103
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,600
He's busy with his career.

104
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,560
He can't arrange for him.

105
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,520
Who will he arrange?

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
It's a pity.

107
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,080
No one is here.

108
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,640
No one is here.

109
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,120
I've said

110
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,080
I don't need to come to the hospital.

111
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,200
No one is here.

112
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,480
I really don't.

113
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,480
What's the wound on you?

114
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,160
It's not...

115
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,360
It's not a wound.

116
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm fine.

117
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,320
No. Be honest.

118
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,480
Be honest.

119
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,200
Tell the doctor later.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
What's going on?

121
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
It's a fight.

122
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,880
Open an autopsy list for us later.

123
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,000
We'll take him away.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,480
Go.

125
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
Jiang Xiao, no.

126
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,360
Jiang Xiao, he's my husband.

127
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
You're so bad.

128
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,880
No one is here to hit me.

129
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,320
I... I...

130
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,520
I just fell.

131
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,800
I promise not.

132
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,040
I did fall.

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,600
I really fell.

134
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,720
Are you sure?

135
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,160
Are you sure?

136
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,080
Fine.

137
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,080
Let's go.

138
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,200
You...

139
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,920
Give me a break.

140
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,520
What are you doing?

141
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,120
What are you doing?

142
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,040
What are you doing?

143
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,680
Calm down.

144
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
What are you doing?

145
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,480
Calm down.

146
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,200
Calm down.

147
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
You're going to hit me.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,080
You're not my daughter.

149
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,920
What are you doing?

150
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,240
Calm down.

151
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,160
I got hurt.

152
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,800
It's all because of him.

153
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,000
What are you talking about?

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,600
What else do you want to say?

155
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,360
Tell us.

156
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,840
Go.

157
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,320
No.

158
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,480
I didn't.

159
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,040
Don't run.

160
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,840
Don't run.

161
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,160
Don't run.

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,160
Don't run.

163
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm going to get caught.

164
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,960
Don't run.

165
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,680
I...

166
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,440
I...

167
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,720
You left me like that

168
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,240
when you were drinking,

169
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,120
and set an導 company for latent words.

170
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
I have something to say.

171
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,600
I want to thank you.

172
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,560
For what?

173
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,640
If the police didn't come today,

174
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,960
I would be killed.

175
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,880
Where?

176
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,580
Your previous life is in prison?

177
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,600
Stay here.

178
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,720
Sure

179
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,300
Your Baby

180
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,520
OK.

181
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
I'm going to leave now.

182
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,040
At that moment,

183
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,800
I thinkAD Graduate...

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,200
doesn't look so helpless,

185
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,260
even if she wanted to.

186
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,660
And from that day on,

187
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,300
He can't open it until the time is up.

188
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,100
No.

189
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,220
I really have to go back to my hometown.

190
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,940
I'll open it.

191
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,620
What if there's no box?

192
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,180
I have a plan.

193
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,180
I'll tell you when you get back.

194
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,580
I have a plan.

195
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,620
My hometown is going to be demolished.

196
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,580
I'll tell the public that I have to split the house.

197
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,260
I have to go back quickly.

198
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,740
I'll do the emergency investigation in a few days.

199
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,260
Okay.

200
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,820
Take a look at it.

201
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,300
Don't move.

202
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,460
I want to take my household dog back.

203
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,580
Maybe...

204
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,340
Maybe he can really give me a house.

205
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
It looks okay.

206
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,460
I can open it.

207
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,100
Thank you. Come here.

208
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,940
You go back alone this time?

209
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,700
No.

210
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,980
With my husband.

211
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,700
You two are still together?

212
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,820
Actually, he apologized to me

213
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,340
when he went back that day.

214
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,540
And he never fought me

215
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,820
that day.

216
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,500
He never fought with the child.

217
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,300
I think he really did it.

218
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
You two are gone.

219
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,700
What about the child?

220
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,660
It's okay.

221
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,500
I'll go back one night.

222
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,740
I'll be back the next day.

223
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,140
How about this?

224
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,460
Send them to me one night.

225
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,380
Where?

226
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,100
Will it be too troublesome for you?

227
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,940
I'll rest tomorrow.

228
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,260
There's nothing else.

229
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,860
Come here.

230
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,660
What do you mean?

231
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,380
Sit down.

232
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,900
Come here.

233
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,020
It's interesting.

234
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,860
Don't move.

235
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,940
Who told me to do this?

236
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,260
Dr. Li,

237
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,500
do you think

238
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,500
you're a little bit worried about this?

239
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,780
Are you worried?

240
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,620
What?

241
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,020
I'm worried about his disappearance.

242
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,460
So many parents

243
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,780
left the child to others

244
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
and didn't come back.

245
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,620
You don't think so?

246
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,460
How can you abandon your child?

247
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,380
Bro.

248
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,900
First, give us back the gold needle.

249
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,420
First, give us the gold needle.

250
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,580
You mean the bricks?

251
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,300
Yes.

252
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,700
Currently, I am working with a military breeze.

253
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,300
But you don't seem

254
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,440
towards the court,

255
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,360
Who refused to expect this?

256
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,600
Luckily,

257
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,660
you're one of the three very respected SCATs.

258
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,540
Our scouts prepared multi-family proposals and

259
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,320
paid the prices last time there were很有 currencies.

260
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,500
The main reason is due to the people who refused to accept the suitcase.

261
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,940
You are telling them,

262
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,060
exactly according to my proposal,

263
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,240
that you and Professor�シー

264
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Yes, Ajun has been using

265
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
the cymbal chain since he was a child.

266
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Yes, sister gave me

267
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
such a big piano.

268
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Ajun is amazing.

269
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
He can play all my songs.

270
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Ajun, you are so talented.

271
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
Do you want to make a good career in the future?

272
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
In the future, you will be a pianoist.

273
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Did mom say anything?

274
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,240
She doesn't seem to care about it.

275
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Then, do you have any suggestions?

276
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
I think she should find a teacher now.

277
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Then, she will be a music student in the future.

278
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
The double music school is great.

279
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
You can go to the music school.

280
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
There are many good schools there.

281
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
You can study there.

282
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Great.

283
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,240
My wish is to be a pianoist.

284
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Right?

285
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
What about the music school?

286
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
If Ajun becomes a pianoist,

287
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
I will be happy too.

288
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
What about yourself?

289
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
I think everyone

290
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
will grow up

291
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
and live their own lives.

292
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
So,

293
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
I will think about it.

294
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Hello.

295
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Did Zhong Jie come back to work?

296
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
No.

297
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
I have been practicing.

298
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
The radio is almost off.

299
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
I don't know if he will come back.

300
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Okay, thank you.

301
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Mei Bao.

302
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Let's go.

303
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Let's find a place to stay.

304
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
I will go out.

305
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Okay.

306
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Let's go home.

307
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
How is sister?

308
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Mei Bao.

309
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Do you want to drink water?

310
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Did you finish your homework?

311
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Dr. Mei.

312
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
It's been five days.

313
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
You haven't been on the stage.

314
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
What if he doesn't come back?

315
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
I told you that I have seen a lot of women.

316
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
If you continue like this,

317
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
you will be dragged into the hospital.

318
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Maybe something happened at home.

319
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
Wait a few more days.

320
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Okay.

321
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
I want to ask you,

322
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
can I give a name to the child?

323
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
I will take the child with me next weekend.

324
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Thank you.

325
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Thank you.

326
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Ajun.

327
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
I have a name for you.

328
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Next weekend,

329
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
you can go to the piano class.

330
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
I have a teacher who will teach you.

331
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
He must be a criminal.

332
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
What's wrong?

333
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
Is the food I cooked not delicious?

334
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Is it salty?

335
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,240
My mom is not.

336
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
She doesn't want us.

337
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
How is that possible?

338
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Mom can't come back.

339
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
She will be home in a few days.

340
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Don't worry.

341
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Actually, my mom

342
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,240
used to be a little dirty for two days.

343
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
But it's almost two weeks.

344
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
You eat first.

345
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
You won't come back?

346
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
We have found

347
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
all the relevant information

348
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
of this middle-aged lady.

349
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
We will contact the local office as soon as possible

350
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
to investigate together.

351
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
It's troublesome for you.

352
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
As for the problem of

353
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,240
the private adoption of children,

354
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
this is not suitable for the adoption of legal procedures.

355
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Because the brother is not fully 14 years old,

356
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
you must send him to the local

357
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
public authorities'

358
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
social welfare center.

359
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
They will make sure

360
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
that the family with the capital

361
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
is adopted.

362
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
My sister is already over 14 years old.

363
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
So it's not possible.

364
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
You mean

365
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
they might be separated

366
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
by the two sisters?

367
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
What can they do

368
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
to be together?

369
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Unless the family with the brother

370
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
is willing to take care of my sister forever.

371
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
But from the experience,

372
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
very few people are willing

373
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
to take care of the older children.

374
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
What else do you have?

375
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Nothing for now.

376
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Thank you.

377
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Okay.

378
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
This is the end of the story.

379
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
You've done

380
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
everything you should do.

381
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
Now it's the end of the story.

382
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Yes.

383
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Don't go back to the house

384
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
about the later matters.

385
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Yes.

386
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Don't go back to the house.

387
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
The other half

388
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
is my stupidity.

389
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
I'll just do it.

390
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
You guys go first.

391
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
I'll be back soon.

392
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
Okay.

393
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
Hello, is it the Children's Service?

394
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Is it the Children's Service?

395
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Hello, my name is Li Guilan.

396
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
There are two children here.

397
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
They are my friends.

398
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,240
I want to ask them about the children's nutrition.

399
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Actually, I've contacted

400
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
the Children's Service at that time.

401
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
The next day,

402
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
they came home to take care of the children.

403
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
At that moment,

404
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
I suddenly felt

405
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
a strange panic.

406
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Then I realized

407
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
that I can't save those two children.

408
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Weibo,

409
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
you two haven't slept yet.

410
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
I have something to discuss with you two.

411
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
I'll open the door.

412
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Where are we going?

413
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Weibo,

414
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
why did you leave me?

415
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Don't run.

416
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Where are you going?

417
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
I asked you.

418
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Your mother is back.

419
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
How can I explain to her?

420
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
Why won't she come back?

421
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
Weibo,

422
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
please believe me.

423
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
You and Jun

424
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,240
are very, very important to your mother.

425
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
But she hasn't got a chance

426
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
to let you know yet.

427
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
My mother has already abandoned us.

428
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
If she was adopted by others,

429
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
I would have lost

430
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
only one family in this world.

431
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Weibo,

432
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
I'm sorry.

433
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
I neglected

434
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
your feelings.

435
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
But weibo, do you know?

436
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
When I was a child,

437
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
I didn't have anyone

438
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
to take care of my mother.

439
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
When I was a child,

440
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
I had no parents.

441
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
Because of you two,

442
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I had a family

443
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
for the first time.

444
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
Can you...

445
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Can you treat me

446
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
as your family?

447
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
If mother

448
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
doesn't come back,

449
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
we three

450
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
will never

451
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
be separated

452
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
from each other.

453
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
Okay?

454
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Okay?

455
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
The information is that

456
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Zhong Jie died in the prison.

457
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
So,

458
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
did she also go to your hospital to rescue you?

459
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
How much is the blood?

460
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
64 yuan.

461
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
200 grams of blood.

462
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
The charge is over.

463
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,240
Zhong Jie, leave.

464
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Put it down.

465
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Two times.

466
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Two times, 200 grams.

467
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
The charge is over.

468
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Put it down.

469
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
One more time.

470
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
400 grams.

471
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Doctor,

472
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
the patient has left.

473
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
21.08 yuan.

474
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Yes.

475
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
That night,

476
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
three people who were killed by Li Lin Xi

477
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
were killed.

478
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
I had a bad feeling.

479
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Xiaoyu.

480
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Aunt Li, Aunt Li.

481
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
I want to touch her.

482
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Yes.

483
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
I...

484
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
I...

485
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
She said she sold the house.

486
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
She wanted me to give her the money.

487
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
I didn't agree.

488
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
She locked me up.

489
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
She didn't let me eat.

490
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
She didn't let me contact the child.

491
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Today, I was careless.

492
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
I escaped.

493
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
She kept chasing me.

494
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Then she sold the house.

495
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
She didn't give the money.

496
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
I didn't leave it to her.

497
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
I want to leave it to Jun.

498
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
No matter what she did to me,

499
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
she won't give the money to her.

500
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
I'm sorry.

501
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
I didn't take good care of you.

502
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm sorry.

503
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Mom.

504
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I'm sorry.

505
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Mom.

506
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
My life is in danger.

507
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
I still have two children.

508
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
I really don't want to continue like this.

509
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
I just want to help her.

510
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
You must help me.

511
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
I still have two children.

512
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
I don't want to continue like this.

513
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
What do I want to do first?

514
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I don't want to go to bed.

515
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Yes.

516
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
After that,

517
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Mei Bao's mom has really changed.

518
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,240
She's become more and more active.

519
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,240
She insisted on having a flat-touch house with me.

520
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,240
She didn't let me pay for the piano lessons.

521
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
She insisted on being alone.

522
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,240
She was taken to hospital in the hospital

523
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
to receive the hospital.

524
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,240
She was taken to the hospital as a nurse at home at night.

525
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,240
The guests all liked her.

526
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
As long as she doesn't work,

527
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,240
she'll put all her time on the two children.

528
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
In my opinion,

529
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,240
that may be the happiest day in Mei Bao's life.

530
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,240
But sometimes,

531
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
some people

532
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,240
are like a bag.

533
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
No matter what,

534
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,240
we can't find a solution.

535
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
I'm sorry.

536
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
I'm sorry.

537
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
Let me go over there.

538
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Thank you.

539
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Are you okay?

540
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Yan Yuyan came to see me.

541
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
He said he wanted me to go back with him.

542
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
If I didn't go back,

543
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
he'd come to pick me up every day.

544
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Sister,

545
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
you know that

546
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
most people in our restaurant like you.

547
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
But you know that

548
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
your husband always keeps his mouth shut.

549
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,240
Our little bowl is very hard to get rid of.

550
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
I just gave you two months' rest

551
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,240
to make a good match with your boss.

552
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,240
You can go.

553
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Take it.

554
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
No matter what,

555
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Zhong Jie can always be found by Yan Yuyan.

556
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,240
He can find all kinds of ways.

557
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Zhong Jie finally

558
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,240
gets to see himself.

559
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Aunt.

560
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Aunt.

561
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Aunt,

562
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
you're in the final.

563
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
I told you to play with me.

564
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
You're so great.

565
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
You'll be in the final, right?

566
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
Let's play with mom tonight.

567
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
Let's play with Qingzhi.

568
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Forget it.

569
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
What?

570
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
Actually,

571
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Jun's piano class

572
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
has paid a lot of money.

573
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
My mom said she has no money.

574
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
You can't do this.

575
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
It's okay.

576
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
I'll teach you.

577
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
You two can go to sleep.

578
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Let's go.

579
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Sorry.

580
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,240
The number you have dialed is busy.

581
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
Please call again later.

582
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Sorry.

583
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
The number you have dialed is busy.

584
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Look at your face.

585
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
Don't be nervous.

586
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Come on.

587
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Meiba.

588
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
Get ready for your brother.

589
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
I'll be right back.

590
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Jun.

591
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
You're the best.

592
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Come on.

593
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
I'll be right back.

594
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Anni.

595
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Forget it.

596
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
It's okay.

597
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,240
Let's go.

598
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Where have you been these days?

599
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
You haven't been home for days.

600
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Hi.

601
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Leave with me.

602
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Take care of yourself.

603
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
I'll be right back.

604
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
If Meiba and Yanjun

605
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,240
need money,

606
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
take it.

607
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Where did you get so much money?

608
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Where did you get it?

609
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,240
I got it from Yan Weiyuan.

610
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
He doesn't know what's more difficult

611
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
in the fun.

612
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
He's quick-witted.

613
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
He said

614
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
I'll be with him

615
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
next time.

616
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,240
We'll be faster.

617
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
He said he has money.

618
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
He forgot everything.

619
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
He apologized to me.

620
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
He said

621
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
he wanted to start over with me.

622
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,240
I can't keep bothering you.

623
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,240
I'll have to live my own life.

624
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Do you really think you two

625
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,240
can start over?

626
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Do you really think he'll change?

627
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
He'll be honest with you, okay?

628
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Of course not.

629
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
What can I do?

630
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Can I stay at your house forever?

631
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
But I don't have a job now.

632
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
How many times do you need to be treated like this?

633
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
You can't wake up.

634
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,240
You know

635
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
all these efforts are wasted.

636
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
Guilan.

637
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,240
I can't escape.

638
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,240
I can't escape this whole life.

639
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
I can't leave him.

640
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
You can.

641
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
As long as you're willing to, you can.

642
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Ajun's piano competition is about to start.

643
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
He needs you.

644
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
He needs his parents.

645
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,240
He needs you.

646
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Come with me.

647
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Come with me.

648
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Don't you really think

649
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
he can play the piano at home?

650
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
I don't think so much.

651
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
But you have to come with me now.

652
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
I...

653
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
When I was little,

654
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
I was selected

655
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
as a dancer in the class of 2005.

656
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
I've learned a lot of things.

657
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
All my lessons

658
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
were about my talent.

659
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
As long as I can,

660
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
I'll be a dancer.

661
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
My parents said

662
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
they scolded me.

663
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
They said I was a bad singer.

664
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
But they said I was wrong.

665
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
I can still make money.

666
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
I was a little bit old.

667
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
I was poor.

668
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,240
I didn't have any money.

669
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,240
So I've been a dancer for years.

670
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
I've been a good dancer.

671
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
I'll show you.

672
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Stop it.

673
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Stop it.

674
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
So why do you say

675
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,240
I have to watch his performance?

676
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,240
It will make me sadder.

677
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
The director of the dance

678
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
and the piano.

679
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,240
I can't be a doctor like him.

680
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Or...

681
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
My son is also...

682
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
I can't remember

683
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
when I leave here.

684
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Come with me.

685
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Trust me.

686
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
I can't forget

687
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
when I leave here.

688
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,240
I can still make money.

689
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
I'm a good mother.

690
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Of course you can.

691
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
We can leave here.

692
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
We can find a place

693
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
that we can't find.

694
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
We can start over.

695
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
You won the first place.

696
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,240
You're so good.

697
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
You're so old-fashioned.

698
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
Let's go home now.

699
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Wait for us.

700
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Let's go.

701
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
This one.

702
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,240
Where are you going?

703
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Come on.

704
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Aunt,

705
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
did my mom hear me?

706
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
She didn't hear me.

707
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Trust me. She will come.

708
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
Mom will really come.

709
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
Wait.

710
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
This time,

711
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
you really want to leave?

712
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
I'll give you a gift.

713
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
I'll give you a gift.

714
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
I'll give you a gift.

715
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Mom.

716
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Did my mom come to see me

717
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
when I just asked for a match?

718
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
She's here.

719
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
She really is.

720
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Who can pick up?

721
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,240
I don't want to.

722
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Hello?

723
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
Dr. Li,

724
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
your friend

725
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
ended up jumping off the building

726
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
and killing.

727
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
He just came here.

728
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
He didn't succeed.

729
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Are you sure it's him?

730
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
I know.

731
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
Aunt,

732
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
did my mom hear me?

733
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
What happened to my mom?

734
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,240
Mom can't come over.

735
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Let's go to the box first.

736
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Mom,

737
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
why can't you come over?

738
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
Aunt,

739
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,240
why can't you come over?

740
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Mom,

741
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,240
why can't you come over?

742
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
Go.

743
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Go.

744
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Mom, come over.

745
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
Go.

746
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Sit down first.

747
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
It's okay.

748
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
It's okay.

749
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I'll go to the toilet.

750
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
I...

751
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
I really went to the toilet.

752
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
I was so stupid at that time.

753
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,240
They actually have the same kind of eyes.

754
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,240
I clearly saw it in the eyes of Zhong Jie.

755
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,240
I saw that kind of eyes.

756
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
What are you doing?

757
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
I'm going to the toilet.

758
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
I'm going to the toilet.

759
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Sister, don't go to the toilet.

760
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
I'm going to the toilet.

761
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
I'm going to the toilet.

762
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
Aunt,

763
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
you must keep that

764
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
the top-class guest in the future.

765
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
Okay.

766
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Let's stop here today.

767
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
Thank you for your cooperation.

768
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
I hope you can find the murderer earlier.

769
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
You've been taking care of the child for more than ten years.

770
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,240
In the end, you became a person who takes care of the child.

771
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
It's really pitiful.

772
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,240
There's no way.

773
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
The child has nothing to do with him.

774
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,240
He didn't leave the town for the medical procedure.

775
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
From the legal side,

776
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
it's a crime to be a murderer.

777
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,240
I'm sorry.

778
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
I didn't do anything to you.

779
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
I didn't do anything to you.

780
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
I'm sorry.

781
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
I'm sorry.

782
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,240
I'm sorry.

783
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
I'm sorry.

784
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
I'm sorry.

785
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,240
I'm sorry.
