Episode谨事

00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,260
Episode 3

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,680
I've already bought new ones.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,400
I've also bought new ones.

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,320
That's strange.

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,200
Mom,

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,160
we've been here the whole time.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,200
It's really weird!

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,600
We need to find our own preferred restaurant to check on.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
I have assumed your wife's house is on site.

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,800
But our parents don't have any rent to such that the rents will clean them up.

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
The smell of the gas is coming.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Let's go.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Call me if you need anything.

16
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
When will you be able to close the door?

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
I just know that this house has been in the house for 70 years.

18
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Mr. Yan.

19
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Have you seen Zhong Mei Bao recently?

20
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
We found your fingerprint in his house.

21
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Have you been to his house?

22
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Where are you on the night of November 2nd?

23
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Yan Yong Yuan.

24
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
You don't deserve our investigation.

25
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Actually, it's very bad for you.

26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,800
After all, your biological son has come out to prove you.

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
If...

28
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
If...

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
If I tell the truth,

30
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
can you keep it a secret?

31
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
I don't want to hurt my son.

32
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Where should I start?

33
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Then let's talk about your relationship with Zhong Mei Bao.

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
My relationship with him?

35
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Then we should start talking about it.

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I don't want to say, I'm very clear.

37
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I don't want to say, I hate this world.

38
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,800
But I can't refuse.

39
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Give it to me.

40
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I want to sit down.

41
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Sit down first.

42
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Sit down.

43
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Mr. Wen, Mr. Yan sent you the most beloved watch.

44
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
You should say it right.

45
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Let's kiss.

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Kiss.

47
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Kiss.

48
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Kiss.

49
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Kiss.

50
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Kiss.

51
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Kiss.

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Kiss.

53
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Kiss.

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Kiss.

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Miss.

56
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Miss.

57
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Miss.

58
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Hello.

59
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Hello.

60
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Miss, pour me some water.

61
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
I'll introduce myself.

62
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
My name is Yan Yu Yuan.

63
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I opened a company.

64
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
It's called Peng Yang Electric Friendship Company.

65
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Oh, right.

66
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
This is my name card.

67
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Sorry, I don't have a name card.

68
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
No, no.

69
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
I know who you are.

70
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Oh, right.

71
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm a personal guardian.

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
You don't mind, do you?

73
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
What do I mind?

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Great.

75
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Then I want to deal with you.

76
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Are you happy?

77
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I'm happy.

78
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I'm happy.

79
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
I'm happy.

80
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm happy.

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm happy.

82
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Don't laugh.

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Are you okay?

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Are you married?

85
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
No.

86
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Then you have a girlfriend?

87
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
No.

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Then why can't you be with me?

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Because you won't like me.

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
If I like you,

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
can I see you at night?

92
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I saw you at night.

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
She gave me a present.

94
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
You gave me a watch.

95
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
And you gave me a drink.

96
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
You're a full-time drinker.

97
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
So,

98
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I'm not suitable for you.

99
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm not suitable for you.

100
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Don't rush the conclusion.

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
We can know each other.

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Mom.

103
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Yan Bao.

104
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Come on.

105
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
You're so good.

106
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Did mom give you a candy?

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Yes.

108
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
I'm so good at giving you a candy.

109
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Didn't you just say

110
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
you want to know each other?

111
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Did you know each other?

112
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
But...

113
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
My daughter.

114
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
What did I say?

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
I said you won't like me.

116
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm not a woman who worth your money.

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm not a woman

118
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
who worth your life.

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Let's go to bed.

120
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
I'm so bad.

121
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
I'm so bad.

122
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Let's go home.

123
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
I was lucky to meet

124
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,800
my mom at that time.

125
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Bye.

126
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Bye.

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Bye.

128
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Bye.

129
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Bye.

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Bye.

131
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Bye.

132
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Bye.

133
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Bye.

134
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Bye.

135
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Bye.

136
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Bye.

137
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Bye.

138
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Bye.

139
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Bye.

140
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Bye.

141
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,760
I'm not pregnant.

142
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,760
This is a baby.

143
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,960
Do you like it?

144
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,120
I like it.

145
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,760
Let's give it a name, okay?

146
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,960
Okay.

147
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,440
I'm done.

148
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,560
Mei Bao.

149
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,200
Who gave you this toy?

150
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,080
Uncle gave it to me.

151
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,560
Mei Bao, didn't I tell you that

152
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
you can't take the gift from others.

153
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,640
Go back and give it back to uncle.

154
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,440
Let him keep the child's love.

155
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,760
I can't give it to you.

156
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,760
Take it.

157
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,120
Okay?

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,440
You can't do it.

159
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,360
Mei Bao, come here.

160
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,000
Go find Uncle Li.

161
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,640
Tell him that

162
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,840
his work is done today.

163
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,240
I'll call him, okay?

164
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,440
Go.

165
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,800
Thank you, uncle.

166
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,640
Okay.

167
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
What do you mean?

168
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,240
What do you mean?

169
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,960
You humiliated me last time.

170
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,080
You came here again.

171
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,040
What do you mean?

172
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,160
I didn't humiliate you.

173
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Enough.

174
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,080
I've seen a lot of people like you.

175
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,120
None of them really likes me.

176
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I don't know what kind of people you've met.

177
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,840
I'm sincere to you.

178
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,960
I like you.

179
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,000
And

180
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
I also like children very much.

181
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,280
Really.

182
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,400
It's hard to have a child alone.

183
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,640
Right?

184
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,160
Don't cry.

185
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,360
Don't cry.

186
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,680
Bai Cao.

187
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't cry.

188
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,200
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,560
I shouldn't have let you cry.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,160
I'll come again.

191
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,640
I have one thing to ask about.

192
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
I will tell him.

193
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,320
Why did you intend to add one?

194
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,440
I thought

195
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,000
I met with a kind of one- Treasure.

196
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,500
Since then,

197
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,920
I have been Looking around from time to time.

198
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,960
At first,

199
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,160
the mother and daughter

200
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,200
were like two books.

201
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
What was your company's name?

202
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,160
It was

203
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,720
Hangyang Electric.

204
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,360
I was the one who was hurt the most in the early days.

205
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,120
Although my company was small,

206
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,720
I was able to win.

207
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,720
It's good to hear that.

208
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,960
You used to have a good life.

209
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,440
Of course.

210
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,040
I'm doing well.

211
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,400
I'm good to her.

212
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,320
How is it? Is it good?

213
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,920
Honey.

214
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,040
Is it real?

215
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,400
Of course.

216
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,600
It's so expensive.

217
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,720
Take it slow.

218
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,840
Take it slow.

219
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,240
Thank you, honey.

220
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,000
Honey.

221
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,440
How do you think

222
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,440
you can get something from a empty carpet?

223
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,200
I... I forgot.

225
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,160
Next time,

226
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
I'll buy you a pair of earrings

227
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,840
to accompany them.

228
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,360
Okay?

229
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
Honey, you're so smart.

230
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,640
I forgot to tell you, honey.

231
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,960
A customer of mine

232
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,560
will give me a big carpet.

233
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,840
We can sit together

234
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,520
and watch TV in the future.

235
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,240
The carpet is not expensive.

236
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,200
Who wants to give it to me?

237
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,120
It's just a customer.

238
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,080
Don't think too much.

239
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,600
It's important to have a good life.

240
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,480
If it's not because of the final season,

241
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,480
I should be able to get hurt.

242
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Who's that?

243
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,840
Who?

244
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,280
You...

245
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,200
Yongge?

246
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,560
Mr. Yan.

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You have money here.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,280
You can spend it on the spot.

249
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,960
You don't know how to pay the debt.

250
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,760
There are many people.

251
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,800
Let's go out and talk.

252
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,280
There are many people.

253
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Don't be afraid.

254
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,120
You're always busy.

255
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm going to be a big man today.

256
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll accept your old brother.

257
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,480
Don't, don't, Yongge.

258
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,960
I've been

259
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,920
in trouble.

260
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,920
I can pay the debt very quickly.

261
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,520
Why should I believe you?

262
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,960
You're the one who gave him a car.

263
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,800
The boss made a mistake

264
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,040
to block your mouth.

265
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,320
Now you've ruined the company.

266
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,720
I don't know you.

267
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,360
When did you pay the debt

268
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,560
to the boss?

269
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,880
A few days ago.

270
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,480
Three days?

271
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,280
You don't pay the debt for three days?

272
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,760
I'll wait and see.

273
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,800
You...

274
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,920
Yongge.

275
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,480
Yongge.

276
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,200
I've been hiding it from you for so long.

278
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,040
I used to be a little driver.

279
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,520
It's very complicated

280
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,440
to drive a female boss.

281
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,040
I've heard a lot of things.

282
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,320
He turned off my factory.

283
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,760
He wanted to pay the debt.

284
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,600
You told him I'd give him 10%.

285
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,680
How can I show up?

286
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,120
I'll have to go in if I show up.

287
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,480
You helped me find a scapegoat.

288
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,040
You're a man of the word.

289
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,520
I don't care if you're a man of the word.

290
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,880
Just do it.

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,800
Later,

292
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,960
the boss made a small company

293
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,360
to block my mouth.

294
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,560
It was a good thing

295
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,240
to do a few days ago.

296
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,600
But recently,

297
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,920
the client's money chain has been in trouble.

298
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,000
The salary can't be paid.

299
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,360
Darling,

300
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,640
don't worry too much.

301
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,280
Sometimes, the company is a little hard to handle.

302
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,400
That's normal.

303
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Didn't you say

304
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,920
you'd pay the debt if you believed in it?

305
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,720
I'm just kidding.

306
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,000
I just want to save more time

307
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,240
to let you and Mei Bao go.

308
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Go?

309
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,120
Are you leaving me?

310
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,360
No.

311
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,080
I can't drag you and Mei Bao anymore.

312
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Darling,

313
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,360
you've never dragged us.

314
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,760
These days,

315
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,800
you've been so kind to Mei Bao.

316
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,720
So, no matter what,

317
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,400
I'll always be by your side.

318
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
And,

319
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Mei Bao is the only one

320
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
who's not here.

321
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I was so in love with her

322
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
that I didn't have the heart to break up with her.

323
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
If I could leave her earlier,

324
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
I wouldn't be like this.

325
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,400
But when I thought I could leave her,

326
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,600
I suddenly realized

327
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,200
that I couldn't find a way out.

328
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
You should go.

329
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Darling,

330
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,200
no matter what happens,

331
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,200
you have me,

332
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,000
Mei Bao,

333
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,400
and our child.

334
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Darling,

335
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,200
I must work hard

336
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
to make our family

337
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,000
live a good life.

338
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,000
No.

339
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Come on, darling.

340
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Darling,

341
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,600
do you remember a Hong Konger

342
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,200
who always came to our room?

343
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,600
The one who came to your room?

344
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,800
When did you get this kind of nonsense?

345
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,600
I remember

346
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,400
when he knew you were

347
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,000
a housekeeper,

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,200
he was like a tailor to you.

349
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
The price was reasonable, right?

350
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I remember.

351
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
But I heard

352
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,200
that he had a problem with the goods.

353
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
He died.

354
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,200
He died.

355
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,800
Okay.

356
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Darling,

357
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,800
it seems like

358
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,600
many companies are doing this.

359
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,600
And they are thinking about it.

360
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,400
Is it because

361
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,600
they are so strict?

362
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,400
According to our investigation,

363
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,600
you had a problem with the goods.

364
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,400
So you mean this?

365
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,800
Mei Bao, be careful.

366
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,800
No, no, no.

367
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This is not good.

368
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
I have to send a client.

369
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,600
Take your time.

370
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Please.

371
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,200
Dad, I'm hungry.

372
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,800
You're hungry?

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What do you want to eat today?

374
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,800
I want to eat chicken and ribs.

375
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,200
I want to eat hot pot,

376
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,800
potato and pork.

377
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Okay.

378
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I'll wait for you.

379
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,400
What do you want to eat?

380
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Hello?

381
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm hungry.

382
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,400
Tomorrow.

383
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,200
Okay.

384
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,400
Later,

385
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,400
I'll change my clothes

386
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,600
and change for you.

387
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Let's go out together

388
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,000
and have a meal, okay?

389
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Okay.

390
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,600
Mei Bao, Jun.

391
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm leaving.

392
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,200
Be good.

393
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Mom, let's go.

394
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
Didn't you say you'll have a meal together?

395
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
I told you I'm going to sign the contract today.

396
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,600
We promised to have a meal together.

397
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
We haven't had a meal together for a long time.

398
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
But I can't leave without a contract.

399
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Why?

400
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
I want to earn more money.

401
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Dad, you've given up your job, okay?

402
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
I have a good business now.

403
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't need you to earn money.

404
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Besides,

405
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,880
a bunch of ugly men are still

406
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,280
drinking the most.

407
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,280
They don't have time to accompany their children.

408
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Can you give up?

409
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,680
They're at my place.

410
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,080
They want me to accompany them to drink.

411
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,680
Can I not accompany them?

412
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,080
I don't know my job's quality.

413
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,880
Sister.

414
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,480
Okay, okay.

415
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,880
Then I'll have a meal with the children tomorrow, okay?

416
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,680
It's okay.

417
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,080
I'll have a meal next time.

418
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,080
Boss Yan,

419
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,080
we've passed this address.

420
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,680
But we didn't find the Hong Konger.

421
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,680
He won't...

422
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,480
Wait a minute.

423
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,480
He's so busy.

424
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,280
He must have a lot of business.

425
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
Let me ask you.

426
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,680
There was indeed a Hong Konger before.

427
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,080
The information hasn't been found yet.

428
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,480
The office has been locked up.

429
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,680
He must have been in the past.

430
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,680
Hello?

431
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Very soon, very soon, very soon.

432
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,680
Tomorrow.

433
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,280
Wang Lei.

434
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,480
Brother Yan, bad news.

435
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,880
I heard that the Hong Konger went in.

436
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,480
The one who saw the goods was taken away by the police.

437
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,080
What should we do?

438
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,480
How do I know what to do?

439
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,880
Are you looking for him?

440
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,280
Where's Zheng Jie?

441
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,280
Zheng Jie?

442
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
He hasn't come in a long time.

443
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,480
Didn't he say he wanted to take a break?

444
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,080
No.

445
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,280
He said he's been very busy lately.

446
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,080
So he didn't come.

447
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,480
Brother.

448
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,480
Why are you so early today?

449
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Where did you go?

450
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,680
I was still able to go somewhere.

451
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,280
I went to work.

452
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,280
I went to the hotel.

453
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,880
They said you didn't have any work these days.

454
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,680
Recently, there was an old client.

455
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,080
He used to run my factory.

456
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,880
He came here.

457
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
I accompanied him to eat and drink for a few days.

458
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Nothing else.

459
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,680
Just eat and drink.

460
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,680
Husband.

461
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,080
You still don't know my work.

462
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
It's just a factory.

463
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,880
I only have you in my heart.

464
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
That Hong Kong man has disappeared.

465
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,880
I just went in there and got some money.

466
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,680
I didn't give him any goods.

467
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
You know where he is, right?

468
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,080
How can I know?

469
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,080
But he's not familiar with it.

470
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,080
You're not familiar with him.

471
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,480
What's this?

472
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
What's this?

473
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
What's this?

474
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,080
Why is the money on it?

475
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,880
It's not more than the money.

476
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,480
It's the second day I gave him the money.

477
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,680
Money?

478
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,280
Money is...

479
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
I'll keep it for you in the future.

480
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,080
A Jun is in school.

481
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,080
Didn't you say A Jun has a talent in music?

482
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,680
The music in the future should be very expensive.

483
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
I don't care how much you take it back.

484
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,680
I just want to know

485
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,480
what you and him are related to.

486
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,080
Do you think he has a problem?

487
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,080
Dad, what's wrong?

488
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Go to sleep.

489
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Jun, it's okay.

490
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Dad and mom are discussing something.

491
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,680
Don't run.

492
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,880
Go back to sleep.

493
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,080
Honey, you scared the kid.

494
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Hong Kong man

495
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,480
likes me.

496
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
He said he would give me a break.

497
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
But honey,

498
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,880
I really didn't do anything to make you feel sorry.

499
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,080
Honey, go.

500
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,080
The money on it

501
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,080
is all our money.

502
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
I did this

503
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,880
for our family.

504
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,080
Honey.

505
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,280
I don't care about these things.

506
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,480
I just want you to

507
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,280
try and live with me.

508
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Honey,

509
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,280
let's not do this business, okay?

510
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,080
Hong Kong man ran away.

511
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,280
I don't know when the police will find me.

512
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,280
The company can't continue.

513
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,880
The money is gone.

514
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Now,

515
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,680
I only have you.

516
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,680
I know. I know.

517
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,680
Honey, I know.

518
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,680
I won't leave you.

519
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,480
If you don't want me to go to sing with me,

520
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
I'll quit my job tomorrow, okay?

521
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,880
The company is always good.

522
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
When the time comes,

523
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,080
I'll go to your company

524
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,480
to collect your debts and make a living.

525
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,080
We'll take care of

526
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,280
these two kids and raise them.

527
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,880
Don't you like my job?

528
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,680
Do you know this little book?

529
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,280
It's all my client's phone number.

530
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll tear it off

531
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,680
as your face.

532
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Honey,

533
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,680
as long as you are the most important,

534
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,880
do you know that?

535
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,680
Okay, it's okay.

536
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,080
It's okay.

537
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
It's okay. It's not sad.

538
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,480
It's not sad.

539
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Mr. Yan,

540
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,680
your story is too long.

541
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,280
Can we jump to the point

542
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,480
where you can do it?

543
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,880
And did you say

544
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
that it has anything to do with Zhong Mei Bao's death?

545
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,880
You said you were thinking about the kids everywhere,

546
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,280
but why do they hate you so much?

547
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,480
They even come out to deduct you from your own son.

548
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,480
Let her continue to be a prisoner.

549
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,080
Why did we get old?

550
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,880
If it weren't for the struggle,

551
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,480
I wouldn't get old.

552
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,080
If it weren't for the struggle,

553
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,880
I wouldn't get old for such a long time.

554
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Honey,

555
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,880
I want to go to the orphanage.

556
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,680
They said that

557
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,680
we can live together.

558
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Don't worry.

559
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
I will be waiting for you outside.

560
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Oh, right.

561
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,880
My husband's account

562
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,480
and some money

563
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,480
I want to give him up.

564
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
I want to give him some dead sleep.

565
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,080
Maybe

566
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,280
he can get rid of you.

567
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,480
Honey,

568
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
you said that

569
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
you have some money on your account.

570
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,680
You Nuan, don't worry.

571
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,880
No matter how many years you are waiting,

572
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,280
I will be waiting for you outside

573
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,880
and take care of the two kids.

574
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,280
I will wait for you to come back and live a good life together.

575
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,480
Honey,

576
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,480
I am a little worried

577
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,080
that I will have to pay

578
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,880
the two kids for you.

579
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,080
Will it be hard?

580
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,080
Honey, I have something to discuss with you.

581
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,680
I said

582
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
can we

583
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,480
pay the money

584
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,080
on our account?

585
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,080
I will pay the money.

586
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Police officer.

587
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
Are you in the hospital?

588
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Police officer.

589
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,880
He hasn't come back yet.

590
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,680
Who is in the hospital?

591
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,880
He hasn't come back yet.

592
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
No one.

593
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,080
I didn't hug your father.

594
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
You misunderstood him.

595
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,080
Police officer.

596
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,280
I didn't hug your father.

597
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,080
Police officer.

598
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Police officer.

599
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Police officer.

600
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Look,

601
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,080
they

602
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,880
played a game

603
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,080
with each other.

604
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,080
They sent me to prison.

605
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
I thought

606
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,680
they kept a lot of money for Zhong Jie.

607
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,480
The two kids are fine with him.

608
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,480
I can

609
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,280
also

610
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,680
change my mind in prison.

611
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
When the news is released,

612
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,880
our family will be

613
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,680
in a deep depression.

614
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,280
But I forgot.

615
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,280
As the old saying goes,

616
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,880
the country is full of

617
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,880
hard work.

618
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,680
Wang Zuo.

619
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Wang Hong.

620
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,880
Let's go.

621
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,280
315204.

622
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,880
You are talking too loud.

623
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,080
315204.

624
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,680
What?

625
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Come in.

626
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,480
Who is he?

627
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,880
Don't call him another man.

628
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,080
How can you promise me?

629
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
You are so noisy.

630
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,880
Who are you?

631
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,680
What are you doing?

632
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,880
Yan Yuan.

633
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,480
Go.

634
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,280
Yan Yuan.

635
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,480
I am begging you.

636
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,080
Yan Yuan.

637
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,680
You are a criminal.

638
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,680
Go out.

639
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,880
Come back.

640
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Go find your wife.

641
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,080
Go back.

642
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,880
Go back.

643
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,680
Go back.

644
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,280
Wait.

645
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,480
Who is the spy?

646
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Who is the spy?

647
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
A relative.

648
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,480
A relative?

649
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
I used to work in my company.

650
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
Where did you go

651
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
after you were discharged?

652
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
I want to go home.

653
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,280
But I don't have a home anymore.

654
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,880
A-Jing.

655
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,480
A-Jing.

656
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,880
A-Jing.

657
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,480
A-Jing.

658
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,680
I can't believe you anymore.

659
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,680
Let's go, A-Jing.

660
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,280
Let's go.

661
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,080
I want to go.

662
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,880
What are you doing?

663
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,280
You scared the kid.

664
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,280
You scared the kid.

665
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
I will kill myself if you let him go.

666
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Don't scare the kid.

667
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Don't be scared.

668
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
Zhong Qi.

669
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Mom.

670
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
I found you.

671
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,480
Zhong Qi.

672
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,680
Mom.

673
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,680
Mom, do you still hurt?

674
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,280
Mom doesn't hurt.

675
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Jun Gui.

676
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Jun Gui.

677
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,280
Jun Gui.

678
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Honey.

679
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
I beg you.

680
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Please don't take A-Jing away.

681
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,280
I've been living with you for a long time.

682
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,280
I'm begging you.

683
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
What about the next?

684
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
Later,

685
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,280
Zhong Jie met a female doctor.

686
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,280
He became weird.

687
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,280
Sometimes,

688
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
they were too close.

689
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,480
I didn't think much of it.

690
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,680
But one day,

691
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,280
I suddenly found out

692
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,080
that Zhong Jie and the two kids

693
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,280
were gone.

694
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,680
Gone?

695
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,280
They disappeared like a flying bird.

696
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,080
I tried my best to find them.

697
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,280
But we couldn't find them.

698
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,680
Why didn't you call the police?

699
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Call the police?

700
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,680
I thought

701
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,880
he must have gone with that man.

702
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,080
The police is not taking the blame.

703
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,680
I thought

704
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,080
I must find them myself.

705
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
But I didn't expect

706
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,280
that when I met Jun again,

707
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,080
it's been years.

708
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,280
Where did you meet him?

709
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,680
Mr. Yan.

710
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,480
Where did you meet your son?

711
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Officer.

712
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,680
Can you promise me

713
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,680
to keep the secret?

714
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
You didn't tell the media.

715
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,280
I really want to protect my son.

716
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,680
Really.

717
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,080
Our information is a secret.

718
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,880
The media won't know.

719
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
When I see Jun again,

720
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,080
he will change his name.

721
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,680
Mr. Ye.

722
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,680
Mr. Ye, your father came to visit you.

723
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,280
I didn't expect

724
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,080
he would be so ill.

725
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,080
How is that possible?

726
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,880
It seems normal.

727
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,480
If you don't believe me,

728
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,080
you can go to the hospital

729
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,480
to check his admission record.

730
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,680
You mean

731
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
your son is ill?

732
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
And the patient

733
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,480
was not admitted once.

734
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,280
I don't know

735
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,080
what Zhou Meibao did

736
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
to my son.

737
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,280
When I saw him in the hospital,

738
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,480
he didn't recognize me.

739
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
He became

740
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,680
a poor person.

741
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,480
A good boy

742
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,080
was so ill.

743
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,480
Even if he was a genius,

744
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,080
he would become a poor boy

745
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
and a poor boy.

746
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,080
Master.

747
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
If Ye Shujun

748
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,280
is really ill,

749
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,280
then the previous words

750
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,680
are meaningless.

751
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,280
That's the case.

752
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Sometimes,

753
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,480
you see a flash of light.

754
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
It's actually dark.

755
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,880
Sometimes, you think it's dark.

756
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,280
Maybe a flash of light will show up.

757
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,280
Then...

758
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,880
What should we do now?

759
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,080
What should we do?

760
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,280
Let's have a look.

761
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,280
You wait here for us to switch.

762
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,880
Thank you.

763
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,680
Hello.

764
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,280
I'm Man Cheng Jingjing,

765
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,880
Yang Ersin.

766
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,880
I called you before to talk to you.

767
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Okay, wait a minute.

768
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,280
Thank you.

769
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,480
Xiaojun's medical record

770
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,680
is his privacy.

771
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,280
And

772
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,880
what's going on between you two?

773
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,280
Xiaojun is the only one

774
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
who can be a murderer.

775
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,280
He said

776
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,080
that the words he said

777
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,080
were useless.

778
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,280
I'm sorry.

779
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,880
We didn't expect it to be like this.

780
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,080
You've been to the hospital to investigate.

781
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
What can I say now?

782
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,280
We need to know more details.

783
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,680
This is also a case of the case.

784
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
But don't worry.

785
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
We'll definitely

786
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
keep it secret.

787
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,080
Thank you.

788
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,080
Thank you.

789
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,880
Second Sister is not only a victim,

790
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,480
I really don't know

791
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,680
how Zhong Mei Bao and Zhong Tian

792
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,080
had a heart attack on her.

793
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,880
She's a good girl.

794
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,680
She's ruined it.

795
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,080
Mr. Ye, I'm sorry.

796
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,680
We need to confirm

797
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,480
that if you really have a mental illness,

798
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,080
then your high-level fever

799
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,080
may be fixed as a useless one.

800
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
Don't believe what he said.

801
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,880
He's really a bad guy.

802
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,080
He...

803
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,480
He's already...

804
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,880
He's already killed my mom.

805
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,680
He wants to kill my sister.

806
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:07,880
I...

807
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,680
I'm calling Xiaojun.

808
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,880
Xiaojun.

809
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,880
Are you okay?

810
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm fine.

811
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,080
Don't call him.

812
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,680
Come on.

813
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,680
Come on.

814
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,680
Relax.

815
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,680
I'm calling the ambulance.

816
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Don't call the ambulance.

817
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
We have our own doctors.

818
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,480
Call them right away.

819
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,480
Relax.

820
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,080
Come on.

821
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,880
Relax.

822
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,080
Okay. Thank you.

823
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
According to your request,

824
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
we've made a decision

825
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,080
to make a call to the account name of the bank.

826
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Is there a name

827
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
called Zhong Jie in these accounts?

828
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:34,880
Yes.

829
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,680
Every few weeks,

830
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,280
there will be a big account

831
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,480
that will be transferred to Zhong Jie's account.

832
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,280
Zhong Du.

833
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,280
It's already the end.

834
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,280
I'm begging you.

835
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,680
Don't put Xiaojun's money

836
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,080
into this case.

837
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,280
Okay?

838
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,080
Ye Shujun has a mental illness.

839
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,080
He can't be a witness.

840
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,480
If he can't be a witness,

841
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,720
then our current evidence

842
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,680
will be lost for a while.

843
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
We can't wear it.

844
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880
So we can't

845
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,080
make the case against the actress.

846
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,080
We have to defend him.

847
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,580
I can't believe he said我们

848
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
did the same thing.

849
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,080
But Wenwen still ran away.

850
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,280
She has his audience.

851
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,480
She should live by himself.

852
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,640
Are you going to take my dad's picture

853
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,680
oi?

854
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,680
Miss Nee is your father?

855
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,080
Yes, she is.

856
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Yes.

857
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,880
I can't say it.

858
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,880
Ma Jun, I'm sorry.

859
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,680
I can't say it.

860
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,280
I have to protect my son.

861
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,880
I hope he can come back to me.

862
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,280
After all, I'm his biological father.

863
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Then what do you want to say to your son?

864
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,480
Jun,

865
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,680
tomorrow night,

866
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,680
I'll go to the blue wood next to love.

867
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,680
In the show,

868
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,480
I'll tell all our stories.

869
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,080
I'll tell you all.

870
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,080
I'll tell you all.

871
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,880
I'll tell you all.

872
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,280
I'll tell you all.

873
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,680
I'll tell you all.

874
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,080
I'll tell you all.

875
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,680
I'll tell you all.

876
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,080
I'll tell you all.

877
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,680
I'll tell you all.

878
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,280
I'll tell you all.

879
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,880
I'll tell you all.

880
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,480
I'll tell you all.

881
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,080
I'll tell you all.

882
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,880
I'll tell you all.

883
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,280
I'll tell you all.

884
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,880
I'll tell you all.

885
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,480
I'll tell you all.

886
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,080
I'll tell you all.

887
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,880
I'll tell you all.

888
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,280
I'll tell you all.

889
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,080
I'll tell you all.

890
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,880
I shall go.

891
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,680
I'll go.

892
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
I'll go.

893
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,080
I'll tell you all.

894
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
I'll go.

895
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,680
I'll tell you all.

896
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
I'll go.

897
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
I'll tell you all.

898
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,680
I'll tell you all.

899
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
I'll tell you all.

900
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
I'll tell you all.

901
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,280
I'll tell you all.

902
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
I'll tell you all.

903
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,080
I'll tell you all.

904
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,080
I'll tell you all.

905
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,680
I'll tell you all.

906
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
I'll tell you all.

907
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,280
I'll tell you all.

908
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,880
I'll tell you all.

909
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,280
I'll tell you all.

910
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,480
I will follow anywhere I go

911
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Wherever I will go

912
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:31,480
You're the only one

913
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Carry your load

914
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
Wherever you go

915
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,480
The sun knows

916
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Cause there's a way around the fences

917
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,480
There's a word on the wall

918
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,480
And as we swear around the edges

919
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Could it be the angels call?

920
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,480
Could it be the only one?

921
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
And I know

922
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Wherever I will go

923
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,480
You're the only one

924
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,480
I will follow anywhere I go

925
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,480
Wherever I will go

926
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:33,480
You're the only one

927
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:47,480
I will follow wherever I go
