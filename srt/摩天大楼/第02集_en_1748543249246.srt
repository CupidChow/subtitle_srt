00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
New Challenge

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Episode 22

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,560
Hel落

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
He did it?

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,200
I'm going to get you a cake.

6
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
What's wrong?

7
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,600
Is this the gift for me?

8
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,200
I made this myself.

9
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,200
Thank you.

10
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,100
A Cloud糊 in the Royal Dining Room

11
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,800
It's just aew?

12
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,320
You sure?

13
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,460
Yes.

14
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,000
Sir, come and have a look.

15
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,380
象,

16
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,840
take this nuances out.

17
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,520
Look at the(?)

18
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,700
dashing cup,

19
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,680
It's all Aha.

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,380
It's all new,

21
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,380
Zhong Bei Bao works in the coffee shop.

22
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,380
She should be not a high-ranking.

23
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,380
Yes.

24
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,380
I think the clothes in her closet

25
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,380
are all cheap clothes.

26
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,380
The style is also relatively simple.

27
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,380
I guess she is not the kind of girl who buys luxury products.

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,380
These things should be given by others.

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,380
And not just one person.

30
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,380
Look at this bag.

31
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,380
The same brand, the same style, the same color.

32
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,380
There are two.

33
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,380
If it's the same person who gives it,

34
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,380
this person is too little.

35
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,380
It seems that Zhong Bei Bao has a lot of followers.

36
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,380
So many gifts.

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,380
Uncle, I want to check the source of these gifts.

38
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,380
Xiaoyang.

39
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,380
From a female perspective,

40
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,380
according to your recognition of Zhong Bei Bao,

41
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,380
which one of the most suspicious things

42
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,380
in this room is the most obvious?

43
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,380
I can't tell.

44
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,380
I think it's her.

45
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,380
Why?

46
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,380
If she really likes to play the video,

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,380
she won't just hide it.

48
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,380
It's obvious that she doesn't like it.

49
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,380
She must be a very important person to give her gifts.

50
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,380
That's why she is here.

51
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,380
Xiaoyang, what are you doing?

52
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,380
I think this chair is quite strange.

53
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,380
It's very uncomfortable to sit up.

54
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,380
Check this.

55
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,380
Xiao Zheng, take a picture.

56
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:34,060
Ringogai

57
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,060
Hello.

58
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,620
Hello.

59
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,860
Just a minute.

60
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,740
Ask if you paid to identify these blackhorbrites?

61
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,380
Defendant?

62
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,460
No.

63
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,780
Your grandpa reserved it for me to spend.

64
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,980
It's a very simple perceber.

65
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,300
Thank you.

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,220
Little girl,

67
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,620
don't rushed to see it.

68
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,900
Ang spaghetti.

69
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,380
Look, you don't have to keep the black glue.

70
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,380
It's useless to keep it.

71
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,380
Why don't you sell it to me?

72
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,380
Two thousand?

73
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Isn't it enough?

74
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,380
Then four thousand.

75
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,380
One price.

76
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,380
Have you noticed?

77
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,380
Recently, our boss came to see a young girl.

78
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,380
She's been in the central country for a long time.

79
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,380
She just brought a female teacher here.

80
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,380
It seems to be called a blind man.

81
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,380
She still dares to bring a female teacher.

82
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,380
Why hasn't the previous case been suspended?

83
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,380
Who knows?

84
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,380
Your relationship is hard.

85
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,380
Master.

86
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
Morning.

87
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,380
Morning.

88
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,380
I went to a black glue shop yesterday.

89
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,380
The black glue shop is really suspicious.

90
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,380
What do you mean?

91
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,380
Four thousand. One price.

92
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,380
Four thousand?

93
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,380
I'm also a little bit suspicious about this shop.

94
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,380
It must be worth four thousand.

95
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
Little girl, are you kidding me?

96
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,380
Fine.

97
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,380
Don't open the price.

98
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,380
If you really want to take it,

99
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,380
you can open a new price.

100
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,380
Don't waste your time here.

101
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
Am I right?

102
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
Let me see.

103
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,380
You can't let me pay, right?

104
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,380
At most five thousand.

105
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,380
Fifty thousand.

106
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,380
Actually, this song is my grandma's gift.

107
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,380
I'm not in a hurry to sell it.

108
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,380
How about this?

109
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,380
I'll put this song on your site and sell it first.

110
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,380
In half a month,

111
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,380
whoever gets the highest price,

112
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,380
we'll sell it to whoever.

113
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,380
We'll share the profit we got.

114
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,380
Look at this, okay?

115
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,380
Okay.

116
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,380
You can say it.

117
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,380
But this song can't be put in other houses.

118
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,380
You can only hang it in my house.

119
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,380
No problem.

120
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,380
Then I'll put this envelope in your place.

121
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,380
I have to bring this song back.

122
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,380
How can this work?

123
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,380
If there are customers who want to see the color,

124
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,380
how can I sell it?

125
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
I'll just leave a call for you.

126
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,380
If anyone is interested,

127
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,380
please contact me anytime.

128
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,380
I can't leave the song.

129
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,380
Right, master?

130
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
You're good.

131
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,380
This method is good.

132
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,380
I'm thinking about

133
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,380
the person who sent this song to Zhong Mei Bao's song.

134
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,380
If you see the song,

135
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,380
if you see the song,

136
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
and you go back to the market,

137
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,380
he'll definitely think of a way to buy it back.

138
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Then we can follow this person

139
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
and find some new clues.

140
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
Come, sit.

141
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,380
By the way,

142
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,380
have you read these files?

143
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,380
Yes.

144
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,380
According to the investigation,

145
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,380
the car or the car came to sell.

146
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,380
It's basically the same as what Xie Baolo said.

147
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,380
And he does have some evidence.

148
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,380
Master,

149
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,380
do you think we'll think too much?

150
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,380
But you don't know.

151
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
He didn't say much.

152
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
Even if there are many small things,

153
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,380
we can also have a misjudgment

154
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,380
for his impression.

155
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
Master, are you saying

156
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,380
he's hiding something from us

157
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,380
and following his ex-girlfriend?

158
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,380
Not only that.

159
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
Take a look.

160
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,380
He's been in college for six years.

161
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,380
The reason is that he has too many subjects.

162
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,380
He had to leave a few after that.

163
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
And this.

164
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,380
After graduating from college,

165
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
he went to the bank

166
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,380
because of his score in the competition.

167
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
He was forced to go to the bank

168
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,380
because of the competition.

169
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,380
He spent a few years in the bank.

170
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,380
He's very ordinary.

171
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,380
So,

172
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,380
he'll let us think that

173
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,380
he's a famous salesman

174
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,380
who's been working in the market for four years.

175
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,380
In fact,

176
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,380
he's a waste.

177
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,380
Actually,

178
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,380
he's like our hidden things.

179
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,380
He just wants to avoid people's favor.

180
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,380
He doesn't want to harm others.

181
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,380
But if he wants to hide something else,

182
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,380
he'll take our investigation

183
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,380
to the wrong place.

184
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
That's right.

185
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
This guy knows the wrong.

186
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
He told us that

187
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
he's been through it all the time.

188
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,380
No matter what his relationship with Zhong Mei Bao is,

189
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,380
he must be hiding something.

190
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,380
Maybe he's trying to protect himself.

191
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,380
Maybe he's trying to protect Zhong Mei Bao.

192
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,380
So,

193
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,380
when you see him alone,

194
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,380
you must be careful.

195
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,380
I'm alone.

196
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
Officer Yang.

197
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,380
Hello.

198
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,380
I came here today to see

199
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,380
where Zhong Mei Bao worked before.

200
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
Could you please be my guide?

201
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,380
I've already called your leader.

202
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,380
You're alone?

203
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Where's that person?

204
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,380
Last time,

205
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,380
I was offended by you.

206
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,380
I apologize for him.

207
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,380
Okay. Wait for me.

208
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,380
Dong Lin.

209
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,380
Please wait for me.

210
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
No, no.

211
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,380
Bao Luo is busy today.

212
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
How about I take you there?

213
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,380
I'll go first.

214
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,380
No need. Thank you.

215
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,380
This way, please.

216
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,380
Okay.

217
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,380
Hello.

218
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Hello.

219
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,380
Hello.

220
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,380
Why do I like her so much?

221
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,380
I think it's because of her weight.

222
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,380
Hello.

223
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
It's okay.

224
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,380
Thank you.

225
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,380
It's already midnight, right?

226
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
There's something about dinner.

227
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,380
What is it that's so hard to tell us?

228
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,380
There's a big case in this small village.

229
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,380
It's hard to call it a day.

230
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,860
If we keep letting people see us,

231
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,260
we'll be affected by the case.

232
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,940
Yes.

233
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,140
Please.

234
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,540
It's a bit tight.

235
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,620
How many people do you usually live here?

236
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,460
I live with Bao Luo.

237
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,980
The house on the left is my room.

238
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,980
The one on the right is Bao Luo's room.

239
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,780
Please sit down, Zhong Fei.

240
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,420
Please sit down.

241
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,780
I feel that you're familiar with this place.

242
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,780
You know how to operate the machine.

243
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
You know that?

244
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,460
I've worked here before.

245
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,300
You insist.

246
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,460
No.

247
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,100
I was busy with something urgent.

248
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
I came to help.

249
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,780
I often came here when I was resting.

250
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,500
I like to make coffee.

251
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,420
You just like to make coffee?

252
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,260
Officer Zhong

253
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,740
has always suspected that

254
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,260
I have something special to do with Bao Luo.

255
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,460
It's nothing.

256
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,900
The job we're doing is

257
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,180
to be patient and ask for justice.

258
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,420
Then we find the truth.

259
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,340
I hope you can understand.

260
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,660
I understand.

261
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,980
You're doing this for the case.

262
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,500
Please believe me.

263
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,580
He's a very outstanding detective.

264
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,860
He'll catch the murderer.

265
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,780
But

266
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,860
you're a criminal.

267
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,660
The procedure and regulations

268
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,860
should be respected.

269
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,660
So I hope you can tell your master

270
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,860
after you go back.

271
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,380
Please do everything in your power.

272
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,980
If he's been sued,

273
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,700
it's not good for the investigation.

274
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,340
Marry him.

275
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,940
How are you?

276
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,100
Xie Bao Luo,

277
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,980
you had a free lecture last time.

278
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,660
Now you really have a temper.

279
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,560
I want to make three more coffees.

280
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,740
You can't even tell me

281
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
what you used.

282
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,460
What happened?

283
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,500
Did you get the news?

284
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,340
It's useless to观see no news.

285
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,300
You must have felt afraid.

286
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,100
So much information about

287
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
me.

288
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
I'm thirsty.

289
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,420
Do you have water?

290
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,420
I'll get you some water.

291
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,420
Have some tea.

292
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
Okay.

293
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:56,420
Chief Officer Zhong, you're here.

294
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Why didn't you stay with Chief Officer Yao?

295
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,420
I came to investigate this case.

296
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,420
I talked to your colleague.

297
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,420
You can investigate it.

298
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,420
But you're like this.

299
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
You broke into my room.

300
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Do you have any information?

301
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,420
Do you have any information?

302
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
No.

303
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,420
I went to the toilet.

304
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,420
I made a mistake.

305
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,420
I'm sorry.

306
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,420
Chief Officer Xie,

307
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,420
thank you for being with us

308
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
in the investigation.

309
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
I just hope you can find the murderer as soon as possible.

310
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,420
We'll do our best.

311
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,420
When was the last time you saw Chief Officer Zhong?

312
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
The case was released that afternoon.

313
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,420
The last time I saw him,

314
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,420
he left the cafe.

315
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,420
Please think about it.

316
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Did anything suspicious

317
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,420
or suspicious happen on the day of the case?

318
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,420
Didn't I say that before?

319
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
Chief Officer Zhong...

320
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,420
There should be many pursuers in the media.

321
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,420
Do you know that?

322
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,420
There are no suspicious pursuers

323
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,420
in such a pretty girl.

324
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,420
Xiao Yang, do you have a pursuer?

325
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,420
What kind of gift

326
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,420
do your pursuers usually give you?

327
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,420
That's my idea.

328
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
Pretty girls are good.

329
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
There are so many gifts

330
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
that I give to them.

331
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,420
Look.

332
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
There are bags, shoes,

333
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
handkerchiefs, and this.

334
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,420
Is there a gift

335
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,420
that you give girls?

336
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,420
I gave this to Mei Bao.

337
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
But she likes it.

338
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
So you took this

339
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
as a reward for your personal business yesterday.

340
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
I said it.

341
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
I was wrong.

342
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
I know what you're suspecting.

343
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
I'm not afraid of you.

344
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
Mei Bao has many pursuers.

345
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,420
But it's not me.

346
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,420
I have my favorite person.

347
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,420
I'll help you.

348
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
No need.

349
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
It's okay.

350
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
No need.

351
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,420
I want to be your sister.

352
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,420
Thank you.

353
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,420
You're a girl who can make wheels.

354
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,420
Don't you know

355
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
who I'm protecting?

356
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
She likes

357
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,420
the girl who can make wheels.

358
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
I...

359
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,420
I'm a girl who can make wheels.

360
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
What's wrong?

361
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
Nothing.

362
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,420
Where did you get this?

363
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,420
I bought it online.

364
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
I bought it for her?

365
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,420
I want to try

366
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
to see the world from this height.

367
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
How do you feel?

368
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Officer Zhong, I think

369
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,420
you should think about it.

370
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,420
Bao Luo and Mei Bao

371
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,420
have nothing to do with each other.

372
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,420
Have you thought about it?

373
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
Mei Bao is such a beautiful girl.

374
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,420
Can you look at her?

375
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,420
No matter what I do,

376
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,420
Bao Luo has all her heart

377
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
on her.

378
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,420
Because of the previous experience,

379
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,420
I thought

380
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,420
I had to live

381
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,420
my life

382
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
alone.

383
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
But after this girl appeared,

384
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
I suddenly thought about

385
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,420
her happiness.

386
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,420
Have you told Zhong Bao about this?

387
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Mei Bao is the only one who supports me.

388
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,420
That's how she is.

389
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
She always makes me feel

390
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,420
that I can tell her anything.

391
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
So you're practicing

392
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,420
to live with her?

393
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
If I want to take good care of her,

394
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,420
I need to prepare for it in advance.

395
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
Did you confess to her?

396
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Confess?

397
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,420
No, I didn't.

398
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,420
You can't confess?

399
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,420
What's the point of that?

400
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
I don't know

401
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
if she's interested in me.

402
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,420
How do you know

403
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,420
if she's interested in you

404
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
if you don't confess?

405
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
How did you

406
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,420
confess to other girls before?

407
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
My girlfriend said she liked me first.

408
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,420
Then we got together.

409
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
What if she didn't?

410
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,420
Maybe you should forget it.

411
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,420
You might have missed a lot.

412
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
What about you?

413
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
Did you get it all?

414
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
I think so.

415
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,420
It's because you're pretty.

416
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,420
Men won't reject you.

417
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,420
That's not necessarily true.

418
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
I always think

419
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,420
the people who are always pretty

420
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
and their lives

421
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,420
are more relaxed than others.

422
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,420
How can someone's life be relaxed?

423
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Hold on.

424
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
Did I say something wrong?

425
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,420
No.

426
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
If you really don't know how to say it,

427
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
then write it down with a paper.

428
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,420
Chen.

429
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,420
This little road

430
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
is quite useful.

431
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
Last time, it was because of a love letter.

432
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
And I sent it to you.

433
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,420
What are you doing?

434
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Help.

435
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
Give it to me.

436
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
No.

437
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
No.

438
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,420
No.

439
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,420
Open the door, little brother.

440
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,420
Hurry up.

441
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
You're a letter.

442
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
You're a paper.

443
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,420
This means

444
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,420
she really likes that girl.

445
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
Why are you so serious?

446
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,420
I've read your letter.

447
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
I don't quite understand

448
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,420
how I look now.

449
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
You're sure you like me?

450
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
I've always thought

451
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
I'm not trustworthy.

452
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
I might bring happiness to others.

453
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
But when I met her,

454
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,420
I saw that God was so unfair to her.

455
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
She's still working hard

456
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,420
to live.

457
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
I suddenly realized

458
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,420
that I might have the ability

459
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,420
to make others happy.

460
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
I'm sure.

461
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
I'm sure I like you.

462
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
After that day,

463
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
she suddenly disappeared.

464
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
That's the last time I met her.

465
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,420
Okay, I'm leaving.

466
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,420
Bye.

467
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,420
This is the letter

468
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,420
that Qiao Wei asked me to bring to you.

469
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
Bao Luo,

470
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,420
I'm going to be a surgery master soon.

471
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,420
I'm a little scared.

472
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
So I want to write a letter to you first.

473
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
The doctor said I can only live for half a year.

474
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
If I do a surgery,

475
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
I can live for two years.

476
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,420
But the success rate is only 50%.

477
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
I chose a good surgery at that time.

478
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,420
Because I think it's not

479
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,420
much different

480
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
from two years.

481
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,420
Until I met you,

482
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,420
I realized that

483
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,420
two years and half

484
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,420
are actually very different.

485
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,420
If I can spend more time with you,

486
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
even for a year,

487
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,420
even for a day,

488
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
for me,

489
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,420
it's all about happiness.

490
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,420
I don't know if I can

491
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
see you again

492
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,420
after the surgery.

493
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,420
If possible,

494
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,420
I want to tell you

495
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
that

496
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
I like you too.

497
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,420
All right.

498
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
All right.

499
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Mr. Xie,

500
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
your story of

501
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,420
the ghost god of today

502
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,420
is coming to an end.

503
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,420
We've heard it all.

504
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,420
It's touching.

505
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,420
But what's really unfortunate is that

506
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,420
our police help

507
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
is most likely to be

508
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
emotional.

509
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
You've told us so much.

510
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,420
It seems like you've been talking about yourself.

511
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,420
Actually, we hope

512
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,420
you can talk to us

513
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
about Zhong Mei Bao.

514
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
We're friends.

515
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,420
But it doesn't mean

516
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
I know everything about her.

517
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
Trust is always waiting for a price.

518
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,420
And the fastest way to get trust

519
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,420
is to exchange secrets.

520
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,420
You've talked so much together.

521
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
I believe it's not just about talking about yourself.

522
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
Family, friends, and lovers.

523
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
You know that, right?

524
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,420
Mr. Xie,

525
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,420
if you really want us to catch the real brother,

526
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,420
you can give us the clue.

527
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,420
It's important to know.

528
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,420
Actually, I'm curious.

529
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,420
Why do you like him?

530
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
You don't really know

531
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,420
his personality,

532
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
his blood type,

533
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,420
and his past.

534
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,420
Actually,

535
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,420
I'm not sure

536
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,420
why I like him.

537
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
Did I tell you about my childhood?

538
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,420
It's not that happy anyway.

539
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,420
Do you want to hear it?

540
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,420
Actually, when I was born,

541
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
my father passed away.

542
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Until now,

543
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,420
I haven't seen him.

544
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,420
My mother was only 17.

545
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
She took me from the countryside

546
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,420
to the city to find my father.

547
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,420
For a few years,

548
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
I didn't find him.

549
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,420
But my mother

550
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,420
got along well with another man.

551
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
Then, I had my brother.

552
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Ah Jin, I'm back.

553
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,420
My mother was a little bit anxious at that time.

554
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
She was still fine after a few days.

555
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
I was a rich man.

556
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
I was lazy to cook.

557
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,420
I spent too much time

558
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,420
spending my money on the house.

559
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,420
I even owed her a piece of my salary.

560
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,420
You took the money.

561
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
What are you doing?

562
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
Old man.

563
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,420
Old man.

564
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
Dad.

565
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,420
You let me go.

566
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
Let me go.

567
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
Let me go.

568
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
Let go of me.

569
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
Remember him.

570
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
Old man, listen to me.

571
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,420
No matter if it's your father,

572
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
or his wife,

573
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
how can you give me some money?

574
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,420
When I was a little girl,

575
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,420
she did some business.

576
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
She was arrested.

577
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
Mr. Police.

578
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Is Liu Yanzi here?

579
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
He's been here before.

580
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
He just left.

581
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,420
Mr. Police.

582
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,420
I said there was no one inside.

583
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,420
He didn't come back.

584
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
There was no one inside.

585
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,420
I said there was no one inside.

586
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,420
Old man, let go of me.

587
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,420
Let go of me.

588
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
Let go of me.

589
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,420
Old man, you're still sick.

590
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
What did you say?

591
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,420
You...

592
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,420
Are you okay, Mr. Police?

593
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,420
Be gentle.

594
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,420
Be gentle.

595
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,420
Mr. Police.

596
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Mr. Police.

597
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
You misunderstood him.

598
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
Mr. Police.

599
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
Listen to me.

600
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,420
You misunderstood him.

601
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,420
But I misunderstood him.

602
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,420
Old woman.

603
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,420
You misunderstood him.

604
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,420
Mr. Police.

605
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,420
You misunderstood him.

606
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,420
Let's go.

607
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
At that time,

608
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,420
many people in the pharmacy

609
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,420
took away all the things

610
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,420
that our family could move.

611
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
Nothing.

612
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,420
When my mom was on the way,

613
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
she met Uncle Wang.

614
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,420
Since Uncle Wang was with me,

615
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,420
my mom has stopped working.

616
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,420
She drinks all day and plays cards.

617
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,420
A-Ju, let's go to school.

618
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
But it's okay.

619
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,420
Uncle Wang's income is okay.

620
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,420
It's okay for me and my brother.

621
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
It's better for my mom and my sister-in-law.

622
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,420
Wei Bao.

623
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,420
Wei Bao.

624
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,420
Go to school.

625
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,420
Come on.

626
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,420
Here.

627
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,420
Take it.

628
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,420
Have breakfast and go to school.

629
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,420
Don't put your belly down.

630
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,420
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

631
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,420
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

632
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
Let's go.

633
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,420
But my mom doesn't like him that much.

634
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,420
Maybe because he's too good.

635
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,420
Our friendship is very good.

636
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,420
So we should work harder.

637
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,420
Okay, boss.

638
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
But what I said is good.

639
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,420
It's not that he's really a good person.

640
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
Hello.

641
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
Hello, Mrs. Chen.

642
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,420
This is the office of the provincial police.

643
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
I'm Li Jun.

644
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
You're the one who got the award.

645
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
You got 15,000.

646
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
But it's the first time...

647
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
You're so kind.

648
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
Take a photo with me.

649
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,420
Come with me.

650
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
Let's go.

651
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,420
Wei Bao.

652
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,420
Take care of your mom.

653
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,420
Take care of A-Jun.

654
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,420
I'll call her back later.

655
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,420
Mom.

656
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,420
I gave it to you before.

657
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,420
I'm afraid something bad will happen to you.

658
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,420
What is it?

659
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,420
You're not going to write a letter to me, are you?

660
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,420
You know how to make trouble for me.

661
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,420
Mom.

662
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
Mr. Wang sent you a letter.

663
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,420
You go over there first.

664
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,420
Mr. Wang has been in there for so long.

665
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,420
Are we going to visit him?

666
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
I'll go there if I have time.

667
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,420
Okay, I'll go to the bar.

668
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,420
You should eat well at home.

669
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,420
Mom, you're so kind.

670
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,420
I'm buying food.

671
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
I left it for you last time.

672
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,420
You're so fast.

673
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,420
I'm done with it.

674
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,420
Mom.

675
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,420
I'm not good at talking.

676
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,420
It's okay to see you.

677
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,420
Mom.

678
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,420
I'll go to the bar to eat with you.

679
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
I'll go to the bar to eat with you.

680
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,420
Listen to me.

681
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,420
Mom.

682
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
Did you finish the money of Mr. Wang?

683
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,420
The money of Mr. Wang is mine.

684
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
Yes.

685
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,420
Are you okay?

686
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,420
I miss you so much.

687
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,420
I'm fine.

688
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
What about A-Ju and Mei Bao?

689
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Are they okay?

690
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,420
They're not very good.

691
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,420
What's wrong with them?

692
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,420
Did you give me the bank card last time?

693
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,420
We've already spent the money.

694
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
What should we do?

695
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,420
I'm in a hurry.

696
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,420
A-Ju and Mei Bao are going to pay for the tuition.

697
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,420
We can't delay the child's life.

698
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,420
Actually,

699
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,420
I also hid a card.

700
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,420
It's behind the bed head cabinet in our room.

701
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,420
I thought it was used when we got married.

702
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,420
Save the words.

703
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,420
The password.

704
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,420
The password.

705
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,420
Wait.

706
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,420
I'll go.

707
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
What's the number?

708
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,420
315.

709
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
You're a big girl.

710
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,420
315-204.

711
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,420
3...

712
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
Who is he?

713
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
God, don't talk to me.

714
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,420
How can you be so bold?

715
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,420
You can't take me.

716
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,420
Who are you?

717
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
What are you doing?

718
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
Get out of here.

719
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,420
Get out of here.

720
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
Yan Yuan, get out of here.

721
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
What are you doing?

722
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
You're going out.

723
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,420
Mom has another day of rest.

724
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,420
Who knows that one day,

725
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,420
I just got home.

726
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,420
I'm back.

727
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,420
A-Ju.

728
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
A-Ju.

729
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,420
Sister.

730
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
He's back.

731
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
Slow down.

732
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,420
Here, Mei Bao is back.

733
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
Slow down.

734
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,420
Go.

735
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,420
Are you okay?

736
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,420
Mei Bao, we have money.

737
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,420
Mom said he has one million.

738
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,420
With this money,

739
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,420
I can go to the New Dragon

740
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:18,020
to do the

741
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,420
business.

742
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,420
We can have a good life.

743
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,420
Mom, it's Uncle Wang's money.

744
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,420
Who is Uncle Wang?

745
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
Leave it to you.

746
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,420
How can you say that, Mei Bao?

747
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,420
You can't give him all the money.

748
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,420
He's also a family.

749
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,420
Do you understand?

750
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,420
I will take care of you.

751
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,420
A few days before Uncle Wang's birth,

752
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
my mom took one million.

753
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,420
She even escaped to another city overnight.

754
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,420
Actually, I think sometimes,

755
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,420
you and my mom are a bit like each other.

756
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,420
They all like someone who is a bit cruel.

757
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,420
Maybe,

758
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,420
that's all.

759
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
We can only face our bad habits,

760
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,420
so that we can be a little better.

761
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,420
I understand this kind of joke.

762
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,420
But I don't agree.

763
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,420
I think you are not as bad as you think.

764
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,420
Let's talk about my mom.

765
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,420
Although she has met many

766
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
people who are in a mess,

767
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,420
she is not familiar with it.

768
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,420
But in the end,

769
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,420
she still meets someone who is sincere to her.

770
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,420
I just think

771
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,420
no matter what kind of person you are,

772
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,420
in this world,

773
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,420
there will be someone who is most suitable for you.

774
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,420
Just like two pieces of clay,

775
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,420
the one who can only find the right person to be together

776
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,420
can be complete.

777
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,420
Her life is quite complicated.

778
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,420
No wonder we can't find

779
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
information about her family.

780
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,420
I'm afraid that we haven't been in touch for a long time.

781
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
I haven't seen her family face to face.

782
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,420
Zhong Wei Bao's life circle is very small.

783
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,420
Basically, it's in this small area.

784
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,420
You can recognize her like this.

785
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,420
If anyone around her

786
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,420
is very close to her,

787
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,420
even in her room,

788
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,420
you should know it very well.

789
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
I don't know.

790
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,420
Are you not clear or don't want to say it?

791
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,420
No.

792
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,420
Although we don't have the access to the road,

793
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,420
we can easily find these people

794
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,420
through the hall and elevator.

795
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
It's just a matter of time.

796
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,420
Mr. Xie,

797
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,420
would you like to help us

798
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
to save this time?

799
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,420
I'm always helping you.

800
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
I admire you.

801
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,420
You always answer my questions in the middle of the road.

802
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
You've said a lot,

803
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
but you always say something

804
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,420
that has nothing to do with me.

805
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
Mr. Xie,

806
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,420
according to my observation,

807
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,420
you're a very humble person.

808
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
Do you think you can help Zhong Wei Bao?

809
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,420
Do you think you can care about your girlfriend,

810
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
about the girl in the wheel,

811
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,420
about those people who got in the car accident?

812
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
According to me,

813
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,420
you're selfish.

814
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,420
You only care about yourself.

815
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,420
Let me ask you again.

816
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,420
What exactly did you hide

817
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,420
in Zhong Wei Bao's case?

818
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,420
In the brainさ

819
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:47,420
In the eyebrows

820
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,420
I'm quite confident in my level.

821
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,420
I'm not arguing with you.

822
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,420
You don't have any witnesses.

823
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,420
You don't have any misunderstandings.

824
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,420
Why do you suspect me?

825
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,420
Mr. Xie, we're not suspecting you.

826
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
We just...

827
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
We've finished what we said.

828
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,420
Can I leave now?

829
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,420
You seem to have no right to keep me here.

830
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,420
Master, didn't you tell me that you don't have any feelings for someone else?

831
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,420
Where did you go just now?

832
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,420
I'm not joking.

833
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,420
I'm getting curious.

834
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:48,660
What's the point of this

835
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,420
to ask her family if they've come to find her?

836
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,420
Tell them yourself.

837
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
I know.

838
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,420
I'll go check on Zhou Meibao's family.

839
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,420
Xie Xiang,

840
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,420
I found the chair I checked for you.

841
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,420
Thank you.

842
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,420
Macintosh.

843
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Why is it so expensive?

844
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,420
Is it a very famous brand?

845
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
It's not a brand.

846
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,420
What brand is it?

847
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,420
It's a construction designer.

848
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Let me see.

849
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,420
Because a construction designer is a design example.

850
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,380
穆渡周

851
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,540
犬

852
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,760
熏头

853
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,580
There are not many cars out there

854
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,740
in blonde

855
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:32,160
The beleaved cars made

856
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,440
in brown

857
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,540
and

858
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,800
I know

859
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,740
where

860
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,740
I will follow anywhere I know

861
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,740
Wherever I will go

862
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:04,740
You're the only one

863
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,740
Carry your love wherever you go

864
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,740
Cause I know

865
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,740
You and I

866
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,740
We're gonna walk a million miles in the rubble

867
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,740
You and I

868
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,740
We're gonna keep getting in another trouble

869
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,740
Now we're falling down

870
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,740
I'll take you high

871
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,740
Bring you back around

872
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,740
Just you and I

873
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,740
And I know

874
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,740
Wherever I will go

875
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:01,740
You're the only one

876
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,740
I will follow anywhere I know

877
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,740
Wherever I will go

878
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:20,740
You're the only one

879
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,740
Carry your love wherever you go

880
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,740
Cause I know

881
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,740
Cause there's a way around the fences

882
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,740
There's a word on the wall

883
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,740
And as we swear around the edges

884
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Could it be the angels call?

885
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:53,740
Could it be the only one

886
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
And I know

887
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,740
Wherever I will go

888
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:05,740
You're the only one

889
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,740
I will follow anywhere I know

890
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,740
Wherever I will go

891
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:23,740
You're the only one

892
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,740
I will follow anywhere I go

893
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,740
You're the only one

894
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,740
I will follow anywhere I go

895
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,740
You're the only one

896
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,740
I will follow anywhere I go

897
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,740
You're the only one

898
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:56,740
I will follow anywhere I go
