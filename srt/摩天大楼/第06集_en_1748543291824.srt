00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,280
â€¦

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello, auntie.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll be right over. Wait for me.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll be right over. Wait for me.

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The Greatest of Times

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Episode 1

7
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I admit that I have a bad temper.

8
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But you can't be the murderer

9
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
because I have this temper.

10
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yuan Lianwen, believe me.

11
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't be so mean.

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm a bit disgusting.

13
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We found your fingerprints on the scene.

14
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So you're one of the important suspects in the case.

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
How can I...

16
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No,

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
are all the police officers so noisy?

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you talking about?

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What do you mean?

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're accusing us of not being responsible for our work?

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, no, no.

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm not saying that.

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm really

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
a normal pervert.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Zhong, I...

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No, no, no.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm also a bit disgusting.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Put your hand back.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We don't need to be so perverted.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But since you've admitted it,

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll write you a more specific one.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The attitude is good.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Maybe you can save a few days.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Forget it.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let me tell you.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Most of the business owners

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
are from my house.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I helped them to make a loan.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And they paid the household expenses.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So I know

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
their family background and relationship.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I have someone to write a total of money.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Who?

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The person who moved to 1602.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Lin Da Sen.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Didn't you say

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Lin Da Sen and Zhong Wei Bao's relationship

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
is also the relationship between the landlord and the rent?

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is the privacy of others.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Besides, they are all my clients.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But I didn't expect that

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you guys would just put your head down.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I suspect that I'm the murderer.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Zhong,

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Liang Jiu, let me tell you.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In the most cases of the murder case,

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
the most emotional ratio is the most reliable.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Lin Da Sen and Zhong Wei Bao's relationship

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
is known to you.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They don't only have feelings for each other,

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
but also have a low-key relationship.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Then

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
isn't his suspicion bigger than mine?

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There is another type of

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
high-risk combat ratio.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's the robberies and the mood.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You are the kind.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You are the kind.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Zhong,

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I have evidence.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Actually,

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've seen it.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What else have you seen?

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Zhong, is this nice?

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's beautiful.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Really?

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's so expensive.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Is it a double or LV?

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How do you know only the double and double?

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Then the double is for the person who treats you as a couple.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Brother, how do you read this?

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's called

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
a...

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
a couple.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
A couple.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
A couple.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A couple.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
A couple.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Dear, you don't need to read it.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay?

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You do this every time.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Last time, you gave me a pocket bag

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
for my birthday.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You have to read Hermes.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hermes.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Seventh Age.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay?

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't make me feel so awkward every time.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm not talking about you.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You are a building designer now.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Everyone knows you are Li Jing Sheng's son-in-law.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You are so considerate.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't make people think you are a man.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I got it.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I got it.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's wrong with him?

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm really embarrassed

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
as a man.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
As a man,

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
you two are both embarrassed.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What's going on?

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mr. Lin,

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't understand

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
what you are talking about with us.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Is this related to Zhong Mei Bao?

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Wow.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This is so pretty.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What brand is this?

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ge Zun.

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ge Zun.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Have you heard of it?

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is the brand that people know.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How could I go to buy that LV?

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Poochie.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I want that one for you.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And you don't know

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that he is a couple?

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No, I don't mean that.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm going to have dinner

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
with him soon.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Go.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Honey.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes?

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What's this?

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You have a client.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are so mysterious.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I want to give him some gifts.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't know what to do.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
How do you suggest?

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't recommend it.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a French brand.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
People don't know it.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's quite expensive.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't recommend it.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't recommend it.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I just bought this brand.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's pretty, right?

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's pretty.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Do you like it?

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is a French brand.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's not good.

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
People don't know it.

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Zun.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It looks too expensive.

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can't say it.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You like it.

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wear it.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can buy it.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You can buy it.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's pretty.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You bought it?

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes.

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's pretty.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Look.

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's pretty.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What brand is it?

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't ask me about the brand.

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I bought it because

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
it's good for the design.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's not because of its brand.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Look.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's not good.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's not good.

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Zun.

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I can only wear this when I work.

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Then you can wear it when you work.

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
A girl

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
must have some pretty heels.

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
To buy shoes

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
is to buy her heels

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and her design.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's not to buy her logo.

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If it's the same as everyone else,

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
isn't it a low-end?

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Do you like it?

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
My girl.

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm a phoenix.

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What prince is he?

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He's pretending all day.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I hate people like him.

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Lin Meng Yu, you're good.

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You think

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you can be a TV star

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
when you're a person

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
of your own?

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How can a TV star be so good?

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No.

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Zun.

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I know it's wrong.

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But you think

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
it's because I have this nickname

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that I've provided

204
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
so many positive evidence.

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Right?

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think you're a good person.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The evidence you've provided

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
is to prove their friendship.

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Besides, it means

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
you and Lin Da Sen

211
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
are his mother's son-in-law.

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes.

213
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Zun.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Brother Yang.

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You still don't understand.

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Lin Da Sen

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
doesn't really like Mei Bao.

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He's always angry at her

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
because he's at home.

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He has to find some advantages

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
in other places.

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's how he can balance.

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's how he can balance.

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Later,

225
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mei Bao found out about this

226
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and she's always sad.

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I love Lin Da Sen.

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Mei Bao is really pitiful.

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Mr. Yun.

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You mentioned

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that Zhou Mei Bao's apartment

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
was in the name of Lin Da Sen.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But it's actually Li Mo Li's.

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's right.

236
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Then Li Mo Li

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
knows that the apartment

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
was rented by Zhou Mei Bao?

239
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I know.

240
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
She's so bold.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I think she's a good person.

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
She knows how to deal with him.

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
She's a good person.

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
She's a good person.

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
She's a good person.

246
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
She knows how to deal with him.

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
She knows how to deal with him.

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
She knows how to deal with him.

249
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm really sorry.

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's like this.

251
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Although the purchase

252
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
is not a rental order,

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
the contract you rented before

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
is almost expired.

255
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So I arranged

256
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
a new apartment meeting

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
with you today.

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll sign a contract again.

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay. No problem.

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Mr. Lin may be busy with work.

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We'll wait for him.

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay.

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is good.

264
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hello.

265
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Mrs. Lin.

266
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Please have a seat.

267
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Please have a seat.

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you.

269
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Well,

270
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
this is

271
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Mrs. Lin,

272
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Mr. Lin's wife.

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is

274
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
new customer,

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Zhou Mei Bao.

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hello.

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hello.

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Sorry.

279
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
My husband

280
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
can't come to my office

281
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and I don't want to sign this contract.

282
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's okay.

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well,

284
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
how about

285
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
we confirm

286
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the new rent first?

287
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You all know

288
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
that our company

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
has been growing a lot recently.

290
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's okay.

291
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I told you

292
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
the rent is still

293
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
according to the original price.

294
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The price is 3,000 yuan.

295
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You can give him the cash

296
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
at any cost.

297
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What do you think?

298
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I have no problem.

299
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Thank you.

300
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And thank you for your husband.

301
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Excuse me.

302
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Do you like this brand, too?

303
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

304
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This brand

305
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
is not so popular in China.

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I've never seen anyone wear it.

307
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's really a coincidence.

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm not a celebrity.

309
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Many people don't know

310
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
her name.

311
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
She's from England.

312
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
She's the one

313
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
who has a strong sense of smell.

314
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm really relieved.

315
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Thank you.

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Thank you.

317
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Thank you.

318
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I suddenly remember

319
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that Li Mo Li's house

320
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
is different from others.

321
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No matter what others say,

322
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
we have to see

323
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
how many houses are there.

324
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We'll make a decision

325
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
than the three houses.

326
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Li Mo Li chose this one

327
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
when he came up.

328
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He was successful that day.

329
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He didn't even get married.

330
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So I was so worried.

331
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
When Lin Dacen

332
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
was just in the hands of money

333
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and wanted to invest,

334
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
actually,

335
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
the investment buying house

336
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
is the same as buying anywhere.

337
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But if we buy this one,

338
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
we can get a happy relationship

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and a good deal.

340
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
How do you know

341
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that this house is not

342
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
for Zhong Mei Bao to own?

343
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Mei Bao will never

344
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
open this door.

345
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
She's not

346
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
a girl who's shy at all.

347
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
She's with Lin Dacen.

348
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's easy to say

349
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that she's a young lady

350
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
with a rich old age.

351
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
She's a man.

352
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
She's blind.

353
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why are you so excited?

354
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You seem to be

355
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Lin Dacen's lover.

356
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
No, I...

357
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm not worth it for her.

358
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So when we arrived in Qianyue,

359
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Li Mo Li didn't find

360
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
the identity of Zhong Mei Bao.

361
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He saw her necklace.

362
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And it's a small brand.

363
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
As a woman,

364
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
it's a little bit

365
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
of a direct feeling.

366
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Maybe she thought

367
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
it was a coincidence.

368
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But the thing that happened

369
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
later on is more wonderful.

370
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It feels like

371
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
walking on the road

372
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and being killed by thunder.

373
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I can only say that

374
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Lin Dacen's kind of bastard

375
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
can't even see it.

376
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Father.

377
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Captain, excuse me.

378
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I heard that you have

379
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
a person here

380
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
who's in a hurry, right?

381
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes, it's him.

382
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
How long do you need

383
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
to be here?

384
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's almost there.

385
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Why don't you take him away?

386
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Brother.

387
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I thought you...

388
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's true.

389
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I... I told you just now

390
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
that you can't tell anyone.

391
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Otherwise,

392
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
my house won't be sold out.

393
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Thank you.

394
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You're welcome.

395
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Go.

396
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Go.

397
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Master,

398
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
he shouldn't be a murderer.

399
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Of course not.

400
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But

401
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
did you think that

402
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
the reasons

403
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
for his doubtful feelings

404
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
were a bit strong?

405
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes.

406
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think

407
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
he really likes Zhong Mei Bao.

408
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Do you think

409
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Lin Dacen

410
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
is a lover

411
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
so he's so annoying?

412
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
There's too much possibility

413
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
in this case.

414
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Isn't there

415
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
no clue?

416
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This person is so scary.

417
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Who's the other suspect

418
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
who's the other one?

419
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We've compared

420
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
all suspects.

421
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Including the dead

422
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and confirmed the suspect.

423
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
They're all the same.

424
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So,

425
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
there's a new suspect again.

426
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Group steal.

427
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This neighborhood is so scary.

428
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Do you think

429
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
it's the repair staff

430
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
who's in the house?

431
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We've asked the housekeeper.

432
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
There's no repair record on that floor.

433
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Chief.

434
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Tell me.

435
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Xiaoyang.

436
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We've been

437
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
trying to ask you something.

438
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What is it?

439
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Is it true

440
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
that your master

441
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
was sent to the hospital?

442
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What kind of thing?

443
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's you.

444
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
A woman

445
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
was sent to the hospital

446
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
a few days ago.

447
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
She's called Cao Cao.

448
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Cao Cao?

449
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That woman

450
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
is still a rich woman.

451
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
She's rich?

452
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I thought you knew.

453
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You don't know

454
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
if it's true or not.

455
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
My master

456
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
is not doing his normal job.

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If it's true,

458
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
we should

459
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
leave early.

460
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Chief.

461
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If you want to save Ye Meili,

462
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
it's not impossible.

463
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll sell my phone.

464
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Why?

465
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's like this.

466
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We're

467
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
in contact with

468
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
the repair staff.

469
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The phone is very annoying.

470
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's a exaggeration.

471
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's even more troublesome to get it together.

472
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And I heard

473
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
that his son

474
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
has been disobeying the sentence.

475
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He didn't stop

476
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
from being a judge

477
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and didn't let him go.

478
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And he also

479
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
asked a very famous lawyer

480
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
to help him get out of the law firm.

481
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He has a son?

482
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The one who was sold by the ghost.

483
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He's just been married to Ye Shujun.

484
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He's not a victim.

485
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Why did he

486
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
ask the lawyer

487
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
to help him?

488
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Who knows?

489
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll prove it to you.

490
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Think of a way to help me.

491
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's okay to bother the chief.

492
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll wait a few more days.

493
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay.

494
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Lin Mengyu.

495
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Although your case

496
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
has been reported to the police,

497
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
you still have to

498
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
actively cooperate with

499
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
the Central Security Service.

500
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Thank you.

501
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Goodbye.

502
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I knew you'd come to me.

503
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Are you okay?

504
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm fine.

505
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You don't want to know

506
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
if I'm okay?

507
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm not concerned.

508
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Then what are you concerned about?

509
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Are you a cop?

510
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Nonsense.

511
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Let me find you a job.

512
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Don't worry.

513
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I've said what I should.

514
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll do it.

515
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll do it.

516
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll do it.

517
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I didn't say

518
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
what I should say.

519
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Thank you.

520
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
For you,

521
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm willing to do anything.

522
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm almost done with the second-hand procedure.

523
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And the police are looking for me again today.

524
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
They said they found my fingerprints.

525
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm fine.

526
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I won't give up on you.

527
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I won't give up on you.

528
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I won't give up on you.

529
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I won't give up on you.

530
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I won't give up on you.

531
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I won't give up on you.

532
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I won't give up on you.

533
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Master.

534
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Do you remember Xie Bao Luo once lied to us?

535
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He said he stopped by a shop

536
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
when Zhong Mei Bao just moved here.

537
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I remember.

538
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We've been investigating for a while.

539
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Actually, it was a year ago.

540
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I went to the shop yesterday to check the details.

541
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It was January 1st last year.

542
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It was 1.13 p.m.

543
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That is, after the party.

544
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What a coincidence.

545
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Why did you hang up with the party?

546
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And it seems that the monitoring

547
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
was a bit of a problem that night.

548
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What?

549
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What did you say?

550
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You're so far away from me.

551
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
How can I hear it clearly?

552
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Come in.

553
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What?

554
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
There's a doctor.

555
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He's called a rascal.

556
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Master.

557
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The person seems to be here.

558
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's go with you.

559
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Did we start?

560
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I have something else to do.

561
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It won't take you long.

562
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Zhang, are you starting the recording?

563
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm waiting.

564
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Miss Ding Er Lin.

565
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Let's invite you here today.

566
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Let's invite you here today.

567
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What's wrong with you?

568
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Captain Zhong.

569
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Another guest is here next door.

570
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Who will go there?

571
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll go.

572
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Li, go and check with me.

573
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Okay.

574
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What's going on?

575
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You handled the holiday activities

576
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
10 months ago?

577
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes.

578
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's a good idea.

579
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Isn't this kind of activity

580
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
usually organized by a housekeeper?

581
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
How can a housekeeper have my heart?

582
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm the owner.

583
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What about the past few years?

584
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Why didn't you do it the past few years?

585
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I was also bullied by a friend.

586
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Isn't it your wife?

587
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Don't be so surprised.

588
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm leaving.

589
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Didn't I tell you?

590
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm coming back.

591
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm coming back.

592
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm coming back.

593
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm coming back.

594
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm leaving.

595
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
He said he's already in the house.

596
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
He's been waiting for me.

597
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
He's been waiting for me.

598
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He's been waiting for me.

599
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
He's leaving anyway.

600
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Zhiliang.

601
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
How are you going to spend the holiday today?

602
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How can I spend it?

603
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Just spend it alone.

604
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm watching a movie with him.

605
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm watching a movie with him.

606
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm watching a movie with him.

607
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Alone?

608
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't believe you.

609
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I hate spending the holidays the most.

610
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
No matter what the holidays are,

611
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm still reminded of how lonely I am.

612
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Zhiliang.

613
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I can't spend the holidays with you.

614
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry.

615
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Are you okay?

616
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm not talking about you.

617
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm just being selfish.

618
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How about this?

619
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
How about I have a party this year?

620
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
A party?

621
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Just on the rooftop.

622
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You know,

623
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the best effect is on the rooftop.

624
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'll call everyone in the building.

625
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm here, too.

626
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You won't be lonely like this.

627
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Most importantly,

628
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I want to tell you all of it.

629
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
A'Ling.

630
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Do you know why I came to you?

631
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Maybe you want to make it more convenient.

632
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I know.

633
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Actually, you have a lot of choices.

634
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There are many people who like you.

635
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
There are many people who like me.

636
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
There are many people who want to sleep with me.

637
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But do you know what's the hardest thing in this career?

638
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The hardest thing is

639
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
finding someone who knows you well.

640
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Who is this person?

641
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm still here, too.

642
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Lin Mengyi seems to listen to you.

643
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Because what I said makes sense.

644
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He is not a fool.

645
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He won't do anything bad to him.

646
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Are you really a fool?

647
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Of course.

648
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't need to be a fool.

649
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The person who works in the office

650
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
often stays in the coffee shop for a whole day.

651
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I've been chatting with him.

652
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What do you think

653
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
about Lin Mengyi and Zhong Mi Bao?

654
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Nothing.

655
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
They are just

656
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
single-celled.

657
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You can tell that.

658
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Mr. Lin, you are here.

659
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What would you like to have?

660
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Nothing.

661
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Nothing?

662
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Okay.

663
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What's wrong with you, Mr. Lin?

664
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You look very quiet.

665
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I don't look quiet, do I?

666
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I've been looking at you these days.

667
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I think you are in a bad state.

668
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You want to change your life.

669
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Is there anything wrong?

670
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Maybe I'm getting older.

671
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't have enough sleep.

672
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You are so old today.

673
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Sorry.

674
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I just think you look

675
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
much younger than me.

676
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Why do you think you are the oldest?

677
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I think I'm suitable

678
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
for every old man.

679
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Mr. Lin, are you kidding me?

680
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Don't you know

681
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
there is a popular word

682
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
called Uncle?

683
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'll treat you to this.

684
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Thank you.

685
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You are in a good mood.

686
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Everyone has two faces.

687
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You look at others.

688
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You look at yourself.

689
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The one you look at

690
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
is a little awkward or not.

691
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But the beauty is different.

692
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I've seen him for so long.

693
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
He really has only one face.

694
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
His kindness.

695
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
His dignity.

696
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Between us,

697
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
you are more in love

698
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and more in love.

699
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I think in this world,

700
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
no one knows him better than me.

701
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Mr. Lin,

702
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
please don't say anything

703
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
about your behavior.

704
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Last time,

705
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you said that

706
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
there was a woman

707
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
who was taken away by the police

708
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
by a family service at the shopping chain.

709
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Isn't that evening meeting

710
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
only the owner of the building can participate?

711
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Why can that woman participate?

712
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
She went to help Meibao.

713
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What?

714
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
She went to help Meibao.

715
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Here.

716
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Happy birthday.

717
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Meibao,

718
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
the dessert you made is really great.

719
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's beautiful and delicious.

720
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
How about

721
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
we prepare more?

722
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Of course.

723
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
We won't eat it.

724
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
No problem.

725
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Don't worry.

726
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay, I need your help.

727
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Okay.

728
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Dear customers,

729
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the new dessert is here.

730
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Welcome to the market.

731
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Come here.

732
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Have a taste.

733
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Aunt,

734
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
help me to open it here.

735
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'll go down and make two more.

736
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Okay.

737
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Don't be so serious.

738
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'll eat it later.

739
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'll eat it later.

740
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Thank you.

741
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Okay.

742
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Thank you.

743
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Excuse me.

744
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's beautiful.

745
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's me.

746
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Police.

747
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
What's the relationship between

748
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Aunt and Meibao?

749
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I heard it's a hometown.

750
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
There are so many customers

751
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
in this building.

752
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Thanks to Meibao's introduction.

753
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What's the reaction

754
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
of Meibao when the human-mei police took her?

755
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The dessert is here.

756
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Come and eat.

757
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I thought she was fine.

758
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But the factory gave us a high-end.

759
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And it was already bad.

760
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Then there was a dog-eating drama.

761
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
A drama?

762
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
What drama?

763
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Don't you know?

764
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Thank you.

765
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Thank you.

766
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
She came to find you.

767
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
She's so beautiful.

768
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
She's so beautiful.

769
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
She's so beautiful.

770
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
She's so beautiful.

771
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Thank you.

772
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Thank you.

773
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Thank you.

774
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Thank you.

775
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Thank you.

776
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's okay.

777
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
All the musicians,

778
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
let's keep it up.

779
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Let's have a happy New Year.

780
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Happy New Year.

781
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Wish you a happy New Year.

782
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yes.

783
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's the way it is.

784
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The same pair of shoes,

785
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
the same clothes,

786
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
the same necklace.

787
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Even the bed is too small.

788
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
God is so kind.

789
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Mr. Lin.

790
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You're making a lot of trouble.

791
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The New Year's Eve

792
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
is ten months ago.

793
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
According to the transaction record,

794
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Li Mo Li bought the house

795
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
after the New Year's Eve.

796
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
At that time,

797
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Li Mo Li and Zhou Meibao

798
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
already knew each other's relationship.

799
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
How could he give the house to San?

800
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Maybe I didn't tell you.

801
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That's the way it is.

802
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Li Mo Li bought the house

803
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
a year ago.

804
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The owner is abroad.

805
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So he lived there for half a year.

806
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
If you don't believe me,

807
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I can show you the contract.

808
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You've been saying that

809
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Mr. Lin is a murderer.

810
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Tell me,

811
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
what is his motive?

812
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
His wife.

813
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What's the problem

814
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
between Feng Hong and him?

815
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm telling you.

816
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Li Mo Li and Zhou Meibao

817
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
will definitely choose Li Mo Li

818
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
after the marriage.

819
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Because he knows

820
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
that he has nothing

821
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
left Li Mo Li.

822
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Then what about

823
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
him and Zhou Meibao?

824
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Why kill people?

825
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Who knows

826
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
if they have any

827
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
evidence when they break up?

828
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Let me tell you.

829
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Mr. Lin is

830
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
the one

831
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
who can do anything

832
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
for his wife.

833
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
No,

834
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I shouldn't say that.

835
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
He is the one

836
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
who can do anything

837
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
for fame and career.

838
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So don't

839
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
suspect that

840
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm a murderer.

841
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You should check it out.

842
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Mr. Lin

843
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
is very likely to be a murderer.

844
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
To be honest,

845
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Mr. Lin's

846
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
motive is not enough.

847
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's your fault.

848
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Because he has been

849
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
stealing for a long time,

850
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
your motive

851
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
is more important.

852
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I swear to you,

853
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I've been

854
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
stealing for a long time.

855
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I haven't seen it.

856
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Mr. Lin

857
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You're worth

858
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
a better person.

859
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Meibao.

860
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Are you okay?

861
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm fine.

862
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
What's wrong?

863
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm fine.

864
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm fine.

865
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Mr. Lin.

866
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Mr. Lin.

867
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Mr. Lin.

868
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Actually,

869
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I want to say thank you.

870
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I've been...

871
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Anyway, thank you.

872
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Thank you.

873
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
From that moment on,

874
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm sure

875
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
he has seen that note.

876
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
He knows

877
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I left it to him.

878
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
He knows it all the time.

879
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Mr. Lin.

880
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Mr. Lin.

881
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Mr. Lin.

882
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Mr. Lin.

883
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Mr. Lin.

884
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Mr. Lin.

885
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Mr. Lin.

886
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Mr. Lin.

887
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Mr. Lin.

888
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Thank you for your concern.

889
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I know you've been

890
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
nice to me.

891
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But I think

892
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
we should not

893
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
get into each other's life too much.

894
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
After all,

895
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
as long as we know

896
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
each other's feelings, that's enough.

897
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I think Meibao

898
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
is right.

899
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So from that moment on,

900
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I've never been in trouble.

901
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What's wrong?

902
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Nothing.

903
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I just feel sorry for you.

904
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I've always been

905
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
a good person.

906
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I don't know

907
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
when I'll start to be a good person.

908
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I slowly become dirty.

909
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I hate myself.

910
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Until I know Meibao,

911
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I find my heart

912
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
is like a new flower.

913
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Shen Meiji.

914
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You're

915
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Lin Mengyu's ex-wife, right?

916
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yes.

917
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Because we found

918
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
her fingerprint

919
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
in the tunnel of Zhongmei Bao's house.

920
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
May I ask

921
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
did you and your ex-husband

922
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
stay together at night?

923
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
No.

924
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But I can assure you

925
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
she's not a murderer.

926
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Why are you so sure?

927
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Lin Mengyu is usually

928
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
under great pressure.

929
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
She needs to take pills

930
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
before she can sleep.

931
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That medicine has a negative effect.

932
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's a dreamy medicine.

933
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It even makes you dreamy when it's serious.

934
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It's so hard to eat.

935
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm going to see Ding Xiaoliu again today.

936
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Where are you going?

937
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
What?

938
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm going to see her.

939
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm going to see her.

940
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So if she's really a murderer,

941
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
she should have told me through

942
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Meng Hua.

943
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I think she...

944
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
she's just a little bit self-conscious.

945
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Maybe Zhongmei Bao doesn't know

946
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
she's the one who went into her room.

947
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But she once wrote

948
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
a note for Lin Mengyu.

949
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It seems she knows.

950
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Officer,

951
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
you've been together

952
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
since you were together.

953
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Are you sure it's Zhongmei Bao?

954
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Are you okay?

955
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm a little tired.

956
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I want to go back to rest.

957
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'll go back to rest.

958
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Don't be late.

959
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Just hang out with her for a while.

960
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
See you, Mr. Lin.

961
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
See you.

962
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
See you.

963
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
See you.

964
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
See you.

965
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
See you.

966
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
See you.

967
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
See you.

968
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
See you.

969
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Mr. Lin.

970
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
He still knows how to dream.

971
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
He said he's a dreamer.

972
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But he never went

973
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
to Zhongmei Bao's room.

974
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
He never mentioned Zhongmei Bao.

975
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

976
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't want to lie to you anymore.

977
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Let's not get married.

978
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Let's not get married.

979
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So

980
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
he still wants to be with Ding Xiaolin?

981
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Maybe.

982
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Officer, you know what?

983
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
When we were little,

984
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
there were always so many beautiful girls on the class.

985
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
They were able to attract

986
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
all the boys' attention.

987
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
They made other girls

988
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
look like they didn't exist.

989
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Ding Xiaolin and Zhongmei Bao

990
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
were such women.

991
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
They knew when they would be sold

992
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and be sold.

993
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
They also knew

994
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
what kind of pitiful place they should be in.

995
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Every thing they did

996
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
was to attract

997
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
all the men in Zhouzao.

998
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Even death.

999
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
They also wanted to choose the most beautiful way

1000
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
to die.

1001
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
They wanted to die so beautifully.

1002
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
They wanted to be in a luxurious world.

1003
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Xiaoyao,

1004
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
this is the most important thing in the technical department.

1005
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Thank you.

1006
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You're welcome.

1007
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Master,

1008
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
another paper has been published.

1009
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's really beautiful.

1010
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It's true.

1011
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Everyone is not as simple as they look.

1012
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You think you know them.

1013
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
But you don't know

1014
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
how secret they are.

1015
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
These people

1016
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
