00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,480
Episode 5

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,180
Stop!

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:36,980
Five, four, three, two, one.

6
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,980
Five, four, three, two, one.

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,580
Five, four, three, two, one.

8
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,980
Five, four, three, two, one.

9
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,980
What's going on?

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,380
Look, they're wearing the same clothes.

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,980
They're here.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,980
Look.

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,380
Miss, Miss.

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,980
What's going on?

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,380
It's okay.

16
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,380
We wish you a happy new year.

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,980
Happy new year.

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,180
Happy new year.

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,980
Happy new year.

20
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,980
The End

21
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Episode 1

22
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,980
Master.

23
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,780
He's going to be used by someone.

24
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,780
The space is designed for people.

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,180
It can represent people's emotions.

26
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,980
It can also represent people's emotions.

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,380
The famous water flow end of architecture.

28
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,780
Its designer, Lighter,

29
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,980
built the whole house during the three-way selection.

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,980
It looks like it's growing inside.

31
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,980
But at the same time, it forgot something.

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,580
The space was too open.

33
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,380
When the natural life of those who were in the position of the end was taken care of,

34
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,180
the real nightlife was in the area.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,780
Because those flowers were too noisy,

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,180
they turned the space out.

37
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,580
Mr. Lin, what's the most important detail

38
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,580
when you design a house?

39
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,580
The most important detail.

40
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,780
Let me ask you.

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,580
Where do you think the center of a house is?

42
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
The kitchen.

43
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,780
He Ting.

44
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,780
The kitchen.

45
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,580
The bedroom is good.

46
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,380
Actually, this is very subjective.

47
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,180
But I personally think it's actually the bedroom.

48
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,580
Because the bedroom is the most core of a house.

49
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,780
It's also the most secretive place to hide.

50
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,580
The house can make the house feel safe.

51
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,580
Most of the rooms are all made of bedroom.

52
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,580
Mr. Lin, what do you think of the first one?

53
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,380
A good bedroom space?

54
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,780
It's very simple.

55
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,780
Three things.

56
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,980
First, the bedroom is the window.

57
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,980
Second, the bathroom is connected to the bathroom.

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,380
Third, the window.

59
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
Think about it.

60
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,780
Everyone works hard outside.

61
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,580
When you get home, you leave the secret to the bathroom.

62
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,480
You throw away all the furniture on the bed.

63
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,080
So I think the bedroom is very important.

64
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
It's too much trouble.

65
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Let's work hard together.

66
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Come on.

67
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,680
Goodbye, Mr. Yang.

68
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,880
Mr. Lin, we meet again.

69
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,480
Officer Zhong, you should be listening to someone.

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Are you investigating the case?

71
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,880
No.

72
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,480
There are a few questions.

73
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,880
But I heard it just now.

74
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,080
I think you have a good speech.

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,880
Especially the bedroom part.

76
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
It feels like a little bit of a touristic.

77
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,680
Awesome.

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,880
Officer Zhong, you've overestimated it.

79
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,480
My speech is actually more shallow.

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,880
It's just to take care of your non-professional listeners.

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Thank you for your care.

82
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,080
I really have a question about it.

83
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,480
It's always bothering me.

84
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,280
Can you teach me?

85
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
No need to be polite.

86
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,080
You can ask.

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm a busy worker.

88
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,480
I often get late.

89
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Sometimes I can only sleep in the dormitory.

90
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
It's weird.

91
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,080
No matter how tired I am, I can't sleep in the dormitory.

92
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,080
But when I get home, I sleep right away.

93
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
What's going on?

94
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,280
How can the bed in the dormitory be more comfortable than home?

95
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,280
It must be hard to sleep.

96
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,680
So what?

97
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,480
The way to make money is the same.

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,680
Let's change to a bed.

99
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,280
Buy a bed that's better.

100
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,680
It's expensive.

101
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Don't be so expensive.

102
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,880
Remember, you must buy the same brand of bed in your house.

103
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,480
It's the same feeling as lying on the bed.

104
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,480
It should be the sleeping bed in the dormitory.

105
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
I see.

106
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
So the bed you bought for Zhong Mei Bao

107
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,480
is the kind of sleeping bed you said.

108
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,880
Right?

109
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,680
Officer Zhong, what are you talking about?

110
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Nothing.

111
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,880
Come, sit down.

112
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,680
Let's talk slowly.

113
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

114
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

115
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

116
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

117
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

118
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

119
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

120
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

121
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

122
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

123
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

124
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

125
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

126
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm going to the dormitory.

127
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Okay.

128
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
I'm coming.

129
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,880
Excuse me, Miss, what would you like to drink?

130
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,080
One cup of coffee.

131
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,080
We can't drink coffee here.

132
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,680
We need a cup of our desserts.

133
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
But I can't eat now.

134
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,080
We can't eat anything.

135
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,580
It's a gift for you.

136
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,300
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,580
We're here for a tea break.

138
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
If you just want to drink,

139
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,980
I suggest you go to the next door.

140
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,580
Then let's drink a cup of champagne.

141
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,780
Okay, wait.

142
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,580
Rui Shan, it's really you.

143
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,580
Rui Shan, come here.

144
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,580
Come here.

145
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,580
I'll introduce you to my best friend.

146
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,580
Come, let's go.

147
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,580
Come, come, come.

148
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,580
I'll show you around.

149
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,580
Come, come, come.

150
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,580
I'll show you around.

151
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,580
Come, come, come.

152
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,580
I'll thank you.

153
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,580
Come, come, come.

154
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,580
This is my best friend.

155
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,580
This is my young friend.

156
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,580
Actually,

157
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,580
she's also a fiancee.

158
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,580
In order to have a daughter-in-law,

159
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,580
these ladies

160
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,580
all look like young men.

161
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,580
Hello, aunt.

162
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,580
Hello, aunt.

163
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,580
You're alone.

164
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Why don't we sit down together?

165
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,580
No, no, no.

166
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,580
Come, let's sit down.

167
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,580
Let's sit down.

168
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,580
Let me go with you.

169
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,580
I'm on duty now.

170
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,580
I'm leaving.

171
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,580
Come, come, come.

172
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
Sit down for a while.

173
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,580
Sit down for a while.

174
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,580
Sit down for a while.

175
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,580
What kind of job do you have?

176
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,580
You two,

177
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,580
don't look at us.

178
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,580
We're just friends.

179
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
Actually,

180
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,580
she's a model.

181
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
A model?

182
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,580
That's great.

183
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
That's great.

184
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,580
Don't say that.

185
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,580
I really have to go.

186
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,580
I'll go first.

187
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,580
I'll go and see the ladies.

188
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,580
I'll see your guests.

189
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,580
Come.

190
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,580
Actually,

191
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,580
Mei Bao has a problem with her sleep.

192
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,580
I want to say that

193
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,580
the solution to her sleep

194
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,580
is to make a bed.

195
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,580
So I bought a bed for her.

196
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,580
Oh, I see.

197
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,580
That means

198
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,580
you just bought her a bed.

199
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,580
Then what kind of experience

200
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,580
did we find on her bed?

201
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,580
What kind of hair?

202
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,580
It must be yours.

203
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,580
Director Lin,

204
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,580
you didn't cooperate with us

205
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
to investigate this.

206
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,580
You even hid the truth.

207
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Do you know

208
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,580
what crime you committed?

209
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
You've been trying to harm the law.

210
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,580
I'll give you another chance.

211
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,580
Tell me everything you know.

212
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
Mei Bao,

213
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,580
I've been trying to say sorry to you.

214
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
Let me tell you.

215
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,580
As a brother,

216
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,580
I didn't take good care of you.

217
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
I'm sorry.

218
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,580
Brother,

219
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,580
many things have passed.

220
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,580
I only remember your kindness to me.

221
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
I forgot to tell you.

222
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,580
I'm staying with your father.

223
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,580
Where are you?

224
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,580
Brother Dazhen.

225
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
Long time no see.

226
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,580
Come in.

227
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,580
I caught a cold.

228
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,580
Hello, mom.

229
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
What are you hungry?

230
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
I'm used to it.

231
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,780
You live here

232
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,580
near my home

233
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,580
and work in my home.

234
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,580
Great.

235
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
Your home is close to my house.

236
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,580
You work out of it?

237
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,580
I opened that coffee shop.

238
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,580
You're the boss?

239
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,580
You're amazing.

240
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,580
You must be very hardworking.

241
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Is it enough money?

242
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,580
Can you pay for the coffee?

243
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,580
Is your mother and brother okay?

244
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,580
Brother Dazen,

245
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,580
you asked me so many questions.

246
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,580
I don't know which one is better for you.

247
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,580
I haven't seen you for a long time.

248
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,580
Actually, I've always been very concerned.

249
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,580
Actually, I've always been concerned about you.

250
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
I often think

251
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,580
if something bad happened that day,

252
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
what would we be like?

253
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
Every time I think of you,

254
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,580
I think about the memories we shared together.

255
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
I don't forget.

256
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,580
I don't forget the memories we shared together.

257
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,580
I don't forget.

258
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,580
I've only heard one thing.

259
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,580
She's doing this for you.

260
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
How can I say this?

261
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
Mr. Zhong,

262
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,580
think about it.

263
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,580
A girl's life in the city

264
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,580
is hard to find

265
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,580
because of her family.

266
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,580
I think it's better to

267
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
think about it.

268
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
I'm sorry.

269
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,580
I think I've done you wrong.

270
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,580
I've been thinking about

271
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,580
how to make up for you.

272
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,580
Brother Dazen,

273
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,580
how long has it been?

274
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Don't say that.

275
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
Actually, that period

276
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
is the best time of my life.

277
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,580
It's okay.

278
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,580
I'm happy and happy.

279
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
You said

280
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,580
you'd buy me the biggest house

281
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,580
and give me the best thing in the world.

282
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,580
Yes.

283
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
So?

284
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,580
You choose.

285
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
You haven't chosen yet.

286
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
What do you want me to do?

287
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
Brother Dazen,

288
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,580
let's play a game.

289
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,580
What game do you want to play?

290
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
You want to make up?

291
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,580
Didn't you like to make me a princess the most?

292
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
I can't make up.

293
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
Then you won't make up.

294
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
You want to make up?

295
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,580
I'll help you.

296
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,580
It's Spring flies away

297
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,580
I'm the summer wind

298
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,580
You know

299
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,580
You said

300
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,580
he's making everything up.

301
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,580
He wants the house.

302
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:26,580
Why did you do this

303
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,580
because I think

304
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,580
It's a pity that she's hurt.

305
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,580
It's a pity that she's not safe, right?

306
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,580
You can say that.

307
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,580
My wife is not young anymore.

308
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,580
She always wants a child.

309
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,580
Both parents want to have a grandson.

310
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,580
As for Mei Bao,

311
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
I think it's my relationship with her

312
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
since she was little.

313
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
I'm not good at it.

314
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,580
I'm not good at killing cars.

315
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
But I think the most important thing is

316
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,580
the complete family.

317
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
Does Zhong Mei Bao know that your wife is pregnant?

318
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Yes.

319
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
This child

320
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,580
has been my wife for a long time.

321
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,580
No wonder you're so weak.

322
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,580
Does Zhong Mei Bao want to break up with you?

323
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
Of course not.

324
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,580
So she has a relationship with you.

325
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
Officer Zhong, why are you so rude?

326
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
I've told you.

327
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
I'm very grateful.

328
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,580
And that night,

329
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,580
I was with my wife in Shen Xiao Hai.

330
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,580
I was in a hospital.

331
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,580
What time did you send your wife to the hospital?

332
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
About 8 o'clock in the evening.

333
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,580
You stopped the power?

334
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,580
Yes.

335
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,580
But you didn't have any evidence.

336
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,580
Zhong Mei Bao was in the hospital

337
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,580
when he was in the hospital.

338
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,580
Officer Lin,

339
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,580
think about it.

340
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,580
What we're going to talk about today.

341
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,580
Officer Zhong,

342
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,580
why don't you suspect

343
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,580
the Wu Ming Yue next door?

344
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,580
Let Mei Bao's family die.

345
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,580
We can only say one more suspect.

346
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,580
She doesn't mean

347
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580
your suspect is gone.

348
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,580
But I still want to thank you.

349
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,580
I'm sorry.

350
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,580
But I still want to thank you.

351
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,580
So, Officer Lin has admitted that

352
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,580
Zhong Mei Bao is his lover.

353
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,580
She can't hide this from me.

354
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,580
Then you still think

355
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,580
he doesn't have a suspect?

356
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
Such a big suspect.

357
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,580
Such a big suspect.

358
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
He must not have a suspect.

359
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,580
But he doesn't have a suspect.

360
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,580
It doesn't mean

361
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,580
their family is not in the same place.

362
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
He also told me

363
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,580
about their family.

364
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
I want to ask you two

365
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
to sit down and drink with me.

366
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,580
Sister,

367
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,580
Brother-in-law is going to

368
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,580
study in the US

369
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
for a year.

370
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
What do you want him to do?

371
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
I want him to do it.

372
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
I hope he won't come back.

373
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
It's not easy to bring a kid.

374
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
Be careful.

375
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
You young couples

376
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,580
like to be together all day long.

377
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,580
When they're in middle school,

378
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
they'll be separated.

379
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
We meet each other often.

380
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,580
That's the best way to meet.

381
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
Besides,

382
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
look at Brother-in-law.

383
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,580
He's like a dead person every day.

384
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,580
He's either here or not.

385
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
What's the difference?

386
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,580
He told you that

387
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
this ordinary wine is my wife.

388
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,580
He's a good wife.

389
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,580
What did you say?

390
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
I said this wine is very good.

391
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Learn it.

392
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Mo Li,

393
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,580
you and Da Sen

394
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,580
can't be in love.

395
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,580
Mom and Dad

396
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
are waiting for their grandchild.

397
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,580
Yes.

398
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,580
You and my dad

399
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
are the only common topics now.

400
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,580
Yes.

401
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,580
Mom means

402
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,580
you're as good as Da Sen.

403
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,580
I know.

404
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
Women shouldn't be too strong.

405
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,580
You're doing your job well.

406
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,580
Right?

407
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
It's not appropriate to say

408
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
you're going to be a girl.

409
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,580
You're regretting

410
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
your own life.

411
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,580
I know.

412
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
I'll do it.

413
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,580
I'll do it.

414
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
I'll do it.

415
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,580
Mo Li,

416
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
I've finished talking to you.

417
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
What?

418
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
So,

419
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
don't do it.

420
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
And you and Da Sen

421
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,580
are married now.

422
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
You're family.

423
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
Your family

424
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,580
is successful.

425
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
Enough.

426
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Mom, I'm done.

427
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
Mo Li,

428
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,580
isn't this

429
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
the famous French master cake?

430
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Yes.

431
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,580
It's so good.

432
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
I bought

433
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
the famous white rose cake.

434
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Right?

435
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,580
Da Sen,

436
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,580
how much is it?

437
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,580
Mom,

438
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,580
this cake

439
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,580
is made by

440
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,580
a French master.

441
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,580
It's worth more than 2000 yuan.

442
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,580
You can have more later.

443
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
More than 2000 yuan?

444
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
I'm also a student.

445
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,580
I'll save the money for you.

446
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,580
Mom,

447
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
don't worry.

448
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
My mom won't cook.

449
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
She'll take care of it.

450
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
She'll cook

451
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
the dishes for me.

452
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
Why won't I cook?

453
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
Right?

454
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Mom.

455
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
She's so cold.

456
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
Don't bother her.

457
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
Mom,

458
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
why are you all here?

459
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,580
What are you looking for?

460
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,580
I'm looking for a way to cook.

461
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,580
Mom,

462
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,580
what are you cooking?

463
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,580
What are you doing?

464
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
I'm cooking.

465
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,580
Mom,

466
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,580
I'm cooking.

467
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,580
Mom,

468
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,580
what are you cooking?

469
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,580
I'm cooking.

470
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,580
I'm cooking.

471
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,580
No, no, no.

472
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,580
Da Sen.

473
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,580
I'm cooking.

474
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
I'm cooking.

475
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,580
Da Sen.

476
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,580
Da Sen.

477
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,580
Why did you buy the ingredients?

478
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,580
Da Sen.

479
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,580
Da Sen.

480
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,580
Da Sen.

481
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,580
They're all good.

482
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,580
It smells so good.

483
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,580
Da Sen.

484
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
I can't put it in the plate.

485
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,580
This one is not good either.

486
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,580
This is good.

487
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,580
I'll change one.

488
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
This is not good either.

489
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,580
Hurry up.

490
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580
Hurry up.

491
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,580
Hurry up.

492
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,580
Hurry up.

493
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,580
Hurry up.

494
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,580
Hurry up.

495
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Hurry up.

496
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,580
Hurry up.

497
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,580
Hurry up.

498
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,580
Hurry up.

499
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,580
Hurry up.

500
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,580
Hurry up.

501
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,580
Hurry up.

502
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
Hurry up.

503
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,580
Why are you here?

504
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,580
Aren't you two having a birthday party?

505
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,580
Aren't you two celebrating your birthday?

506
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,580
I just want to celebrate my birthday with you

507
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,580
I feel that this is the life I want

508
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,580
I don't want to say this to you

509
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
I never thought about it

510
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
You know what?

511
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,580
From the first time I saw you

512
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
I just want to hug you like this

513
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
I'll hug you like this forever

514
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,580
Then why didn't you stand out when I was framed

515
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,580
when I was framed?

516
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,580
You did all those things

517
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,580
If you say that

518
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,580
Maybe I have a brother and mother

519
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,580
I don't need to move away

520
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
If we don't move away

521
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,580
I won't meet that person

522
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
I'm sorry

523
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,580
I've been trying to make you feel so bad

524
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,580
I'm sorry

525
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Xiao Yang

526
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,580
Have you seen those video clips on the Internet?

527
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,580
Who do you usually visit?

528
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
Xiao San

529
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,580
So you think

530
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
Li Mo Li is more suspicious?

531
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,580
Oh, right

532
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,580
Did you find out anything about her today?

533
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,580
No

534
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,580
I found out that she is a friend of her

535
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,580
who doesn't stop eating and drinking

536
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,580
and is not a kind of friend

537
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,580
How do you know that she is not kind?

538
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,580
Because I sat next to her

539
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Those two women were talking about

540
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,580
what bag she bought recently

541
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,580
what face she made

542
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,580
and what kind of food she wanted to eat

543
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Li Mo Li just said

544
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,580
something to her

545
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,580
Is it possible that she is not thinking about anything else?

546
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,580
It's possible

547
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,580
I just asked Li Mo Li

548
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,580
after I came here

549
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,580
I found that they are not just

550
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,580
sensitive to love

551
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,580
Xiao Zhang

552
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,580
Please start recording

553
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,580
Roger

554
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,580
Hello

555
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,580
I'm sorry

556
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,580
I called you here so late

557
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,580
Don't be nervous

558
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,580
Am I nervous?

559
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,580
I didn't do anything

560
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,580
Now

561
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,580
I'm asking you a personal question

562
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,580
How do you feel about

563
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
your husband, Lin Da Sen?

564
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Not so good

565
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,580
Why?

566
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
As far as I know

567
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,580
you two are not married for a long time

568
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,580
and you just married a single parent

569
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
Is it okay to marry a single parent?

570
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,580
How about your parents?

571
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
It's good

572
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,580
I still want to ask you

573
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,580
I'm sorry

574
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,580
I was too rude

575
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
When I was young

576
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,580
many people told me

577
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,580
that marriage is for a single parent

578
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
But I was a little rebellious at that time

579
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,580
I think

580
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
love can be against everything

581
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Later I got married

582
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,580
I had a family and a child

583
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,580
I found that the single parent

584
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,580
they said was really important

585
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
Wife

586
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Where should I go?

587
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
Where did you go?

588
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,580
It's annoying

589
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
I want to get out of the mood

590
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Me too

591
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
You know what happened

592
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,580
when I met you

593
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,580
Do you know what your mom told me?

594
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,580
What did she say?

595
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,580
What did she say?

596
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,580
Be serious

597
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,580
Your mom told me

598
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,580
that you were trying to make her

599
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,580
to be nice to me

600
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,580
You just made her

601
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,580
What?

602
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,580
I want to tell you something

603
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,580
I want to go to the US

604
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,580
I want to apply for a polyethylene

605
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,580
I want to get a scholarship

606
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,580
Let's go to the US together

607
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,580
But my mom is here alone

608
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
Why is it your mom again?

609
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,580
Do you have me?

610
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,580
It's all you

611
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,580
You have a life

612
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,580
and this studio

613
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
My dad opened it for you

614
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
My dad invested for you

615
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
I'm not used to it

616
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,580
You're not used to it

617
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,580
You're always not used to it

618
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,580
Let's go to the US

619
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,580
Wait

620
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,580
What are you doing?

621
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,580
A safety belt

622
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
Where's the safety belt?

623
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,580
Where's my mom's safety belt?

624
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,580
What do you mean?

625
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,580
A safety belt

626
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Wait

627
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
What do you mean?

628
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
My mom wants to take the safety belt

629
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,580
Your mom took the safety belt?

630
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Hello

631
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,580
Hello

632
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,580
Hello

633
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,580
Hello

634
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Hello

635
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
Hello

636
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Hello

637
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,580
Hello

638
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,580
Hello

639
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,580
What?

640
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,580
How can your mom take the safety belt?

641
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,580
We're so old

642
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
Why does your mom want to follow us?

643
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,580
You don't want a child?

644
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
I want a child

645
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,580
But your mom can't do that

646
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,580
I'm so sorry

647
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
I'm telling you

648
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,580
You're the only one in your heart

649
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,580
I've never seen an old man like this

650
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,580
Your husband

651
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
Don't be angry

652
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
Go

653
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
Go

654
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,580
So annoying

655
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,580
So disgusting

656
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,580
I'll go to the US with your mom

657
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,580
You go with your mom

658
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,580
Go

659
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
So disgusting

660
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Where's my mom?

661
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Lin Da Sen and Li Mo Li

662
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,580
graduated from the architecture department of Mandar

663
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
When she was a student

664
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
she was a junior of the two young Lin Da Sen

665
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Yes

666
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,580
According to the law

667
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,580
the one who can get into Mandar

668
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
must be the one in the department

669
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,580
This Li Mo Li

670
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
is a full-time graduate

671
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,580
and a graduate of the full-time graduate

672
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,580
And this Lin Da Sen

673
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,580
is a second-grader

674
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,580
in the city school

675
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,580
in the university

676
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,580
He got into Mandar

677
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,580
when he was a graduate

678
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,580
Such a good senior

679
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,580
He's a very good senior

680
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,580
He's a very good senior

681
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
He's a very good senior

682
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
He's a very good senior

683
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,580
He's a very good senior

684
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
He's such a good senior

685
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,580
He's such a good senior

686
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,580
He's such a good senior

687
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,580
He's a very good senior

688
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
Is he a great senior?

689
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,580
Master

690
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,580
You may not be able to understand this

691
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,580
Only one requirement for women

692
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,580
is to get married early

693
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,580
It doesn't matter how good

694
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,580
your career experience is

695
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,580
They're all the same

696
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,580
So you mean

697
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
your new Lin Da Sen

698
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,580
has defiled your design?

699
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,580
Actually

700
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,580
I don't know

701
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
how to defile these two words

702
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,580
now

703
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,580
If it can be used

704
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,580
by a female student

705
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,100
the result of the student's study.

706
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,700
It can be called a reminder.

707
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,260
Then the husband

708
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,020
uses his wife's design

709
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,100
to say that he is a liar.

710
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,620
Then I want to know if you have

711
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,100
anything to say to your father.

712
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,020
As far as I know,

713
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,060
your father is called Li Jingshen.

714
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,140
He is a famous

715
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,260
academic professor of

716
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,580
the University of Lin Dacen.

717
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,580
This is the work of my university.

718
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,380
This is Lin Dacen.

719
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,100
My husband is the editor-in-chief.

720
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
So,

721
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,220
you were also

722
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,700
ready to be a designer?

723
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,820
Actually, many people said

724
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,180
Li Jingshen was hurt by two girls

725
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,740
in the famous Li Jingshen.

726
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,660
No one can improve her.

727
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,660
But when I was in the middle of the university,

728
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,060
every time I designed a game,

729
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,660
I was in a lot of trouble.

730
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,980
Including Lin Dacen?

731
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,420
He was always the second.

732
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,300
Actually, I'm quite sorry for Mo Li.

733
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,900
I'm not talented.

734
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,300
Lin Dacen doesn't have any problems.

735
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,340
Some works are actually his inspiration.

736
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,700
He thinks he married me.

737
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,980
I'm his.

738
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,980
My work is his work.

739
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,580
But he didn't say anything.

740
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,860
What's so pitiful is

741
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,780
my father passed away.

742
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,820
He thinks men are easier to succeed than women.

743
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,140
Dacen really likes to steal things from you.

744
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,860
You are also a professional woman.

745
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,420
You should be able to understand.

746
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,020
There are many boys and girls in every field.

747
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,060
And you get a high-level skin.

748
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,380
Even if that high-level is your father.

749
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,940
This is so unfair.

750
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,100
I used the literature to

751
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,700
get this title of the famous Li Jingshen.

752
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,980
Why did you give it to Lin Dacen?

753
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,100
Mo Li, I know your literature is excellent.

754
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,020
But the title of the famous Li Jingshen

755
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,020
is shared in the same school as yours.

756
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,620
Your father is Jing Shouren.

757
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,860
I know what you think.

758
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,260
You want me to be a teacher

759
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,260
to avoid the rumors.

760
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,020
Is it possible that your father

761
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,660
gave you the title of the famous Li Jingshen

762
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,900
for the sake of the safety of the people?

763
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,500
Have you thought about it?

764
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,820
But I got it from my strength.

765
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,220
I can't control it.

766
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,900
This is the opportunity to build a building.

767
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,620
I...

768
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,660
Dacen, what's the matter?

769
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,220
Professor,

770
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,620
your professor is coming to see you.

771
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,500
Professor Li?

772
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,060
Yes.

773
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Mo Li,

774
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,420
I have something to ask you.

775
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,820
Please don't be so kind.

776
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,740
I don't know you.

777
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,540
Thank you.

778
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,460
Mo Li,

779
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,380
I'm asking you.

780
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,500
Do you know Chen Yaolei's office?

781
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,100
The architecture design department

782
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,060
of the Chinese brand's previous dance.

783
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,860
I know.

784
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,460
What's wrong?

785
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,820
Then what do you think about working there?

786
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,740
Stop promoting, okay?

787
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,140
You are the one who is a big fan of the band.

788
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,460
You are the one who is also a fan of Chen Yaolei.

789
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,420
You are very old-fashioned.

790
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,580
I know.

791
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,100
Mo Li,

792
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,860
come here.

793
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,860
But they are not my students.

794
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,980
What do you mean?

795
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,380
I'm not your student.

796
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,700
What do you mean?

797
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,860
I secretly sent your works

798
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,340
and the travel records to them.

799
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,260
They hope you can go there next week.

800
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,700
And,

801
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,740
I didn't let them know

802
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,620
that your dad is Li Jizhi.

803
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,820
That's enough.

804
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,500
You are the one who is a fan of the band,

805
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,140
so you are the one who sent me this, right?

806
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,700
I didn't mean that.

807
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,300
I just want your dad to ask you something.

808
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,020
A girl

809
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,940
who is so far away from home

810
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,820
is not allowed to study.

811
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,460
Your dad can't bear to do that.

812
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,100
He can't bear to do that.

813
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,340
When I was a kid,

814
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,300
when he sent me to the dormitory

815
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,340
to the private school,

816
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,540
I didn't think he had any feelings for me.

817
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:47,820
So,

818
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
I think you should have a good talk with your dad.

819
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,900
Think about it.

820
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,940
A girl

821
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,140
who is looking for happiness

822
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,940
in the land and the land of dust.

823
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,220
Can you find it?

824
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,780
Your dad is hoping you to be happy.

825
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,820
You fool.

826
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,940
Do you know

827
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,420
what true happiness is to me?

828
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,700
A girl who will take care of you

829
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
can rely on you

830
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,060
and love you.

831
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,060
Finally, you can eat.

832
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,540
I am really curious.

833
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,500
How did you two start dating?

834
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,300
There is a feeling

835
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,340
called love.

836
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,900
Mo Li.

837
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
I heard that

838
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,220
our boss

839
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,340
is going to have a meeting with Lin Da Sen tomorrow.

840
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,860
Is he coming back today?

841
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,780
Who?

842
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,860
Lin Da Sen?

843
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,820
What's the matter with me?

844
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,100
Aren't you two very close?

845
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,460
Who cares about me?

846
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,300
Right.

847
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,420
Do you want to go to the restaurant?

848
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,820
Have a good rest.

849
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,420
You haven't slept for three days and three days.

850
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,020
It's okay. I'm almost done.

851
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,580
I found out

852
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,700
that you really look like a partner

853
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,180
when you work.

854
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,980
I don't like to listen to you.

855
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,620
Why do women

856
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,260
work hard

857
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,820
to make men think of women?

858
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,620
Okay, okay.

859
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,220
I'll go eat first.

860
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,020
Okay.

861
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
What's wrong with me?

862
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,820
The doctor said that you work too hard.

863
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,180
You have to stay up all night.

864
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,260
You don't have enough sleep.

865
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,420
Don't move.

866
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,460
I have to go back.

867
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,660
You need to rest.

868
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,660
I have to go back to work.

869
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,860
I can help you.

870
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,340
You just came back.

871
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,100
My dad is not looking for you.

872
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,300
I just called him.

873
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,380
He will come to see you later.

874
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,500
Don't come any later.

875
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,660
I have to go back to work now.

876
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,140
I love you.

877
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,860
Cur truth

878
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,300
I just wooed you.

879
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,940
Finally you hadn't

880
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,900
changed your thinking.

881
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:22,500
I didn't care about it.

882
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,380
Since you don't want it,

883
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,980
I'm feeling ridiculous.

884
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,900
What's wrong with me?

885
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,340
Your eyes are soné.

886
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm just bekannt.

887
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,200
I see that you're just kind.

888
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,260
I'll find someone to do something with you.

889
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,860
Be brave.

890
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,260
Actually, you gave Lin Da-sen a chance.

891
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,180
You two might have a chance to slowly fall in love

892
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,060
and get married.

893
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,260
Yes.

894
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,140
But you now feel that

895
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,380
this decision is a mistake.

896
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,180
Actually, all the unparalleled feelings are mistakes.

897
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,260
Even if you were moved at the beginning,

898
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,900
you would later find out that you are not a world-class person.

899
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,540
Then do you think he and Zhong Mei Bao are a world-class person?

900
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,460
When you get used to eating street-cooking,

901
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,820
you suddenly find a very high-class restaurant.

902
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,820
You would feel very fresh.

903
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,500
But after a long time, you will find out that it's not his dish.

904
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,620
He still wants to eat street-cooking.

905
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,900
He doesn't want to give up the table in the high-class restaurant.

906
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,420
What you said is your feelings or your career?

907
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,540
I have no career.

908
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,140
After your college graduation,

909
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,940
you have been a teacher in the building of the university.

910
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,940
You resigned a year ago.

911
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,540
Why did you do that?

912
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,740
Because I had a foreign injury when I was young.

913
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,140
It caused me to get used to Liu Chan.

914
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,140
After Liu Chan died, my parents and Lin Da-sen

915
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,540
worked in different universities.

916
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,540
They think that being a student is more important than being a building teacher.

917
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,540
More important?

918
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,540
What do you think of Zhong Mei Bao?

919
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,140
Nothing.

920
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,140
What is your relationship with Zhong Mei Bao?

921
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,540
We don't have a relationship.

922
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,340
Then does Zhong Mei Bao's death have any effect on you?

923
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,540
I understand what you want to ask, but I already answered.

924
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,140
He is not one of the people in the world, so I don't hate him.

925
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,340
He died or is alive. I have nothing to do with him.

926
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,740
What else do you want to ask?

927
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,140
Can I go out first? I want to go to the washroom.

928
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,940
Lin Xiao...

929
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,940
Your phone.

930
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,740
Thank you.

931
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,740
When I was just born, I was also quite emotional.

932
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,740
I'll go out first.

933
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,340
If you want to, then there's no need.

934
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:13,740
When you attend to

935
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,240
chez, you can stay at yourself in this house.

936
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,600
Do you have any objection?

937
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,140
Just ignore it,

938
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,940
and tell Zhong Mei Bao Second Karen

939
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,900
They must trust that Li Long hazarded someone as those who feature the인이

940
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,460
xIng z simply cut the line in their hands.

941
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,540
A sense ofonen has angered him once.

942
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,700
But now is the day for the head closer.

943
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,920
I know how it ended.

944
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,160
She's acting treadlessly now.

945
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,940
...

946
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,000
Why did you still want me to look at her?

947
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,120
after the flower is finished?

948
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,000
Do you think this phone

949
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,240
is that...

950
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,800
No way.

951
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,800
It's too scary

952
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,720
to have it here.

953
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,680
Women

954
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,080
can do anything

955
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,680
for men.

956
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,600
Shall we test it now?

957
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,400
Let's guess.

958
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,560
You and I

959
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,920
We've been floating through this life forever

960
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,760
You and I

961
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,320
We've been walking hand in hand for so long

962
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,000
And now we're falling down

963
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I've said what I should have said.

964
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I didn't say a word.

965
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Thank you.

966
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And I know

967
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Wherever I will go

968
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You're the only one

969
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I will follow anywhere I know

970
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Wherever I will go

971
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You're the only one

972
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Carry your load

973
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Wherever you go, this I know

974
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You and I

975
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We've been walking hand in hand

976
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
For so long

977
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And now we're falling down

978
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I've said what I should have said.

979
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I didn't say a word.

980
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I didn't say a word.

981
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I didn't say a word.

982
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I didn't say a word.

983
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I didn't say a word.

984
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I didn't say a word.

985
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I don't know

986
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Wherever I will go

987
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You're the only one

988
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I will follow anywhere I know

989
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Wherever I will go

990
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You're the only one

991
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Carry your load

992
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Wherever you go, this I know

993
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Cause there's a way around the fences

994
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
There's a word on the wall

995
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And as we swear around the edges

996
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Could it be the angels call

997
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Could it be the only one

998
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And I know

999
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Wherever I will go

1000
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You're the only one

1001
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I will follow anywhere I know

1002
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Wherever I will go

1003
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You're the only one

1004
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I will follow anywhere I know

1005
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Wherever I will go

1006
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You're the only one

1007
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I will follow anywhere I know

1008
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Wherever I will go
