00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The sun shines on the moon and the moon shines on the sky

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The moon shines on the moon and the moon shines on the sky

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The moon shines on the moon and the moon shines on the sky

The moon shines on the moon and the moon shines on the sky

The moon shines on the moon and the moon shines on the sky

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,360
Leave it to me to repaint myself

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,600
On the yellow night of my vacation, it's not enough to make me sick

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,000
The joy in the sky, where am I from?

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,360
Leave it to me to repaint myself

00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,120

Inside.

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,320
Leave.

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,680
Are you okay?

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
Hurry up.

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Go after me.

25
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,800

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
Are you okay?

32
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
I'm fine.

33
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Hurry up.

34
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Let's go.

35
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Fei'er.

36
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Fei'er.

37
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Hold on.

38
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
Don't get hurt.

39
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Let's go.

40
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Hurry up.

41
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Fei'er.

42
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
Hold on.

43
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Hurry up.

44
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Fei'er.

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Fei'er.

46
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
She's a girl.

47
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Brother.

48
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Let me hug her.

49
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Come on.

50
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Take it easy.

51
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Fei'er.

52
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm fine.

53
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
I'm fine.

54
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
Fei'er.

55
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm fine.

56
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
I'm fine.

57
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
I'm fine.

58
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Fei'er.

59
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Fei'er.

60
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Fei'er, what are you doing?

61
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
I'm scared.

62
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
She can't live.

63
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Brother.

64
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
She's scared to death.

65
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
She's your daughter.

66
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,760
She's your nephew.

67
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
If she lives,

68
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
she can only be like me for the rest of her life.

69
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
She's used by many people.

70
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
What does she mean by living?

71
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
She can't let her die now.

72
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
She can't let her die now.

73
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Fei'er.

74
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Fei'er.

75
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
I won't let you die.

76
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
I won't give up.

77
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
They're coming out.

78
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
But you're still here.

79
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Go.

80
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Go.

81
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Is it here?

82
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
No.

83
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
No.

84
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Go after them.

85
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Hurry up.

86
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
You must find that child.

87
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Bring her back.

88
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Go.

89
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Yes.

90
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Fei'er.

91
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Why do you have to suffer?

92
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
I don't care about you and others'

93
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
state affairs.

94
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
I'm willing to

95
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
marry you back to my mansion

96
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
as a concubine.

97
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Why can't you

98
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
stay by my side

99
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
all the time?

100
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
You're the closest to me.

101
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
You're just for Bi Luo Tian.

102
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
How can you have

103
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
a real love affair with me?

104
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Our misunderstandings are too deep.

105
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Stop.

106
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Here.

107
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Prince.

108
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
You're free to keep your bloodline.

109
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
people will understand.

110
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Blood is water.

111
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
You'll be myكون.

112
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
We only have one wish.

113
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
We must find that child.

114
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Your Highness, stay there.

115
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Hurry. I won't save you.

116
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Hurry.

117
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,760
If we take them away, we will die.

118
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
No one can find us.

119
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

120
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Your Highness, please be quiet.

121
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Your Highness.

122
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Thank you.

123
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Bye-bye.

124
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Where are they?

125
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Let's go.

127
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Stop.

128
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
What's the matter, brothers?

129
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
What's the matter?

130
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Do you know the rules?

131
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
How dare you ride on our land?

132
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Right?

133
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm really sorry.

135
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
If there is any trouble,

136
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,760
please forgive me.

137
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
We'll leave now.

138
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
You want to leave?

139
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Which one?

140
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Bring the food.

141
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Brother, please pity me.

142
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
We haven't eaten for three days.

143
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
It's not easy to get a little.

144
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Just now, on that street,

145
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
you sold the food and took away the people.

146
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
You took so much money.

147
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
You said you didn't have money, right?

148
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Bring it here.

149
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
No.

150
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Give them the money.

151
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
No.

152
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
This is my money.

153
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
This little girl.

154
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Take the money.

155
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Give it to the people.

156
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
You're a man, right?

157
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Uncle, are you okay?

158
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
No.

159
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Take it.

160
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Take it.

161
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
You're dead.

162
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Please don't hit me.

163
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
I'm dead.

164
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
I'll give you the money.

165
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Can't you?

166
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
Go.

167
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Buqi, let's go.

168
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Go.

169
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Uncle, are you okay?

170
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
I'm fine.

171
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Huang.

172
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Come here.

173
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Uncle, it's all my fault.

174
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I should give them the money.

175
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Buqi,

176
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
you must remember that

177
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
money is the best thing to do.

178
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
I should be the one to do it.

183
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
We can discuss it later

184
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
when we're done with the money.

185
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
But we only have one life.

186
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Do you remember?

187
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I know.

188
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Uncle, are you okay?

189
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,760
I'm fine.

190
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
I just need to rest for a few days.

191
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
But we can't

192
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
ride the horse here anymore.

193
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Let's go somewhere else.

194
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
We always have to go to the place we want to go.

195
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Buqi,

196
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
it's hard for you

197
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,760
to ride the horse with Uncle Jiu.

198
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
It's not hard.

199
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
It's not hard at all.

200
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
There are many places

201
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
where other kids don't go.

202
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Uncle Jiu,

203
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
thanks to the big-awaited dog

204
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
who saved us today,

205
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
can we raise him?

206
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
He's already our old friend.

207
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Just follow us in the future.

208
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Great!

209
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
I'll call you Huang,

210
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,760
we'll be a family in the future.

211
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Uncle Jiu,

212
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
time to eat.

213
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Uncle Jiu,

214
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
we'll have a meal

215
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
and we'll have dinner

216
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
every day.

217
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
I'll leave the money

218
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
to do business.

219
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
No, you can't do business.

220
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Why?

221
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
You don't need to know why.

222
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
You just need to listen to me.

223
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
The less people live, the better they know.

224
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
You have to be humble and humble.

225
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
You can't be too much

226
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
and get in touch with others.

227
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
You can't do business.

228
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Do you hear me?

229
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
It's not a meal for a lifetime.

230
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
I don't want to be a meal for a lifetime.

231
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Buqi,

232
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
because Uncle Jiu has owed others a lot of debts,

233
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
he can't pay it back for a lifetime.

234
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
He can only hide it.

235
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
He can't let others know his identity.

236
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Uncle Jiu has implicated you.

237
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Uncle Jiu, don't say that.

238
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
If you hadn't raised me,

239
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
I would have been starving.

240
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Uncle Jiu, don't worry.

241
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
I won't do business.

242
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
I'll have a meal

243
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
for a lifetime with you.

244
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Uncle Jiu, eat.

245
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
I've eaten.

246
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
I'll take Huang to take a bath.

247
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,760
Buqi,

248
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
you must be careful when you go out.

249
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Don't get in touch with too many people.

250
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,760
I know.

251
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
I know.

252
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Huang,

253
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
come here.

254
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Huang, come here.

255
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Hurry up.

256
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Huang,

257
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
you said that

258
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
you can't pay back any debts for a lifetime.

259
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
You look like a bookman.

260
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
You don't look like

261
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
a person who can borrow.

262
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
Are you a debt collector?

263
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Do I look like Uncle Jiu?

264
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
I'm not Uncle Jiu's daughter, right?

265
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
No wonder I have a face

266
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
that is also dirty.

267
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
I'm afraid that people will find out.

268
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
It must be.

269
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
I really want a meal for a lifetime.

270
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Maybe someone

271
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
has been looking for Uncle Jiu for so many years.

272
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
He has already quit.

273
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
No,

274
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
I still have to hide it from Uncle Jiu.

275
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
I can't make money with my face.

276
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
I can't make money with my face.

277
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Huang,

278
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
do you think so?

279
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Huang,

280
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
you think so too.

281
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Then we can make a deal.

282
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
I'll make money with my face.

283
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
What are you doing?

284
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
When will you send the money

285
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
to the director of the company?

286
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Don't worry,

287
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
we'll go there this afternoon.

288
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Okay.

289
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Sister Xiaohua.

290
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Sister Xiaohua, this time you're saving the money.

291
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
So many.

292
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
You didn't do it on purpose

293
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
and you put it on others' clothes.

294
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
You got beaten up.

295
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
What?

296
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
I'm a good student now.

297
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm sending my brothers

298
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
to guard the back door of the big house.

299
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
They're throwing clothes.

300
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
I'll take them back in a while.

301
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Please.

302
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,760
Have you seen this person?

303
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
No.

304
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Let's go.

305
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Let's go.

306
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Sister Xiaohua,

307
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
take the cloth.

308
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Sister Xiaohua, take the cloth.

309
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Sister Xiaohua, take the cloth.

310
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Sister Xiaohua.

311
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
Here you are.

312
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Sister Xiaohua, take the cloth.

313
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
Sister Xiaohua, here you are.

314
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Xiaohua is here.

315
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
A'pu,

316
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,760
this is the money from last time.

317
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
This time you're saving the money.

318
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Please help me to wash it clean

319
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
and change it.

320
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
I'll buy it later.

321
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
No problem.

322
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Just make money.

323
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Xiaohua, you're so smart.

324
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Who knows

325
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
if you take the cloth

326
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
and put it on another clothes,

327
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
there will be so many people

328
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
who will buy it.

329
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Right?

330
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Isn't it beautiful?

331
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Are you going to Chengxi today?

332
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
Yes.

333
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
My uncle's case is getting worse.

334
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
I can't get up early this morning.

335
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
I have to pay him for treatment.

336
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
I have to bring back

337
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,760
Master Liu's wine.

338
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I'll bring another big one.

339
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Chengxi's family

340
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
has two families.

341
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
It's not bad to bring it back.

342
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
Take care.

343
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
I'm leaving.

344
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
Let me go.

345
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Let me go.

346
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Good.

347
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Everyone is good.

348
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Good.

349
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Let's give him a big hand.

350
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Good.

351
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Let's talk about the books.

352
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
The Great Xia Lian Yi Ke

353
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
told me

354
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
that Lian Yi Ke will be

355
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
blocked by bandits.

356
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
These bandits

357
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
are all ten people.

358
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
They are all

359
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
strong and strong.

360
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
They are holding

361
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
the steel

362
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,760
and they are shouting.

363
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
But

364
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
who is the Great Xia Lian Yi Ke?

365
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Why are you afraid of them?

366
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
You said it's a stone.

367
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
The Great Xia Lian Yi Ke is

368
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
holding the bow with his left hand.

369
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
He is holding the sword with his right hand.

370
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
He is holding ten long swords.

371
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,760
He is holding ten long swords.

372
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
And one has a sword.

373
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
But pattern is broken.

374
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
Good.

375
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
The Great Xia Lian Yi Ke is doing great.

376
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Ten sword arrows.

377
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
This gentleman is so annoying.

378
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
What annoying?

379
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
The Great Xia Lian Yi Ke is as good as him.

380
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
He is so strong.

381
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,760
It's just one action.

382
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
You can do it but

383
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
you can't represent another person.

384
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
If you believe me,

385
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,160
I knew it was a cool place.

386
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,960
It's not a good person.

387
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,560
Listen to me when you hear the story.

388
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Don't talk nonsense.

389
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Come on.

390
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,160
So, the Lotus Inn has become a great mansion

391
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,160
in their heart.

392
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,360
Let's go.

393
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,160
Put down the things in the inn.

394
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,560
Get some medicine in the medicine shop.

395
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,160
Yes.

396
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,560
No need.

397
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
I don't want anyone to know

398
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,760
that I am in West Zhou Manor.

399
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,960
Do you understand?

400
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,560
What should I do?

401
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,960
I don't like looking for a private woman.

402
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,360
So, don't let me see this painting.

403
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,960
Or else, I will break your legs.

404
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,560
Yes.

405
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,560
There is a woman.

406
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,160
Go.

407
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,560
Go.

408
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,560
There is Stella.

409
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,760
OK.

410
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,980
She.

411
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Hello, guys.

412
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,360
Please come in.

413
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,760
Come in, Big Brother Xiao Ma.

414
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
Two guests are on the way.

415
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Second Master, please come upstairs.

416
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Second Master, please come inside.

417
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
This is your room.

418
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Second Master.

419
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Okay, thank you.

420
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Young Master, we came to Xizhou's house.

421
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,160
The Prince asked Young Master to help find the girl.

422
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Why did you say so to the guards?

423
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,160
I didn't agree to it and I won't.

424
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Since Father has been looking for the girl for so many years,

425
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,160
he should know that mother is in danger because of someone's words.

426
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Now he wants me to help him find the girl.

427
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Even if I really see him, I won't take him back.

428
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
The Prince's health is always at home.

429
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
He's been coughing more and more lately.

430
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
He can't even take a bath.

431
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Young Master came to Xizhou's house this time

432
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,160
because he was worried that the Prince would take the medicine for him.

433
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Maybe the Prince is sick.

434
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,160
He might be more useful than the medicine.

435
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Thank you.

436
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
Wait a minute.

437
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
There's one more thing.

438
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Master received a message that there's a woman who's crying because of the Prince.

439
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,160
I saw the guards in the palace on the street.

440
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,160
You two follow the guards.

441
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Send someone else to find her.

442
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Kill her after you find the girl.

443
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Yes, Your Highness.

444
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Master, we have a shop.

445
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,160
We can only get the goods in this way.

446
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,160
The medicine is indeed the medicine of Xizhou's soul.

447
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Master Yun, you're welcome.

448
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
The goods are very valuable.

449
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
Be careful on the way.

450
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,160
There's something that I need to do for the medicine.

451
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Just open it.

452
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Of course.

453
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Master Lin, I'll take my leave.

454
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
I'll take my leave.

455
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Let's go.

456
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Master, I'll take my leave.

457
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Master, I'll take my leave.

458
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Master, I'll take my leave.

459
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Master, I'll take my leave.

460
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Master.

461
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Master, I'll take my leave.

462
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Master.

463
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Master.

464
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Master.

465
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
Master.

466
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Master.

467
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Master.

468
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
Come over here.

469
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
Looks like there's something interesting.

470
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
I need to go out.

471
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Where will you go, Master?

472
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Let's start the time.

473
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
These are just ordinary herbs.

474
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
They are not worth the money.

475
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Go to hell!

476
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Lian Yi Ke!

477
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Who are you? How dare you steal from Guan Dao?

478
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,960
If you do this now, I will spare you.

479
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Brothers, don't be afraid.

480
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,160
He is just one person. Let's kill him first and then do this.

481
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Kill him!

482
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Hurry up!

483
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Hurry up and go!

484
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Brothers, you guys, follow me!

485
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Hurry up!

486
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Go!

487
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Hurry up!

488
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Hurry up and go!

489
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,160
My wine! My rice!

490
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Kill him!

491
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,160
Kill him!

492
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Lian Yi Ke!

493
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
It really is Lian Yi Ke!

494
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Lian Yi Ke must be a bad guy.

495
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
He is a bad guy.

496
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
He is a bad guy.

497
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Don't be angry!

498
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Lian Yi Ke has a helper! Kill him!

499
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
I will kill you!

500
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,160
I am not dreaming, am I?

501
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Lian Yi Ke!

502
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Lian Yi Ke!

503
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Kill him!

504
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
Am I that pretty?

505
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
I should have taken the headband off.

506
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Thank you for saving me just now.

507
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,160
You are a hero. Don't joke with me.

508
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
I know I was just helping you.

509
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
If I hadn't lost a bottle of wine to you,

510
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
you would have defeated those people.

511
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,160
But I think it's weird.

512
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
You are so strong.

513
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Why didn't you start shooting them?

514
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
I just want to protect those innocent people.

515
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,160
In the end, I can't kill them.

516
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
You are so nice.

517
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
Thank you very much.

518
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
I was thinking...

519
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,560
I can't afford to do business.

520
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,960
I'm just a useless person.

521
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,640
I'm just helping you.

522
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,160
How much is the money?

523
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,760
Wait. I'll give it to you.

524
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,040
Brother Lian Xiao.

525
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,600
How old are you?

526
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,520
You look young.

527
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,800
Not thirty yet.

528
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,120
By the way,

529
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,720
where are you from?

530
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,280
I heard from Mr. Shu that

531
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,080
you usually work in the capital.

532
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,240
How come you come to Xizhou?

533
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,880
What?

534
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,360
No need to find it.

535
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,400
The thanks I sent out

536
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,720
won't be taken back.

537
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,560
Here.

538
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:31,360
=== Marriage of Ming with Emperor afar ===

539
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,720
It really is.

540
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:15,640

00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,260
A repeated story in my youth,

543
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,340
nothing limited to him.

544
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,200
I will be beautiful

545
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,800
until the sky,

546
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,900
and decide,

547
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,780
when I'm at my best.

548
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,040
I am a child's child.

549
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,960
By wearing reacting spinners,

550
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,660
I can see the Bundestag

551
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,420
seem employed in a gaming society.

552
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,900
Apart from me,

553
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,660
I'm still near...

554
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,180
The

I'm not afraid of the wind.

560
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
I'm afraid of the rain.

561
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
I'm afraid of the wind.

562
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,820
I'm afraid of the rain.

563
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,820
I'm afraid of the wind.

564
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,820
I'm afraid of the rain.

565
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,820
I'm afraid of the rain.

566
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,820
I'm afraid of the rain.

567
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,820
I'm afraid of the rain.

00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,820
I'm afraid of the rain.

I'm afraid of the rain.

I'm afraid of the rain.

571
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,820
I'm afraid of the rain.

572
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,820
I'm afraid of the rain.

573
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
I'm afraid of the rain.

574
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,380
She can come close again.

575
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,540
The Empress Dowager我要来西州府找私生女 old man and the fanciful installation from Xizhou

576
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,060
Especially the eyes.

577
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,580
Trying to棉 the May precisa nobody's makeup.

578
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,760
It's okay for you.

579
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,400
What made you realize this coincidence?

580
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,340
There are many chances to repay.

581
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,620
Join us soon.

582
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,420
The first lady of the澳門, Yu Le Chang, 994466, come.

583
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,980
Miss.

584
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,100
Master asked me to come to Xizhou

585
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,780
to pick up the herbs from the Fiyun Bao.

586
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,260
I'm the one who picked up the herbs.

587
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,100
It's impossible to walk on the wind.

588
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,420
It's only you who can do it.

589
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,380
Tell me.

590
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,460
Who else in the medicine factory knows about this?

591
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,340
Please forgive me, Miss.

592
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,700
I'm the only one who knows about this.

593
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,700
I didn't expect

594
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,500
a sudden appearance in the medicine department.

595
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,860
Please don't worry, Miss.

596
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,420
I've sent someone to pick up the herbs.

597
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
The person who picked up the herbs

598
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,860
was the one who picked up the herbs.

599
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,220
The government is already attacking him.

600
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,740
Your reaction is fast.

601
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,900
The Fiyun Bao is very gentle and gentle.

602
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,540
This kind of herbs is very necessary.

603
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,260
Master asked me to pick up the herbs.

604
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,660
It's good that they can't be cured in time

605
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,980
and have some energy.

606
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,340
I didn't expect that

607
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,340
they were replaced by Lian Yi Ke.

608
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,780
Lian Yi Ke is very mysterious.

609
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,660
Will he find out the spirit form?

610
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,140
He will definitely suspect it.

611
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,300
Not only Lian Yi Ke will suspect it,

612
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,540
but also Fiyun Bao.

613
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,140
But don't worry.

614
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,980
I won't leave any evidence.

615
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,860
They will find out

616
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,620
the spirit form.

617
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,780
Get ready.

618
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,660
Come to the room and ask around.

619
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,220
Catch people in the spirit form?

620
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,940
They are completely against them.

621
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,700
You have the spirit form tomorrow.

622
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,900
What are you afraid of?

623
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,860
And do you think that

624
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,420
after this disaster,

625
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,380
Fiyun Bao will buy herbs with you here?

626
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,140
Miss is right.

627
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,980
I am the one who is more worried.

628
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,540
You sent some men from the spirit form.

629
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,540
You asked for women who look like each other.

630
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,300
Lian Yi Ke and I

631
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,060
caught her and saw her.

632
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,980
If she dares to run away,

633
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,420
kill her

634
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,660
and bring her back to me.

635
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,380
She is...

636
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,420
You don't need to know who she is.

637
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,900
As long as you obey my order.

638
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,740
Do you understand?

639
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,780
Yes.

640
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,540
I will go to the lady

641
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,700
and send men.

642
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,020
Dad.

643
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,860
When did we get the spirit form?

644
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,140
They haven't left.

645
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,740
If we continue like this,

646
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,340
we will destroy the spirit form

647
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,940
in Mingyue Mountain sooner or later.

648
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,900
Their wild spirit is too big.

649
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,620
They want to destroy Fiyun Bao.

650
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,020
Fiyun Bao

651
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,460
is one of the four families in the capital.

652
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,580
I know that it's not possible.

653
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,180
The spirit form

654
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,500
is supported by Mingyue Mountain.

655
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,100
These years,

656
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,780
we have done a lot of things

657
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,140
for them.

658
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,580
The more we work,

659
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,940
the more we can be highly-predictive.

660
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,100
Otherwise,

661
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,340
we can't act recklessly.

662
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,940
What are you going to do?

663
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,820
I will take a step.

664
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,820
I asked her to check this woman.

665
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,540
It's not accurate.

666
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,700
She is someone in our family with no genealogy.

667
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,300
Right.

668
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,780
Let me see.

669
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,660
Let me see.

670
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,260
Let me see.

671
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,180
Let me see.

672
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,660
Someone reported to Lord Zhifu

673
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,220
that someone took the medicine

674
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,660
in the Xizhou Prefecture.

675
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,260
There are many dead bodies

676
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,140
and found the sword

677
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,740
with the Lian Yi Ke symbol.

678
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,060
Now, Lord Zhifu ordered

679
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,700
to search the Lian Yi Ke

680
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,340
and report to the intelligence bureau

681
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,820
to the silver and silver.

682
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,300
The sword with the Lian Yi Ke symbol

683
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,660
was taken by Lian Yi Ke?

684
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,900
Yes.

685
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,700
Maybe he killed the bandits

686
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,220
to protect the medicine.

687
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,220
Lian Yi Ke was always

688
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,180
a criminal.

689
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,820
Why did he suddenly take the medicine?

690
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,060
Exactly.

691
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,780
The government can't find out

692
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,540
and just take the blame.

693
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,100
Yes.

694
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,500
The Lian Yi Ke is a big snake.

695
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,180
How can it catch a big snake?

696
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,940
Because it's a big snake,

697
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,900
the government can't see a big snake.

698
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,660
Yes.

699
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,740
Stop arguing.

700
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,460
This is Lord Zhifu's order.

701
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,740
You dare to take the medicine.

702
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,660
Come on, girl.

703
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,660
Now,

704
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,980
stop arguing.

705
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,100
Be brave, girl.

706
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,260
Stop arguing.

707
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,460
Baby.

708
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,820
Get up.

709
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,220
No more arguing.

710
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,220
Stop arguing.

711
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,420
It's him who recorded it.

712
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:45,780
His spies

713
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,820
happened to awaken the alcohol.

714
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,900
You guys take the Lian Yi Ke空.

715
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,740
Get out of the way.

716
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,860
She's quite smart.

717
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,940
Hua, you've earned hundreds of dollars today.

718
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,500
Yes.

719
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,860
It's a pity that my uncle didn't let me do business.

720
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,100
I earned money secretly.

721
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,380
If I get money to expand the scale,

722
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,580
I'll definitely earn more.

723
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,740
I didn't expect you to be so good at earning money.

724
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,580
He must want you to be a bodyguard.

725
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,940
You're the only one who doesn't know.

726
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,420
When my uncle was young,

727
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,660
he owed a lot of money to the housekeeper.

728
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,540
He had to hide from those women.

729
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,140
Let me tell you.

730
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,500
He asked me to call him uncle.

731
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,620
Actually, he's my father.

732
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,820
Look at my daughter.

733
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,660
I'm going to talk.

734
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,380
You're leaving.

735
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,860
I'm going, sister-in-law.

736
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,540
Okay.

737
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,740
It seems that I've overthink it.

738
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,300
How could my father have met

739
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,180
such a long-lost girl?

740
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,580
Let's go.

741
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,580
Young Master, are you not going to follow me?

742
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,220
It's important.

743
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,180
Go and find out who reported the number of the drug.

744
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,740
Maybe there's a clue.

745
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:19,780
Yes.

746
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,580
This is the money I spent with you long ago.

747
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,940
Is it a high rotation plan

748
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,940
that's used to heal theakra areas

749
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,640
from girls' sight after meeting

750
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,500
a dusty cloud before this sangat?

751
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:17,900
rendre 준비direction

752
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,260
Good

753
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,600
the treasure chest is for you

754
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,860
are there any civilizations?

755
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,000
hey

756
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,460
Huang

757
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,420
Huang

758
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,800

759
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,300
difficulty

760
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,100
sor Occurred

761
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,520
I'm back

762
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,900
I don't care about others.

763
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,300
I'm a good cook.

764
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,460
I'll make a dish of rice with salt and vegetables.

765
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,260
I'll eat half of it.

766
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,700
You can eat the rest of the wine.

767
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,260
Are you trying to make a business out of me?

768
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,580
Wine?

769
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
Why don't you believe me?

770
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,100
With my smart talent,

771
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,060
I can get a lot of experience from cooking.

772
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,260
Do you still need 20 yuan a day?

773
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,260
If you really don't believe me,

774
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,660
when you're well,

775
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,020
go and get it yourself.

776
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,820
Did you see a new class come?

777
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,900
It's not that I don't believe you.

778
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,580
We've been hiding for so many years.

779
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,100
I'm afraid you'll be worried.

780
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,780
You'll be in danger.

781
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,620
Don't worry, Uncle Jiu.

782
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,020
I'm keeping your watch.

783
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,220
Be careful.

784
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,420
I'll go get the medicine.

785
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,740
My bad.

786
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:27,300
