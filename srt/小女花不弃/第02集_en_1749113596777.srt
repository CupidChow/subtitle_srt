1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The moon is shining, the sea is green, the hair is long

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
When it meets the wind, it will be small

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The starry sky will also fade

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The starry sky will never be old

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The wind is blowing, the wind is blowing

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The river is changing, the river is falling

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The river is flowing, the river is flowing

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The sky is clear, the wind is blowing

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The red spring is burning, the future is better

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The flower will become bright and beautiful

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The rain will not stop and it will not fall

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The sky is clear, the wind is blowing

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The flower will become bright and beautiful

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
La la la la la la la la la...

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The flower is willing to bloom

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Ah

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000

if it's Lin Yike who gave me a heart

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,800
I've talked to you for so many times

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,680
can't take too many made-up tener

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,560
and can't do business

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,960
Why do you not listen

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,360

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,760
I did all of it

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,920
I haven't been found out for so long.

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,360
Your enemies must have given up on us.

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,960
You're so stupid.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,120
I'm telling you.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,520
They will never give up on us.

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,720
You did this

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,600
because you put yourself in danger.

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,720
Do you know that?

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,200
I don't know.

48
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,600
You didn't tell me anything.

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,120
How do I know what's dangerous

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,960
and what's not dangerous?

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,760
I didn't tell you.

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,880
It's for your own good.

53
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,680
I made money for your own good.

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
You took the medicine for more than ten years

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,040
and your body is broken.

56
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,520
You've been coughing like this.

57
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,320
I used to see how you treated me.

58
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,120
I'm fine.

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll be fine today.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,120
I don't need your help.

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,560
I don't care about you.

62
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,560
You coughed for months.

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,040
You're like this.

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,920
You love to cough.

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,720
You cough and cough.

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,720
You're not fit for the medicine.

67
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,960
If I hadn't been a kid,

68
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,360
you wouldn't have had the medicine.

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,400
Yes.

70
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,680
We have it.

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,080
喝 a glass.

72
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,520
Uncle.

73
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,440
How about this?

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,380
You've found out this time.

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,200
Let's use my money

76
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,440
to cure everyone.

77
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
Once you're well,

78
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,760
I'll guarantee that you'll stay here.

79
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,880
Let me play with them.

80
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,120
Let them taste the taste.

81
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,820
Jingjing,

82
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,240
come on.

83
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,840
No matter what illness or what issues you face.

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,460
There's nothing.

85
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,940
God rest our下を.

86
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,880
izione hence,

87
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,420
we must have him taught us to be cautious.

88
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,740
Come on.

89
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,700
you know what,

90
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,740
Moon...

91
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,740
It's really getting cold.

92
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,940
From now on, you'll listen to me.

93
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,740
Yin Yin.

94
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,540
Eat.

95
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,140
Slowly. Don't hold it.

96
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,140
Be careful.

97
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,340
Uncle!

98
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,540
Uncle! Uncle, what's wrong with you?

99
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,740
Don't scare me, Uncle!

100
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,340
Uncle!

101
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,740
come

102
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,720
oh

103
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,340
police

104
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,060
Doctor, how is it?

105
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,620
What happened to my uncle?

106
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,540
Why did he suddenly faint?

107
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,500
He's a serious illness.

108
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,980
He's already in a high fever.

109
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,340
His body is already dead.

110
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,780
He's in a very bad state.

111
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,940
You should prepare him for the next death.

112
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,460
Isn't it just a cough?

113
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,860
How can it be a cough?

114
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,980
Doctor, doctor!

115
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,620
Please save my uncle!

116
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,860
I'm just his family.

117
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,660
Please save him!

118
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,740
Miss, hurry up.

119
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
Get up.

120
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,780
Miss, I'm not good enough for you.

121
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,740
But I heard that there's a poison in the medicine.

122
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,060
It's called the spring pill.

123
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,620
It can only be used for three years.

124
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,100
It needs a year of work.

125
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,420
It's really rare.

126
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,420
But the price is very high.

127
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,540
It's rare for ordinary people.

128
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,620
The master of the medicine clinic is kind.

129
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,540
Please save him.

130
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,980
I need the medicine.

131
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,260
Young Master, I asked.

132
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,220
The medicine is gone.

133
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,780
It's the report from the clinic.

134
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,140
But why are they so fast?

135
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,940
And it's a group of bandits.

136
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,540
Why did they become one person?

137
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,100
They're in a hurry to follow the medicine.

138
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,260
And now, the first time, the report says that it's a group of bandits.

139
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,660
Why are they so fast?

140
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,540
Unless they follow the medicine.

141
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,140
Or maybe it's the medicine clinic.

142
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,340
Young Master.

143
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Young Master.

144
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,220
What are you thinking?

145
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,540
You're thinking so much.

146
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,660
That girl can't do business.

147
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,540
She still needs to be a beggar.

148
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,500
Think about it.

149
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,340
The reason she said it is so bad.

150
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,340
Then do you want to go to the clinic again?

151
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
No need.

152
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,700
My father has gone to the clinic.

153
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,340
Why should I worry about it?

154
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,340
Go to the medicine clinic.

155
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,900
Take the medicine first.

156
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,540
And check the address.

157
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,100
Don't worry about the rest.

158
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Yes.

159
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,020
This is li man skincare there.

160
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,980
And I'm looking for natural products.

161
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,100
This is li man skincare.

162
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,340
And you're looking for the natural ingredients.

163
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,100
15 and 10 and a half hundred Brenda

164
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,380
You've moved the photographer out.

165
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,180
Your Highness, please tell me how this young man is doing.

166
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,820
I wonder how His Highness is doing.

167
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,860
I'm willing to take the blame.

168
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,300
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

169
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,900
Rise.

170
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,660
Sit.

171
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

172
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm here for the medicine

173
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:17,300
made with Father at

174
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,540
Yanglingounds Light.

175
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,540
But the medicine is still effective.

176
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,540
Even if you use this medicine,

177
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,540
you can also die in a few months.

178
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,540
Then how much can I sell it to me?

179
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,540
The medicine is in the hospital.

180
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,540
Your Highness, this is what you should do.

181
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,540
How can you say it's sold?

182
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,540
I have two more rounds of rounds of rounds.

183
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,540
I'll order someone to bring it to you.

184
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,540
Guanyiang, bring the medicine in the hospital.

185
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,540
I only have two rounds of rounds.

186
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
Yes, Your Highness.

187
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,540
Thank you for your kindness.

188
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
I heard that

189
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,540
the medicine is the first-largest medicine in Xizhou.

190
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
The degree of Chinese power in the hospital

191
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,540
is not comparable to any of the hospitals in the capital.

192
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,540
I'd like to see it.

193
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,540
I don't dare to.

194
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,540
It's just that the business is a little big.

195
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,540
How can it be compared to the hospital in the capital?

196
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,540
If you are willing to accompany me,

197
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
go and have a look.

198
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,540
Let's go.

199
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,540
Please.

200
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,540
Open the door!

201
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,540
Coming!

202
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,540
Go, go, go.

203
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,540
The medicine is still in Xizhou.

204
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,540
I'm not here to buy the medicine.

205
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,540
I'm here to buy the medicine.

206
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,540
What medicine?

207
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,540
The medicine for the spring.

208
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,540
You bought the medicine for the spring?

209
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
Do you know how expensive it is?

210
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,540
I have...

211
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,540
You can't buy a thousand taels of silver for one.

212
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,540
And we have only two in the store.

213
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,540
Go back.

214
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,540
I only need one.

215
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,540
I have more than fifty taels of silver.

216
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,540
Look, I can still be in the hospital.

217
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,540
If it's not enough,

218
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
I can sell it to the medicine shop.

219
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,540
I'm very smart.

220
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
I didn't expect that your little beggar is rich.

221
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
Didn't I tell you that

222
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,540
even if you have money, you can't buy the medicine.

223
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,540
The shopkeeper has already sold these two medicines

224
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,540
to a gentleman named Chen.

225
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,540
Go back. I won't tell you.

226
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
No, I need the medicine.

227
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,540
Go back.

228
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,540
Go away.

229
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,540
Go away.

230
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,540
I renovated these.

231
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,540
Your Highness.

232
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,540
Mr. Chen,

233
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,540
how many days are you going to stay in the Xizhou Manor?

234
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
Two or three days.

235
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,540
It's not fun to stay in the Xizhou Manor.

236
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,540
I'm going back to the capital in two or three days.

237
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,540
The scenery is beautiful.

238
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
It's necessary for the locals to be the guests.

239
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,540
If you don't mind,

240
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,540
I'll let you stay alone

241
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,540
and accompany you to the Xizhou Manor.

242
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,540
You can leave now.

243
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
How can I thank you?

244
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,540
This is my daughter's honor.

245
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,540
Okay.

246
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Then, I'll be in your care for the next few days.

247
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,540
Ling Zhuang!

248
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,540
Please, please.

249
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,540
I'm almost dead.

250
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,540
I know you want Ling Zhuang.

251
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,540
There's a medicine called the spring medicine.

252
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,540
Please, please sell it to me.

253
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,540
Let me go back and save my uncle.

254
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,540
Young Master, is he the one who can't be found?

255
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,540
I've already given the medicine to Young Master Chen.

256
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,540
The supplement is already in the stock.

257
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,540
You can use it to take two old bodies to the medicine room.

258
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,540
Go back and cure the illness.

259
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,540
No.

260
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,540
Mr. Chen.

261
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,540
You know that kind of toy-like place.

262
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,540
It's not a good person.

263
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
You can hear the story from now on.

264
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Don't talk nonsense.

265
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,540
Come on.

266
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,540
It's over.

267
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,540
Why didn't you come in?

268
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,540
Young Master Chen.

269
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,540
I wonder why you bought this medicine?

270
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,540
My father's body is a little bit cold.

271
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,540
I bought it to cure his body.

272
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,540
I bought it to cure his body.

273
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,540
I'm asking for medicine to save his life.

274
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,540
You're asking for medicine to keep his body.

275
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,540
And I heard that you bought two.

276
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,540
Can you give me one?

277
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,540
When the medicine room is re-contained,

278
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,540
you won't be late to give it to Mr. Chen.

279
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,540
You're right.

280
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,540
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

281
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Don't be anxious.

282
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
You're right.

283
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,540
But I can't take the things I want.

284
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,540
You...

285
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,540
Why don't you make sense?

286
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
You bought the medicine first.

287
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,540
How can you make the decision by yourself?

288
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
Besides, I gave you the medicine.

289
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,540
Why don't you buy it?

290
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,540
What are you doing?

291
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
Let go of my young master.

292
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,540
You can't take the medicine.

293
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,540
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

294
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,540
My family has been ill.

295
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,540
He raised me since I was a child.

296
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,540
Now I can't repay his kindness.

297
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,540
I have to pay him back.

298
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,540
This sorrow, this heartache, this helplessness.

299
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
Let go of my hand.

300
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,540
You should understand.

301
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,540
Let go of me.

302
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,540
You're not coming back.

303
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,540
I know.

304
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
Mr. Chen, you know my filial piety.

305
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,540
But because I'm too busy with my breakfast,

306
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,540
I feel uncomfortable.

307
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
I apologize to you.

308
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,540
You're so ridiculous.

309
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,540
You can't be so impulsive.

310
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,540
You don't need to apologize.

311
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
Now I got the medicine.

312
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,540
I feel comfortable.

313
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,540
Lin Zhuangzhuo, what are you doing?

314
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Get out of here.

315
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,540
Let's go.

316
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Mr. Chen, let's go.

317
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,540
Give me the medicine.

318
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,540
Let's go.

319
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,540
I'm so tired.

320
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,540
I'll kill you.

321
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Okay.

322
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,540
What are you doing, Mr. Chen?

323
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,540
You're so stubborn.

324
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,540
You don't look like a good person.

325
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,540
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
I'm not capable.

327
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,540
I can't get the spring egg.

328
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
I shouldn't have quarreled with you yesterday.

329
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,540
I was wrong.

330
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,540
Wake up, okay?

331
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,540
I promise I won't let you get angry.

332
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,540
I won't do business.

333
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,540
I'll have a good meal.

334
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,540
Wake up.

335
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
Lian Yike.

336
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
Where is the spring egg?

337
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Uncle.

338
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Here.

339
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,540
Lian Yike.

340
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
Thank you.

341
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Uncle.

342
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,540
You're awake.

343
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
Great.

344
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,540
You're awake.

345
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,540
I'll get up.

346
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
Uncle.

347
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
Uncle.

348
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
I thought I couldn't see you again.

349
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,540
Uncle Jiu thought

350
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
I couldn't see you again.

351
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
I'm not angry.

352
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,540
I thought

353
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
I could take care of you for a lifetime.

354
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,540
But

355
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,540
I'm so proud of myself.

356
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
All these years,

357
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,540
you took care of Uncle Jiu.

358
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,540
Uncle Jiu's life

359
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,540
has gone.

360
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,540
I'll take you to the capital.

361
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,540
Mr. Zhu,

362
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,540
don't you want to know

363
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,540
your real identity?

364
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,540
When you arrive in the capital,

365
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,540
I'll tell you.

366
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,540
You've grown up.

367
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,540
You can decide

368
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
how to go.

369
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,540
To the capital.

370
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,540
How can I go to the capital?

371
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,540
Go.

372
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,540
Go.

373
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
Within two hours,

374
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
bring him down.

375
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
I'll put him in the fire.

376
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
Yes, sir.

377
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Don't be afraid.

378
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
Don't be afraid.

379
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,540
Miss,

380
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,540
are you still wearing clothes?

381
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,540
No.

382
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,540
Have you seen someone you know?

383
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,540
I haven't seen him.

384
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Shan,

385
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
I'm leaving.

386
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
I won't wear clothes anymore.

387
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,540
You can send the clothes

388
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,540
to my friend.

389
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Okay.

390
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
Go.

391
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,540
Go.

392
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
Hurry up.

393
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,540
Tell him to go back.

394
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,540
Who let him in?

395
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,540
I found someone.

396
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,540
Go out.

397
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
Go out.

398
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
I found him.

399
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,540
Mr. Chen.

400
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,540
Don't be so surprised.

401
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
You can.

402
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,540
You actually found him here.

403
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,540
You can go.

404
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,540
I won't give you the body.

405
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,540
It seems that Mr. Jiu

406
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
doesn't know

407
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
where you got his body.

408
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,540
Mr. Chen, you misunderstood.

409
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,540
I heard that

410
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Mr. Chen will return to the capital in two days.

411
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
I want you to take me there.

412
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
It's boring to be alone.

413
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,540
If you take me there,

414
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,540
I can change my mind.

415
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,540
Mr. Chen will be happy.

416
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
You want to go to the capital

417
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
to cure your family's illness?

418
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,540
Mr. Chen's body is so smart.

419
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,540
He is so smart.

420
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
If Miss Jiu

421
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,540
is with Mr. Chen,

422
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
she will be happy forever.

423
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,540
Well,

424
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,540
the doctor here

425
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,540
can't take care of my uncle Jiu's illness.

426
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
I heard that

427
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,540
the doctor in the capital is more powerful.

428
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,540
That's why I want to go to the capital.

429
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
But the road is long and far away.

430
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
My uncle Jiu's illness is serious.

431
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,540
He can't take care of it all the time.

432
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,540
So I want to treat him

433
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,540
with a smart and kind mind.

434
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,540
I want to take us to the capital.

435
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
Mr. Chen's great kindness.

436
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
I want to

437
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
make him happy forever.

438
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,540
I want to make him happy forever.

439
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,540
You are so nice.

440
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,540
You are actually in the hell, right?

441
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,540
Why should I help you

442
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,540
when I am with you?

443
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,540
You should go by yourself.

444
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
Don't disturb my uncle's peace.

445
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
Mr. Chen.

446
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,540
What are you doing?

447
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,540
My uncle Jiu's illness

448
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
can't be cured.

449
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
His illness is serious.

450
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
I know.

451
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
I said wrongly before.

452
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,540
I apologize to you.

453
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
But my uncle Jiu's illness

454
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,540
can't be cured.

455
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,540
Young Master,

456
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,540
why don't you take him back to the capital?

457
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,540
Let go of me.

458
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,540
Let go of me.

459
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,540
I beg you, Mr. Chen.

460
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Let go of me.

461
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
You really don't agree?

462
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
I don't agree.

463
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Then don't regret it.

464
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Why should I regret it?

465
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540
I am happy and free.

466
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,540
Young Master.

467
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
No.

468
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
You...

469
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,540
Young Master.

470
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,540
It's okay if you don't want me.

471
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,540
But you can't

472
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
leave me alone.

473
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
What are you talking about?

474
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,540
Hey, you.

475
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
What are you doing?

476
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,540
What are you thinking?

477
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,540
Young Master.

478
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,540
Young Master is angry with him.

479
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
Who is angry with him?

480
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
I didn't expect

481
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
he has so many bad things

482
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,540
in his family.

483
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
Why?

484
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,540
What are you talking about?

485
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,540
Young Master doesn't know you.

486
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,540
I know I am a despicable person.

487
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,540
I shouldn't be a despicable person.

488
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,540
But that day,

489
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,540
we were in love.

490
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
You said you wouldn't take me away.

491
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
I tell you.

492
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
If you dare to talk to me again,

493
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,540
I will kill you.

494
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
You woman.

495
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,540
I have always wanted to serve you.

496
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,540
I have never seen you before.

497
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,540
Don't put me in a dirty situation.

498
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,540
You are just a despicable person.

499
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,540
Do you know what your Young Master does at night?

500
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,540
He didn't stay here last night.

501
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
Stop it.

502
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Enough.

503
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Enough.

504
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
Enough.

505
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
Young Master.

506
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Young Master, look.

507
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,540
Why are you so embarrassed?

508
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,540
I just want to ask you for a favor.

509
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
I promise

510
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
I will never disturb you

511
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,540
in the future.

512
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,540
What do you think?

513
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,540
If you agree,

514
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,540
I will go down to explain to them right now.

515
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,540
I am mistaken.

516
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,540
You think you can threaten us like this?

517
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,540
How about you try it?

518
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
Didn't you say

519
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,540
you have a baby in your belly?

520
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
What's wrong?

521
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,540
You are shy?

522
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,540
You are not a character.

523
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,540
But you are a hero.

524
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,540
As long as you are willing to accompany me,

525
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
I will take you to the capital.

526
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,540
How about it?

527
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,540
Hua Buqi, what are you mad at?

528
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
He is just a despicable person.

529
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,540
He is a man of the past.

530
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,540
Do you think he really looks like a beggar?

531
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,540
Young Master.

532
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
No.

533
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,540
But he is a man of the past.

534
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
Young Master.

535
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,540
Young Master.

536
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,540
Don't do this.

537
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,540
There are so many people watching.

538
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,540
Shut up.

539
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,540
Don't talk.

540
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
Don't talk.

541
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,540
Don't talk.

542
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,540
It hurts.

543
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
It hurts.

544
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,540
Move away.

545
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,540
What are you looking at?

546
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Move away.

547
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
Shut up.

548
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,540
Don't talk.

549
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Shi.

550
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,540
Take the clothes you changed yesterday.

551
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
And the bags.

552
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
They should smell good.

553
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
Take them all.

554
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,540
Look at him.

555
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,540
If you don't wash them,

556
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,540
you can't take him to the capital.

557
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,540
Yes, Young Master.

558
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,540
As long as I finish the clothes,

559
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,540
you take me to the capital.

560
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,540
Yes.

561
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
Okay.

562
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,540
Miss Lin.

563
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,540
My father ordered me to take you to the Western Zhou Mansion.

564
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,540
I wonder when you want to leave.

565
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,540
You are sick now.

566
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
Thank you, Miss Lin.

567
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,540
You are welcome.

568
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,540
It's my honor to accompany you.

569
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
Shi.

570
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,540
Watch him closely.

571
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Before I come back,

572
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,540
I want to tell you

573
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,540
that I need to wash all the clothes.

574
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,540
I just need to wash the clothes.

575
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,540
I will wash them for you.

576
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
Go.

577
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,540
Don't let no one wait for you.

578
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,540
Isn't it just to wash clothes?

579
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,540
Where are the clothes?

580
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,540
These are the clothes

581
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,540
for you two.

582
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,540
These are all

583
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,540
from my Young Master.

584
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
These are just clothes

585
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,540
from the oil.

586
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,540
In the capital,

587
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,540
our Young Master has two rooms

588
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,540
to put clothes on.

589
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,540
It's so hard to find a rich man.

590
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,540
Why do you need so many clothes?

591
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,540
You can't tell me.

592
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,540
Young Master is not a normal person.

593
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
No matter how many clothes there are,

594
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
it's not strange.

595
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,540
You just wash them slowly.

596
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,540
You are so naughty.

597
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,540
You are so naughty.

598
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,540
You are so naughty.

599
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,540
You are so naughty.

600
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,540
Isn't this the girl

601
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
from the government office?

602
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,540
Yes.

603
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,540
You are so naughty.

604
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,540
You are pregnant with a child.

605
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
You can wash so many clothes.

606
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,540
He is not a normal man.

607
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,540
Yes.

608
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,540
There is no good man.

609
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
Miss,

610
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,540
don't wash them.

611
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,540
You are pregnant with a child.

612
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,540
You are so naughty.

613
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,540
Do you know that?

614
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,540
It's okay.

615
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,540
It's okay.

616
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,540
This is my life.

617
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,540
Forget it.

618
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,540
Don't worry about others.

619
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,540
Don't be so cruel.

620
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,540
No, it's not human.

621
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,540
You...

622
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,540
Wash clothes.

623
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,540
Wash clothes.

624
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,540
No.

625
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
Darling.

626
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
Darling.

627
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
Darling.

628
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Darling.

629
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,540
Darling.

630
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,540
Darling.

631
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Mr. Chen.

632
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,540
I come here often.

633
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
Do you like it?

634
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
Even the beautiful scenery,

635
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,540
it's not just me.

636
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,540
I didn't expect to get a beautician like you

637
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
I heard that

638
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,540
a person who stole the medicine

639
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,540
from a person with a bright face

640
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,540
wanted to take it back to Shandong.

641
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,540
It seems that

642
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,140
he needs to save a few more people.

643
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,340
You're so kind.

644
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,140
Right, Miss Lin.

645
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,540
I heard that the medicine

646
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,140
was bought from the medicine shop.

647
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,540
Exactly.

648
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,140
And the medicine

649
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,540
is from one of the four families.

650
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,540
He's a treasured person.

651
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,940
His medicine was not taken out

652
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
in the seven provinces.

653
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,740
Father is really annoyed by this.

654
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,140
You said that the Lotus Robe Knight

655
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,140
is so big.

656
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,140
It feels like it's a treasured medicine.

657
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,740
Are you sure that

658
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,940
the Chief of the Lin Clan is the Lotus Robe Knight?

659
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,540
I don't know about it.

660
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,940
Father always

661
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,940
doesn't allow me to do

662
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,740
things on my own.

663
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,740
That's right.

664
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,140
Let's not talk about these annoying words.

665
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,540
The love is the water.

666
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,940
The filial piety is the seed.

667
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,940
What a stupid woman.

668
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
Who are you?

669
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,140
Young Master.

670
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
Why are you here?

671
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,140
Didn't I tell you to

672
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,140
wash your clothes?

673
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,140
Stop talking.

674
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:41,940
The Lotus Robe Knight

675
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,940
is always talking behind you.

676
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,940
And he's also

677
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,540
talking behind you.

678
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,540
Bring him to the room right now.

679
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,540
Yes.

680
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
Didn't you tell me that

681
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,540
as long as I take you to the city,

682
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
you'll explain to them?

683
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
Why do you still have to

684
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,140
pretend to be pregnant

685
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,340
and go to the same place with someone else?

686
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,940
I'm wronged, Young Master.

687
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,140
I just

688
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,540
got cold water and my stomach aches.

689
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,540
I can't even

690
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,340
think of a way to

691
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:05,940
make people misunderstand me.

692
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,540
You're obviously pretending.

693
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
Which eye of yours

694
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,140
do you think I'm pretending?

695
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,540
Why don't you go to the basin too?

696
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,540
And your shoulder.

697
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,940
You'll be the same.

698
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
Forget it. Forget it.

699
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,140
You...

700
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,940
You go back.

701
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,540
Go back.

702
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:16,940
Young Master.

703
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Didn't I say that

704
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,740
I'll wash your clothes?

705
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,940
You take me to the capital?

706
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,140
You're a man.

707
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,140
Don't be rude.

708
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,540
I'll wash your clothes for you.

709
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
I'll wash them for you too.

710
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,740
You don't need to wash your clothes.

711
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,140
You keep the address.

712
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,540
I'll let Shi tell you when I get the address.

713
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,740
I'll stay in the broken room

714
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,140
near the stone building.

715
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
I hope that Young Master Chen

716
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,140
is a kind-hearted person.

717
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,540
Don't run away from me.

718
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,540
Don't worry.

719
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,540
I'll make you go to the city.

720
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
Otherwise, who knows

721
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,740
what I'll do to you?

722
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,540
If you're still in trouble,

723
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,340
I'll still be a man.

724
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Don't worry, Young Master Chen.

725
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,340
I'll explain to them now.

726
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
Thank you, Young Master Chen.

727
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,540
Shi.

728
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,980
How many

729
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,740
of these are my father's personal birthday?

730
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,940
There are eight of them

731
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
in this project.

732
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,140
But we need to find out

733
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,740
what's more important.

734
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,940
I didn't expect that I wouldn't go to him.

735
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,740
But he insisted on showing up

736
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,740
in front of me.

737
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,140
He wanted me to take him to the capital city myself.

738
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
If he's really

739
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,540
my father's personal birthday,

740
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,540
I won't take him to the capital city.

741
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,940
What if he isn't?

742
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,140
If he isn't,

743
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,740
he's so pitiful.

744
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,140
I want to help him.

745
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,340
Young Master,

746
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,140
why are you so stubborn?

747
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,740
Why don't we

748
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,940
investigate his identity first?

749
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,140
If he isn't the daughter of Lord Wang,

750
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,340
you'll have more to do.

751
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,740
And you can save him.

752
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,540
You don't need to think too much.

753
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,940
If he is the daughter of Lord Wang,

754
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,940
we'll make more plans.

755
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
By the way, Young Master,

756
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,940
why don't we ask him

757
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,940
about the matter?

758
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,340
No.

759
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,540
He should be here

760
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,940
to ask about it.

761
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,740
I'll investigate it myself.

762
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,340
If he isn't,

763
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,540
he's quite clever.

764
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,940
He's smarter than you.

765
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,940
Young Master,

766
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,540
I just don't have the strength to talk to him.

767
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,740
To know your story

768
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:50,640
you should look up Woossapa prevention

769
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,920
You really don't mind.

770
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,880
What do you plan to do when you're at the Palace?

771
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,280
My lord...

772
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,880
We have news.

773
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,280
In Xi Zhao Manor,

774
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,680
According to the告訴,

775
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,400
There was a lady that

776
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,280
has both Tester and Abbess.

777
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,320
She has a inviteslaught back auntie's,

778
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,440
and is very close with Yang from Zhuhua.

779
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,360
Moreover,

780
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,520
the inviteslaught doesn't allow her to do business here.

781
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,800
They have other guards.

782
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,160
That girl is secretly doing business.

783
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,840
There must be something fishy.

784
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,120
Did they catch her?

785
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,200
In the previous report,

786
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,720
they seem to have received news

787
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,040
and are going to leave Xizhou.

788
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,000
They said that

789
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,560
the prince should go back to the county.

790
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,400
People?

791
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,720
Where do I have people now?

792
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,920
Since the emperor's arrival,

793
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,560
he has trapped me in the capital.

794
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,240
It's good to hear that

795
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,520
he doesn't want me to leave

796
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,920
because he doesn't want me to.

797
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,640
He wants me to be in charge of the government.

798
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,840
Actually, I'm afraid that

799
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,480
I'll be in the capital and be in trouble.

800
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,880
How can I

801
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,880
send the guards to Xizhou now?

802
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,640
If the emperor knows

803
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,240
that I'm still in the capital,

804
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
he will definitely

805
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,800
ask me to stay in the royal family

806
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,520
and never leave.

807
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,720
Your Highness,

808
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,320
the emperor only knows that

809
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,760
the prince is looking for his own daughter.

810
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,960
Why don't we

811
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,360
inform the Xizhou family

812
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,440
and the four families

813
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,960
to help us find her together?

814
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
With the prince's identity,

815
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,040
they will definitely do their best.

816
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,080
No.

817
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,280
If

818
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,520
Zhuhua comes to a dead end

819
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,800
and finds us

820
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,280
to get rid of

821
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,600
the girl in the heaven,

822
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,520
we

823
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,040
will be in great loss.

824
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,080
It's too much.

825
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,160
And if that uncle

826
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
is really Zhuhua,

827
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,120
Zhuhua can put in

828
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,080
such a big business in the capital.

829
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:44,800
He can't do it.

830
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,880
And he can't do it.

831
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,160
How can he

832
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,840
put the girl in the palace?

833
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
If it's really so,

834
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,160
that girl

835
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,360
will become the main place

836
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,640
and live a peaceful life.

837
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,160
Your Highness,

838
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,600
we can't delay it.

839
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,160
We finally found the clue.

840
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,160
If we delay it,

841
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,880
we don't know

842
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,920
how many years we have to wait.

843
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,960
Moreover,

844
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,400
Yu'er is in the Xizhou family now.

845
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,320
We should let her go to find her.

846
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,960
Wait.

847
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,960
Yu'er is also in the Xizhou family?

848
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,560
Yu'er is in the royal family.

849
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,200
Although she is noisy with you,

850
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,840
she is very concerned about you.

851
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,960
This time, she is trying to

852
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,840
to prevent the Xizhou family

853
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,600
from going to the Demon Forest Manor.

854
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,520
We need to find the antidote for you.

855
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,920
Fu,

856
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,240
well,

857
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,680
I'm not serious about this.

858
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,360
We can't let others know.

859
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,560
I'll write to Yu'er immediately.

860
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,120
I want to tell her

861
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,360
this is my only wish before I die.

862
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,920
Let her find someone

863
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,640
in the Xizhou family.

864
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,400
Bring her back to me.

865
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,680
Your Majesty.

866
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,200
The Imperial Security Department is not in a hurry.

867
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,360
Only five or six people

868
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,600
in the family of the Demon Forest Manor are sent.

869
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,640
Why are they still failed?

870
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,280
Qingwu is a big man.

871
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,520
He didn't have the right to worry.

872
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,880
When he was trying to get the antidote,

873
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,760
he sent someone to find Xuefei's daughter.

874
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,720
Who is the one who took a bribe?

875
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,000
If it's not for someone,

876
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,760
the people sent by Qingwu

877
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,040
have enough to kill Lian Yi.

878
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,280
Please be careful.

879
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,800
The alliance between Feiyin and Mu's family

880
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,240
is not against the law.

881
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,480
I wanted to give this opportunity

882
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,040
so that Feiyin can't give the war horse

883
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,320
to the emperor in time.

884
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,560
Once the emperor is against Feiyin,

885
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,120
I can understand

886
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,400
their relationship.

887
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,600
I'll let Feiyin

888
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
do what I want.

889
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,960
Now it seems

890
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,920
we can only wait for the opportunity.

891
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,920
I'll help you take them in.

892
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,120
But I don't understand

893
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,640
why His Majesty

894
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,200
has been looking for Xuefei's daughter.

895
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,880
You know she is the daughter of Prince Qi's personal daughter.

896
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,680
She is not only the daughter of Prince Qi's personal daughter,

897
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,800
but also the daughter of Xuefei's.

898
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
I understand.

899
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,320
You still can't forget Xuefei's daughter.

900
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,720
Xuefei.

901
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,960
So you have to find her daughter

902
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,240
and keep her by your side.

903
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Don't worry.

904
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,160
I'll help you find her.

905
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,000
But I'll kill her right away.

906
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
You'll never see her again.

907
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
Uncle.

908
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
You're back.

909
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Uncle.

910
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Uncle.

911
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
You're much better.

912
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,360
Your medicine is so effective.

913
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Uncle Jiu's body is recovered.

914
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,560
We're going to the capital now.

915
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,120
Uncle Jiu.

916
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,640
Don't worry.

917
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,160
I've found the way to the capital.

918
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,680
In two days,

919
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,920
we can take the carriage to the capital.

920
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,920
Silly girl.

921
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
You still have the money to take the carriage.

922
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,200
But now,

923
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,400
I have something to tell you.

924
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,920
You're here.

925
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,600
You can hide.

926
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,040
But you can hide for a while.

927
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,120
I've never found the medicine

928
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,040
in Mingyue's Manor.

929
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Kill them!

930
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Uncle.

931
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Move.

932
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,320
Uncle Jiu.

933
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Uncle.

934
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,880
Uncle.

935
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,240
Uncle Jiu.

936
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
Uncle.

937
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Uncle Jiu.

938
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,400
Uncle.

939
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,800
You're Emirates.

940
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,720
You know that I'm Liu Yun Xin.

941
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,320
Turek H concerns Ensign.

942
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,600
Uncle.

943
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,680
Yixing.

944
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,420
Remember, I'm willing to be your master.

945
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,020
