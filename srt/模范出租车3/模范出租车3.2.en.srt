00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,759
(Lee Je Hoon)

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,790
(Jang Hyuk Jin, Bae Yoo
Ram, Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin)

3
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,939
(Taxi Driver 3)

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,194
(The names of characters,
regions, agencies,

5
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:36,490
organizations, and
other titles are fictitious.)

6
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,578
(The scenes with child
actors and animals are

7
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:38,690
compliant with the production guidelines.)

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,930
(Episode 2)

9
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,950
{\an8}Hello, sir!

10
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,460
{\an8}That old man, I told him to go easy.

11
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,580
{\an8}Good evening, sir!

12
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,900
{\an8}Hello, sir!

13
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,300
{\an8}- Did she pay off her debt?
- Yes, she did.

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,250
{\an8}Good evening, sir!

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,770
{\an8}Get her some clothes.

16
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,420
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,950
You're still alive after all this?

18
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,180
Poor thing.

19
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,930
You must be suffering.
Let me give you a hand.

20
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,910
She was stabbed with a wine opener.

21
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,080
Just the upper half of her body alone
has sustained 29 stab wounds.

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,690
29?

23
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,680
The wine opener was the murder weapon?

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,900
She was killed by suffocation.

25
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,930
Judging by the wound on her neck,

26
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,480
she was strangled by
a blue-colored stocking.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,210
What's puzzling is that the body was
displayed as if to show it off.

28
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,940
Gosh, how cruel.

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,500
Come in.

30
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,460
Please let us know if
you've found more clues.

31
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,560
Yes, sir.

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,360
Look at this.

33
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,410
Her fingerprints and
footprints have been erased.

34
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,290
So, we can't confirm her identity yet.

35
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,370
But we think she's a woman

36
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,200
who went missing in
Hong Kong two years ago.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,130
Yeah, it's her.

38
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,480
And forensics suggests

39
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,180
it doesn't seem like they
tried to hide anything.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,510
They left her out here on purpose.

41
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,880
It's like they're saying,

42
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,850
"Here she is, come get her."

43
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,950
Yeah. It's getting bolder.

44
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,990
More frequent, too.

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,740
What is it?

46
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,450
What? Got beaten up?

47
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,810
- Let's go!
<i>- Yes, sir!</i>

48
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,600
(No entry for persons
(with) without tattoos)

49
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,170
We're going to earn big
bucks with these goods.

50
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,870
This is a rare one!
We should get this, too.

51
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,400
It won't look cute if
you don't show her foot.

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,880
What the hell! Do it like this!

53
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,880
Sir.

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,580
I think the Boss will be happy with this.

55
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,680
The profits from Korea and Hong Kong
have increased since last quarter.

56
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,830
Pay them the bonus.

57
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,350
We should treat them for their hard work.

58
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,930
Will do, sir.

59
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,150
I'm very sorry, sir.

60
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,250
The selection tonight is canceled

61
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,720
because some punk stirred up trouble.

62
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,460
He's the one who caused a scene at the gym.

63
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,810
What for?

64
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,500
He got spit on his shoe.

65
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,550
<i>Tell your boss.</i>

66
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,010
<i>If he buys my new shoes,</i>

67
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,600
<i>tell him to call me...</i>

68
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,780
<i>at this number.</i>

69
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,250
Whoa, we did indeed wrong him.

70
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,520
Buy a new pair of shoes and set it up.

71
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,270
An apology should be given where it's due.

72
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,960
Do it.

73
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,610
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,000
They have fighting matches each
month and hire the men they need.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,650
That's how they operate.

76
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,580
How did you find that out?

77
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,232
It was written on the board.

78
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,467
(Men needed this month
Security and delivery)

79
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,857
(Selection date on 17th)

80
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,180
We found a good starting point, right?

81
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,000
We did a good job of tossing the bait.

82
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,720
Mr. Choi, go straight at the intersection.

83
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,310
Why? What's going on?

84
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,540
- Someone is following us.
- What?

85
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,840
<i>So, should we back you up?</i>

86
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,380
It's okay. There's only one car following.

87
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,300
Is it those bastards from
the gym, by the way?

88
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,450
I'll find out when I meet them in person.

89
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,060
Round 2. Shall we do it here?

90
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,310
Ouch... Sorry, sir.

91
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,590
- You're too huge.
- I'm sorry.

92
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,220
I'm Detective Suzuki.

93
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,470
Please come with us briefly.

94
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,230
Geez...

95
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,380
(Police Headquarters in Fukuoka)

96
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,730
It's strange, no matter how I look at it.

97
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,500
How is a Korean like you able to
obtain a Japanese taxi?

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,750
- It was given to me.
- Speak in Japanese!

99
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,770
Where else would I get a taxi other
than from a taxi company?

100
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,610
You don't get this situation, do you?

101
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,760
Looks like you're very angry with me, huh?

102
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,190
This bastard!

103
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,870
Gosh, how scary.

104
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,180
Yes.

105
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,350
Kim Do Gi?

106
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,590
Yes, he's being trained by our company.

107
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,010
Yes.

108
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,610
I'll send over a fax. Okay.

109
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,570
Thank you for helping us out.

110
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,360
It's no problem.

111
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,790
Checks out. What he said is true.

112
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,270
He's also listed as an employee

113
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,430
of a South Korean company
called "Rainbow Taxi."

114
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,450
Who is this guy?

115
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,740
Shows up out of nowhere and

116
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,070
ruins everything we've
been working on for months.

117
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,370
Geez...

118
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,340
We should get him deported immediately.

119
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,820
What's that supposed to mean?

120
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,980
If, as you say, he ruined our operation,

121
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,940
burned through our
funds, and wasted our time.

122
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,390
Then, logically, he might be
the only option we have left.

123
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,130
What? How does that make any sense?

124
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,610
Bento.

125
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,070
Hey.

126
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,680
Care for a cup of coffee?

127
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,790
I know a place.

128
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,200
Green tea, please.

129
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,770
Michael Chang.

130
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,250
Interpol Inspector.

131
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,460
You know Interpol, right?

132
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,440
This is him.

133
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,840
Police, and now Interpol.

134
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,820
I feel like I've done something very wrong.

135
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,250
We're making him feel worried.

136
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,410
Of course, he'd feel that way.

137
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,240
Sorry if I offended you.

138
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,900
He said he's sorry.

139
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,240
Sure, you are.

140
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,900
You understand English?

141
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,830
I get the feeling you've got something
specific you want to say.

142
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,930
He speaks well, too.

143
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,930
Have you ever seen this game before?

144
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,890
Over the past three years,

145
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,462
more and more people
from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and

146
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:06,730
other parts of Asia have gone
missing after coming to Japan.

147
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,340
That's the gambling
game Yi Seo and I played.

148
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,060
And they all have a few things in common.

149
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,140
They all borrowed money from
a loan company called Neko Money,

150
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,270
failed to repay it,

151
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,260
came to Japan,

152
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,240
and then vanished.

153
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,620
And this gambling game
is where they all begin.

154
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,330
What?

155
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,420
These bastards must've been
doing the same in other countries.

156
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,860
Matsuda Keita.

157
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,530
Owns a loan company.

158
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,090
Also, a key player in the crime gang
that's been rising in this region.

159
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,260
That gym you visited?

160
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,000
Matsuda uses it as a recruitment
hub for his organization.

161
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,340
And the opponent you knocked down?

162
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,490
<i>- Sorry, sir.
- You're too huge.</i>

163
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,390
<i>He was actually one of
our undercover officers.</i>

164
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,140
After a few tests,

165
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,950
he was set to be selected
as Matsuda's security today.

166
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,410
Why are you telling me all this?

167
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,100
Matsuda likes trained fighters.

168
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,700
Especially someone exceptionally
skilled in combat.

169
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,690
You'd be a great help.

170
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,010
Why do you think I'll help?

171
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,340
You show up in Japan,

172
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,780
walk into Matsuda's gym,

173
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,590
pick a fight,

174
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,070
and take down one of
our biggest guys easily.

175
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,470
And you're telling me
you're just a taxi driver?

176
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,910
Come on. Even you got to admit
that sounds a little off.

177
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm not going to ask who you really are,

178
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,080
or why you're trying
to get close to this guy.

179
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,150
As long as it benefits both of us,

180
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,940
that's all that matters.

181
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,820
Thanks for the tea.

182
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,170
The more I see him, the
more suspicious he looks.

183
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,850
A trilingual taxi driver?

184
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,660
Where in the world do
you find someone like that?

185
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,190
Right there.

186
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,920
What are you going to
do if this all goes south?

187
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,430
What about damage control?

188
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,790
Damage control is something
you do after things go wrong.

189
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,720
Let's think about it then.

190
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,340
Try some. Welcome.

191
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,170
Mr. Kim, you have tons
of work to do here, too.

192
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,620
Is it okay for us to meddle
with the police's business?

193
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,130
It probably won't be good.

194
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:00,790
But it won't be bad to find a way
to benefit each other.

195
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,120
That would help us to find Yi Seo, too.

196
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,200
That's what I think, too.

197
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,170
Yi Seo ended up with someone far
more dangerous than expected.

198
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,840
Meeting with that boss
would be our priority.

199
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,940
- That's right.
- Hey!

200
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,480
Hey, there!

201
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,500
We have a customer. I told you.
We should've priced higher.

202
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,560
I don't speak Japanese.

203
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,360
You won't earn much doing business here.

204
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,930
Shall I bring you some customers?

205
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,450
Welcome!

206
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,310
How about 500 yen per person?

207
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,580
Welcome!

208
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,420
Dude, are you screwing with me?

209
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,040
- Welcome?
- Listen.

210
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,910
Do you know who I am?

211
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:50,540
The original owner of the
land you're standing on.

212
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,530
Masahisa Hoshino, the third-generation
boss of the Haneshima gang.

213
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,030
I once served him.

214
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:04,590
No one would dare breathe when I walk by.

215
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,940
Welcome.

216
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,720
If anyone dares to so
much as breathe in my ear,

217
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,820
he'll lose his head!

218
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,160
That's who I am.

219
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,410
He's asking for a cut for
the customers he brings.

220
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,590
Just say yes.

221
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,400
- O-Okay. Good. Okay.
- Okay.

222
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,500
- 500 yen per person.
- Okay. Yes. Okay.

223
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,350
Yes, okay! I'll help you out.

224
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,530
I'll bring you plenty of customers.

225
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,900
Do your best.

226
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,320
Right?

227
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,060
- Yeah...
- See you!

228
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,120
He wants to rip us off.
What's with the grand speech?

229
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,480
Why hassle us out of the blue?

230
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,790
He's probably a retired yakuza.

231
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,290
This tiny shop now has a salesman.

232
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,350
He's not a salesman. He's a thug.

233
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,860
Why are you angry?

234
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,670
Hello?

235
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,080
Yes, speaking.

236
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,120
If the shoes are ready,
I should go try them on.

237
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,480
I'll finally get to meet
the so-called boss.

238
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,450
Thank you for waiting. This way, please.

239
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,210
Please make yourself comfortable.

240
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,330
I apologize.

241
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,120
With all respect.

242
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,140
<i>Is he supposed to be that boss?</i>

243
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,230
These are the shoes I used to wear.

244
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,850
It's your turn.

245
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,860
You've made quite a ruckus at our place.

246
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,430
Shouldn't you apologize as well?

247
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,200
- Ikuya.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,260
I apologized as you wanted,

249
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,730
so you should apologize the way I want.

250
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,470
That's only fair, isn't it?

251
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,460
How do you want me to apologize?

252
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,340
If you leave me a finger,

253
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,440
I'll accept your apology.

254
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,520
Do it.

255
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,770
Why? You don't want to?

256
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,830
Why don't you try to take it yourself?

257
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,620
Are you the boss around here?

258
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,040
I do want to apologize.

259
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,820
But would you accept someone else's finger?

260
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,920
Spare me, Boss!

261
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,170
- Sir!
<i>- Mr. Kim,</i>

262
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,920
<i>they came sooner than expected.</i>

263
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,020
Time out, time out.

264
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,900
Finally...

265
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,980
Stop them!

266
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,540
Stop!

267
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,780
Hey! You can't go in! Stop!

268
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,750
Hey, stop it!

269
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,080
- We're the police!
- No, stop them!

270
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,940
Police!

271
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,650
What? They're gone already?

272
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,930
I thought they were here for me.

273
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,540
But they came for you instead.

274
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,590
Do I owe you a finger since you helped me?

275
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,870
A murderer from Korea...

276
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,160
I knew you'd be something
out of the ordinary.

277
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,150
Do you think you've got
something over my head?

278
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,540
I don't think you're worth that much.

279
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,130
I've noticed that wimps like you...

280
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,570
are nothing but talk.

281
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,180
That's enough. It's not funny anymore.

282
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,980
"Time out, time out."

283
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,970
- I knew you were all talk.
- Huh?

284
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,330
What did you just say?

285
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,460
What the hell did you say?

286
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,760
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

287
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,320
Hey, stop the car.

288
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,920
"Stop the car."

289
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,740
Stop the car!

290
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,040
Hey, don't stop.

291
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,190
Stop the car!

292
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,650
Yes, sir.

293
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,330
- Don't stop the car.
- Stop the car!

294
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,760
Yes, sir!

295
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,070
Bring it on.

296
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,120
- Come on!
- Hell yeah, I'm coming!

297
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,490
Bring it on.

298
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,820
You're good.

299
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,760
Bring it on, damn it!

300
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,930
I was going to ask you
to get me some water.

301
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,060
But I guess you don't have to.

302
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,090
Did they hit their head?

303
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,240
You're a pretty good fighter.

304
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,430
Although I'm better than you.

305
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,430
You want to go at it again?

306
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,760
Hey, do you want to work for me?

307
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,020
So you can cut off my finger?

308
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,650
No.

309
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,890
Forget your finger.

310
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,840
Work for me.

311
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,870
Don't want to.

312
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,820
Thanks for the drink.

313
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,130
Come work for me.

314
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,300
Welcome!

315
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,840
Thank you.

316
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,630
Tricky. Very tricky.

317
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,170
Even you find something tricky, Go Eun?

318
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,590
I looked into every company Matsuda owns,

319
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,880
but I guess all the important files
are kept as hard copies.

320
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,730
The network only has the shells.

321
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,380
There's no clue related to Yi Seo, either.

322
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,180
Is there another server I'm not aware of?

323
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,370
As you said, it won't be on a server.

324
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,420
I think he's the type
who doesn't trust anyone.

325
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,840
It's likely the core documents are
kept somewhere only he knows about.

326
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,170
Crime organizations are usually run
through scattered organizations.

327
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,520
But I guess Matsuda doesn't
even trust one of his own.

328
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,840
What's nice is that there's only
one person we need to deal with.

329
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,160
I think we should see him often.

330
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,520
- Hey, guys!
- Hot...

331
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,280
Come on. He's here again.

332
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,420
Does he have to come every day?

333
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,920
I sent a customer over earlier, right?

334
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,790
Welcome!

335
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,010
Give me 500 yen.

336
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,570
What's this?

337
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,070
I said give me 500 yen.

338
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,370
Listen for a moment.

339
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,910
If a customer pays us 1,000 yen,

340
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,110
the ingredient cost is 500 yen,
and your cut is 500 yen.

341
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,350
Then, what are we left with? Right?

342
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,950
You can't charge 500 yen. 500 yen, no.

343
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,580
Listen, you punks.

344
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,180
The original owner of the
land you're standing on.

345
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,010
The third-generation boss
of the Haneshima gang,

346
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,950
Masahisa Hoshino. I once served under him.

347
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,440
Take me on if you dare!

348
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,970
Just pay him and let him go before
he tells his life story again.

349
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,900
But still. This isn't right.

350
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,930
My ears are sore because
I heard it too much.

351
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,900
Now, that's my boy.

352
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,810
Work hard, you hear?

353
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,900
Hold on. Give us the 100 yen back. Hey.

354
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,590
Don't pick a fight.

355
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,870
On the way here, I saw...

356
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,760
That man comes by often.

357
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,920
He can't get a job.

358
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,520
He can't make bank transactions
besides using a credit card.

359
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,090
Looks like he lives in
the past, not the present.

360
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:40,510
<i>♪ Give me your warmth, baby ♪</i>

361
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,340
Hey, you piece of trash!

362
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,960
Where do you think your territory is?

363
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,110
Right here.

364
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,940
Do you miss your old territory?

365
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,740
I've aged a lot. I can't hear you too well.

366
00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:00,660
Just go and die in a temple, old man!

367
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,100
I may be old, but I can still earn my keep.

368
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,460
You're going the wrong way, old man!

369
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,660
Aren't they those men who were
in front of the gym the other day?

370
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,840
I saw a really huge No-Face over there.

371
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,990
- Up there, up there.
- Hey, stop right there!

372
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,700
You're not waiting for me
to get you one, are you?

373
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,750
Funds from the foreign branches
have started moving rapidly.

374
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,530
That means Matsuda is planning something.

375
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,990
We don't have time.

376
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,630
We need to come up with a plan.

377
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,970
A plan?

378
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,810
You have something on your mind?

379
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,970
We need to get on the inside, then.

380
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,280
I was thinking of getting some food.

381
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,730
Food?

382
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,580
But to eat,

383
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,610
I'll need that guy's help.

384
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,520
What are you looking at, man?

385
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,020
How many are we getting today?

386
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,410
We're getting four from East Asia.

387
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,780
Eight from Central, and two others.

388
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,550
A total of ten.

389
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,150
Then 14 altogether.

390
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,930
Everyone, shall we give a toast?

391
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,650
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

392
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,530
Thank you for all your work.

393
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,330
It's your business, Mr. Matsuda.

394
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,320
We should do our best.

395
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,460
And I hope that you don't
think that I don't know.

396
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,460
What do you mean by that?

397
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,630
Did you think I wasn't aware
of you pocketing funds in secret?

398
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,260
Cut open your abdomen.

399
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,670
You traitor.

400
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,200
Mr. Matsuda, please...

401
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,010
Mr. Matsuda!

402
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,000
Mr. Matsuda!

403
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,270
Don't you know how to drive, you idiot?

404
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,710
Who the hell are you?

405
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,490
Do you want to know who I am?

406
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,920
If you want to find out,

407
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,170
do you want to talk over a cup of tea?

408
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,940
That wasn't what we agreed on... Ouch!

409
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,980
What are you looking at?

410
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,240
What the hell are you looking at, huh?

411
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,160
Mind your own business!

412
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,040
Who the hell are you?

413
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,300
Is this how you make a living?

414
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,920
Yeah, that's right.

415
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,400
Move your car.

416
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,640
Hey, hey...

417
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,760
Nice work.

418
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,700
Nice work?

419
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,890
Is this really the right
way to handle this?

420
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,880
Feels like he's just messing with us,
rather than helping us.

421
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,930
Leave me out of that "us."

422
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,030
I haven't even eaten all day!

423
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,050
This is good.

424
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,540
Delicious!

425
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,620
Let this be my treat.

426
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,950
You paid last time.

427
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,670
I should pay this time.

428
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,860
Is that so?

429
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,750
Then, I'll have to stuff myself.

430
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,710
Be my guest.

431
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,100
But don't eat more than three.

432
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,330
I haven't had any customers yet,
so I don't have much money.

433
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,730
You don't have money?

434
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,130
Well, then...

435
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,670
I guess there's no choice.

436
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:20,220
This will be on the house. My treat.

437
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,700
Alright? I'm serious. Just eat your fill.

438
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,600
I'll eat everything.

439
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,020
Good.

440
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,200
Good.

441
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:44,510
I've done all kinds of
work for over 10 years.

442
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,960
In the course of taking down our rivals,

443
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,820
my friends, whom I treated like brothers,

444
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,500
betrayed my older brother and me.

445
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,260
I lost my organization
and my older brother.

446
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,090
But I didn't let them get away with it.

447
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,450
Traitors don't deserve to live.

448
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,000
My shoes were the last gift from my boss.

449
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,120
Work for me instead of driving a taxi.

450
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,910
The other groups around here
were taken care of a long time ago.

451
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,730
So, you don't need to worry about that.

452
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,370
The pay is 10 times what
you make as a cabbie.

453
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,340
I don't want to.

454
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,310
What should I do to make you work for me?

455
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:37,050
I don't serve two bosses.

456
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,890
You're so stubborn.

457
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:43,020
But I can work part-time for you.

458
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,900
Even better if I can use my fist.

459
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,150
I'm confident there.

460
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,800
My organization operates incognito.

461
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,260
For jobs that attract attention,

462
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,620
I hire part-timers. Use them
once and discard them.

463
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,540
Do you like young ladies?

464
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,720
Young girls?

465
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,470
<i>I have plenty of girls without
identities whom I use as slaves.</i>

466
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,930
<i>Do you want one as a present?</i>

467
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,960
He's talking about the
ones he kidnapped, right?

468
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,330
He's calling them a
present. What a bastard.

469
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,890
Why? You don't want her?

470
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:35,410
If someone accepts a
girl as a present like that,

471
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,460
get rid of him.

472
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,320
You can never trust someone like that.

473
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,840
You turn down a gift with style, too.

474
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,870
I'll take cash for payment.

475
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,610
Sure.

476
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,920
Hey, over here.

477
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,120
Okay, okay.

478
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,410
Yup, back it up a little more.

479
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,370
Come on, come on.

480
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,480
Hey, part-timer.

481
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,490
When we start dealing,
keep a lookout around the area.

482
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,280
You may leave once the deal is done.

483
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,100
Leave by the back door.

484
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,500
If anyone barges in,
just beat them up, right?

485
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,770
If you have nothing to do, that means
things are going well.

486
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,420
I'm counting on you.

487
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,400
Boys!

488
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,080
Go!

489
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,690
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

490
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,800
<i>The weather is great today.</i>

491
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,800
<i>It's a little dark out here,
but let's get down to it, shall we?</i>

492
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,840
<i>Here we go!</i>

493
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,540
Come on, go to the front!

494
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,260
165 cm. Size 2.

495
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,710
<i>This one is from Russia.</i>

496
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,350
By auctioning off goods,

497
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,410
they meant those people.

498
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,520
Huh? Those evil bastards.

499
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,400
A Russian girl is rare, don't you think?

500
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Those who wish to purchase this lass,

501
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,710
kindly direct your laser pointers at her.

502
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,770
Are you going to let this go?

503
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,460
Don't miss this chance.

504
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,630
Look at her soft and pale skin.

505
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,070
<i>Do you really want to let her go?</i>

506
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,060
This is a lovely one, ladies and gentlemen.

507
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,170
Look, look. 100!

508
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,340
120! Any more bids?

509
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,150
Come on, take a good look!

510
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:26,840
Mr. Park, Mr. Choi, I'll need some help.

511
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,780
We're all ready to go.

512
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,440
Me, too.

513
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,940
Come with me.

514
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,370
Don't let them escape!

515
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,440
Where do you think you're going!

516
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,250
- Come here!
- Please, let us go!

517
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,960
- Come with us!
- Please, have mercy!

518
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,390
Welcome, you bastards!

519
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,540
It's okay. It's okay. Don't cry.

520
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,020
You can go home. Don't worry.

521
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,860
This way. This way.

522
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,100
- Go that way.
- Okay.

523
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,620
Yeah.

524
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,700
Smoke?

525
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,690
What do you mean?

526
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,260
Got it. I'll be right there.

527
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,100
Be careful.

528
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,800
It's okay.

529
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,270
- Is that everyone?
- Yes.

530
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,410
Let's go.

531
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,390
Hey, hey, hey...

532
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,090
Damn it!

533
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,070
What the hell happened?

534
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,200
<i>Good evening, sir!</i>

535
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,100
Yes.

536
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,020
Capture them all.

537
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,190
That was the perfect
chance to take them all down!

538
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,460
That could've been critical evidence.

539
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,180
Why the hell didn't you tell me sooner?

540
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,300
You're only interested
in arresting them, aren't you?

541
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,740
What?

542
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,850
If you had moved in,

543
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,270
they would've cut their
losses, disappeared,

544
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,980
and taken all the
unfound victims with them.

545
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,160
I thought we were on the same side.

546
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,070
Are we not?

547
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,380
If our interests align,

548
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,870
then, sure. We're on the same side.

549
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,860
That bastard's definitely hiding something.

550
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,490
- What?
- He could be playing both sides.

551
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:13,140
He could just easily team up
with them as he did with us.

552
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,300
We need to keep an eye on him.

553
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,800
If they took Yi Seo somewhere
the way we saw at the port,

554
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,570
would we be able to find her?

555
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,490
Don't you think only one person knows that?

556
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,360
The one who can't even trust his own.

557
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,340
Matsuda Keita.

558
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,470
We need to enter his base somehow.

559
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,040
Mr. Kim, you'll be okay, right?

560
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,760
He won't just sit back.

561
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,300
He'll be suspicious of me first,
since it happened after I joined.

562
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,930
Hey!

563
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,890
Hey, guys!

564
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,680
- I've brought you a customer!
- It's him again.

565
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,210
I'm so sick of that old yakuza.

566
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:59,610
- Our customer here is round and jiggly, huh?
- Right.

567
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,810
You'll have to protect me this time, sir.

568
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,720
You need my protection?

569
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,000
How could I say no? What can I do?

570
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,880
- Bring them all over here!
<i>- Yes, sir!</i>

571
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,620
Get out!

572
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:22,860
- You, too, bastard!
- Come on.

573
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,510
- Stand up!
- Down you go!

574
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,480
About what happened last night...

575
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,380
The only thing different in this
organization from before

576
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,420
is that you guys worked
for us as part-timers.

577
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,970
I don't know anything!

578
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,700
And that's exactly the problem.

579
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:02,020
Do you think you did
something wrong or not?

580
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:06,310
I'm just a part-timer! Please let me go!

581
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,340
Tell me the truth.

582
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:16,830
There's no point in telling the truth.

583
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,530
The truth?

584
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:31,180
You're not interested
in finding the traitor.

585
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,670
That's right.

586
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:36,180
If I kill all of you, he'd be dead, too.

587
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,620
Coward.

588
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,210
You've never trusted anyone.

589
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:54,340
You've killed them all
before you can trust them.

590
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,640
Because you were afraid of betrayal.

591
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,270
Boss.

592
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,850
<i>Did you receive the gift I sent
you to the port last night?</i>

593
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,700
<i>Did you think our organization would
sit back and wait around forever?</i>

594
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,340
Who are you?

595
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:20,800
I'm the original owner of the
land you're standing on.

596
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,840
The third-generation boss of the
Haneshima gang, Masahisa Hoshino.

597
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,890
What? Who?

598
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,730
Last night was just a warning.

599
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,390
But next time, your life is on the line.

600
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:35,840
You sure know how to talk, old man.

601
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,930
You think you can say that
when you're in front of me?

602
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,880
If you want to hear it, come to me.

603
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,650
I'll tell it to your face.

604
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,230
- Kill the rest.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

605
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:51,520
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

606
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,690
Let me go with you.

607
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:01,100
I'm dying to know who screwed me over.

608
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,800
Nothing has been
going well lately. Damn it.

609
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,040
Chin up, man!

610
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,610
It wasn't like this before.

611
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,900
Whoa, thanks, man.

612
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,330
Okie-dokes! This...

613
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,100
Gosh, I can't stand it anymore!

614
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,060
What? Taking a piss again?

615
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,620
You love the loo, don't you?

616
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,950
Don't look down on me!

617
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,790
Let's go!

618
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,840
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

619
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,480
Hey, hey!

620
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,820
Who are those people?

621
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,800
- You're kidding me.
- Those punks.

622
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,430
- Come on out!
- Show your face!

623
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,650
Where is he?

624
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,830
Come out, you coward!

625
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:48,780
<i>Hey, come out here!</i>

626
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,330
<i>I'm going to kill you!</i>

627
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,240
<i>Get your ass out here!</i>

628
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,650
Shut up, boys.

629
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,410
Where are you hiding?

630
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,540
I'm here, you assholes!

631
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,330
Haneshima gang.

632
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,160
You geezers are still alive?

633
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,980
You've lost your office,

634
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,490
and now staying in this pathetic place?

635
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:30,070
You've set up base here now?

636
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:33,080
What a punk.

637
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,160
I will not allow any more insults!

638
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,270
What will you do if you don't?

639
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:41,200
I'll crush you all and
kick you out of here.

640
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,980
Don't be delusional.

641
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,720
Your era is over.

642
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,960
All you have to do is
wait patiently to die.

643
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,410
In my day,

644
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:02,120
no one would dare breathe when I walk by.

645
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,660
The moment I hear anyone breathe,

646
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,850
he'd lose his head!

647
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:11,730
All you can talk about
is your good old days.

648
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,410
You're nothing but trash

649
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:17,370
who goes around begging, and will be
eaten by animals when you die.

650
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:20,340
Listen. Let me give you something.

651
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,140
This is for you.

652
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,580
Damn, my pocket has a hole.

653
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,830
Hey.

654
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,450
Take care of him.

655
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,570
Come at me!

656
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,880
Boss!

657
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,570
Blood...

658
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,570
We were...

659
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,010
sworn to be brothers...

660
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:33,560
and pledged loyalty.

661
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:38,000
He'd die with that much blood...

662
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,570
Can't believe I came all
the way here to see that.

663
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:47,180
Don't underestimate the yakuza!

664
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:02,550
I hate it when someone stabs
from behind like that.

665
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,890
I see that you're always
wearing those shoes.

666
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,180
Don't worry about what I just did.

667
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,340
I'm already a murderer.

668
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,130
One more wouldn't make any difference.

669
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,730
No.

670
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:44,620
I owe you one. I should repay you somehow.

671
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:49,620
There's no need. I only did what I had to.

672
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,570
Are you the backstabber? You bastard.

673
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,650
Go away. Go away.

674
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,790
I was stabbed.

675
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,060
I told you to stop playing with that.

676
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,740
Doesn't it look so real?

677
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:13,840
How are things going?

678
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,930
I have a feeling that we're almost there.

679
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,770
Boss, you're back.

680
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,210
Good work, sir!

681
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,260
<i>Good work, sir!</i>

682
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:28,090
Come on.

683
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,480
Yeah.

684
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,290
Come sit down.

685
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,530
How do you like it here?

686
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,700
It's nice.

687
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,410
I like it.

688
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:12,580
What kind of person was your brother?

689
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,740
Someone who trusted me.

690
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,050
As expected.

691
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:23,010
Why do you want to know?

692
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:31,030
I have never trusted anyone.

693
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,700
No matter how loyal I was,

694
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,940
I was the one who got betrayed in the end.

695
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,200
So, I always chose to betray
someone before they could.

696
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,120
Sometimes, when I see good food,

697
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,910
I take pictures of them.

698
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:54,210
But then,

699
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,000
I realize I have no one to send it to.

700
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,840
Food photos. Yeah, they're important.

701
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,880
Can I send them to you?

702
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,900
Instead of working for me, be my family.

703
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,680
Family?

704
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,660
How about we pledge to be brothers?

705
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,420
We can even do a ceremony.

706
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,730
You've got me.

707
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,200
Seriously.

708
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,870
I'll prepare the ceremony, suited for you.

709
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,420
All right...

710
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:47,500
I guess I can't address
you so casually anymore.

711
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,680
Boss.

712
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:24,280
What the hell are you up to?

713
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,520
<i>That's what I want to ask you.</i>

714
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,880
What's with all the
following and taking pictures?

715
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,800
<i>So, you've finally decided
to side with criminals?</i>

716
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,430
You always assume whatever suits you best.

717
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:41,040
Matsuda is even throwing me
a grand welcome ceremony tonight.

718
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:45,350
How many guys can we put in immediately?

719
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,830
Wait a sec.

720
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,830
Hey, miss, would you like some fun?

721
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:52,070
It won't take more than 30 minutes.

722
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,240
Hey, miss, over here.

723
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,650
Miss, look over here.

724
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,320
Are you lonely tonight? Come over here.

725
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:08,680
It's the weekend. If only I could
at least enjoy a hamburger.

726
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:13,310
Too bad, I'm 500 yen short.

727
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:17,080
Alright, everyone!

728
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,660
The couple over there, let me recommend...

729
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,240
I sent out the invitations.

730
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,630
<i>You're nothing but trash</i>

731
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:38,420
<i>who goes around begging, and will be
eaten by animals when you die.</i>

732
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,550
<i>Listen. Let me give you something.</i>

733
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,100
<i>This is for you.</i>

734
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:46,780
<i>Just go and die in a temple, old man!</i>

735
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:49,900
<i>Don't do it over here!</i>

736
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:08,130
<i>Hey, you piece of trash!</i>

737
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,670
<i>Where do you think your territory is?</i>

738
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,890
<i>Do you miss your old territory?</i>

739
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:17,030
<i>Your era is over.</i>

740
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:20,450
<i>All you have to do is
wait patiently to die.</i>

741
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,930
<i>Don't underestimate the yakuza!</i>

742
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,860
Once you have this drink,

743
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,910
you'll become part of
our organizational family.

744
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:35,210
Do you want to hear a secret?

745
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,850
When I first suggested
that you become our family,

746
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:42,230
if you had said yes,

747
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:44,280
I would've killed you then.

748
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,620
It's still not too late.

749
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,390
- Counting on you.
- Please leave it to me.

750
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,060
Boss! We have trouble!

751
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,870
Who the hell are you people?

752
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,000
What do you want!

753
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Who said you could come in here!

754
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,930
Hey!

755
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,780
Shut up!

756
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,840
I said shut up!

757
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,800
What the hell is this, old man?

758
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,250
We will die here today.

759
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:34,630
<i>We'll die here today!</i>

760
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,220
We are the yakuza!

761
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:40,100
<i>The yakuza!</i>

762
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:43,960
We are the real yakuza!

763
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,000
<i>The real yakuza!</i>

764
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,700
Let's do this!

765
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,420
You have to get out of here.

766
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,350
Go for it!

767
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,760
Hold the fort!

768
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,170
Let's get out of here.

769
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:27,360
- Get them!
<i>- Yes, sir!</i>

770
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,280
Where did these old geezers come from?

771
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:40,550
Gone again.

772
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,060
Come on, walk.

773
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,950
We're walking. Can't you see?

774
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,900
Stop talking and walk.

775
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:57,140
Officer, can I go get some food?

776
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,610
Of course not.

777
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,560
Then, what's Luna and Guu going to eat?

778
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,010
Who?

779
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,220
My cats!

780
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:07,130
Like I care! You're not
getting any food. Hey!

781
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:09,560
How dare you...

782
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:13,200
When did Mr. Kim come up with this idea?

783
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,230
"Kill someone with a borrowed knife."

784
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:20,410
Getting what you want easily
by making the enemies fight.

785
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:23,530
Mr. Kim said their desire to go back to

786
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:27,120
the yakuza's heyday must be
stronger than you think.

787
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:31,050
Where did he go, by the way?

788
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:33,310
What do you think?

789
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:36,870
He ran away with his boss.

790
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,320
Where the hell did you
learn to drive like this?

791
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,760
I'm a taxi driver, after all.

792
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:05,030
The more I think about it,
there's only one answer.

793
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,330
There's a rat.

794
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,970
I'm so sick and tired of traitors.

795
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,410
But I'm glad I can trust one person.

796
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,780
Looking for this?

797
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:36,040
Kim Do Gi...

798
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,670
Because you can't trust anyone,

799
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:41,730
you collected all this so neatly.

800
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:43,440
Why?

801
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,970
I was going to give you
everything you wanted.

802
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:51,890
I was going to give you the world.

803
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:54,310
So why?

804
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,880
What's the reason?

805
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,810
Because the vacation is almost over.

806
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,510
Yi Seo needs to go back to school.

807
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:08,810
What?

808
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:11,230
She needs to help Grandma at the shop.

809
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:15,330
She needs to eat tteokbokki
after the extracurricular activity, too.

810
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:18,000
Stop talking to me in Korean!

811
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,790
Someone like you would never understand.

812
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,210
Until the day you die.

813
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:27,290
Die? Why would I die?

814
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:30,090
You should be the one to die!

815
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:51,520
I should be honest
with you about one thing.

816
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,240
You suck at fighting.

817
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,260
You...

818
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,850
Aren't you curious?

819
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:23,250
If you disappeared,

820
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,840
would you be considered missing,

821
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,870
or just trash being disposed of?

822
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,370
I told you.

823
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:09,510
If anyone is going to
betray first, it'll be me!

824
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,480
Die!

825
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,350
Not late this time.

826
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:36,900
Right?

827
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,560
Now, we're in business.

828
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:01,100
Y-Yi Seo.

829
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,870
Yi Seo.

830
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,510
Yi Seo, it's okay.

831
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,540
It's all over.

832
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:15,720
Let's go home.

833
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:19,200
Let's go home. Let's go home, Yi Seo.

834
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,020
It's okay.

835
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:33,500
It's okay.

836
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:38,680
<i>♪ I couldn't share with anyone ♪</i>

- Yi Seo.
- Yes.

842
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:12,140
Didn't you miss me?

843
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:14,160
Yi Seo.

844
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:20,220
Thank you for coming back safely.

845
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,210
I was scared.

850
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:01,640
<i>Yes, I remember.</i>

851
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,360
Who is it?

852
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,790
What's this?

853
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:16,290
You're saying I can go
in here, right, Go Eun?

854
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:18,440
<i>I'm sorry. I should've told you sooner.</i>

855
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,010
What's he saying to himself?

856
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:26,460
No. I'll always do what
you tell me to do, Go Eun.

857
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,760
What? He's locking the door.

858
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,160
What are you doing? Get rid of him.

859
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:35,060
Is there a wall here? Why won't you answer?
What's with you?

860
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:37,090
I'm sorry.

861
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:38,810
I'm not that interested in talking.

862
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:41,550
You bastard, do you know who we are?

863
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,800
I'm here because I know.

864
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:05,100
What do we do with the commission fee?

865
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,460
I know. It must be quite a bit this time.

866
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,890
<i>Everything costs money abroad.</i>

867
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,740
Transportation, lodging,
food, and car rentals.

868
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:16,830
Parking fees, too.
Parking is too expensive in Japan.

869
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:19,820
Include the money the old yakuza took, too.

870
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,970
Because Mr. Choi kept driving
in the wrong direction,

871
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,450
<i>we owe a ton in fines, too.</i>

872
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:28,380
If you combine all
that, it's a lot of money.

873
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,020
We can't ask Yi Seo to pay it.

874
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:33,400
Are you crazy? Students have no money.

875
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,600
Right?

876
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,170
It's okay. We already got paid.

877
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:39,610
<i>Whoa, nice.</i>

878
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:42,140
<i>- What? When?
- From where?</i>

879
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,860
Hey, some of the money is missing.

880
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:47,700
Who stole some of the money?

881
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,030
No one.

882
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:51,770
That's all there was from the start.

883
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:53,420
But the amount in this ledger-

884
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:55,240
Come on and let's keep moving!

885
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,520
What?

886
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,450
We've got a long list to round up. Come on.

887
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,870
Whatever.

888
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:10,210

{\an8}<i>Mr. Yang got us something big.</i>

902
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,880
{\an8}<i>The previous car owner had a DUI accident.</i>

903
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,550
{\an8}<i>Mr. Oh! They took my license plate.</i>

904

{\an8}<i>I said take it, you asshole.</i>

907
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:22,680
{\an8}<i>We should confiscate that car first.</i>

908
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:26,490
{\an8}<i>The owner indeed is a lawyer
who passed the bar exam.</i>

909
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:28,590
{\an8}<i>He's been disbarred.</i>

910
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:29,890
{\an8}<i>He killed someone.</i>

911
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:33,050
{\an8}<i>The fact that no one was on your side</i>

912
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:35,769
{\an8}<i>means that you're in the wrong.</i>
