(Children and animals were

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,800
Driver Kim Do Gi.

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,940
- How's the new used car?
- I think I might've paid too much.

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,700
Driver Kim Do Gi.

11
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,370
I think I paid more for
this car than I expected.

12
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,680
Driver Kim, is something wrong?

13
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
(Safety First)

14
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,370
Hey, there's a crash!

15
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,310
- Call someone!
- Quick, call 911.

16
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,439
How do I...

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,340
- Someone call 911, quick!
- Are you okay?

18
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,150
Driver Kim Do Gi, can you hear me?

19
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,050
Go Eun.

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,060
I think I'm going to need a tow.

21
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,560
- The airbag didn't go off?
- There's someone inside.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,930
(Taxi Driver 3)

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,100
{\an8}All right. Just keep coming straight back.

24
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,170
{\an8}(Episode 4)

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,010
{\an8}- Yes, just pull straight in.
- Let's get to work.

26
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,810
{\an8}Right. Come straight in.

27
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,520
{\an8}All right.

28
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,190
{\an8}Next one.

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,260
{\an8}Move back, I'm spraying it down.

30
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
{\an8}Further back.

31
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,170
{\an8}Driver Kim Do Gi.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,140
{\an8}This car's been flooded.

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,809
{\an8}- A flooded car?
- Level three flooded car...

34
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,310
{\an8}with its engine submerged.

35
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,910
{\an8}With a level three, it can
stall suddenly on a highway...

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,310
or fail and cause a major
accident, just like this one.

37
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,450
This car should never
have been put on the market.

38
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,650
It's basically a ticking
time bomb on wheels.

39
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,060
Not just the kids. Countless people
on the street could've been hurt.

40
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,060
So how can you tell if
a car has been flooded?

41
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,930
There are a few ways to
check if a car's been flooded.

42
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,570
When you pull the seatbelt all the way out,

43
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,740
if there are traces of muddy
water, that's a red flag.

44
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,380
- It's clean.
- Replace all four belts.

45
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,610
- With used ones.
- Got it.

46
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,080
Hey, Choi.

47
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,550
But what if they replaced the belts?

48
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,280
You can check for that too.

49
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,920
Just check inside the cover.
They usually don't clean in there.

50
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,630
- Clean the crevices with a swab.
- Park, get the swabs.

51
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,960
- Yes, sir.
- What if they cleaned that too?

52
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,970
There's still a way to tell.

53
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,200
You can check for mud inside
the rubber weather stripping.

54
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,510
- No mud here.
- Replace all the weatherstripping.

55
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,110
And what if they replaced
those with new ones?

56
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,750
You can check the model
sticker or the condition of the fuses.

57
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,849
- Did you change this?
- I haven't touched it.

58
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,550
Replace these two cars'
fuse boxes over here.

59
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,560
Get started.

60
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,090
All right, be thorough.
Check that too, okay?

61
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,130
Got it.

62
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:32,160
Found it.

63
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,870
It's got to be here.

64
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,970
There's a mud stain here.

65
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,210
Gosh, we missed that.

66
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,240
If they'll go to these lengths
to hide that a car was flooded,

67
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,550
then they're the real problem, not the car.

68
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,450
I still don't get it. All this
trouble for a flooded car?

69
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,090
Because if they can trick
someone into buying just one,

70
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,850
they stand to make a huge profit.

71
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Money's important, but come
on. People could die in an accident.

72
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,960
Anyone selling these flooded cars
should be rounded up and drowned.

73
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,430
Legally, a car this flood-damaged
should've been scrapped.

74
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,530
But for it to be sitting
brazenly on a lot...

75
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,740
means an illicit pipeline must
exist for acquiring these cars.

76
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,339
I'll start by checking the
transported vehicles...

77
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,680
that went to and from Noblesse.

78
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,640
Here, get rid of this.

79
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,450
- It's from a flooded car.
- You're right.

80
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,920
Goodness.

81
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,990
Thanks.

82
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,600
I heard you haven't been home in days.

83
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,200
I sent a text.

84
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,070
I told them I needed to
get some air for a few days.

85
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,400
Your wife and Ji Eun are really worried.

86
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,040
It's just that I...

87
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,540
don't have the confidence
to face my family yet.

88
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,180
There you go again, saying
the opposite of how you feel.

89
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,390
You mean you can't wait to see them, right?

90
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,160
You're right.

91
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,990
My wife and Ji Eun...

92
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,630
I miss them so much.

93
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,200
Just hang in there a little longer.
We'll take care of everything.

94
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,570
I never imagined you'd do
this kind of work, Mr. Jang.

95
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,810
And to think we've worked
together for over ten years.

96
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,880
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

97
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,250
I'm sure you had your reasons.
You don't have to apologise.

98
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,150
I'm the one who should be sorry...

99
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,690
and grateful.

100
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,620
Oh, right.

101
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Here.

102
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,630
That imported car registered
in your name, Driver Oh.

103
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,860
I've transferred the ownership to my name.

104
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,600
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,870
Why would you do that?

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,270
Hey, is there some rule that
says I can't drive a fancy car?

107
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,210
I've got it all handled, so
please don't worry about it.

108
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,389
Remember when some guy threw a fit...

109
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,489
about his license getting revoked?

110
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,030
How much did the boss pay for it?

111
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,460
The boss probably
bought it for 1,000 dollars.

112
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,860
It was 1,000 dollars?

113
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,929
But we sold it for 100,000 dollars.

114
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,000
That's right.

115
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,440
He made 100 times his money.

116
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,740
Our boss is seriously the best.

117
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,180
Hey, work hard. Then maybe
one day you can be like the boss.

118
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,750
Driver Kim Do Gi, did you hear that?

119
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,980
They made 100 times
their money off of Driver Oh.

120
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,020
Then we'll take it back
from them, 100-fold.

121
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,260
I've called everywhere,

122
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,630
and it looks like there's
nothing worth getting...

123
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,900
for individual taxi licenses today.

124
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,430
- What about the online forums?
- I haven't checked them yet.

125
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,940
You should set up keyword
alerts so you see them right away.

126
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,569
- Okay.
- But you should go on...

127
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,940
a business trip first.

128
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,340
A business trip? Where to?

129
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,279
The torrential downpour last
weekend has left four dead...

130
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,510
and displaced 8,000 residents.

131
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,579
Police are continuing to search...

132
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,680
for the two people who are still missing...

133
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,690
To the place that was
flooded, where people died?

134
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,620
Is that all your darn eyes can see?

135
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,190
You'll never make any real money.

136
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,830
What do you mean, sir?

137
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,830
- I saw seven cars just at a glance.
- Seven cars?

138
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,700
- Gosh.
- Call for a car carrier.

139
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,370
- Yes, sir.
- That's seven, all right.

140
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,740
Let's go get those cars washed.

141
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,280
Keep it coming.

142
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,280
This batch is really nice.

143
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,690
We've got German cars, American cars,

144
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,520
and even a British car.

145
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,460
This is a pretty good haul.
What more could you ask for?

146
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,460
- Go check them out.
- Thank you.

147
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,200
We only see each other
when there's a flood.

148
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,040
Then again, meeting up
for work is what we enjoy.

149
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,910
- How many did you bring in total?
- Gosh, so impatient.

150
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,480
After your call, Mr. Cha, I
found some without full coverage.

151
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,280
I've secured seven of them
in total. Here, take a look.

152
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,620
You've rounded up a nice little collection.

153
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,790
So that's how they've been
getting these flooded cars.

154
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,800
By buying back the cars
that come into the scrapyard?

155
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Flooded cars are usually written
off by insurance and then scrapped.

156
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,570
But they're after flooded cars
without comprehensive coverage.

157
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,940
That's why the flood
history check came up clean.

158
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,580
With no insurance, there's no
reason to report the flood damage.

159
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,510
Then the people who buy
the cars from the dealership...

160
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,920
would have absolutely no
idea what they're buying, right?

161
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,280
They'll only find out...

162
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,390
after the car dies on them.

163
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,660
Now, you need to pay me.

164
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,100
If we're done here, let's go.

165
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,009
(Scrapped vehicles must be deregistered.)

166
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,579
(File with your city or county office.)

167
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,210
(We can handle the
de-registration for you.)

168
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,190
(Scrapyard Office)

169
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:32,420
Come on, TG. What's wrong with you?

170
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,880
Who's there?

171
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,420
Hey, I want some of that jerky too.

172
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,160
Come on out. Stop hiding.

173
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,040
Hey.

174
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,870
Who are you?

175
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,770
You used the car scrapping
papers to transfer the ownership.

176
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,980
I said, who are you?

177
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,810
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,580
Let's wash them up and
send them off to a good home.

179
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,910
They just have to run smoothly
for one month, that's all.

180
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,380
Yes, sir.

181
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,520
That car on the far left
is a popular family model.

182
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,360
So pay extra attention. The
passenger-side airbag deployed.

183
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,720
Tuck it back inside...

184
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,430
- and stitch it up, Manager Yoo.
- The airbag?

185
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,130
Make it a nice, clean stitch.

186
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,870
But if I do that, the airbag
won't deploy in a crash.

187
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,430
Are you going to be driving it?

188
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,340
- No.
- Then why do you care?

189
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,910
Then I'll stitch it up nicely.

190
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,880
- Hey.
- Yes?

191
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,810
Wipe that smile off your face.

192
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,920
Sir.

193
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Sir.

194
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,420
It's about these documents...

195
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,560
I couldn't process the titles,
so I decided to look into it.

196
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,690
It turns out all the cars we bought
from the scrapyard yesterday...

197
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,200
have already been deregistered.

198
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,660
Are you sure you checked properly?

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,170
I checked every single VIN myself.

200
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,510
(Cheongju Scumbag)

201
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,150
That jerk.

202
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,920
You live in the gutter,
you become gutter trash.

203
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,420
(8pm, Legal consultation for the goons)

204
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,730
(8pm, Legal consultation for the goons)

205
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,940
Finish prepping the cars
and just leave them be.

206
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,370
We're turning them all into ghost cars.

207
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,010
Yes, sir.

208
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,420
Okay. Just say you don't remember. Period.

209
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,519
Byeong Jin, thanks a lot.

210
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,930
Remember that girl I told you about?

211
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
She's pressing rape charges.

212
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,460
You need to be more careful, you idiot.

213
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,229
Byeong Jin, my buddy
was out for a joyride...

214
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,200
with his girlfriend,

215
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,470
and he ended up hitting someone.

216
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,670
- Was he playing Grand Theft Auto?
- What did you say? You jerk.

217
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,880
Yes.

218
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,850
How's the victim?

219
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,320
The victim?

220
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,390
Dead or alive?

221
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,920
They're alive.

222
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,160
Okay, so they're alive.

223
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,830
Alcohol?

224
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,430
- Alcohol?
- Were you drunk?

225
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,100
A little. Two bottles of whisky.

226
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,670
Two bottles of whisky?

227
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,740
Hey, two bottles aren't "a little."

228
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,840
Don't get out of the car. Go to
the nearest convenience store.

229
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,539
Go buy a bottle of soju...

230
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,340
and drink it where you can be
seen clearly on security cameras.

231
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,380
- That'll get you out of the DUI.
- You're telling him to drink more?

232
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,610
Five minutes later, report
the accident to insurance.

233
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,620
If they sue, just write
a very sincere apology.

234
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,690
Got it. Thank you, sir.

235
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,490
How on earth do you know all this stuff?

236
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,460
Hey! That stupid jerk.

237
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,030
Byeong Jin is a lawyer.

238
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,430
Former lawyer.

239
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,240
All right!

240
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,140
Let's settle this month's rent!

241
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,510
- You got it!
- Right away!

242
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,440
It's 50,000 dollars.

243
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,410
- Gosh, hurry up.
- Hurry.

244
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,220
That place looks super expensive.

245
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,760
I bet they're eating expensive
food in there. Those jerks.

246
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,030
I know, right?

247
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,030
Why do bad guys always pick
places with no security cameras?

248
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,470
(Deluxe Taxi)

249
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,110
I'm going in.

250
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,570
- So that's what you meant.
- See you later.

251
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,980
I need to cover my face.

252
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,220
- You do have a plan, right?
- No, not really.

253
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,760
- Then why'd you come in?
- I had a hunch there was something.

254
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,060
- A hunch about what?
- I don't know. You got any ideas?

255
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,530
- No! I was following you.
- Hey, you little...

256
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,930
You should've said we
shouldn't go, you brat!

257
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,100
Hey, what did I do?

258
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,400
Show some respect!
Aren't you going to let go?

259
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,100
- No! You let go first!
- I'm going to count to three. One.

260
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,010
Two. Two and a half,
two and three quarters!

261
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,810
Three! Hey! I said three,
so why didn't you let go?

262
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,680
What's wrong with you?
I said three, you punk!

263
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,780
This isn't my first rodeo. I
knew you'd try something.

264
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,220
- What? Why, you little...
- Who are you guys?

265
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,460
Sorry. We seem to have
picked the wrong room to fight in.

266
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,530
We'll just go fight somewhere
else. Please enjoy your evening.

267
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,300
Get out! You little brat!

268
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,430
Those idiots.

269
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,240
Hey, drink up!

270
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,210
- Drink up!
- Drink up!

271
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,280
We did good, right?

272
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,920
Go Eun, are you getting a clear view?

273
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,620
Well, I can just barely see.

274
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Anybody need a ghost car these days?

275
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,190
I do. I need about three.

276
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,790
Three?

277
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,700
I can get you those three.

278
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,930
Byeong Jin, we need some too!

279
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,800
Just let me know if you need any.

280
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,970
I can set you all up.

281
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,940
Hey, we're all in a good mood,
so let's get a group picture.

282
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,180
Take it!

283
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,480
He's really putting cars on the road
that have no business being there.

284
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,080
That guy only cares about money.
He has no regard for human life.

285
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,150
Look at what he did to Driver Oh.

286
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,060
He didn't just fake his license.
He also sold him a luxury car...

287
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,360
just to bleed him dry.

288
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,930
I guess it's time to act like
we've got money to burn.

289
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,530
We have a wide selection of cars.
We've got this one, and that one...

290
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,840
- Manager Yoo, show him around.
- Right this way, sir.

291
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,310
Hey, fashionista!

292
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,680
Hello.

293
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,820
Looks like you're here to exchange
the car you bought last time.

294
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,990
You must not have read the
contract very carefully, my friend.

295
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,860
I'm not here to exchange the car.

296
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,400
Then what?

297
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,200
- You want a refund?
- No.

298
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,800
I'm here to buy a car.

299
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,440
You see, I...

300
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,340
just got a new girlfriend,

301
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,510
and as a surprise,

302
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,010
I want to get her a used car as a gift.

303
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,320
Gosh, would you look at that.

304
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,020
You're a real romantic, aren't you?

305
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,100
Without love, I - Can't go on

306
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,700
Man, there's no better
surprise than a car, am I right?

307
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,470
You know it. Okay,
recommend a good one for me.

308
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,670
Just for you,

309
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,280
I'll recommend a real killer.

310
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,050
All right, this one here. The red one.

311
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,780
It's sharp.

312
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,020
- It's a sweet ride.
- Oh, a killer car! I love it.

313
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,120
Wait, you shouldn't...

314
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,290
- What a pushover.
- Gosh, those are expensive.

315
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,900
This one's a goner too.

316
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
It's gone.

317
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,600
Another level-three flooded car.

318
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,510
He said he'd sell me a "killer" car,

319
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,310
and I guess he wasn't lying.

320
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,810
What do you think
they're thinking about me?

321
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,749
You're buying what they're selling.

322
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,920
They must think you're a pushover.

323
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,750
Guess I'll have to buy another one, then.

324
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,990
They'll be happy to see
you again, Driver Kim Do Gi.

325
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,190
No.

326
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,560
I'm going to buy one somewhere else.

327
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,260
What?

328
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,540
Honey, this car has really low mileage.

329
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,280
And the price is pretty
good. Should we get this one?

330
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,880
That's because it's
been in a ton of accidents.

331
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,750
If you look closely here,

332
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,480
the bumper is a slightly different colour.

333
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,350
They just have a lot of cars.
Honestly, most of them are no good.

334
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,620
How about I recommend a
great car from our dealership?

335
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,690
Excuse me.

336
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,990
What do you think you're
doing in front of our lot?

337
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,200
They just had some questions.

338
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,230
Darn, I almost poached one.

339
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,270
This one just came in
yesterday, fresh on the lot.

340
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,770
- Look at the curves on this thing.
- Isn't that the pushover?

341
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,110
Love that soars so high

342
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,220
All right then. I really like this one.

343
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,590
Just recommend a good one for me.

344
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,460
What is with that guy?

345
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,260
He bought another used car?

346
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,170
Come on. Are you sure you saw that right?

347
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,040
I'm sure it was that pushover.
It was a gift for his girlfriend.

348
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,110
But he just bought a car
from us not too long ago.

349
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,470
Doesn't that seem a little strange?

350
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,810
Now that you mention it.

351
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,110
That guy's buying cars
too often, don't you think?

352
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,710
Something is definitely off.

353
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,450
He's a repeat buyer. Good
for us. What's so strange?

354
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,690
It's not like he's in a car
carrier buying them up.

355
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,420
Don't make a big deal out of nothing.

356
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,890
Go Eun.

357
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,790
Get a car carrier ready for me.

358
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,900
Yes, sir. Of course. Thank you.

359
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,590
Let's do this.

360
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,530
A car carrier?

361
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,200
Boss!

362
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,770
That pushover is driving a
car carrier buying up used cars.

363
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,130
He loaded them onto a car carrier?

364
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,370
Yes. The other used cars he bought
from other lots were on there too.

365
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,910
The more I think about that pushover,

366
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,240
the more things don't add up.

367
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,910
He never even bothered
to check the cars' condition.

368
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,250
And he never tried to haggle.

369
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,620
That pushover's here.

370
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,060
To buy a car.

371
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,730
Why?

372
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,030
Again?

373
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
What's wrong?

374
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,240
My girlfriend and I broke up.

375
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,610
You broke up with your girlfriend,

376
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,150
so you came to buy a used car?

377
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,920
I feel like a drive in a new car...

378
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,920
will cheer me up.

379
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,400
Got any recommendations?

380
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,170
This one... Gosh.

381
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,370
My gosh. I'm so sorry.

382
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,370
Could you help me pick this up?

383
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,380
(This certifies the transfer of ownership.)

384
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,490
(Kim Do Gi)

385
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
We're all set, right?

386
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,790
Hold on a sec.

387
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,760
Right, thanks. Go ahead, count it.

388
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,240
We're pretty much done, but...

389
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,480
You haven't paid the
residual value of 7,000 dollars.

390
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,920
- Residual value?
- That needs to be paid in cash.

391
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,150
If not, we can just cancel the whole deal.

392
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,500
That's right. Right, the residual value.

393
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,930
That's right. It totally slipped my mind.

394
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,270
Okay, then. Is a check okay?

395
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,570
Count it.

396
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,340
And don't worry, the serial
numbers are all unique.

397
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,750
Thank you. Have a good one.

398
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,350
Take care.

399
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,990
Right. One more thing.

400
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,590
The car key.

401
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,060
This is mine now. Have a good one.

402
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,889
It's my car!

403
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,660
But that pushover...

404
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,200
I bet he doesn't even
know what residual value is.

405
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,140
Look at him. He doesn't
give a darn about price.

406
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,340
- What on earth is that?
- Thank you!

407
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,340
Get the car key.

408
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,570
Where on earth is he going?

409
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
All right.

410
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,160
Let's get a little closer.

411
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,630
Okay.

412
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,740
Perfect.

413
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,420
All mine!

414
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,290
There he is.

415
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,560
What is that thing?

416
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,969
Please enter the four-digit code.

417
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,370
Five, two, eight, three. There we go.

418
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,910
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- What is that?

419
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,390
- Isn't that money?
- This is it.

420
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,360
Bye. I'll be back for more.

421
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,330
Hide.

422
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,730
(Exit)

423
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,500
Time to score another one.

424
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,510
He's got skills.

425
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,670
He goes to used car lots and buys cars.

426
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,340
It looks like he's hoarding them all here.

427
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,040
The cars he bought
from us are over there too.

428
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,010
- Where?
- Right there.

429
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,440
Oh, I see.

430
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,450
Okay, let's see.

431
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,180
Used cars, a car carrier, and...

432
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,620
love?

433
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,790
Gosh, I can't figure out
what this jerk is up to.

434
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Maybe he's collecting
used cars to export them?

435
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,000
Come on. What moron buys
cars at a dealer to export for a loss?

436
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,330
What if...

437
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,370
he's buying all these
cars to smuggle drugs?

438
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,340
The curiosity is killing me.

439
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,880
What is this pushover's deal, anyway?

440
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,810
What? People?

441
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,650
Well, well. Look at those curious eyes.

442
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,020
The fact they followed
me here so quickly...

443
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,330
means they must be dying to know why.

444
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,399
- It's not just them. I'm curious.
- Me too.

445
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,860
You can at least tell us, can't you?

446
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,000
I may've built it, but I don't know.
What does that thing even do?

447
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,840
- You curious?
- Yes.

448
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,910
Desperately.

449
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,970
To sell the cars.

450
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,840
- What?
- What?

451
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,980
Did you get what Driver
Kim Do Gi just said?

452
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,119
- No. Should I smack him and ask?
- What?

453
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,580
Who's smacking who?

454
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,490
Driver Kim Do Gi. He's going to hit me.

455
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,320
Then maybe he'll feel
sorry for me and talk, right?

456
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,760
That could work. Go take one for the team.

457
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,430
Goodness.

458
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,730
Please enter your four-digit code.

459
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,440
Please try again.

460
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,980
Please try again.

461
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,850
If you don't know the code, move on.

462
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,290
Stop hitting it and move on.

463
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,720
The next time that
pushover comes to buy a car,

464
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,220
we need to have a little chat with him.

465
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,790
Yes, sir.

466
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,490
Darn it.

467
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,330
(Pedestrian Entrance)

468
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,460
Hello.

469
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,340
He's in a real hurry. He
really missed you, Driver Kim.

470
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,810
Yes, maybe he missed me
so much that he got angry.

471
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,910
I feel like they're not just
going to sell me a car today.

472
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,720
Doesn't that make
things a little dangerous?

473
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,250
I just have to buy from them one last time.

474
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,590
It'll be fine.

475
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,530
Good news, everyone!

476
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:48,260
What do you know? I've
gotten myself a new girlfriend!

477
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:53,040
Recommend me one with a really smooth ride.

478
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,270
You want a smooth ride?
I'll find you the perfect one.

479
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,560
How about that? A killer ride, right?

480
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,470
- Let me take a look.
- No, you can't.

481
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,200
You're a cheeky one.

482
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,000
There must be a misunderstanding.

483
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
A misunderstanding?

484
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:32,140
Yes. I haven't done anything wrong.

485
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,510
- You think you've done no wrong?
- What? What did I do?

486
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,150
Your problem is...

487
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,720
that you're just so unfriendly, you punk.

488
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,350
- I am?
- Yes.

489
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,390
What? That can't be right.

490
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,530
This feels ominous.

491
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,110
Wait, are you going to hit me?

492
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,710
You don't have to hit
me. I'll tell you everything.

493
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,350
Just ask me anything!

494
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,570
Why are you buying up all these used cars?

495
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
I'll only ask you one more time.

496
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,010
Oh, no. You don't have to ask again.

497
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,310
I...

498
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,120
I managed to land a real pushover.

499
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,460
- A pushover?
- Yes. If I buy a used car,

500
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,120
he adds ten percent on
top of the purchase price...

501
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,160
and gives it to me as a finder's fee.

502
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Ten percent?

503
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Yes.

504
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,300
So that's why you didn't care
about the prices and kept buying.

505
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,570
Since I get reimbursed for all of it.

506
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,410
What's he planning on
doing with all those cars?

507
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,480
That part, I'm not sure about.

508
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,810
Is he exporting them or something?

509
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,250
Maybe that's it?

510
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,920
I have no idea.

511
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,890
I really don't know!

512
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,620
He probably found his
own pushover to sell to.

513
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,260
Sir, you should take
a look at this contract.

514
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,530
That's...

515
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,900
He signed a contract for 100 cars.

516
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,270
Darn. I've only managed to get 30 so far.

517
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,040
I need to get to 100 fast.

518
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,640
If you need that many, why buy
them one by one instead of all at once?

519
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,210
Because that would look
suspicious, wouldn't it?

520
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,980
Driving around in a car carrier to
buy them 1 by 1 isn't suspicious?

521
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,320
I hadn't thought of that.

522
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,750
So you're still 70 cars short.

523
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,530
You want to go home, don't you?

524
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,790
Excuse me?

525
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,860
Yes.

526
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,630
Then you're going to
do a little job with me.

527
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,340
Okay.

528
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,010
All right.

529
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,780
Could you loosen these? They're too tight.

530
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
It hurts.

531
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,850
But if we get involved with that guy,

532
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,820
are you sure we won't get into trouble?

533
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,420
All we have to do is sell the cars.

534
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,860
Even if something goes wrong,
that pushover's on the contract,

535
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,960
so we have nothing to worry about.

536
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,070
We have a total of 36 cars
available to take immediately.

537
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,200
Thirty-six?

538
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,870
Should I get the contracts
ready for all of them?

539
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,780
Thirty-six cars. Plus the
thirty that pushover took.

540
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,080
That means we still have room for 34 more.

541
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,290
Are you going to buy them
from other dealerships?

542
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,900
That's harsh.

543
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,740
I know. After you cooperated so nicely,

544
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,970
they won't even untie
you. They're real jerks.

545
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,210
How many cars did you
say they have in stock?

546
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,710
Thirty-six.

547
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,910
Then it's about time
we get ready to sell too.

548
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,780
Okay. I'm all set with the contracts too.

549
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,890
I'm done too.

550
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,760
Post it now.

551
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,600
The taxi company near my house.

552
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,270
I'm spilling the tea
on their massive flood.

553
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,200
Hey!

554
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,500
Hey!

555
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
Whoosh!

556
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,760
(Post)

557
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,100
(New post with keyword detected)

558
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,830
(Keywords: Flood, submerged)

559
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,800
A pipe burst at the taxi company
across from my house. It's a flood.

560
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,170
It's total pandemonium.
And it was my day to sleep in,

561
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,869
but I kept hearing noise,

562
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,570
so I looked out my window and was shocked.

563
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,539
All the cars are underwater.

564
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,640
The taxi company is gone. It's submerged.

565
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,180
So now we just have to wait
around until that guy takes the bait?

566
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,250
I'm not a big fan of waiting.

567
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,819
- Brings back some bad memories.
- It does.

568
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,850
(Can you tell me the
location of the taxi company?)

569
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,620
Looks like we won't have to wait at all.

570
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,160
(I'd like to help out personally.)

571
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,430
Driver Kim, they're asking for our
location. What should I tell them?

572
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,630
Could you pass on a
message to Mr. Jang for me?

573
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,640
Tell him it's a good day for a drink.

574
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,600
My gosh.

575
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,980
(Business suspended)

576
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,220
Gosh, look at all this.

577
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,920
Money, money

578
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,680
This is perfect. A level-three flood car.

579
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,220
Who's there?

580
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,060
We're not even open. Why are you here?

581
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,930
Are you a burglar?

582
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,230
Just when I was feeling
lonely and desolate,

583
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,800
I'm even happy to see a burglar.

584
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,600
Come on in.

585
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,470
- Are you the owner?
- The owner?

586
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,250
The owner of a ruined
company? I'm hardly that.

587
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,680
How about a drink with me?

588
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,820
Wait.

589
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,760
Are you saying that you want to buy...

590
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,630
all of our flooded taxis?

591
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,270
After all,

592
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,170
if you scrap those cars, you'll
only get 900 dollars per car,

593
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,270
for a total of just 27,000 dollars, right?

594
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,010
But from there,

595
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,680
once you factor in towing,
paperwork, and de-registration fees,

596
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,080
the money you'll actually
pocket will be next to nothing.

597
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,050
You're not wrong, but...

598
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,190
How about this? I'll even
cover all incidental fees,

599
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,260
and I'll pay you 1,200
dollars for each car.

600
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,840
What do you say?

601
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,370
In that case...

602
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,279
Let's draw up a contract first.

603
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,510
The contract... Wait a second.

604
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,310
- The contract form...
- I'll pay you on the spot.

605
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,850
I need the cars as soon as possible.

606
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,400
Thank you.

607
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,300
All right, keep coming. Yes, you're good.

608
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,100
Okay, stop!

609
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,040
All right, you're good.

610
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,580
The contract's signed,
so get them moving now.

611
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,750
Got it. We'll be busting our
butts back and forth all night.

612
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,450
Hold on!

613
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,750
What?

614
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,150
Hold on a second.

615
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,520
When will you pay the
other 500,000 dollars...

616
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,960
for the residual value?

617
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,260
I prefer cash, by the way.

618
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,300
What's this nonsense?
That's not in the contract.

619
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,340
It's not in your copy of the contract?

620
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,210
Because it's right here in mine.

621
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,250
If you slip this special
provision right in here,

622
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,820
your seal is stamped
plain as day right here.

623
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,890
If you were going to argue against it,

624
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,720
you should've used an inter-page seal.

625
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,030
I guess going bankrupt
made you lose your mind.

626
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,030
Choi!

627
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,470
You have a Choi. We have a Kim.

628
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,310
Kim.

629
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,320
Isn't that the pushover?

630
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,050
Why is that pushover coming out of there?

631
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,020
What's going on?

632
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,890
I think we're done for.

633
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,770
Is everyone okay?

634
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,510
You want to go home, don't you?

635
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,540
Then you're going to
do a little job with me.

636
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:40,780
Okay.

637
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,580
So, were you planning
to scam me from the start?

638
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,250
Gosh, that's a bit harsh.

639
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,750
Especially after I sold so
many used cars for you.

640
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,160
For old times' sake, I
can't cancel the contract,

641
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,260
but I can offer you an exchange.

642
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,830
An exchange?

643
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,210
They're new, so they're a bit pricier.

644
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,550
My goodness!

645
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:29,390
(Rainbow Taxi)

646
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:32,690
Come on.

647
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,210
This is incredible.

648
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,540
Choi!

649
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,520
What are you staring at? Get the contract!

650
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,170
What are you?

651
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,200
- Go Eun.
- Darn it.

652
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,770
I learned to box too, you jerk!

653
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,280
Weave, weave, one, two.

654
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,750
Oh, gosh!

655
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,320
Don't tell me it's over already.

656
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,520
What are you talking about?
We just got here to have some fun!

657
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,530
Please help me!

658
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,800
What are you talking about?

659
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,500
I'm just a car salesman.

660
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:58,280
So, are you buying or not?

661
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:24,469
Byeong Jin. Funny you should mention it.

662
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,280
I know guys dying to drive supercars.

663
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,340
- I was just about to call you.
- Round up all your guys.

664
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,880
I'm sorry? I don't think I heard you right.

665
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,380
I'll let you guys drive supercars
for a whole year, free of charge.

666
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,650
So get everyone together and
tell them to gather right now.

667
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,190
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

668
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,960
You picked a fight with the wrong people.

669
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,400
Darn it.

670
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,470
Byeong Jin!

671
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,709
I told them they could drive free,
and they came running like strays.

672
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,909
Byeong Jin, where's the guy we're burying?

673
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,350
Who is it?

674
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,390
(Deluxe Taxi)

675
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,490
What's all this?

676
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,760
Get that jerk. Get him!

677
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:02,740
These idiots can't even catch one taxi.

678
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,870
Gosh. That thing's really fast.

679
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,210
What on earth? Darn it!

680
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,310
Driver Kim Do Gi, how close are you?

681
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,750
I'm almost there.

682
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,570
I got you.

683
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,280
- Hey, block the exits first!
- Yes, sir!

684
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,680
- Where is he?
- Move it!

685
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,350
Spread out!

686
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:26,619
Guys, don't you want to ride supercars?

687
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,620
- Search every corner!
- Come out.

688
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,190
- Yes, sir!
- Every corner!

689
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,740
Stop him!

690
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,490
Thanks for going to all the
trouble of bringing these here.

691
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,190
You saved me a lot on delivery fees.

692
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,230
Delivery fees?

693
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:05,830
That was the easiest delivery ever.

694
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:08,800
You could've parked
a little neater, though.

695
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,670
I guess you're all just
messed up in the head.

696
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,140
Thanks to your cooperation,
this whole job went a lot smoother.

697
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,370
Moving them all by
myself would've been hard.

698
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:24,550
The contract said you'd be trading
the new cars for these supercars.

699
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,580
New cars?

700
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,560
You must not have read
the contract very carefully.

701
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,070
What are you all standing around for?

702
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,100
Kill that jerk!

703
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,440
You scum!

704
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:52,670
You jerk.

705
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,460
- You walked in here voluntarily.
- But you won't be walking out.

706
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,060
You little punks.

707
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,980
My goodness.

708
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,940
Where are we?

709
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:04,840
Hey, what's that over there?

710
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,110
I'll give you one last chance.

711
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,190
If you admit what you've
done wrong, even now,

712
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:20,520
and promise to compensate your victims,

713
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,360
then I might just reconsider.

714
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,040
- Just run him over. Go! Step on it!
- Just run him over!

715
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,940
How about you all think it over?

716
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,140
Just die, you jerk!

717
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,580
Turn around! It's a dead end!

718
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,500
That car you're in. Doesn't
it look a little familiar?

719
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,369
- Boss!
- What is it?

720
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,830
This is one of the cars from our lot.

721
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,940
- It's a flood-damaged car of ours.
- What? Are you sure?

722
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,370
I'm the one who stitched
the airbag in this car!

723
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,540
Stop the car now!

724
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,310
- Stop the car, you jerk!
- The brakes aren't working!

725
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,750
You never thought you'd drive it, did you?

726
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,720
- Turn the car! Hit the brakes!
- The brakes!

727
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:31,660
I said, stop the car!

728
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,760
Hey, you jerk!

729
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,300
- The pedal's not working!
- Just slam on it!

730
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,310
Now you get to experience
it for yourselves...

731
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,650
what it's like to be driving
a ticking time bomb.

732
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,190
(Deluxe Taxi)

733
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,630
No!

734
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:16,140
(Deluxe Taxi)

735
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,570
Make sure you eat all of your lunch.

736
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,980
Okay, I will. I'm heading out.

737
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,710
- Drive safe. Ji Eun, be careful.
- Okay.

738
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:27,620
Dad.

739
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,380
Ta-da!

740
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,020
Here, have this while you're working.

741
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,290
Your knees must hurt from sitting all day.

742
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,660
Our daughter is so thoughtful.

743
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,060
Since my sweet daughter
is looking out for me,

744
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,160
I feel reenergized already.

745
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,029
I'm the best, right?

746
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:43,870
Drive safe, and I'll see you later!

747
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,030
Ji Eun.

748
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,300
Yes?

749
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,840
ASD.

750
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,540
- ASD.
- "ASD?" What does that mean?

751
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,010
What's the inside joke?

752
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,350
Another safe day.

753
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:59,550
See you later.

754
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,990
(Another Safe Day)

755
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,530
All right.

756
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,600
Vehicle 5283, ending service.

757
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,400
Great work.

758
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,100
You all did a great job.

759
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,800
- Oh, right.
- Yes?

760
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,340
If we're going to resume
business as usual tomorrow,

761
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,710
we have to clean all the taxis
we deliberately messed up.

762
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,340
So the real work is just
getting started for us, right?

763
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:06,880
- I'll help out.
- Me too.

764
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:08,720
We should all pitch in.

765
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,190
- I guess we're back to the grind.
- Yes, sir.

766
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:22,160
Look at the marbling on this meat.

767
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,400
How long has it been
since we had Korean beef?

768
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,170
Pass me your plate.

769
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:32,410
Here's a little to start.
I'll bring more over.

770
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,780
Driver Kim Do Gi, get over
here before Chief Choi eats it all.

771
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:44,090
That's hurtful. I've only
had three pieces so far.

772
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,160
- Already? I've only had one piece.
- Better step it up.

773
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,360
Come on, Do Gi, hurry up and sit down.

774
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:50,690
All right.

775
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:54,560
- Hurry up!
- There he is.

776
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,440
- Go on, have some.
- Okay. Should we make a toast?

777
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,540
Yes!

778
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,340
- To a job well done!
- Cheers!

779
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,340
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

780
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,690
(Watch Repair)

781
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:04,430
(Don't die. Get revenge.)

782
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:12,670
I'm going to kill them all.

783
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,100
(We'd like to thank Yoon Si
Yoon for his special appearance.)

784
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:03,660
(Taxi Driver 3)

785
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,130
{\an8}Are you kidding me? Five months for murder?

786
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:08,530
{\an8}Fifteen years ago.

787
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,570
{\an8}I started the Deluxe Taxi
service because of Dong Su.

788
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:13,770
{\an8}Min Ho.

789
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,070
{\an8}Dong Su, it's me. Don't you recognise me?

790
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:20,710
{\an8}Then we'll have to move faster.
Before his memories fade completely.

791
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,910
{\an8}Let's see how Im Dong Hyeon
reacts to Park Min Ho showing up.

792
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,909
{\an8}Who is messing with me?

793
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:29,550
{\an8}Park Min Ho... Is he really dead?

794
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,120
{\an8}You're sure he was buried for good, right?
