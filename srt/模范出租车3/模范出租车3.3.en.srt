We called him already.
We took turns and called nonstop.

177
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,430
But we can't reach him at all.

178
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,340
It was 100% a scam.

179
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,250
We need to catch that bastard.

180
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,500
That's why I'm telling you
to call the police.

181
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,210
The police are far away,
and you're right here.

182
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,320
I'll get far away from you
since I'm very busy.

183
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,480
Don't come. Don't come.

184
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,500
We sold it quickly because you told us to.

185
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,310
Are you saying it's my fault?

186
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,090
What's all the commotion? What's going on?

187
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,510
They sold the car to a wrong person,
and they want me to find him.

188
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,960
Wrong person?

189
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,930
You have no idea. We waited all night,
and we came back because it rained.

190
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,160
The used car dealer
wanted to test drive it, but-

191
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,010
Hold on. Hold on.

192
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,970
Yes, Mr. Oh. I was waiting for your call.

193
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,650
<i>I don't think I need to borrow money.</i>

194
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,440
- Pardon?
<i>- I'm sorry for making you worry.</i>

195
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,980
<i>You must be busy. I'll hang up now.</i>

196
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,700
Mr. Oh.

197
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,070
Go Eun, you know Mr. Oh, right?

198
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,290
Find his home address and text it to me.

199
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,020
- Okay.
- But...

200
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,970
- G-Go Eun...
- Go dry yourself. Geez.

201
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,370
Looks like Mr. Jang is leaving.
What do we do?

202
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,630
Should we wait for him?

203
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,000
He told us to wait a bit. Let's wait.

204
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,080
- You were home, Ji Eun.
- Hello.

205
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,190
Is your mother home?

206
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,650
She's sleeping because she's
coming down with the flu.

207
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,180
- Come on in.
- Okay.

208
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,550
Mr. Oh got into an accident while
providing designated driver service?

209
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,830
He fractured his wrist.

210
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,320
He's hospitalized after surgery.

211
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,750
Well, his taxi business was going well.

212
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,730
I found out he was working as a designated
driver because of the accident.

213
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,730
Gosh.

214
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,410
And...

215
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,530
I found this in his drawer.

216
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,260
Hey.

217
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,470
This is a divorce paper.

218
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,080
I'm not sure what exactly Dad is thinking.

219
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,060
I asked him, but he won't answer.

220
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,420
Which hospital is he at right now?

221
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,350
Mr. Oh?

222
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,880
Mr. Oh!

223
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,800
Mr. Oh!

224
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,090
Mr. Oh, hold on!

225
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,790
Mr. Oh.

226
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,020
I don't know what happened,
but we need to talk.

227
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,470
There's no other way.

228
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,050
I need to die now to end it all.

229
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,420
End what, exactly?

230
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,900
What about the people left behind?

231
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,850
The pain you're experiencing now.

232
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,270
The people remaining will have
to reap the whirlwind.

233
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,650
They'll have to bear the burden
for the rest of their lives.

234
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,650
Are you okay with that?

235
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,230
Come here.

236
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,230
I'll help you.

237
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,810
Please?

238
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,960
There's nothing I can do anymore.

239
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,660
That's not true!

240
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,250
There definitely are solutions.

241
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,980
There are so many things
you can still do. Okay?

242
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,110
I...

243
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,650
I fell victim to those bastards,

244
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,300
but there's no way out.

245
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,030
Please.

246
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,900
Please take my hand.

247
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,490
Please?

248
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,740
It's okay.

249
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,280
It's okay.

250
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,770
It's okay.

251
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,690
Tell me everything that happened.

252
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,440
Everything.

253
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,220
You brought all the correct documents.

254
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,010
But the thing is...

255
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,150
What is it? Do you not like the price?

256
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,100
I do. It's just much
cheaper than I expected.

257
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,460
Is it a problem that it's cheap?

258
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,950
I'm sorry if I came across that way.

259
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,580
The current market price
of Seoul Taxi Number is

260
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,470
115 to 125 million won, roughly.

261
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,380
The license we're selling now was

262
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,090
offered to us urgently due to the
current license holder's health issue.

263
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,250
That's why we put it on the market
with a 25% discount.

264
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,710
You were the first person
to call us about it.

265
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,780
I was checking out the listings,

266
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,840
and I saw a new post that popped up.

267
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,470
So, I thought I should seize the chance-

268
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,540
I have another appointment.

269
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,600
I understand you're canceling the purchase.

270
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,520
I'll call the next customer immediately.

271
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,810
No, no. I'm not canceling.

272
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,200
Not at all.

273
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,730
The owner wants to receive cash today.

274
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,550
It'd be our loss to waste time.

275
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,320
Okay. Got it.

276
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,710
I'll sign the agreement.

277
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,950
- Mr. Yang.
- Yes.

278
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,990
I checked the paperwork.
Proceed with the sale.

279
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,400
Okay.

280
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,700
- Are you there, Ms. Yu?
- Yes, sir.

281
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,730
Bring out the taxi outside the
showroom so it can exit easily.

282
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,920
Okay. Got it.

283
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,960
I'm sorry, I have to go.
I have a tight schedule today.

284
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,070
It's okay. I took up too much of your time.

285
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,960
I'm sorry.

286
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,030
Sign him up for a cash back service, too.

287
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,220
Okay.

288
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,850
The section chief will explain everything.

289
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,870
You can sign afterward. All right, then.

290
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,220
Okay.

291
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,760
Good day, sir.

292
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,710
Nice to meet you.

293
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,290
I'll help you with the signing.

294
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:33,100
By the way, he's Mr. Cha Byeong Jin, right?

295
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,650
Yes. He's the owner.

296
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,410
That's real, right?

297
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,100
Gosh, of course.

298
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,410
He indeed is a lawyer
who passed the bar exam.

299
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,850
Oh, really?

300
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,690
He runs this showroom himself
because he just loves cars.

301
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,160
He's a car fanatic.

302
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,730
I find him trustworthy since he's a lawyer.

303
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,190
Have a seat.

304
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,950
Okay, then. Should I explain the
cash back agreement to you?

305
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,040
Cash back?

306
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,900
If we sell way lower than the market price,

307
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,800
we'll be disrupting the market
for the other businesses.

308
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,890
So, we'll register the price
at the market price

309
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,400
and pay you back 800,000 won
to your account each month.

310
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,740
Oh, I see.

311
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,690
I put the independent taxi
in front of the door.

312
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,520
Congratulations.

313
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,000
Congratulations.

314
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,140
Wow, what a nice taxi.

315
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,480
We also buy.

316
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,760
Recommend us to taxi drivers
who want to sell their used vehicles.

317
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,250
Of course. Thank you.

318
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,790
We should thank you.

319
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,810
Let's finish this up, then.

320
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,830
- Okay.
- Here you go.

321
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,530
(Certificate)

322
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,060
He is a lawyer.

323
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,080
Why would a lawyer sell used cars?

324
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,190
He's been disbarred.

325
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,240
He killed someone in a DUI hit-and-run.

326
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,500
He only served six years in prison.

327
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,050
He was disbarred,
but he proudly displayed it.

328
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,050
He must still be very proud.

329
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,270
But wait, there's something
I'm curious about.

330
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,020
Mr. Oh qualifies to
get an independent taxi.

331
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,540
Why did he have to buy it
at such a high cost?

332
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,190
There's a regulation for that.

333
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,480
They only allow a certain number
of independent taxi drivers.

334
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,060
You can only get a new license
if someone returns theirs.

335
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,180
Rather than waiting for their turn blindly,

336
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,040
people usually inherit
someone else's license.

337
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,220
But after putting a huge
investment into the license,

338
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,870
it got canceled overnight
after working with it briefly.

339
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,980
- Canceled?
- Why?

340
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,880
Hold on, Honey.

341
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,470
You forgot your lunch.

342
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,460
I cooked bone broth for your knee pain.

343
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,700
Make sure to finish it all.

344
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,850
Wow. I'll have it
right after my first customer.

345
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,870
See you later.

346
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,090
You'll get hungry too quickly, then.

347
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,800
Have it for lunch, okay?

348
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,200
- Ji Eun, watch out for cars.
- Okay.

349
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,820
I thought you'd catch a break as
an independent driver. But you don't.

350
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,460
You should be free from student
loans before you graduate

351
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,930
so you could focus on the exam.

352
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,760
People study civil servant exams
for a long time these days.

353
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,150
I'll pass at once, Dad. Don't worry.

354
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,620
Get going. See you later.

355
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,810
- Right, Dad.
- Yes?

356
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,330
Be S.T.

357
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,120
Huh?

358
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,220
Be safe today. See you.

359
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,530
Be safe today.

360
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,130
Be S.T.?

361
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,070
What are you doing over there?

362
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,680
Are you the owner of the taxi?

363
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,760
Yes. I'm the independent taxi owner.

364
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,190
What are you doing to my car right now?

365
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,560
According to the Transportation
Service Act Article 24, Clause 3,

366
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,150
your license was canceled.

367
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,630
Pardon? Canceled?

368
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,680
It looks like you've been punished
for a DUI accident.

369
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,560
I was?

370
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,260
I think you're mistaken.

371
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,040
I don't drink at all.

372
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,530
And what accident?

373
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,050
We don't know the details since
we're only following an order.

374
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,130
We'll confiscate the license plate first.

375
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,940
Gosh, don't do this! I've never done that.

376
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,520
Don't yell at us.

377
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,170
Check with those you
bought the license from.

<i>Just like that overnight,</i>

380
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,910
<i>they took away my independent taxi license.</i>

381
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,780
Would you like to get in the car, sir?

382
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,840
Hey, you. You know me, right?

383
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,240
You deceived me on purpose, didn't you?

384
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,300
Deceive you? What do you mean?

385
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,450
Let's go over there.

386
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,250
What's wrong?

387
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,840
The previous owner had a DUI accident.

388
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,640
They took my license plate away.

389
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,770
Did that really happen?

390
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,900
We were asked to sell the license quickly.

391
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,100
All we did was sell it
to you as a middleman.

392
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,710
You know.

393
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,950
Stop lying.

394
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,610
You knew everything.

395
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,760
Do you think we're fortunetellers?

396
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,750
I'll report you to the police.
Just wait and see.

397
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,640
I'll report you for everything!

398
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,960
Gosh.

399
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,680
Go ahead.

400
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,580
Call the police.

401
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,910
Okay?

402
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,850
Stop disrupting our business.

403
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,850
Sir.

404
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,820
He comes by sometimes
and says weird things.

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,460
<i>Yes. I understand what you mean.</i>

407
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,490
We don't know what to do, either.

408
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,730
What do you mean?

409
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,510
Even though the license
was transferred to you,

410
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,020
it should be canceled
in accordance with the law.

411
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,040
The previous owner is the one who drank.

412
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,390
All I did was buy the license.

413
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,480
Why should my license be canceled?

414
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
How is this fair?

415
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,630
I understand your frustration,
but that's the current law.

416
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,030
I'm sorry.

417
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,580
Is that all you can say?
What am I supposed to do now?

418
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,640
Who should I talk to about this?

419
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,970
Consult the relevant government agencies.

420
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,920
I know you're in a hurry, but if you drive
without a license plate like that,

421
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,270
you might get punished for it.

422
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,920
Hello. I was suddenly told that
my taxi license was canceled.

423
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,170
We can't help you here.
Please go to the 7th floor.

424
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,270
Pardon? The 7th floor?

425
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,480
Next, please.

426
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,670
Well, thank you.

427
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,380
<i>There's nothing we can do
since we follow the law.</i>

428
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,110
Everyone says they can't do anything.

429
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,580
Who am I supposed to talk to, exactly?

430
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,750
I think you should go
to the police station.

431
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,390
That's where I came from just now.

432
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,500
You could file a lawsuit
if you find it unjust.

433
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,630
Sir, stop saying you can't help.

434
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,680
Help me just once. Please?

435
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,400
Have you talked to the previous owner?

436
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,630
The previous owner?

437
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,880
<i>The previous owner was in jail for DUI.</i>

438
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,030
<i>He said he was penniless.</i>

439
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,810
<i>I didn't even get to ask for money.</i>

440
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,310
Yes, hello?

441
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,890
<i>Did you have many customers today, Honey?</i>

442
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,010
Well, today...

443
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,910
<i>Right. How was the bone broth?
You finished it all, right?</i>

444
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,970
Yes. It was delicious.

445
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,130
<i>Of course. I made it.</i>

446
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,350
<i>Drive safely. See you at home.</i>

447
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,680
Okay. See you later.

448
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,220
Gosh. What do I do?

449
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,770
How could they all be like this?

450
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,290
How?

451
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,220
But isn't this too unfair?

452
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,360
Why should Mr. Oh be punished
for what the previous owner did?

453
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,190
The current law says that if an
independent taxi driver commits DUI,

454
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,800
the license gets canceled.

455
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,700
Looks like the broker bought the license
that was about to be canceled cheaply

456
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,760
and sold it to Mr. Oh.

457
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,530
But that's a scam.

458
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,110
All they have to say
is that they didn't know.

459
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,470
What?

460
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,680
The previous owner. The broker.

461
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,770
The civil servants. The police.

462
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:58,020
Mr. Oh was standing outside
all of their boundaries.

463
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,630
They found a loophole in the law
and used those boundaries.

464
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,160
But Mr. Oh tried his best not to give up.

465
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,030
Why did he end up on the rooftop, then?

466
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,190
Because that wasn't the end of it.

467
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,350
<i>Sir, we're here.</i>

468
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,290
Yes. Designated driver service.

469
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,060
Yes. I'm nearby.
It will take about 10 minutes.

470
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,220
Yes, I'll be right there. Thank you.

471
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,940
Sir, here's the key.

472
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,390
Thank you.

473
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,900
Yes. Designated driver service.

474
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,010
<i>Yes. I'm calling
from Noblesse Trading Company.</i>

475
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,280
What's this about?

476
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,870
<i>I'm calling to give you the quote
for the repair of your car.</i>

477
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,190
What are you talking about?

478
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,670
<i>It was a minor accident,</i>

479
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,550
but since it's an
expensive imported vehicle,

480
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,570
it will cost 40 million won.

481
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,630
Imported vehicle? What
are you talking about?

482
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:20,050
I'll hang up since I gave you the quote.

483
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,870
What are you doing right now?

484
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,810
What are you doing?

485
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,450
Forget this!

486
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:14,160
You think I'd fall for
stuff like this again?

487
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,440
This is why I sign agreements.

488
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,230
Because of people like you.

489
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,000
I know.

490
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,430
See how he's playing ignorant.

491
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,810
If we didn't send the monthly usage fee,

492
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,830
we would've completely fallen victim.

493
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,440
Don't you remember?

494
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,100
You received the 800,000 won
we sent every month.

495
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,080
- You said that was a cash back-
- Sir!

496
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,820
We told you that the
imported car registered

497
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,270
in your name was in an accident.

498
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:49,600
Thankfully, the shop we know well
repaired it.

499
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,560
That's why it only cost 40 million won.

500
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,390
(Clause 3 - Obligation to cooperate
in providing the title)

501
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,700
This is your legal seal, right?

502
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,170
When did you show me this?

503
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,900
When did you show me this?

504
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,530
You only showed me the last page.

505
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,140
If you want to insist
you only saw the last page,

506
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,250
apply your seal on each page next time.

507
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,710
Then, we might believe you.

508
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,630
It was you bastards.

509
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:45,840
Now. What about the 40 million
for the repair?

510
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,600
Will you pay in cash?

511
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,160
Credit?

512
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,750
You even displayed the fake certificate.

513
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,880
You scam artists.

514
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,860
Fake?

515
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,940
- It's not fake.
- Let go!

516
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,360
You're going too far.

517
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:16,020
You guys planned all of this.

518
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,180
All of it!

519
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,660
Gosh. I took time to explain everything.

520
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,800
Come on now! Seriously.

521
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,430
Come on.

522
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,780
Enough. Bring him here.

523
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,810
Have you visited the government office?

524
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,470
What did the police say?

525
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,090
Did any of them defend you?

526
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,750
Let's say I planned everything as you said.

527
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,200
If so,

528
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,400
what else can you do?

529
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,430
Everything was done
according to the procedure.

530
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:57,940
If no one defended you,

531
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,190
it means you're in the wrong.

532
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,660
And...

533
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,360
that certificate is real.

534
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,850
<i>I keep thinking about it,</i>

535
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:34,760
<i>but I don't know where things went wrong.</i>

536
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,700
<i>I don't know what I did wrong and when.</i>

537
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,160
<i>I have no idea.</i>

538
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,670
Mr. Oh fell into the trap they set
from the beginning.

539
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,410
He tried to get out of it,
but he didn't see how he could.

540
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,700
He must've gone through so much alone.

541
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,560
What do we do with those bastards?

542
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,850
Since they followed the procedure,

543
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,430
we should do the same.

544
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,440

turns out to be an attorney)

(24-Ma-5283)

569
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,410
This is much better looking than you.

570
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,580
- You-
- What are you doing?

571
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,950
- Aren't we leaving?
- Coming.

572
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,630
Let's go.

573
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,870
Noblesse Trading Company.

574
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,700
(Noblesse Trading Company)

575
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,100
They do all kinds of brokerage
jobs related to cars.

576
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,790
Their main focus is buying used cars.

577
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,490
What's the company's fund structure?

578
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,000
Their buildings are being used
as collateral for a loan.

579
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,310
The showroom vehicles are owned
by a bank for inventory financing, too.

580
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,990
He's running a large buy-and-sell business
without spending his own money.

581
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,100
He wouldn't suffer a loss even
if things went wrong.

582
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,090
He's so smart.

583
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,730
It would've been nice to use his smart
brain on something good.

584
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,440
<i>You'll visit the showroom first, right?</i>

585
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,800
I should.

586
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,820
I'll check where the imported car
registered under Mr. Oh's name is.

587
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,560
Okay.

588
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,970
Noblesse Trading Company.

589
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,860
Noblesse?

590
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,130
Noblesse?

591
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,570
What?

592
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,340
It's nothing. Let's go for now.

593
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:21,400
(Noblesse)

594
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,510
That sign that says
Noblesse looks so familiar.

595
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:36,040
I guess it feels familiar
to me, too, somehow.

596
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,780
It's like vague nostalgia.

597
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,290
I feel that way, too.

598
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,770
I thought you knew something.

599
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,620
Huh?

600
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,340
<i>Lastly, I'll circle
around for a test drive.</i>

601
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,510
- Huh?
- What is it, Hyungnim?

602
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,100
What is it now?

603
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,030
You're dead, you bastard.

604
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,410
<i>Where are you going all of a sudden?</i>

605
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,870
What's wrong?

606
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,260
Hyungnim!

607
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,210
Yes. Yes.

608
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,180
Yes. Yes.

609
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,740
What? What? What? What?

610
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,360
The car thief... The car thief...

611
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,020
What do we do, Mr. Kim?

612
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,140
I'm not sure. What do we do?

613
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,690
Hey!

614
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,290
Are you here to check out a car?

615
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,350
Don't you know me?

616
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:38,120
I'm not sure. Who are you?

617
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,020
What about this car?

618
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,220
Do you still not know me?

619
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,530
You're the one who sold me fond memories.

620
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,300
You said you'd circle around
for a test drive.

621
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,310
But you ran away!

622
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,110
Pay me the balance.

623
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,490
Or give me back this car.

624
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,360
What balance?

625
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,050
Oh-ho? You're playing ignorant?

626
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,300
I took the car according to the agreement.

627
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,470
Why do you say I'm playing ignorant?

628
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,350
What? According to the agreement?

629
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,700
<i>The car died during the test drive.</i>

630
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,440
<i>The engine was broken.</i>

631
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,900
<i>The repair quote was 10 million.</i>

632
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,900
<i>So, I deducted 10 million according
to the agreement-</i>

633
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,880
<i>- Don't lie!</i>
- Do you have evidence?

634
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm the evidence, bastard!
I repaired it myself!

635
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,960
What are you doing?

636
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,370
That's enough.

637
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,640
What's all the fuss?

638
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,220
He's insisting I pay him out of the blue.

639
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,850
You're blaming me?

640
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,450
You can't turn this on me!

641
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,090
Mr. Choi, help the customer out.

642
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,260
Who's Mr. Choi? What...

643
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,540
Wow. What...

644
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,420
Excuse me, are you a Choi?

645
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,960
Which Choi family? I'm a Choi, too.

646
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,100
Huh? What's this?

647
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,770
You acted as if you'd do something big.

648
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,190
It could've been really bad...

649
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,330
My back. My back.

650
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:23,180
No one from the Choi
family is that violent.

651
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,850
<i>He must be a Choi from the Silla era.</i>

652
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,610
<i>I located the imported car
under Mr. Oh's name.</i>

653
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,710
Where is it?

654
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,370
It's not too far away.

655
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,040
Should I go there first?

656
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,500
They hit someone with this car, by the way.

657
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,240
Wow.

658
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,470
Do you know how much it costs
to rent a car like that a month?

659
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,350
<i>- Three million?</i>
- Come on. It's imported.

660
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:12,630
Four million.

661
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,080
Fifteen million.

662
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,110
How much? Fifteen million?

663
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:19,800
If that's the market price,

664
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,040
they must be charging a lot more
for that one.

665
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,570
- Why?
- If it's rented under Mr. Oh's name,

666
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:30,300
it's obvious what kind of person
the client is.

667
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,820
What kind of person?

668
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,740
Someone who can't rent under his name.

669
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,300
Either a criminal or will become one soon.

670
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,490
One or the other.

671
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,390
We should cancel Mr. Oh's contract
before something worse happens.

672
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,360
<i>Let's go, my baby!</i>

673
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,740
I should confiscate that car first.

674
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,690
(No cars allowed: 10 a.m. - 6 p.m.)

675
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,820
<i>So much traffic.</i>

676
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,790
- Should we party?
- Deal.

677
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,600
Okay, let's go!

678
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:11,010
<i>♪ Ring, ring, get out of the way ♪</i>

679
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,060
Don't get scared. We didn't hit them.

680
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,060
- Floor it.
- Move it!

681
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,350
<i>♪ Ring, ring, get out of the way ♪</i>

682
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,300
How brave.

683
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,700
<i>♪ I can run over people here ♪</i>

684
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,370
<i>♪ Ring, ring ♪</i>

685
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,100
Why aren't those punks moving?

686
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,290
Let's go!

687
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,440
Is it okay? Shouldn't we move?

688
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,830
I'm sure they'll drive around us.

689
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,200
My gosh!

690
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,890
Are you okay?

691
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,430
You can't actually hit him.

692
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,970
Hold on. Hold on. I'll take care of it.

693
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,110
You crazy bastard!

694
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,120
Gosh, my neck. My neck is killing me.

695
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,890
What do we do now?

696
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,280
My car was scratched.

697
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,360
Young man, are you rich?

698
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,480
It costs 10 million for a paint job.

699
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,910
- Let's go.
- I asked if you're rich, you bastard!

700
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,410
I-I'm sorry.

701
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,160
What are you looking at, you bastard?

702
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,540
- Gosh.
- Get lost!

703
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,370
Let's go!

704
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,790
Follow the traffic signals.

705
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:36,090
Gosh. You've got to be kidding me.

706
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:40,280
Granny! Are you deaf?

707
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,520
Move to the side! To the side!

708
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,980
Hey, she can't hear you.

709
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,130
Granny! Walk faster from now on.

710
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,910
This is for you.

711
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,930
Pick it up, okay?

712
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,990
Bye!

713
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,410
What's this?

714
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,480
Hold on. Hey, hold on.

715
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,410
Hold on right there.
Just a moment. Hold on.

716
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,600
Who's that bastard?

717
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,210
Hey, taxi, move the car.

718
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,610
Move the car, Taxi.

719
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:12,500
Did you park here?

720
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,590
You must be busy.

721
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,370
There's a 500-won coin. Is that yours?

722
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:18,930
Now's the time.

723
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,050
Whoa! How fun.

724
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,100
This is fun.

725
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,510
Let's see. Here comes the second
punch. Try blocking it.

726
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,600
You bastard! Bastard!

727
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:38,080
How fun! So fun!

728
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,280
Where are you going? Where are you going?

729
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,200
Hey, are you running away? Try it.

730
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,780
What's this? Huh?

731
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,080
We got you, bastards.

732
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,480
Come out, you son of a bitch!

733
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,110
What a poser.

734
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,300
You bastard. Do you know who we are?

735
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,250
You bastard.

736
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,940
You carry that to kill,
not to threaten people.

737
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,680
You think we're here to save people?

738
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,320
It's too late to run, you bastard.

739
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,500
- I agree with you.
- Die!

740
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,270
He's really going at them.

741
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,600
Don't come closer, bastard!

742
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,970
Let's go take care of the rest.

743
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,010
(Vehicle Registration)

744
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,810
(Lease agreement)

745
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,490
(Customer: Oh Man Su)

746
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,380
(Lease agreement: Oh Man Su)

747
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,710
Looks undamaged, thankfully.

748
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:41,020
Let's cancel the lease immediately.

749
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,010
Yes. Got it.

750
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:46,190
We won't be able to cancel.

751
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,440
This car is being leased
under Mr. Oh's name.

752
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,760
But we can't get an early termination.

753
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,960
What do we do, then?

754
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,800
The lease needs to be transferred
to someone else

755
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,660
or use it until the contract expires.

756
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,630
There's no other solution?

757
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,220
No.

758
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,620
What now? We found the car,
but the payments still need to be made.

759
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,860
We need to get more money
from those bastards, then.

760
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,420
Pick a car for me.

761
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,400
A car?

762
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,340
Since we got Mr. Oh's car back,
I'll buy the car I need.

763
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,920
You'll buy a car? From Noblesse?

764
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,440
I'll go and buy what
you pick for me, Go Eun.

765
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,020
All right. I'll choose one
that's perfect for you.

766
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:46,870
Hello.

767
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,600
Hello.

768
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,530
Is there a model you're looking for?

769
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:57,920
It will be my first car. So, I don't
know what's good yet.

770
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,030
I want something sturdy and safe.

771
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,530
Are you an office worker?

772
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,630
Yes. I recently got a
job at a small factory.

773
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,880
Gosh, congratulations.

774
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,150
Are you married?

775
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:14,680
- Yes.
- Any children?

776
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,000
My wife is seven months pregnant.

777
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,060
Hallelujah. So many things to celebrate.

778
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,030
- Double congratulations. My gosh.
- Thank you.

779
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,910
Because of the baby,

780
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:30,620
I thought I needed
to get a loan for a new car-

781
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,970
I'm glad you're here.

782
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:36,300
There isn't much difference
between new and used. Look.

783
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,550
Gosh. Seriously.

784
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,710
You need it quickly if she's
seven months pregnant.

785
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,100
- Yes. She needs it to see her doctor-
- Okay!

786
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,400
To go to work and to the hospital.

787
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,300
And go on a family outing later, too,
in your first car.

788
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,820
It's all here.

789
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:00,620
Let's go. There are sturdy and
safe ones over there.

790
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,150
We have one sturdy one left.

791
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,340
What are you talking about?
The car was taken?

792
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,860
By whom?

793
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,130
What? A taxi driver?

794
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:25,000
Hey, you want the car,
but you don't want to pay?

795
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:30,310
Bring in the car when I'm asking nicely.

796
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:33,550
Or I'll put you in jail
for aggravated theft.

797
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:40,210
Don't drive the car
if you can't afford it. Thugs.

798
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,310
Sir, Mr. Yang found a pushover.

799
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,350
- What about the contract?
- He's signing inside.

800
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,400
Gosh, thank you.

801
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,710
Thank you so much
for recommending a good car.

802
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,480
Not at all. I should thank you.

803
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,970
I'll send the contract fee today.

804
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:27,310
So, will you pay the residual value
of 20 million won in cash?

805
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,700
R-Residual value?

806
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,300
Don't you know what residual value is?

807
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,870
I'm not sure what you mean.

808
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:41,420
The contract doesn't mention that.

809
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:46,280
Geez. I forgot one page. Damn it.

810
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,200
Ta-da.

811
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,410
It says, "separate payment" right here.
(20 million won)

812
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:55,910
What kind of contract is this?

813
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,170
Do you think I'm a joke?

814
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,120
I'm not buying the car.

815
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,080
You bastard!

816
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,010
I took time to explain
everything so nicely.

817
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,080
You say you aren't going to buy?

818
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,800
Don't do it, then.

819
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,850
Gosh, how much was it?

820
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,900
Pay the 20 million won
for cancellation, then.

821
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,140
What?

822
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,820
You're a scam artist, aren't you?

823
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:29,920
I'm not buying.

824
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,960
Come on. How can you say that to me?

825
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,810
A scam artist?

826
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,800
What are you saying?

827
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,280
Who do you think I am?

828
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,580
I'm not a scam artist.

829
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,670
I'm glad you came. You're the owner, right?

830
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,480
You display a fake attorney
certificate on the wall.

831
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,260
What is this, if not a scam?

832
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:15,410
No. That's a real certificate.

833
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:19,350
Hey, you're in trouble now.

834
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:25,140
I'll report all of you to the police.

835
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,240
False accusation and slander?

836
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,800
They're terrible offenses.

837
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,940
My employee explained everything.

838
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:03,130
You should've asked a question
if you didn't understand.

839
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:05,550
You'll call the police?

840
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,830
Come here, Mr. Go.

841
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,330
Stand straight.

842
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,090
Clench your teeth.

843
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,340
Okay. Done.

844
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,130
File a report with the police
along with a doctor's note.

845
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,360
- Make a statement for him, Mr. Yang.
- Got it.

846
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,160
Pay a few million in fines
for a two-sided assault.

847
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,800
Got it, sir.

848
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,030
Fuck.

849
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:49,100
But Mr. Go earns a
higher salary than you do.

850
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,450
Compensation for loss of salary
will cost as much as that car.

851
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,750
When did I hit him?

852
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,140
You hit him.

853
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,570
You married someone nice.

854
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:23,960
You'll have a baby soon, too.

855
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,960
Seeing your address,

856
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,020
it's a nice neighborhood, but there
must be a lot of car accidents.

857
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,730
I'm worried about your wife
and the baby in her womb.

858
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,810
Spare us. Spare us...

859
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:50,720
Spare us.

860
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,220
Spare us...

861
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,280
What are you saying?
I'm just a car salesman.

862
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,990
Spare us.

863
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:13,100
S-Sir...

864
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,630
And...

865
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,020
(Certificate)

866
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:25,270
That's real.

867
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,490
You bastard.

868
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:54,750
Are you okay? Gosh, how heartbreaking.

869
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,330
You forgot your gift.

870
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:01,820
It's for the baby who will be born soon.

871
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,990
Take it. Say thank you and take it.

872
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,050
So cute.

873
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,570
The car is here. The car is here.

874
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:12,300
It's here. Wake up. Open the door, man.

875
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,200
Sir, take your key.

876
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,860
Take it. Take it.

877
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:24,010
- Take it.
- Take it, you bastard.

878
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:29,410
Take it, you bastard.

879
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:47,190
Stop! Stop!

880
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,210
Did he hit it?

881
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:12,890
Are you all okay?

882
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,630
No one's injured, right?

883
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:23,050
I heard people yelling, "Hit it."

884
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:26,440
So, I ended up hitting
it without realizing.

885
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,990
Did your car get scratched?

886
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,100
No, no, stop.

887
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:36,070
- Hot!
- Gosh, what do we do?

888
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,280
Move! Move!

889
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,780
Hey, hey, hey! Move, move!

890
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,470
Geez! Move, move, move!

891
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,410
- Are you the signer?
- Yes.

892
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:52,180
I'm sorry. I think I ruined your contract.

893
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:56,220
The contract is invalid now.

894
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,870
Invalid.

895
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,380
O-Okay.

896
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:05,640
I'm backing out of the contract.

897
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,910
Thank you.

898
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:10,570
Thank you. Thank you.

899
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,560
Don't go. No, man! Stop!

900
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,440
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

901
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,490
Move.

902
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:17,690
I'm not such an irresponsible person.

903
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,390
Okay! Move, I said!

904
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,700
I'll take full responsibility.

905
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,100
- That's enough.
- Pardon?

906
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,820
The contract was canceled because of you.

907
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,780
Well, yes.

908
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,130
Our display car was scratched, too.

909
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,150
How will you compensate us?

910
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,380
Well, if so...

911
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,100
I'll buy it.

912
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:51,990
I'll pay you for the repair, too.

913
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,600
Of course, I should.

914
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,790
Nice.

915
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:12,060
Receive the customer here.

916
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,380
Okay.

917
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,980
I'm the dealer, Go Deok
Su. Nice to meet you.

918
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,590
Yes, nice to meet you.

919
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,780
Wow. I love your outfit.

920
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:30,140
It's a new line. It's new.

921
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,110
How much is that car, by the way?

922
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:38,620
Mr. Kim, how's your new used car?

923
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,170
I think I paid too much.

924
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,320
Mr. Kim.

925
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,710
I think I paid more than I should have.
