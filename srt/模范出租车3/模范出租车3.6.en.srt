26

<i>There was no witness, of course.</i>

27
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,610
The statute of limitations expired.
So, the case was closed.

28
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:58,410
The victim's memory is the
only thing we can rely on now.

29
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,490
Thank you for looking into it.

00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,780

{\an8}Are you sure Park Min Ho's dead?

43
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,170
{\an8}You're sure you buried him, right?

44
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,070
{\an8}Dong Hyeon, what are you talking
about out of the blue?

45
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,570
{\an8}Why are you asking me about him?

46
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,970
{\an8}You can't say that to me.

47
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,980
{\an8}Don't you know what I went to prison for?

48
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,190

{\an8}Should I bury you, too?

{\an8}Geez. Is it fun to joke around like this?

{\an8}No, it's not that.

54
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,460
I don't know what happened to you,

55
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,150
but I know Park Min Ho the best.

56
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,760
He can't reach you right now. You know.

57
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,440
Even if something happens to you,

58
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,450
I'll protect you until the end.

59
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,130
Because you're my only friend. Okay?

60
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,200
So, don't worry.

61
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,320
I'm sorry, Seong Wuk.

62
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,430
Gosh. I must've lost it for a moment.

63
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,900
Yes. Call me if you run out of money.

64
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,880
And don't make lame jokes like this.

65
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,760
I need to prepare for the game. Go now.

66
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,030
Okay. I'll prepare well, too.

67
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,700
Okay. Get lost.

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,980
Okay, okay. Seong Wuk is saying that, too.

69
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,330
Who's the asshole playing tricks on me?

70
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,420
The name is Jo Seong Wuk.

71
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,940
He's the same age as Park Min Ho
and Im Dong Hyeon.

72
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,960
He's been a non-starter at a pro volleyball
team since graduation.

73
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,450
Without really making a mark,
he retired a few years later.

74
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,550
He didn't really make a mark,

75
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,740
but he's been coaching
a college team for a while.

76
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,230
He didn't even go through
the training process, either.

77
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,080
Is he related to someone
in the university's foundation?

78
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,120
- Apparently not.
- I thought so.

79
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,400
Mr. Park doesn't
recognize you yet, does he?

80
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,320
No. He's less and less present lately.

81
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,020
I think I have to be at the hospital.

82
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,000
Will you eat and sleep there?
It's rougher than it seems.

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,840
I'll focus on Dong Su there.

84
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,560
You guys should focus on those two.

85
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,580
Who knows? We might cross paths
somewhere unexpected.

86
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,130
Okay.

87
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,200
Good luck.

88
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,990
Take care.

89
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,620
By the way, Im Dong
Hyeon and Jo Seong Wuk...

90
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,240
Isn't their relationship a bit suspicious?

91
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,510
I agree. Their conversation was weird.

92
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,650
They're friends, but he offered
protection and money.

93
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:56,440
Because he probably was
in the CCTV blind spot 15 years ago.

94
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,200
Right?

95
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,890
Yes. I thought so.

96
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,180
That's why Im Dong Hyeon
threatens and takes money.

97
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,350
I think it's the opposite.

98
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,030
Im Dong Hyeon is taking money,
but he seems to be the one threatened.

99
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,200
Huh?

100
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,590
Okay. What should we do first, then?

101
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,460
Should we treat him first?

102
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,200
Treat?

103
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,800
A financial treatment.

104
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,230
Oh, financial treatment.

105
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:30,090
Yes. Im Dong Hyeon is
too addicted to gambling.

Congratulations?

109
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,370
You're using an envelope that says
congrats at a funeral home?

110
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,100
<i>- Mr. Kim, you've played hwatu, right?</i>
- No.

111
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,940
I have you. I'm not worried.

112
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,220
Okay. You can trust me.

113
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,220
The messages on the
flowers don't seem right.

114
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,920

Ten million. Ten million.

(It was a fun game)

120
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,840

121

Geez Louise.

122
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,530
Exchanging 10 million, correct?

123
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,730
Yes. It is 10 million.

124
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,330
You'll get the chips inside.

125
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,430
Wait, do we know each other?

126
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,760
No. Give me cash.

127
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,490

exchange desk is that?

128
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,960
O-Okay.

129
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,000
<i>Come out! How dare you try to trick us?</i>

130
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,530
Is something wrong, hyungnim?

131
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,200
He snuck a camera in.

132
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,500
- Damn it.
- Look at this.

133
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,080
Don't be harsh.

134
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,720
What are you saying?

135
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,470
Mr. Kim, the door seems
to have a camera detector.

136
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,900
Get out of there for now.

137
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,910
Leaving now would look more suspicious.

138
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,710
Aren't you going to exchange the money?

139
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,080
Exchange and go inside.

140
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,930
Mr. Kim, you'll get caught if you go in.

141
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,760
I'll give you a tip after
winning a lot of money.

142
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,190
What?

143
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,410
Gosh, my money!

144
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,490
Gosh, what the heck!

145
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,960
<i>My gosh!</i>

146
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,720
Hold on.

147
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,250
Are my ancestors telling me that I'll lose?

148
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,690
Geez. This is a bad sign.

149
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
Gosh, he stepped on it!

150
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,270
Give me a break.

151
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,970
You can't step on that.

152
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,530
This is no good. It's bad. Darn it.

153
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,180
Gosh, he's good.

154
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,360
This is a bad sign.

155
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,620
I'll pray to my ancestors
again and come back.

156
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,620
Hold on.

157
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,220
Take that with you.

158
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,120
It's a tip. Give it to him.

159
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,010
If you leave all the cameras,
there's no way to help from outside.

160
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,340
This means you have
to play using your skills.

161
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,620
I'm sure Mr. Kim will do a good job, right?

162
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,570
I can't gamble without Go Eun.

163
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,460
Gosh. There's something you
don't know how to do?

164
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,560
Gosh. Isn't there a way?

165
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,770
Well...

166
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,740
Should I say I had a
past for this fateful day?

167
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,950
Or how should I say this?

168
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,310
Pardon?

169
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,960
Have a seat first.

170
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,790

The automobile development lab
I worked for was there.

172
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,510
There are no buses,
taxis, or a nearby village.

173
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,760
You can't leave for three years
due to security concerns.

174
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,290
It's like the North Pole.

175
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,660
- So?
- Whoever goes there...

176
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,800
ends up becoming one or the other.

177
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,970
A table tennis master or a hoodwinker.

178
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,380
That's all you can do after work.

179
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,090
What did you become?

180
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,760
Which cards do you want, Jin Eon?

181
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,420
Me? Gwangddaeng?

182
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,390
Gwangddaeng.

183
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,460
No. I'll give you the lowest number.

184
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,620
2 and 8. Mangtong?

185
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,270
What do you want, Go Eun?

186
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,770
I want Gwangddaeng, then.

187
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,410
You don't want Gwangddaeng. You acquire it.

188
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,040
You've never played seotda.

189
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,500
Gwang. Ddaeng.

190
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,340
Gosh.

191
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,640
Wow, daebak.

192
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,570
I'll teach Mr. Kim as quickly as possible-

193
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,130
No.

194
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,980
You go in instead of me this time.

195
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,420
Me?

196
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,070
Why?

197
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,390
<i>I can't go alone. I need one more person.</i>

198
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,290
If I win, everyone would be suspicious.

199
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,390
I can help you with that.

200
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,600
All in.

201
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,620
Call.

202
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,240
Go.

203
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,280
What the!

204
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,650
You already went all in. Oh, no.

205
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,930
I-I'll be back. Stay right here.

206
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,090
Especially you. You
have to play with me again.

207
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:19,270
The key is to let them know
that we aren't together.

208
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:27,410
<i>♪ Stay only by my side ♪</i>

209
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,710
<i>♪ You can't leave me ♪</i>

210
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,700
What game do you play?

211
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,490
I like seotda.

212
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,160
You like seotda.

213
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,910
Okay. Come this way.

214
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,530
Excuse me, everyone.

215
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,810
Let's have fun.

216
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,930
Should I bore you guys?

217
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,780
Do I know Do Gi?

218
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,830
He's the best taxi driver-

219
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,080
You scared me.

220
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,540
Are you here to borrow betting money?

221
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,930
Yes. I lost everything I brought.

222
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,680
Okay. I won't charge interest
since you're trustworthy.

223
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,190
Thank you.

224
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,400
- Win a lot.
- Okay.

225
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,910
Mr. Kim, eat hangover soup before you go.

226
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,000
Losing money gives you heartburn.

227
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,850
All right!

228
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,800
I-I'll be right back. Include my cards.

229
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,360
I'll be right back.

230
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,920
Young fellow.

231
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,090
Be a gentleman.

232
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,530
Yes, sir.

233
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,970
No one's a gentleman when gambling.

234
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,180
Go Eun, Go Eun...

235
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,230
What?

236
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,010
Could you lend me 5,000 won?

237
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,070
I don't have it.

238
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,320
I saw you earlier.

239
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,250
You gave Mr. Kim a bag of cash.

240
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,620
- You did?
- Of course.

241
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,880
Pay me back.

242
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,100
You don't play hwatu
to win. You play for fun.

243
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,110
The interest is 50%. Okay?

244
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,620
<i>♪ I cried while lingering
without anyone knowing ♪</i>

245
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,390
Is there a game you'd like to play?

246
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,680
Seotda.

247
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,970
An empty seat for seotda...

248
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,320
A-All-in.

249
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,430
Guddaeng.

250
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,550
My gosh. Aigoo...

251
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,640
I happened to have Jangddaeng.

252
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,880
My goodness.

253
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,940
Shit.

254
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,950
There's a spot there.

255
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,610
Okay. Seotda, it is.

256
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,870
Here.

257
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,170
Wow. You came back quickly.

258
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,350
Did you get a private loan or something?

259
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,360
I-I'll play properly this
time. Brace yourselves.

260
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,870
Didn't you play properly earlier?

261
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,630
Ahjussi, distribute the cards.

262
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,550
<i>Okay. Let's start the game.</i>

263
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,070
<i>There's no need to drag it out.</i>

264
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,250
<i>You get Palddaeng.</i>

265
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,800
<i>Mr. Kim gets Guddaeng.</i>

266
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,730
<i>It's All-in, you bastard.</i>

267
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,120
300.

268
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,460
No. 9 got a call.

269
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,190
I'm No. 9.

270
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,760
Yes, yes.

271
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,980
No. I'm not gambling.

272
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,100
Okay. Got it.

273
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,210
Shit. Where did the time go?

274
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,780
I'm out this round.

275
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,800
- Are you leaving for the day?
- Yes.

276
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,210
Just play this round.

277
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,050
Keep this for me.

278
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,770
Okay.

279
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,970
I have a bad hand. I'm out.

280
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,740
Gosh. Today isn't my day.

281
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,830
I performed a rite, too.

282
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,190
I'll come back with a talisman.

283
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,900
Me, too.

284
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,600
Wow, how much did you win?

285
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,590
You'll play all night.

286
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,730
I'm jealous.

287
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,860
What do you mean-

288
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,180
I'll be back. Keep playing here.

289
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,570
Clean up for me, too.

290
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,470
Okay. Let's have fun all night, then.

291
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:03,300
Huh? He left in a hurry to go to the gym?

292
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,800
Maybe he actually cares about his business.

293
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,450
Or is he here to take a nap?

294
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,080
He stopped gambling and came here
as soon as he got the call.

295
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,410
It means it's something that important.

296
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,290
Something important?

297
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,340
Unfortunately, there's no CCTV
in the owner's office.

298
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,760
We don't know what important
and horrible thing he's doing inside.

299
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,410
I can find out. I just
need to see it in person.

300
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,670
You will?

301
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,960
I'll go real quick since Mr. Kim can't.

302
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,510
Mr. Kim, Go Eun says she'll go in.

303
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,930
As she said, I can't go inside.

304
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,210
I have to play hwatu.

305
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,620
Take care.

306
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,360
- Let's exercise.
- Hello.

307
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

308
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,860
Welcome to "Find the Boss."

309
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,930
Ma'am, what's this for...

310
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,750
Ma'am?

311
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,970
I'm Govely. I'm here to meet the owner.

312
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,520
He's not here right now.

313
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,900
- Did he go out again?
- No, he's inside.

314
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,580
But he told me not to look for him.

315
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,460
Okay. I'll meet with the owner
who doesn't want to be found.

316
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,500
If you leave a message,
I'll relay it to him later.

317
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,760
It can't be relayed.
I'll tell him directly.

318
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,610
What is it that can't be relayed?

319
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,950
I'll meet with the owner and...

320
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,840
No, you can't go in!

321
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,820
The next room is the owner's office.

322
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,010
It's locked. You can't go in, anyway.

323
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,310
Let's check it out...

324
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,550
What? Was the door open?

325
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,210
That can't be. It was definitely locked.

326
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,700
Hey, hurry, hurry.

327
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,810
<i>Let's see what the
owner's office looks like.</i>

328
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,020
<i>Let's look around.</i>

329
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,020
The office is very... The owner is...

330
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,800
He's not in there, anyway.

331
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,070
- Pardon?
- Huh?

332
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,170
It's true. He wasn't in there just now.

333
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,140
Geez Louise.

334
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,300
What? Why is it so noisy?

335
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,750
<i>She kept saying she needed to see you.</i>

336
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,200
She said she must see you.

337
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,540
Do you know me?

338
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,340
Well, no.

339
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,920
Is he the owner?

340
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,590
Yes.

341
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,840
Yes, I'm the owner. Why
did you need to see me?

342
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,720
He's not the owner I was looking for.

343
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,490
The owner I know has a tiny face
and is really handsome.

344
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,890
Who's this ahjussi? My gosh.

345
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,790
This mustn't be the right place!

346
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,800
Where's the owner I'm looking for?

347
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,300
Gosh, I have to meet him.

348
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,990
It wasn't here?

349
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,030
Did you understand what she was saying?

350
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,250
Not really...

351
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,570
She didn't smell like alcohol.

352
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,900
Where's the owner? Seriously.

353
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,680
Mr. Kim, did you see it?

354
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,110
He definitely wasn't in his office.

355
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,850
I saw it, too. He wasn't there.

356
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,820
I guess he can't let anyone find out

357
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,230
about the thing that's more
important than gambling.

358
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,010
It's delicious because
you cooked it for me.

359
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,090
You made all this, Dad.

360
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,490
All I did was serve it.

361
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,020
I got another offer from a pro team today.

362
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,290
Really?

363
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:27,130
I might decide on a team
before I graduate if I'm lucky.

364
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,350
Wow. You worked so hard, my son. Finally.

365
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,560
It will be smooth sailing
from now on, right?

366
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,840
Should we move to a bigger shop
with the contract pay?

367
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,890
Hey, don't worry about me.

368
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,410
Focus on saving up from now on.

369
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:51,220
People say athletes need to save up a lot.

370
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,740
So tasty.

371
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,410
I'll get going now.

372
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:07,020
Hey, why didn't you eat at all?

373
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,410
Hold on. Min Ho, where are you going?

374
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,160
You need to eat before you go.

375
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,750
Min Ho.

376
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,490
<i>Dad, please come now. Hurry.</i>

377
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,960
Min Ho.

378
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,380
<i>I need to see it.</i>

379
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,490
<i>But I don't see it.</i>

380
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,500
You're up.

381
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,870
You haven't gotten
ambulatory rehabilitation yet.

382
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,250
You have to walk a bit.

383
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,540
Min Ho.

384
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,930
Hello.

385
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,240
Is he at the playroom?

386
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,550
Hyungnim, why didn't you go out?

387
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,980
Why are you always in bed?

388
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,290
Hyungnim. Hyungnim!

389
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,200
My gosh! Over here! We need a doctor here!

390
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,450
What's going on?

391
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,170
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

392
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,200
Doctor!

393
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,670
To be honest, this isn't the first time.

394
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:34,170
He cut himself right after
he woke up last time, too.

395
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:42,210
He can't seem to leave the dream
even after he wakes up.

396
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,420
"The frequency of being
alert has been reducing.

397
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,020
It lasts less than three minutes, too."

398
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:36,120
<i>I'm writing down what
I shouldn't forget here.</i>

399
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,290
<i>My son is Park Min Ho,</i>

400
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:52,940
<i>No. 10 player of Jingwang
University's volleyball team.</i>

401
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,490
<i>Min Ho liked Girls' Generation.</i>

402
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,450
<i>His favorite food is my vegetable bibimbap.</i>

403
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,490
It's so good.

404
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,900
<i>Min Ho likes to take photos.</i>

405
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,130
Look.

406
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,830
Whoa, it looks great.

407
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:22,670
Dad, the sky looks like
a volleyball court today.

408
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,240
It's so pretty.

409
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,290
It's so pretty.

410
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,000
Let's come here often.

411
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:36,960
<i>Min Ho said he likes the orange sunset.</i>

412
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,210
(Best Athlete Award)

413
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,920
Jingwang!

414
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,140
Louder! Louder!

415
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,290
<i>The lights.</i>

416
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,480
<i>Min Ho's text. "Come quickly."</i>

417
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,180
<i>A big car.</i>

418
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,090
<i>On the sidewalk...</i>

419
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,410
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't find you.</i>

420
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,410
<i>I'm sorry I can't remember.</i>

421
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,740
(All In Gym)

422
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,190
He was inside for exactly five hours.

423
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,790
He's leaving, but how do we go inside?

424
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,030
They're open 24 hours.

425
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,040
The employees and members are always there.

426
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,840
We have no choice.

427
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,470
Let's just buy the gym.

428
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,370
Pardon? We're buying the gym?

429
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,330
Shit.

430
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,790
Shit. That taxi.

431
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,980
Samddaeng.

432
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,210
Let's get it together.

433
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,910
Are you okay?

434
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,430
Hey, Mr. K-

435
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,370
You're the one who went all-in earlier.

436
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,360
You look tired.

437
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,710
I was tired, but not anymore.

438
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,530
Gosh, you brought a lot of cash.

439
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:26,030
Yes. I'll go big and
play properly this time.

440
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,890
That sounds good.

441
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,550
Hey, it's the guy who won
my money and ran away.

442
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,250
It's because I'm good.

443
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,800
- Just make a bet.
- Okay, fine.

444
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,070
Why don't you check your hand?

445
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:14,800
I wondered why I always lose
whenever I play with you.

446
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,680
It turns out you've been reading my face.

447
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,430
That's why I've been losing.

448
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,370
That's the difference in skills, I said.

449
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,940
Ten.

450
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,620
You'll bet without looking at your hand?

451
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,230
- I'm out.
- Me, too.

452
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,240
I'm out because mine ends with 3.

453
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,080
You all got scared.

454
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,630
This is a great method.

455
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,740
Distribute the cards.

456
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,970
Okay. Hold on. Let me check my hand.

457
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,620
One point?

458
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,640
I quit when I had five points.

459
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,160
This is it.

460
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,370
Hey, I'll make a bet for you.

461
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,330
Please mix these once.

462
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,190
Okay. I'll pass out the cards.

463
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,690
Thirty.

464
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,550
I'll bet 30, too.

465
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:34,120
You play really funny. I'm out.

466
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,710
I got 5 points. W-What do you have?

467
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,610
Six points!

468
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,400
Yes, I won again.

469
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,710
Gosh, I love this.

470
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,580
Mister, I'm going all-in this time.

471
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,110
Please give me an excellent hand.

472
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,790
I won't be in this mess if I could do that.

473
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,290
Gosh. Thank you very much.

474
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,510
Okay. Here comes the big one.

475
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,180
Whatever. I won't check
my hand this time, either.

476
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,650
I bet 100 of the big ones.

477
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,380
- One hundred?
- One hundred million?

478
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,470
I can't play with you. Seriously.

479
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,620
One is out.

480
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,020
Gosh. Your face says you're out.

481
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:59,380
You think I'll get scared that
you're betting without checking?

482
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,730
You look very scared.

483
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,400
One hundred. And an extra 100.

484
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,510
Give up.

485
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,500
Wow. This is how it is?

486
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,760
Should I just stop now?

487
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,350
All-in.

488
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,300
Catch up to me if you can.

489
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,590
People who can't gamble have
one thing in common.

490
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,230
They think they can
scare people with money.

491
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,390
You think that?

492
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,770
Mind if I take out what's in my pocket?

493
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,700
Do you take collateral, too?

494
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,440
It'd better be something serious.
I'm betting a lot.

495
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,330
My gym.

496
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,310
Do you approve?

497
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,320
Just say so if you're scared.

498
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,140
Scared?

499
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,980
I'm in if you put it in writing.

500
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,120
You thought I'd give up, huh?

501
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,730
I'll make you regret it in tears.

502
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,560
Over here! Bring us a pen and paper!

503
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,990
(Collateral Agreement)

504
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,530
(Jangddaeng)

505
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,540
It's Jangddaeng!

506
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,120
Jangddaeng!

507
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,170
Hold on. I-If this is Jangddaeng,

508
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,250
w-what can beat it?

509
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,700
Gwangddaeng is the only one.

510
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,570
Who told you to act
tough in front of me? Huh?

511
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,680
Wait a minute.

512
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,510
I-If I have G-G-Gwangddaeng, I win. Right?

513
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,520
Hold on. Hold on.

514
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,220
Be quiet! Be quiet! Here I go.

515
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,480
(Gwangddaeng)

516
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,100
Gwangddaeng!

517
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:42,090
Incredible! Incredible!

518
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,670
This is incredible! Yes!

519
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,610
My ancestors!

520
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,360
I'll do a ritual to thank you every day!

521
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,860
Just tell me what you'd like to eat!

522
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,330
My ancestors!

523
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,690
Mine.

524
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,110
You two...

525
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,470
- Y-You scammed me, didn't you?
- What?

526
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,690
Come on now. Who scammed?

527
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:10,570
Guard, Guard! These two are scammers!

528
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,700
I knew it was strange that the
newbies suddenly joined in!

529
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,460
Get up for a moment.

530
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,960
I'll search you briefly.

531
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,270
Seriously.

532
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,830
You can't lay a finger on me.

533
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,250
Hey, hey. Come on!

534
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,570
What? What?

535
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,450
What are you doing?

536
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,520
Hey, run!

537
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,670
The key.

538
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:58,540
My childhood dream was
to own a gym! Here I am!

539
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,410
Everyone, I'll give you a good price.

540
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,610
Come to this address.

541
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,980
I hope to see you there.

542
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,360
We need to upload that.

543
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,940
- Hello.
- Welcome.

544
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,160
Look at this. This is...

545
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,990
- Welcome...
- Welcome.

546
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,260
She's that weird ahjumma from then.

547
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,190
I'm not an ahjumma, Unni.

548
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,300
Are you here to see the owner again?

549
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,290
No. I found the owner.

550
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,720
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

551
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,570
Wow. So many members.

552
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,080
I own this place now.

553
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,000
The owner's office is?

554
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,140
Okay.

555
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,800
- What's going on?
- Get to work. Get to work.

556
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,720
- Okay.
- Okay.

557
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,890
(Remodeling)

558
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,820
The hard drive doesn't have much on it.

559
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,720
Same with the network history.

560
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,260
Where did he suddenly show up from?

561
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,530
I don't see a secret door or anything.

562
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,860
Check near that door, too.

563
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,920
Where are you right now, Mr. Kim?

564
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,310
I'm at an arena.

565
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,970
Great. Nice. Here we go!

566
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,930
Let's go.

567
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,550
Nice!

568
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,890
Hey, focus! Tighter. Tighter!

569
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,160
That's right! To the right!

570
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,770
Don't worry about the
score. Do as you practiced.

571
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,600
Why do you practice if you'll
just play however you want?

572
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,680
I'm sorry.

573
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,760
Don't be discouraged because you're losing.

574
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,830
We'll catch up a point at a time,
even if we lose. Okay?

575
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

576
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,450
Gather.

577
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,970
Fighting. Fighting. Score
a point. Score a point.

578
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,430
Jingwang.

579
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,190
Fighting, fighting!

580
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:29,100
Hey, focus on the game.

581
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,380
You aren't receiving well.

582
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,550
You focus on your game, man.

583
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,100
What's the point of receiving?
You can't even score.

584
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,890
Fighting, fighting!

585
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,980
Jingwang!

586
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,300
- Good work.
- Good work.

587
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,080
Yeon Tae, good job today.

588
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,930
- Thank you.
- Sure.

589
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,470
Treat them to a barbecue.

590
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,760
Don't worry about the
cost. Go somewhere nice.

591
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,880
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sure.

592
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,410
What is it? Make it quick.

593
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:26,130
The thing is, Seong Wuk...

594
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,600
- Well...
- Is this about money?

595
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,010
Yes.

596
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:33,490
- It is, but-
- You know the passcode, right?

597
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:36,350
There's 20 million in here. Use it.

598
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:40,090
<i>- It's not that-
- Tomorrow's the playoffs.</i>

599
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,740
<i>It's an important game.</i>

600
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,630
<i>There's nothing more
important than that to us.</i>

601
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,700
Right?

602
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,420
Okay.

603
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,960
Go Eun.

604
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,280
<i>Yes, Mr. Kim.</i>

605
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,390
We need to finish the remodel quickly.

606
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:02,070
Okay. We're almost done
installing the cameras, too.

607
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,670
Since this is by the window,

608
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,470
it should be there if there's anything.

609
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,050
Get up now.

610
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,520
- Seriously.
- We need to go.

611
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,880
Damn!

612
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,800
What the...

613
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,660
Why is he so fit?

614
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,500
How dare they...

615
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,910
So annoying.

616
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,160
When did he replace all these?

617
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,040
Hey! What are you doing?

618
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Hello.

619
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,460
- The new owner told us to replace them.
- The new owner?

620
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,560
We were told that you sold this place.

621
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,970
Where's your boss right now?

622
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,850
He's probably in the owner's office.

623
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,760
Even if there's a new owner,
you can't put my photo...

624
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,450
You're violating my portrait rights.

625
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,430
Y-You can't do that, you bastard.

626
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,380
(CEO Park Min Ho)

627
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,630
Did you bring the money?

628
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,770
I mean, aren't you going too far?

629
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:28,390
You replaced my photos overnight-

630
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,760
Because the owner changed overnight.

631
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,140
Let's face it. You don't have to pay
back the money you bet on gambling.

632
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,770
If you know that, why
are you telling me that?

633
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:40,070
Go talk to the police.

634
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:46,030
I see. You have to admit that you gambled.

635
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,420
I'll pay the money back over 10 months.

636
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,120
Give the gym back to me first and-

637
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,270
Stop wasting your breath.

638
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,020
I said I'll pay you back.

639
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,470
Go bring the money first.

640
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,350
What are you doing? Leave.

641
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:04,840
Shit.

642
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,180
Let me rent this place
just for today, then.

643
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,450
I need to do something urgently.

644
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,290
<i>Tomorrow's the playoffs.</i>

645
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,840
<i>It's an important game.</i>

646
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,640
<i>There's nothing more
important than that to us.</i>

647
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,860
I'll pay you one million won.

648
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,640
I'm not asking for it back.

649
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,840
I want to rent it for a day for a million.

650
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,320
Get another place with that money.

651
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,270
Not another place! I need this place!

652
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:39,450
Get out.

653
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,500
Shit. Seriously.

654
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:49,980
I'll pay you five million, then. Happy?

655
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,190
Get out.

656
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,700
Five million is a month's rent
for the entire place!

657
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,060
If so,

658
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,730
ten million.

659
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,980
- Get out.
- Shit!

660
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,870
What are you still doing here?

661
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,610
Excuse me, sir.

662
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:21,090
What?

663
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,210
I'll pay you 20 million.

664
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,490
That's all the money I can get right now.

665
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,400
Please. Let me use it just for a day.

666
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:47,260
Go ahead.

667
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,890
T-Thank you. Thank you.

668
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,240
I'm kidding.

669
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,740
P-Please let me just once.

670
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,610
Okay.

671
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,380
You mean it, right?

672
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:07,280
He's been hiding a
space like that all this time.

673
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,680
That's why we couldn't find it.

674
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:15,900
Hello, Mr. Jang.

675
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,970
I think I could use your help.

676
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,330
Have a look at this.

677
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:27,860
Dong Su is looking for a combination.

678
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,440
I can't seem to figure it out.

679
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,020
It's a four-digit code.

680
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,700
Is it a passcode?

681
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,700
Let's see. This is...

682
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,170
I think it's a phone
number. The last four digits.

683
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:41,070
Isn't it a date? A birthdate?

684
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,320
It could be a license plate number, too.

685
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,240
(24-Ma-5283)

686
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:59,460
<i>You can't be in the middle
of the road like that. It's dangerous!</i>

687
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,780
<i>Min Ho asked me to come quickly.</i>

688
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,160
<i>The car...</i>

689
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,560
(Big car)

690
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,170
(Big car. Lights.)

691
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,170
Yes. Thank you so much.

692
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,040
You were very helpful.

693
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,880
<i>If you're here before I arrive...</i>

694
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,130
You see the wooden clock in there?

695
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,220
The only clock that's dead?

696
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,910
Yes.

697
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,140
That's the passcode.

698
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,900
10:45?

699
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,120
Yes.

700
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:38,860
1045.

701
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,110
The important thing is...

702
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:46,910
that I don't have to
worry about forgetting it.

703
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,360
<i>I need to see it.</i>

704
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,180
<i>But I don't see it.</i>

705
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,830
<i>Just a little more. Just a little more.</i>

706
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,650
<i>Hyungnim,</i>

707
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:29,630
this watch is Min Ho's.

708
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,040
Please record what you want to remember

709
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,430
on this watch.

710
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,490
I know it's important.

711
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,090
Right?

712
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,730
(1203)

713
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,930
I see it.

714
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,790
Hyungnim.

715
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,250
Are you okay?

716
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:22,000
Hyungnim, you've been through so much.

717
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,040
I'll take it from here.

718
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:30,720
You've done so much.

719

(A Gym in Your Heart)

720
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,990
He came out exactly after five hours again.

721
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,990
There's a lock.

722
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:31,700
<i>That's the only part that
was hidden on CCTV.</i>

723
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,410
Hold on.

724
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,530
Is there a number combination related
to Im Dong Hyeon using 3, 5, 7, 9?

725
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:02,800
Im Dong Hyeon's phone number ends in 5379.

726

727
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,720
What's all that?

728
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,390
The important thing he
needed to quit gambling for

729
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,830
was another kind of gambling.

730
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:22,700
(Safe community!)

731
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,750
Has Im Dong Hyeon been betting
on sports games online for five hours?

732
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,040
No.

733
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,800
To be exact, he didn't bet on sports games.

734
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,180
Pardon?

735
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,230

736
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,450
Im Dong Hyeon hasn't been gambling.

737
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:56,040
He's been manipulating games.

738
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,380
Manipulating games?

739
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,140
(June 13 - Two sets / No. 12...)

740
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,110
Yes.

741
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:07,910
With Jo Seong Wuk, who's been at the game.

742
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:31,100
What Dong Su found out was this.

743
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,200
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, sir.

744
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,470
Mashallah!

750
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,060
{\an8}<i>Why are you doing this, you bastard?</i>

751
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,180
{\an8}<i>My friend, CEO Im!</i>

752
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,470
{\an8}<i>I like the idea.</i>

753

{\an8}<i>Do you know what that bastard's name is?</i>

758

{\an8}<i>Nice to meet you. I'm Park Min Ho.</i>

759
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,580
{\an8}<i>Park Min Ho is dead!</i>

760
