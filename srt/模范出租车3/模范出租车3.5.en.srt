8
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,930
I'll go to my house.

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,250
Really?

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,510
Yes.

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,250
Hold tight.

12
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,540
By the way...

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,730
Yeah?

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,130
I don't know where my house is.

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,090
I'll tell you, then.

16
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,060
- Really?
- Yes.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,370
Huh? Here we go! Here we go!

18
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,700
Go, taxi cab!

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,830
Take us to our house, taxi.

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,390
To the right.

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,400
To the side.

22
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,550
Maybe we're coming up to your house.

23
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,130
We'll see our parents again.

24
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,050
I'm so excited.

25
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,780
No! Hey!

26
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,480
The meat is ready, too.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,000
- Oh, yeah?
- Now...

28
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,170
we just need to cook the
tteokbokki a little longer.

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,180
I can finish up the rest here.

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,910
Go play with the kids, Maria.

31
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:23,310
It's okay. It's more fun
to hang out here with you.

32
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,770
Come on. It's not fun at all.

33
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,550
But I appreciate you saying that.

34
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,180
The jeotgal.

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,510
We just need the jeotgal
to enjoy everything.

36
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,350
Gosh, he hasn't done that in a while.

37
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,290
Why is Mr. Kim driving
so dangerously again?

38
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,100
The jeotgal is here.

39
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,390
What if you get hurt while
doing that? Seriously...

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,790
Mr. Kim.

41
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,600
How did I do, Mr. Kim? Not bad, right?

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,840
I have nothing more to teach you.

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,490
I understand the timing.

44
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,090
Mr. Jang, good parking job, right?

45
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,350
Yes. You're very good at parking, Go Eun.

46
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,620
Maria.

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,210
Wow...

48
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,850
I think they gave us too much.

49
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,440
I'll only take five boxes.

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,600
The rest of them are for you.

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,160
We haven't finished
what you gave us last time.

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,520
It's the first jeotgal this year.

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,730
Try it as soon as you take it home.

54
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,330
Okay. We'll enjoy it. Thank you.

55
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,020
Let's move them.

56
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,000
Everyone, take a lunch break!

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,130
Let's eat.

58
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,510
Here.

59
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,490
Enjoy.

60
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,630
- Who wants tteokbokki?
- Me.

61
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,660
- It's spicy. Is it okay?
- Yes.

62
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,950

63
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,530
Ta-da.

64
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,540
It's a madeleine. Chae Bin's favorite.

65
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,810
Thank you, Unni.

66
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,880
Isn't it tasty?

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,440
<i>- Eat the meat.
- Did you play ball?</i>

68
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,370
Mr. Jang, did you get injured?

69
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,230
Well, my muscles are in shock
after playing dodgeball.

70
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,970
It's not a big deal.

71
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,710
Just a second.

72
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,490
I don't think it's a muscle issue.

(Reception - 17)

74
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,320

prescription is ready.

75
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,370
Okay. Thank you.

76
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,450
Gosh, it's nothing to worry about.

77
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,790
I'll be fine if I don't use my hand
for about a week.

78
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,650
You can't suddenly play sports
as if you haven't aged.

79
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,830
You're not young anymore, Mr. Jang.

80
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,970
Yes. Go Eun is right.

81
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,680
You need to warm up before you start.

82
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,850
You always agree with her on everything.

83
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,110
Gosh, fine. I'll make sure
to warm up from now on.

84
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,680
Hang up.

85
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,720
Her nagging is more
painful than the injury.

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,940
She said I'm not young anymore.

87
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,700
It means she wants to care for you.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,960
Hello?

89
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,540
<i>We're supposed to meet up soon.
Why aren't you here?</i>

90
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,020
Who's this?

91
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,440
<i>We're supposed to meet Im Dong Hyeon today.</i>

92
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,360
He's getting out of prison today.

93
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,080
Dong Su?

94
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,040
You need to come quickly.

95
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,960
I'll wait here until he comes out.

96
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,890
<i>Hyungnim, where are you right now?</i>

97
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,580
What do you think?
In front of the prison, of course.

98
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,800
Hyungnim, I'll be right there.
Wait for me there. Okay?

99
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,850
Don't go anymore, okay?

100
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,580
I need to stop by
somewhere. You can get going.

101
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,750
I'll drive you there.

102
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,840
No, no. I can go on my own.

103
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,210
Dong Su.

104
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,930

108

{\an8}I can't find it.

109
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,060
{\an8}Look a little more.

110
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,230
{\an8}I'm looking, but I don't see it.

111
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,220
{\an8}What changed, exactly?

112
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,570
{\an8}- Should we turn the radio on?
- Should we?

113
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,800
{\an8}This?

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,570
{\an8}Mr. Kim wants conclusive evidence.

115
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,820
{\an8}But he can't get closer because
the bad guys are in the building.

116
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,380
{\an8}It's harder because
they're on the third floor.

You can see what's
going on on the third floor.

121
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,430
- Not bad.
- Right? Mr. Kim would like it, right?

122
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,670
What do you do when
they're on a higher floor?

123
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,770
What if the bad guys
are on the fourth floor?

124
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,170
You can't go any higher.

125
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,070
Well, they shouldn't be there.

126
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,550
Should we tell them to come down?

127
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,980
What if the bad guys are in the basement?

128
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,820
Oh, we can ask them to come up.

129
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,530
Nice.

130
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,090
Doesn't it feel like she just insulted us?

131
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,760
I know. She didn't say
anything, but I feel hurt.

132
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,450
I've been too nice to her. Seriously.

133
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,570
I should teach her a thing or two.

134
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,810

Yes. When do you need it by?

<i>The sooner the better.</i>

139
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay. Just one second, then.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,670
Hyungnim. Hyungnim, hold on.

141
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,360
Will you really yell at Go Eun?

142
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,220
Of course. She should
be praising our hard work.

143
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,550
I'll face her right now and...

144
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,420
Welcome, Go Eun. I heard you coming.

145
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,260
Yes. Send me the phone number.

146
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,720
I knew it.

147
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,090
But the number you sent
me belongs to a payphone.

148
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,990
- A payphone?
- Yes.

149
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,050
Should I send you the location?

150
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,550
If so, by chance, is there...

151
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,630
a nursing home, a
daycare, or a retreat nearby?

152
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,460
Let me check.

153
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,120
Yes, there's one.

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,170
- Hello.
- Hello.

155
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,350
I guess the guardians are busy lately.

156
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,660
They rarely come to
visit, even for holidays.

157
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,800
Hello.

158
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,420
There he is.

160
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,760

he was transferred to our nursing home.

181
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,770
He's been here for about five years now.

182
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:45,340
Are there more records on the
perpetrator or the insurance?

183
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,390
That's all we got when he was transferred.

184
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,980
I see.

185
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,460
It was a hit-and-run, and they
couldn't catch the perpetrator.

186
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,450
As you know, the
insurance doesn't pay much.

187
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,260
Since he's been living off the
medical and living payouts,

188
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,420
the unpaid payment has
been growing each month.

189
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,290
I'll pay the entire unpaid amount.

190
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,640
And the patients filled these out.

191
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,400
Here are Mr. Park Dong Su's responses.

192
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,180
{\an8}I'm not sure if this would help.
(Q and A from the Heart)

193
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,850
Okay, thank you.

194
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,310

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,710

202
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,960
(Min Ho went missing)

203
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,300
(I sometimes feel sad for no reason - Yes)

204
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,310
(It's hard to explain what kind of person I am - Yes)

205
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,190
(I still cherish someone - Yes)

206
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,700
(I'm glad I'm alive - No)

207
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,940
I'd like the four top ones sooner.

208
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,640
I'll ask them to send them this week, then.

209
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,370
Have you seen Mr. Jang today?

210
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,940
Mr. Jang?

211
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,830
- Isn't he inside?
- No.

212
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,150
I was just inside. He won't answer
his phone, either.

213
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,580
I called him earlier to
ask about something, too.

214
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,730
But he didn't pick up.

215
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,430
I guess I haven't seen him since he asked
me to track a caller's location.

216
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,800
A caller's location?

217
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,840
Yes. I don't know the details,
but he seemed to be in a hurry.

218
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,220
You need a snack when you drink.

219
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,860
Go Eun would've nagged you if she saw you.

220
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,900
How did you know I was here?

221
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,280
I noticed you come here
whenever you have a worry.

222
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,000
I can't even lie to you.

223
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,500
Did you meet the person
you were looking for?

224
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,450
May I ask you what it's about?

225
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,230
I'll...

226
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:06,400
tell you how incompetent
and irresponsible I am

227
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,120
when I'm sober and clearheaded later.

228
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,810
Why don't you just tell us now?

229
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,850
You don't have to tell
us when you're sober.

230
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,860
We can just get drunk with you.

231
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,260
I felt drunk as soon as I sat down.

232
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,090
H-How long have you all been here?

233
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:33,650
We followed Mr. Kim together, of course.

234
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,510
She asked where I was going.

235
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,850
All I said was that I was meeting you.

236
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,740
You're unbelievable.

237
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,810
Tell us what it's about.

238
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,940
Im Dong Hyeon.

239
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,930
The day Im Dong Hyeon
gets released from prison,

240
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,130
Dong Su and I agreed to meet up there.

241
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,770
Fifteen years ago.

242
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,440
Fifteen years ago?

243
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,330
Yes.

244
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:18,970
I actually started the taxi company
because of Dong Su.

245
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,520
<i>Is it true that you assaulted the minor,
Jin Yu Rim, physically and sexually?</i>

246
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,280
- I never forced myself.
- Me, neither.

247
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:36,920
Are you going against your statement
to the police and the prosecution?

248
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,600
I was confused because I was so scared.

249
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,950
But I remember clearly now.

250
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,920
It's true. Yu Rim hit on us first.

251
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,590
Stop lying!

252
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,910
Yu Rim killed herself because
of what you guys did.

253
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,830
Kneeling and begging for
forgiveness wouldn't be enough.

254
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,670
How dare you bastards lie?

255
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,160
Ask Yu Rim if it's a lie!

256
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,600
What?

257
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,080
Hey! How dare you say that as a human?

258
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,950
You can't get away with this!

259
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,490
{\an8}<i>The police, the prosecution,
and the judges failed to bring justice.</i>

260
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,200
{\an8}<i>The ones who were pushed away
instead of being protected by the law</i>

261
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,320
{\an8}<i>had to fight a lonely fight to protect
themselves.</i> (Perjury... the prosecution...)

262
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,220
<i>Here he comes. Here he comes.</i>

263
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,140
<i>Please! A comment, please! I beg you!</i>

264
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,550
<i>- Just one second.
- A word, please!</i>

265
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,300
See? They only care about celebrity gossip.

266
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,840
They don't care about us.

267
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,690
There's no need to be nervous.

268
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,820
I already talked to the
prosecutor yesterday.

269
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,990
We basically won already.

270
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,280
Don't lie!

271
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,380
Who says you won?

272
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,020
The trial isn't over yet.

273
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,340
If you want to make a
claim, bring evidence.

274
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,850
You can't just insist on something
without evidence.

275
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,020
You didn't let me!

276
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,740
W-Whenever I tried to do something,

277
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,200
you sued and interfered repeatedly.

278
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,650
You didn't let me do anything.

279
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,600
You need evidence to claim that, too.

280
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,800
<i>Attorney, let's go.</i>

281
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,620
<i>Here's the sentence.</i>

282
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,750
The defendant Im Dong Hyeon will
be sentenced to five months in prison

283
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,370
and 80 hours of community service.

284
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,890
H-How is this fair?

285
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,420
He gets five months in
jail after killing someone?

286
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,560
How could this be?

287
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,380
My son's body hasn't even been found yet.

288
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,670
He didn't even know that he
wasn't charged with murder.

289
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,790
Let him live in ignorance.

290
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,950
Okay. Let's get going.

291
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,460
Hey, tell me where my son is.

292
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,400
We should at least have a funeral.

293
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,350
We just had a fight. I didn't kill him.

294
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,570
I didn't kill him.

295
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,940
Hey, tell me!

296
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,120
Tell me, I said!

297
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,190
Where's my son?

298
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,440
Hey! H-How are you humans?

299
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,120
Let go! How could you do this?

300
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,310

Why did you get sued so much?

343
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,540
I just asked what happened to Min Ho,

344
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,700
but they sued me for obstruction
of business and damage.

345
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,600
They didn't let me do anything.

346

understanding the law.

That often?

351
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,130
Yes.

352
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,410
I'll look over the documents
you've been collecting

353
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,960
and think about what
else we need to prepare.

354
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,730
My goodness.

355
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,730
Thank you so much.

356
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,630
G-Gosh, don't do this.

357
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,470
Let's fight as much as we can.

358
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,250
I'll take all these, then.

359
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,600
Okay.

360
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,700
At 19:40.

361
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,800
That's when we talked on the phone.

362
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,150
And the last call was at 20:01.

363
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,500
It was with Im Dong Hyeon.

364
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,670
<i>Since then, I visited him once a week</i>

365
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,990
<i>and got to know him very well.</i>

366
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,920
E-Excuse me, boys. Let
me ask you something.

367
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,600
Park Min Ho and Im Dong Hyeon,
the volleyball players from here.

368
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,700
Do you know what happened between them?

369
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,640
- We don't know. We're in 10th grade.
- This is Park Min Ho.

370
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,820
Hey.

371
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,500
Park Min Ho.

372
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,200
I thought you might know something, Coach.

373
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,930
You can't ask me about that.

374
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,470
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

375
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,700
He has to know.

376
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,510
Let's ask someone else. Let's go.

377
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,110
The meal is ready. Come inside.

378
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,160
Okay, Hyungnim.

379
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,470
By the way, Hyungnim...

380
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,020
Yes?

381
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,570
The other clocks work well.

382
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,790
But why is that the only one that's dead?

383
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,350
Oh, that?

384
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,710
It's a secret.

385
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,760
You keep that sort of thing a secret?

386
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,330
You shouldn't have
prepared all this, Hyungnim.

387
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,620
It's okay. I just wanted
to cook you a meal.

388
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,030
Thank you for this meal.

389
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:52,260
Wow. If you started a
restaurant, it'd be a hit.

390
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,860
Min Ho grew up without a mom,

391
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,980
but I wanted him to eat as well as others.

392
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,900
So, I used to make him all sorts of things.

393
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,390
I think I'll overeat today.

394
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,740
I packed you some side dishes.

395
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,890
Take them with you later.

396
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,970
- Okay. Eat with me, Hyungnim.
- Okay.

397
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,050
- So?
- There aren't many documents

398
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,430
since it was ruled as a simple assault.

399
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,440
The defense seems to
have taken the evidence, too.

400
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,250
I'm not sure if this would help.

401
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,590
(Evidence)

402
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,380
(Attached is a USB with
the CCTV original footage)

403
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,020
Why is it so noisy?

404
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,970
He's been flipping out, demanding
documents on Park Min Ho.

405
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,140
Park Min Ho? Shit.

406
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,120
Why didn't you call the police immediately?

407
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,620
I did. He was kicked out, but he came back.

408
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,200
What?

409
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,410
- We can't leave!
- Come on now!

410
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,430
Shut up!

411
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:19,500
What are you doing at my office right now?

412
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,820
I'm here to get some documents.

413
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,430
Why are you asking us for that?

414
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,530
Because you took everything,
including the original.

415
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,860
Give me a freaking break
and get out of here right now!

416
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,600
I'll leave if you give me the documents.

417
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,400
I was asking you nicely.

418
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,590
Do you really want to get sued?

419
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,800
Do you want to eat rice and beans♪?
(Euphemism for going to prison)

420
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,160
Rice and beans?

421
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,360
Sounds great! I love rice and beans!

422
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,270
If I get arrested and sued,

423
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:54,610
I'll come back here as
soon as I get released.

424
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,270
I have nothing now,

425
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,470
but I won't come back
empty-handed, then. Understand?

426
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,600
Are you serious right now?

427
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,170
If you sue me again,

428
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,960
I'll destroy your car in the parking lot

429
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,710
the first thing I get released.

430
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,220
Geez. This man is out of control.

431
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,050
Yes. Go ahead and sue
me again. I don't care!

432
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,610
If I get released again, I'll come
to your house. Understand?

433
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,260
Okay! Okay!

434
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:29,110
Attorney Yu, give him what
he wants and let him go.

435
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,430
What are you doing?

436
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,040
I'll give you what you want.

437
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,650
Take it and leave, I said.

438
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,810
Please come with me.

439
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,190
Oh, my gosh!

440
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,350
Hold on.

441
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,350
Let me ask you one thing.

442
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,180
Why on earth are you doing all this?

443
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,540
Honestly, this doesn't even concern you.

444
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,820
You're wrong.

445
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,640
It does concern me.

446
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,440
Hold on.

447
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,500
This is kind of strange.

448
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:00,850
Doesn't it look like he's talking
to someone in the dark?

449
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,870
(Im Dong Hyeon)

450
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:11,340
Im Dong Hyeon wasn't
alone there that night.

451
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,160
(Im Dong Hyeon)

452
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:24,090
Dong Hyeon, you're Min Ho's friend.

453
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,830
I told you everything.
Why do you keep bothering me?

454
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,670
We fought, and I hurt him out of anger.

455
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,180
I'll be in here for five months
since I admitted to all that.

456
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,200
What more do you want me to say?

457
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,540
I know you weren't alone.

458
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,180
I know there was someone else

459
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,540
behind the second row of lockers that day.

460
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,530
Tell me what happened that day

461
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,830
and where Min Ho is.

462
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,790
Just tell me that. Please?

463
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,960
Gosh, you're so annoying.

464
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,570
I don't know. I-I know nothing.

465
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,610
I'll deny your visit from now on.

466
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,760
Don't come back here.

467
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,400
I'll find out even if you don't tell me.

468
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,920
Who you were with that day,
and what happened to my Min Ho.

469
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,490
I'll make sure to find out all that.

470
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,410
<i>Since he's serving his
sentence, it'd be difficult</i>

471
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:47,050
<i>unless he confesses or conclusive
evidence is found.</i>

472
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,990
<i>Based on the protection
against double jeopardy.</i>

473
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,190
Okay. Thank you. I'll be in touch again.

474
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,240
What did he say?

475
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,670
He told me not to visit him again.

476
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,420
He'll reject my visits from now on.

477
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,870
Hyungnim,

478
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,340
it's hot today. Should we get
cold soybean noodles?

479
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,850
Refusing to see you means
he's guilty about something.

480
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,230
That's why he's avoiding you.

481
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,160
By the way, Hyungnim,

482
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,650
at the court back then,

483
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,110
why did you say your son, Min Ho, was dead?

484
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,300
People usually hope the victims are alive.

485
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,720
Everyone wishes that
they're alive somewhere

486
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,260
and wants them to come back someday.

487
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,710
Because I know.

488
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,020
People might not know, but I do.

489
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,790
I'm his dad.

490
00:34:55,410 --> 00:35:01,560
I wanted Min Ho to be alive more
than anyone else in the world.

491
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,170
I wanted him to come back.

492
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,300
But one day, he appeared in my dream.

493
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,000
Dad, don't look for me anymore.

494
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,930
It will only tire you out.

495
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm okay.

496
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,320
So, don't look for me anymore.

497
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,900
Okay?

498
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,500
<i>That's when I realized</i>

499
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,080
that my Min Ho was dead.

500
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,470
Those bastards...

501
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:50,660
had killed my son.

502
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:04,520
Hyungnim, what if we prepare
everything starting now

503
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,940
and wait in front of the prison
the day he gets released?

504
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,150
If we prepare well, he
won't be able to run away.

505
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,170
Let's hold onto him and not let him go

506
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,910
until he tells the truth. What do you say?

507
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,440
Okay. Let's do that.

508
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,820
Whoever arrives late that day
will pay for the meal.

509
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,910
That will work much better for me.

510
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,700
Because I'll make sure
to keep that promise.

511
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,100
Okay. Gosh, the food is here.

512
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,890
Okay. Thank you.

513
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,930
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

514
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,540
Right.

515
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,810
Hyungnim, I'm thinking of
starting something like this.

516
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,850
What is it?

517
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,500
(Don't die and take revenge.)
What do you think?

518
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,460
I'm 100% on board, of course.

519
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,620
"Don't die and take revenge."

520
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,410
Those are the words that saved me.

521
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,220
(Premium Taxi. Don't die and call.)
(We take care of things for you.)

522
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,670
<i>Would you like to take revenge with me?</i>

523
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,410
If you start this, when
will you get to rest?

524
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,040
You'll overwork yourself to death.

525
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,720
That's why I won't die and take revenge.

526
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,620
Let's eat.

527
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,560
(The day of Im Dong Hyeon's release)

528
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,770
<i>Since I've met him every week,</i>

529
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,700
<i>I assumed I'd meet Dong Su that day, too.</i>

530
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,570
Mr. Im!

531
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,090
Mr. Im! Mr. Im, talk to me!

532
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,760
Im Dong Hyeon!

533
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,690
Hey, Im Dong Hyeon!

534
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,830
Hyungnim.

535
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,130
<i>After he disappeared like a mirage,</i>

536
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,790
<i>I never saw him again.</i>

537
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,860
<i>The last time I visited
his clock repair shop,</i>

538
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,270
someone else was living there already.

539
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,200
Did he move without telling you?

540
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,240
Yes.

541
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,260
"Maybe he wanted to
forget about everything.

542
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:05,270
Maybe he cut off all contact with me
to forget about everything."

543
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,110
That's what I used to think.

544
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,550
But I saw him again today.

545
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,240
<i>Dong Su.</i>

546
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,880
<i>He was still in the same place</i>

547
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,590
<i>he was 15 years ago.</i>

548
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,120
<i>He looked so weak.</i>

549
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,970
<i>I never called you.</i>

550
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:33,090
<i>What if I looked for him harder?</i>

551
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:40,690
If I were a little less incompetent,

552
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,790
he wouldn't have been in that state.

553
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,080
I regret that so much.

554
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,600
I don't think that's right, Mr. Jang.

555
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,770
That's not something to regret.
It's something to resolve.

556
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,220
I agree.

557
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,200
You said you've been commissioned.

558
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,750
That was 15 years ago.

559
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,820
His job isn't over yet, then.

560
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,170
Are you guys...

561
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,280
How much do we charge
for 15 years of taxi rides?

562
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,660
You want to charge him for all that?

563
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,490
You can't respond to a joke like that.

564
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:30,110
But he doesn't even remember
having commissioned me.

565
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,140
You need to rush it more, then.

566
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,470
Before he loses all of his memories.

567
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:38,620
Fifteen years ago is a long time ago.

568
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,100
It will depend on how
many records we have left.

569
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,340
You're right.

570
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,150
The more we have, the more we can do.

571
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:51,800
Should we collect as much as
we can and consider again?

572
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,140
Mr. Jang, can we see the old documents?

573
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:08,030
- I'll look into the court records, then.
- Okay.

574
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,930
Fifteen years ago. It
should be in that corner.

575
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,560
Let's look.

576
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:25,550
The defendant, Im Dong Hyeon.
The victim, Park Min Ho.

577
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,440
Should I look into Im Dong Hyeon first?

578
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,360
Okay.

579
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,590
Let's take everything
out and look together.

580
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,040
Okay.

581
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,110
(Don't die and take revenge.)

582
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,750
(Perjury... the prosecution...
granting privileges for former post...)

583
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,090
(I don't see a way,
no matter how hard I try... revenge)

584
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,820
Aren't you tired?

585
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,940
Thank you.

586
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,610
Shouldn't you take breaks?

587
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:51,690
I need to work on this case twice as hard.

588
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,130
Why?

589
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,740
Because there are two clients.

590
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,720
Oh, true.

591
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,540
If this job goes well,
Mr. Jang will feel much better.

592
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,610
I hope he does.

593
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,600
Let's raise our drinks for that.

594
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,020
Cheers.

595
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,350
<i>Dad, come right now. Hurry.</i>

596
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,390
Min Ho.

597
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,820
Min Ho. Min Ho!

598
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,650
Hyungnim!

599
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,660
You can't be in the middle
of the road like that. It's dangerous!

600
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,210
Min Ho asked me to come quickly.

601
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,890
Gosh...

602
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,710
Who are you, by the way? Do you know me?

603
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:26,390
Hyungnim.

604
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:34,180
He's been significantly
less present lately.

605
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,310
By less, how much?

606
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:42,440
He was alert maybe two
hours a week last month.

607
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,310
Now, it's less than 30 minutes.

608
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,630
It's been lasting less, too.

609
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:53,900
It might soon become
impossible to talk to him.

610
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,810
Im Dong Hyeon. Park Min Ho.
Both were born in 1990.

611
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:00,450
They played for the same
college volleyball team.

612
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,330
Right after they returned
to school after a game

613
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,320
and went into the locker room,

614
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,410
they got into a fight
about the game's result.

615
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,500
Im Dong Hyeon assaulted
Park Min Ho with a weapon.

616
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,620
The judge sentenced him
to five months in prison.

617
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:16,960
What? Mr. Park said Im
Dong Hyeon killed his son.

618
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,400
I don't think the trial mentioned
Park Min Ho's death, either.

619
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,640
It's probably because of this.

620
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,000
Is it because the actual
killing wasn't captured?

621
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,230
No. It's because of the next video.

622
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,070
The jersey No. 10.

623
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,520
That's Park Min Ho's uniform.

624
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,180
Because Park Min Ho left the
dorm alone after the fight,

625
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,150
they thought the assault wasn't the cause.

626
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,610
But I don't think the man
in the video was Park Min Ho.

627
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,280
How do you know that?

628
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,720
They're photos of Park Min Ho.

629
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,610
We do certain things
habitually without realizing.

630
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:25,180
Some people always
put their left shoe on first.

631
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,320
Same with the way we put on shoulder bags.

632
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,040
Huh? He's wearing his bag the other way.

633
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,560
He's carrying it on the
left here and right there.

634
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,930
Did someone intentionally
wear his clothes, then?

635
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,750
To trick people?

636
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:42,710
It could be, but it's possible
that's not the case.

637
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,520
You can't see the face clearly, either.

638
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,770
I know. He could've
borrowed his shirt, too.

639
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,980
Even if his face was captured,

640
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,520
it would've been hard to identify him
due to the video quality.

641
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,150
But 15 years ago, they decided
that it was Park Min Ho.

642
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,470
Since no one believed
Mr. Park 15 years ago,

643
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:05,990
how about we believe him 100% this time?

644
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:08,250
- Sounds good.
- What a great idea.

645
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,990
Say no more.

646
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,440
Let's go.

647
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,370
Can you find out where Im Dong Hyeon is

648
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,000
after he got out 15 years ago?

649
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,810
Of course. I already did.

650
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:46,450
<i>Already?</i>

651
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:49,360
I thought you'd want to go see him.

652
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,330
(All In Gym)

653
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,260
(Lose your fat)

654
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:36,800
Go Eun, could you find out Im Dong Hyeon's
funding source when you're free?

655
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,970
Gosh. I'm busy.

656
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,860
I'll still do it.

657
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,000
Hey, In Seo.

658
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,530
You came in, Mr. Im.

659
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,390
- Did we get any cash?
- Yes.

660
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:50,850
Today was the sign-up day
for the new TV dance class.

661
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,790
I see. Many showed up.

662
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,190
You collected all the cash, right?

663
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,450
Yes. I put it inside.

664
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,960
Are you leaving again?

665
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,810
If anyone looks for me,
I'm at a funeral. See you.

666
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,700
Mr. Im! Mr. Im!

667
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,600
Mr. Im! Mr. Im!

668
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,480
Geez. Are you kidding me?

669
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,580
We have so many things to fix.

670
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,170
He always takes off with money.

671
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,910
<i>Mr. Kim, a customer is
waiting for a taxi outside.</i>

672
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,650
There's no handle.

673
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,010
What's this?

674
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:31,890
Taxi? Hurry. Let's go.

675
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,090
Yes. I'm on my way again.

676
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,140
Don't touch mine. Leave it there.

677
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:41,470
Tell the members that
I'll be there soon. Got it?

678
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,720
So annoying.

679
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,090
(Rest in peace)

680
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,200
Pull over here. Right here.

681
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,670
It's 88,000 won.

682
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,340
What? Why is it so expensive?

683
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,000
Because it's a premium taxi.

684
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,230
Shit. I wouldn't have taken it had I known.

685
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,660
Here.

686
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,290
Here's the change.

687
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,450
<i>This looks like an ordinary funeral parlor.</i>

688
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,570
Is he attending a funeral?

689
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:36,600
He brought a bunch of cash.

690
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,740
It doesn't look like a
normal funeral parlor.

691
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,590
Why are there so many dusty cars here?

692
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,490
(Funeral Home)

693
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,790
- I'm here for the funeral-
- You're at the wrong place.

694
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,840
What?

695
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,630
Wrong place? He didn't say whose funeral.

696
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,250
What's the deal?

697
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,730
They're guarding the
door, not the mourning site.

698
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:52,140
Why is the head mourner guarding the door?

699
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,240
What a strange funeral.

700
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,590
<i>Should we come and help you?</i>

701
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,760
It's okay.

702
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,820
You already helped me.

703
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,530
When will this finish going up?

704
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,540
Is it even working?

705
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,850
Was it always like that?

706
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,840
I don't think it's broken, though.

707
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,870
It'd better not be.

708
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:39,010
Mr. Kim, listen to music and take a break.

709
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,160
You'll see something soon.

710
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,990
Hyungnim, it seems a
bit short. It might not work.

711
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,370
It'd better work. Go Eun is watching.

712
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,270
Should we ask them to come down?

713
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,650
<i>It might not work.</i>

714
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,120
It was a gambling house, as expected.

715
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,970
Take 50. Give me 100 more.

716
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:21,750
They got all the funeral props, too.

717
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,180
How impressive.

718
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,210
Gosh. They worked so
hard to be in disguise.

719
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:28,010
Even the police wouldn't notice.

720
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:31,670
No one would think there's a gambling
house inside a funeral parlor.

721
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:37,090
Are those cars collateral
for the gambling house?

722
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,830
<i>I looked into Im Dong Hyeon's money trails.</i>

723
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:44,740
He got an apartment under his name
right after his release.

724
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,140
An apartment?

725
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,820
But it's being used as collateral now.

726
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,780
He must've borrowed tons of money
but couldn't pay it back.

727
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,170
Why would you take so many?

728
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,500
You're taking 100 now?

729
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,380
What do you have that you want that much?

730
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,450
Mr. Im is fearless because
he comes from money.

731
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:10,620
Cut the nonsense. You want to die?
What will you do?

732
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,340
Come on. I can't die at a funeral parlor.

733
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,570
Call.

734
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:17,960
It's 70.

735
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,430
I'm 90. Thank you.

736
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:29,220
What if Im Dong Hyeon went to prison
to cover up another truth?

737
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,430
Another truth?

738
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:36,670
He wasn't alone in the locker room
15 years ago that day.

739
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,970
The apartment he suddenly got
could've been the reward for it.

740
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:44,120
We should hear the
answer from Im Dong Hyeon.

741
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,740
I don't think he'd just tell you.

742
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,050
He'd probably tell Park Min Ho, though.

743
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,100
Pardon? Park Min Ho?

744
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:57,060
Let's see how Im Dong
Hyeon reacts to Park Min Ho.

745
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,450
Would he be happy or anxious to see him?

746
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:10,370
I got nothing left after getting
the car back. Geez.

747
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,740
What?

748
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,520
What's this?

749
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,020
<i>It's been a while, buddy.</i>

750
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,130
<i>Have you been well?</i>

751
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,630
(Lose your fat)

752
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,770
Hi, Mr. Im.

753
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,800
- You should've taken care of this.
- Give it to me.

754
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,220
- It's okay. I'll do it.
- Okay.

755
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,850
Mr. Im, someone called for you earlier.

756
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,010
About four times.

757
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,540
- Who was it?
- He said he was your friend.

758
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,340
He said he was Park Min Ho.

759
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,440
Who?

760
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,630
Park Min Ho. Park. Min. Ho.

761
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:58,560
W-What did he say?

762
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,800
He said he'd call back.

763
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,970
Okay. Got it.

764
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:17,990
Geez. That Seong Wuk
doesn't pick up when I call.

765
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:21,690
He only calls when it's convenient for him.

766
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,280
Park Min Ho.

767
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,180
Geez. I feel shitty.

768
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:36,980
That can't be possible.

769
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,710
Why is there so much left?

770
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,600
Bastards. The flyers...

771
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,710
<i>Are you okay?</i>

772
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:59,380
<i>Are you really okay that you
said you did everything?</i>

773
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,130
Who the hell?

774
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:03,700
Who the hell is playing tricks on me?

775
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,270
Leaving again?

776
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,950
No, I'm not.

777
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,930
- Looking for something?
- No, no. Get to work.

778
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,670
What's this?

779
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,800
(No Caller ID)

780
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,810
<i>Let's meet, buddy.</i>

781
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,510
What the hell?

782
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,010
What's this?

783
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,200
How will you defend tomorrow?

784
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,090
We'll stop the straights by blocking.
We'll be on cross defense.

785
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,140
- What about serving?
- We'll do No. 2.

786
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,490
I think we can do quick sets from the left.

787
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:05,950
Okay. That sounds good.

788
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:07,750
Seong Wuk!

789
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,140
- You can go home now.
- Okay.

790
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,110
- Thank you.
- Good work.

791
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:14,660
What? Showing up without notice?

792
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:17,410
Are you sure Park Min Ho's dead?

793
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,220
You're sure you buried him, right?

794
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,600
Dong Hyeon, what are you talking
about out of the blue?

795
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,570
Why are you asking me about him?

796
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,850
You can't say that to me.

797
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:38,770
Don't you know what I went to prison for?

798
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,330
Are you out of money?

799
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,140
Should I bury you, too?

800
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:04,090
Min Ho, where are you going?

801
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,150
Should I bury you, too?

802
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:18,680
Huh?

803
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,480
Mr. Jang, I think I found

804
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,550
who Im Dong Hyeon was
with that day 15 years ago.

805
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:33,540
<i>You found him?</i>

806
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,920
Yes.

807
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,020
I'm looking at them right now.

808
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,700
Min Ho!

809
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,250
Min Ho!

810
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,230
Okay.

811
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,850
When did you get here?

812
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:30,250
Do you recognize me?

813
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,160
Of course, I do.

814
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,060
You're Sung Chul. The one I'm grateful for.

815
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,260
Hyungnim.

816
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,870
I found it.

817
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,160
Pardon?

818
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,400
But...

819
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:51,210
I don't remember.

820
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,550
I try to remember,

821
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:58,290
but I can't.

822
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,770
Hyungnim,

823
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:10,300
I wasn't able to help you then.

824
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,210
But I think I can now.

825
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,990
Your son, Min Ho.

826
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,080
This time...

827
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,200
This time, I'll make
sure to find him for you.

01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,770
{\an8}<i>A financial treatment.</i>

important than gambling.</i>

851
