00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,279

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,980
(Children and animals were
filmed under guidelines.)

00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,950
(Fukuoka)

8
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,980
The show at the castle was good.

9
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,890
His acting is the best.

10
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,480
Not yet?

11
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,860
Testing, testing. Can everyone hear me?

12
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,060
Sorry about that. The
ships were all backed up.

13
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,660
Thank you all so much for your patience.

14
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,000
The main event will begin shortly.
We have a wide variety of goods,

15
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,600
so I hope you'll pay close attention.

16
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,740
Hey!

17
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,310
- Get moving!
- Hey, get out!

18
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,710
I said, get moving!

19
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,150
Alright, alright. Make way.

20
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,020
Good evening, everyone! Thank you!

21
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,690
Good evening. Can you all hear
me? How are we all doing tonight?

22
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,830
Yes, it's a beautiful night, isn't it?

23
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,930
Not that we can see anything in the dark.

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,470
Shall we get right to it?

25
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,200
The format is the same as last time.

26
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,810
I'll show items. If you like
one, please enter your bid.

27
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,640
Alright then, shall we begin?

28
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,390
And we're off! She's 168cm, size
2. This lovely lady is from Russia.

29
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,520
What shall we start the
bidding at? Let's start at 5. It's 5.

30
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,230
If you'd like to bid, please
turn on your laser pointers.

31
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,430
What do you all think? If
you're interested, don't be shy.

32
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,500
You can't pass this one
up. Look at this smooth skin,

33
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,110
don't you want a taste?
Is that all, everyone?

34
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,680
She's Russian, everyone.
Russian. Take a good look.

35
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
We have 80.

36
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,850
We have 87.

37
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,280
Are you going to place a bid?

38
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,580
No.

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,420
She's not my type.

40
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,390
She's a beauty! Here,
take a look. Anyone else?

41
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,430
She's young and fresh.

42
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,360
Come on, come on.
Let's get those bids higher.

43
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,800
She's in her prime!

44
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,230
There we go! Do you see that?

45
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,400
Look at that. We have 100.

46
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,070
I have 100. Anyone else?

47
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,270
We got 120.

48
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,080
Any other bids? More than 120.

49
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,880
Sold! For 12,000 dollars. Thank you.

50
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,180
Alright, take her away.

51
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,420
Welcome, you jerks.

52
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,330
Don't come close.

53
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,050
Who the hell are you?

54
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,620
I'm a taxi...

55
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,120
A taxi driver.

56
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,530
A taxi driver?

57
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,230
What's with the smug look then?

58
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:20,250
(Taxi Driver 3)

59
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,460
Please, just let me out of here. Please?

60
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,170
- Come on! Let's go!
- Yes, sir.

61
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,330
- Run for it!
- Hey! Come on out!

62
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,800
{\an8}(Don't suffer in silence. Call
us and we'll take care of it)

63
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,890
Hello?

64
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,560
My name is Yun I Seo.

65
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,230
Please, you have to help me.

66
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,970
Okay, we're on our way to you.

67
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,040
Where are you right now?

68
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,770
There she is. Over there!

69
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,910
Hey!

70
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,750
Hello?

71
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,510
Yun I Seo?

72
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,720
Hello? Yun I Seo? Are you still there?

73
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,550
Can you hear me?

74
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,850
Yun I Seo!

75
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,560
(To save a single life is
to save the entire world.)

76
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,260
Sir, watch out!

77
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,920
He looks familiar.

78
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,120
What are you talking about?
You're just seeing things.

79
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,160
- Just my imagination?
- Yeah.

80
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,100
This Hongdongbaekseo and Joyurisi...
Where am I supposed to put this?

81
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,970
Just put it anywhere so we can get started.

82
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,600
We can't just rush through
this. It has to be done with care.

83
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,100
What if we upset our ancestors?

84
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,870
Ancestors. Please.

85
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,340
Go Eun's right. About Joyurisi...
It's not an ancient tradition.

86
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,850
Time's up. Hurry or I'm gone.

87
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,050
All set.

88
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,620
This car is gorgeous.

89
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,050
What about your old car?

90
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,360
I'm going to sell it. I'll
get it all tuned up first.

91
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,420
Please watch over this car...

92
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,290
and grant us safe travels wherever we go.

93
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,600
Well, I have to admit, seeing
the new car is pretty nice.

94
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,150
(Out on Assignment)

95
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,760
- Straight from the airport?
- Yes.

96
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,630
You should've at least
dropped off your luggage first.

97
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,330
I know. I was in such a rush,
it completely slipped my mind.

98
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,440
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey, glad you're here.

99
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:14,010
- You should be a little quicker.
- Oh, please. You have no idea.

100
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,310
How is he supposed to know
where his fare is going to get off?

101
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,680
That's what I mean.

102
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,910
Driver Kim Do Gi wasn't even late,
but I gave him a hard time anyway.

103
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,220
How was your trip to Japan?

104
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,140
(Student ID: Yun I Seo)

105
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,220
We should find out what
happened to Yun I Seo.

106
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,390
I guess I should be the one
to go to the school, right?

107
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,790
Now where did I put my school uniform?

108
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,490
Wait a minute...

109
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,360
It'll be easier to question
students as a teacher.

110
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,970
A teacher?

111
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,110
Hey.

112
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,320
Break's over, but you're
all still out and about.

113
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,450
Hello.

114
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Alright.

115
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,020
(Class 3-3, Homeroom
Teacher Hwang In Seong)

116
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,800
You're all such dedicated students,
studying even during your break.

117
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,510
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

118
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,350
Awkward.

119
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,509
- What was that?
- Did he just say "Awkward?"

120
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,550
- What's that?
- My goodness.

121
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,850
- Study hall?
- Did the schedule change?

122
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,760
Who's the class president?

123
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,590
That's me?

124
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,230
Alright.

125
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,630
Alright, everyone, keep up the hard work.

126
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,030
I'm rooting for you all.

127
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,670
Class president, can I
have a word with you?

128
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,470
Hang on a second.

129
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,810
You know Yun I Seo, right?

130
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,420
We're in the same class,
so I know who she is,

131
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,250
but I don't know her well.

132
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,690
She hasn't been around
school much lately, right?

133
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,990
She turned in a form saying
she was going to some camp.

134
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,160
I'm sorry, who are you?

135
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,730
So she went to a camp.

136
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,330
Where?

137
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,100
- Japan?
- That I wouldn't know.

138
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,570
(Class 3-3, Homeroom
Teacher Hwang In Seong)

139
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,040
By any chance, are you our
new assistant homeroom teacher?

140
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,810
This camp... Is it a real camp?

141
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,650
Doesn't the school usually
sponsor things like that?

142
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,790
I Seo's family is not well-off, so
she gets a special scholarship.

143
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,490
Maybe the scholarship foundation sent her?

144
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,960
But why do you keep
asking such weird questions?

145
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,200
Why do you think?

146
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,870
I'm asking because I'm worried.

147
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,070
You're the Class President.

148
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,470
One of your classmates has gone missing,

149
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,750
and I guess you're not worried at all?

150
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,420
Your granddaughter looks just like you.

151
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,120
Really? Well, she didn't
get her brains from me,

152
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,890
but she's an incredibly bright student.

153
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,430
She and a friend have been
studying at a boarding academy, I think.

154
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,930
Who knew studying could be so much fun?

155
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
A boarding academy?

156
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,710
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

157
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,080
- I gave you the whole row.
- You shouldn't have.

158
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,880
My goodness.

159
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,150
- Enjoy!
- Yes, thank you.

160
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,720
- Take care now.
- You too.

161
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,690
(Lens Implant, Cost with insurance: 1,400 dollars)

162
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,670
- Yes, Mr. Jang.
- Hey, Driver Kim.

163
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,580
I heard her family thinks
she's at a boarding academy.

164
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,010
But she told the school
she was going to a camp.

165
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,380
So she lied to her family and school
and left the country ten days ago.

166
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,090
I'll have to ask Go Eun to check
immigration records and CCTV.

167
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,860
Are you heading back now?

168
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,130
I'll head back after I
meet one more person.

169
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,510
You have something to tell me, don't you?

170
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,610
No, I don't.

171
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,550
I think we have something in common.

172
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,260
We're both worried about I Seo.

173
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,550
(Student ID: Yun I Seo)

174
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,790
It's because of me.

175
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,890
It's my fault this happened to I Seo.

176
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,630
Can you tell me...

177
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,730
what happened?

178
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,270
(Student ID: Yun I Seo)

179
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,870
Hey, I Seo.

180
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,080
This is so much fun.

181
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,550
- You gotta try this.
- What is it?

182
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,350
I saw it on a webtoon
site. You just pick 1 of the 2.

183
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,420
- I'm not really good at games.
- This one's super easy.

184
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,260
I have to see a teacher.
Play for me? I'll be right back.

185
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,530
(Odd)

186
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,870
(You've won 5 dollars!)

187
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,200
I won.

188
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,270
What a cute cat.

189
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,710
(You've won 5 dollars!)

190
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,710
(50 Dollars)

191
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,150
Hello?

192
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,120
Who is it?

193
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,460
Grandma, I told you about her.
She's Ye Ji, the new transfer.

194
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,360
- What's this for?
- You won it for us. Let's split it.

195
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,060
But I just won a game.

196
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,230
It feels a little weird
getting real money for it.

197
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,040
- See? It's fun when you win, right?
- Yes.

198
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,310
It is pretty amazing, though.

199
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,890
50 Dollars a day times
30. That's 1,050 dollars.

200
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,960
Hey, with this money, my
grandma could get eye surgery!

201
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,790
- Now you can get surgery, Grandma.
- Sweetie.

202
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,560
Don't you worry about me.
Your grandma can see just fine.

203
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,000
- You know that's not true.
- Yes! Hey, I won again!

204
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,100
- See? It really works. Wanna try?
- Go on, you try it. Quick.

205
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,310
Okay, I'll do it.

206
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,870
Okay.

207
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,840
From the day...

208
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,910
she cashed out her points,

209
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,780
- Hey, I just...
- she became desperate for points.

210
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,020
Between people, there is an island.

211
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,990
And I long to go to that island.

212
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,329
The island symbolizes the breakdown...

213
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,900
of social connection in today's world...

214
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,600
- and a sense of alienation.
- When she won and received points,

215
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,210
she would feel so relieved.

216

(My Points)

217
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,580
But when she started losing,
it would spiral out of control,

218
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,950
and she couldn't stand the anxiety.

this? The Advance Points Event?

231
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,550
Does it just give you points?

232
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,650
Actually, I already got
the points from that event.

money, but now you're playing dumb?

At least your friend
paid up. What about you?

244
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,300
I'm sorry. I didn't know
I had to pay it back.

245
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,470
You know now. Pay up.

246
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,780
I don't have any money right now.

247
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,640

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,630
All right, kid.

254
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,660
I hear you're an orphan
on a scholarship, right?

255
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Huh?

256
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,400
Think you can keep that
scholarship with a gambling debt?

and pay you all back.

- A part-time job?

go to the faculty office.

What? Are you kidding me?

278
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,119
(Nyan-Nyan Jump Ladder)

279
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,560
Wow, look at all these games.

280
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,530
They look like simple little games
but designed to make kids bet.

281
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,970
Kids are glued to their phones now.
They're an easy target for crooks.

282
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,970
That "Advance Points Event"
they got? It's actually a loan.

283
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,450
They split the 300 dollar loan
into contracts under 100 dollars.

284
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,580
Why bother splitting it?
Why not just one contract?

285
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,320
Because current law has no rate
caps on loans of 75 dollars or less.

286
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,850
That's the exact
loophole they're exploiting.

287
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,590
Am I seeing this right? It's
5,000 percent annual interest.

288
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,029
What? Wait. That's right.
It says 5,000 percent.

289
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,130
How is that even possible?

290
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,830

ballooned to 1,500 dollars...

292
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,800
What is this?

293
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,310
Service fees, late fees, collection fees.

294
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,840
What kind of ridiculous
charges did they tack on?

295
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,080
Do you think I Seo and Ye Jin know
what kind of contract they signed?

296
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,850
Either way,

297
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,220
any loan contract with
a minor is illegal anyway.

298
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,250
If it's illegal, isn't it
void from the start?

299
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,320
You'd think they'd know that.

300
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,890
Until someone tells them,

301
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,130
it won't be easy for them to figure it out.

302
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Why not?

303
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,030
Because the fact is, they did gamble.

304
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,969
- Hold it steady, will you?
- Just stay still.

305
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,240
I'm gonna fall!

306
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,740
- Goodness.
- Boss!

307
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,980
Hey, go give her a scare.

308
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,740
Let's see.

309
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,349
Number one. Y equals
two to the minus x power...

310
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,419
is an exponential function.

311
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,990
Which is one-half to the x power,
so it's an exponential function.

312
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,820
- So that's a true.
- Answer the phone.

313
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,520
Why won't she answer the phone?

314
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,830
- Number 2. Y equals log base 5...
- Why is it so noisy?

315
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,229
The exponent x moves forward,
so it's x times log base 5 of 2.

316
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,830
Hey, is that noise headed this way?

317
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,800
Shouldn't we tell the teacher?

318
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,070
- So the answer is "false."
- This is getting scary.

319
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,710
Grandma.

320
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,910
Grandma? Aren't you home?

321
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,910
Grandma, where are you?

322
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,050
- Is this the place?
- There she is.

323
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,790
- What? What's going on?
- It's raining. Let's hurry inside.

324
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,720
What is this?

325
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,300
It's a GPS. I had business
here anyway, so this is perfect.

326
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,260
- Find the cash box.
- The cash box? Okay, let's see.

327
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,370
- Found it. The cash box.
- No, don't!

328
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,430
Let go.

329
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,239
- I told you to stop!
- Out of my way. What's with her?

330
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,540
- This place is huge.
- You really can't do this here.

331
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,740
- Let go.
- I said no!

332
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
Let go of it.

333
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,980
- Please, just stop it!
- Stop what?

334
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,150
After her, you're next.

335
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,790
Who do you think you
are, not paying us back?

336
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,360
I'm calling the police.

337
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,930
The police? Go ahead. Call them!

338
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,600
- You were gambling, not us.
- If you call the cops,

339
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,340
they'll arrest you, not us.

340
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,640
He's right.

341
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,610
Minors who gamble go to juvie, right?

342
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,080
What are you waiting
for? Not calling? Why not?

343
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,920
- Don't you know the number?
- I was wrong.

344
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,149
- We're sorry. We won't do it again.
- I Seo.

345
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,759
Please, just let us go this once.

346
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,990
Forget the "please forgive us"
crap. Just pay us the money.

347
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,430
Why can't you get it through your head?

348
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,800
Please don't call the police.

349
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,970
Please, don't.

350
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,130
We'll never do it again.

351
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,900
We promise it won't happen again.

352
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Get up.

353
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,840
I said get up. Now.

354
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,580
What are you doing? You too, get up.

355
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Okay.

356
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,350
Okay.

357
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,220
All right then.

358
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,990
Want me to tell you an easy way out?

359
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
Do you?

360
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,820
I'm...

361
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,820
I'm going to do what those guys said.

362
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,200
Hey, Yun I Seo.

363
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,230
You heard what those guys said.

364
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,300
If we go to Japan and
work for just one month,

365
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,870
they said they'd wipe out
our debt, interest, and all.

366
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,840
Do you have any idea
what kind of job that is?

367
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,840
If it's dangerous, we can just come back.

368
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,420
Remember on our school trip?
It only took three hours by boat.

369
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,720
Right?

370
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,160
This is all my fault.

371
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,300
I shouldn't have done it.

372
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,040
I never should've gotten
into this in the first place.

373
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,010
What was I thinking?

374
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,180
I'm sorry.

375
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,280
It's all my fault.

376
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,790
I'm so sorry, I Seo.

377
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,300
Let's go together...

378
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,030
and pay it all off.

379
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,870
- I was leaving with I Seo then...
- Ye Ji.

380
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,770
Dad.

381
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,039
My dad caught me and took away my phone,

382
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,950
so I had no way to get in touch with I Seo.

383
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,920
Come on.

384
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,750
How long are you gonna keep calling?

385
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,320
Stop trying to reach
someone who's not coming.

386
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,730
So, what's it gonna be?

387
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,560
Let's just go already.

388
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,860
Take it.

389
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,340
There you go.

390
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,840
You have to clean up your own mess.

391
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,780
- Right?
- Let's go.

392
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,950
It's all my fault.

393
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,120
This happened to I Seo because of me.

394
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,720
I was too scared to tell anyone.

395
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,090
Please, find my friend.

396
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,560
They just started playing
a mobile game for fun.

397
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,430
They never imagined they'd
fall into such a deep hole.

398
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,200
Of course not. How could
they have predicted this?

399
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,870
I Seo didn't just fall into this.

400
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,680
She was dragged into it.

401
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,210
A mobile game that's
easily accessible to anyone.

402
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,720
And when a classmate recommends
it, you're less likely to suspect it.

403
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,220
They set a trap right
inside that very game...

404
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,920
and just waited for someone to spring it.

405
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,290
And they're targeting minors
who have no real-world experience.

406
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,460

Did they overhaul the entire program?

All right.

00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,480
Driver Kim, I'm sending
you a video. Check it out.

423
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,450
It's footage of the guys
who took I Seo at the port.

424
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:47,160
- If it's debt, why ship her abroad?
- Exactly.

425
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,830
Debtors are usually harassed to pay.
They don't get shipped off to Japan.

426
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,370
That's one of the things
we need to figure out.

427
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,470
Sending them to Japan must
be much more profitable for them.

428
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,180
The two guys who left
the country with I Seo...

429
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,010
they came right back.

430
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,620
It's like they dropped I Seo off.

431
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,250
They could just be couriers.

432
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,790
If it's all right, can you
let me handle it this time?

433

The two punks who took I
Seo just came back alone.

452

Then shouldn't we grab those
two and beat it out of them?

Go Eun already told us.
If we make a rash move,

454

we could lose our only lead to find I Seo.

456
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,020

- Don't you have work to do?

Hey, there are plenty of other seats.

522
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
What was that?

523
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,180
So sorry. Excuse me.

524
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,550
Remember this.

525
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,350
You're not in this alone.

526
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,050
I know, right?

527
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,190
And I've got you guys. I
feel so much safer now.

528
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,890
That's right. You bet.

529
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,890
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

530
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,230
Yes.

531
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,240
Hey.

532
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,370
You made it.

533
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,280
- You weren't followed, right?
- Of course not.

534
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,580
I'm the one who'd be
doomed if I got caught.

535
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,680
We don't even know
what the boss looks like.

536
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,380
Me neither.

537
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,390
By the way, today's girl is really cute.

538
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,020
Am I going by myself?

539
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,020
Hey, over here.

540
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,700
Driver's side is on the other side.
This must feel weird. You okay?

541
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,770
Yeah, I'll be fine.

542
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,840
This feels weird.

543
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,280
All right, then.

544
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,910
Everyone, drive safe.

545
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,910
- Right turn. No, wipers.
- All right.

546
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:12,500
I wonder why they're turning
back right after they got here.

547
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,540
- Me too.
- Because it's a cell network.

548
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,110
A cell network?

549
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,740
You mean the kind that's hard to trace?

550
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,380
After that car drops Go
Eun off at her destination,

551
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:22,910
it'll disappear too.

552
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,650
So it's a kind of safety precaution.

553
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,220
But driving on the other
side, it feels really strange.

554
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,630
I know. It feels like we're on the
wrong side. Cars are coming for us.

555
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:37,930
We are driving on the wrong side!

556
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,899
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm driving!

557
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,340
Come on, hurry up!

558
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,340
No, you have to change lanes again!

559
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,940
I'm not used to it,
okay! I'm not used to it!

560
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,150
My body isn't doing what I want it to!

561
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,150
- This is the right lane, right?
- Yes.

562
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,820
That's right. Follow
the arrows. You got it.

563
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,020
You want me to drive?

564
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,860
We need to move faster too.

565
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:00,710
(Life Reset)

566
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,290
Nice.

567
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,100
It's cute.

568
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,610
(Life Reset)

569
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:34,950
Please, come in.

570
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:38,550
Go.

571
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,760
Go Eun?

572
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,900
- Go Eun!
- What? Why did it shut off?

573
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,730
Something in the building's
probably blocking the signal.

574
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,800
Then what about Go Eun?

575
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,420
Hey, who the hell are you?

576
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,530
Hey!

577
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,860
We're not expecting a delivery today.

578
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,260
Driver Kim.

579
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
No, it's just...

580
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,270
They suddenly tried to take all my stuff.

581
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:03,370
What do I do?

582
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,940
It's okay. It's fine.

583
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,530
You know who this is, don't you? This girl.

584
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Hey, wait!

585
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,840
You know who she is, don't you?

586
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,580
I just...

587
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,879
I just wipe the traces and identities...

588
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,580
of the people they send over!

589
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,620
I don't know what happens after that!

590
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:29,550
How do you pay them?

591
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,560
A car!

592
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,930
A car always comes to pick up the cash!

593
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,030
If you check out that car,
you'll find what you need.

594
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,760
That's everything I know!

595
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
He must be talking about
the car that dropped me off.

596
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,070
I got a picture of the license plate.

597
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,870
You know, Driver Kim is
surprisingly good at Japanese.

598
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,010
And his accent is perfect.

599
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,410
I've confirmed the
location. Sharing it now.

600
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,410
Hey! You can't just leave me tied up! Hey!

601
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,520
Thanks for your cooperation.

602
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,150
- Sir.
- Sir.

603
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:36,490
- Sir.
- Sir.

604
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,780
Please, help me.

605
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,550
Who did this to you?

606
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,750
Please let me go home. Please?

607
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,720
Who's in charge of this girl?

608
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,390
I am, sir.

609
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,320
It's not your fault.

610
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:46,890
The punishment...

611
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,730
is for the one who failed to do their job.

612
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,070
False hope...

613
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,000
is nothing but a noose around your neck.

614
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,670
The longer you hold on to it,

615
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,480
the tighter it will choke you.

616
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,190
The sooner you give up,

617
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,720
the more...

618
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,790
at peace you'll be.

619
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:37,539
Get her dressed.

620
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,540
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

621
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:10,810
What on earth are you guys doing here?

622
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,980
- What's with the crazy getup?
- We're trying to lose weight.

623
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:18,950
This is a gym, right?

624
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,590
Find a butcher shop instead.

625
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,790
You fat fool.

626
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,900
Everything they do is so obnoxious.

627
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,840
You think they are yakuza?

628
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,140
He doesn't seem like your typical yakuza.

629
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,940
And how would you know that?

630
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,310
They don't have a single tattoo.

631
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:48,880
Plus, they look young.

632
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,720
- Still, this place is kinda creepy.
- What is?

633
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:57,090
They've got all those huge
talismans plastered on the entrance.

634
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,460
Is it haunted or something?

635
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,930
It says "No Unauthorized Entry."

636
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,830
Is there anything you
don't know, Driver Kim?

637
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,600
I really thought they were talismans.

638
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Go Eun?

639
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,470
Yes, Driver Kim.

640
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:12,200
If outsiders aren't allowed
in, then who can get us inside?

641
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,870
Well...

642
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:15,540
An insider?

643
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,640
Bingo!

644
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,280
I got it.

645
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,550
But where are we going to find an insider?

646
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,120
Right there.

647
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,020
I don't know.

648
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,530
They don't exactly look
like the welcoming type.

649
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,910
- Let's go. Boss will be here soon.
- All right.

650
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,470
Wipe it off.

651
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,800
What?

652
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,340
These are my favourite shoes.

653
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,310
If you don't want to clean
them, it's 500 dollars.

654
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:30,280
What? You're the one
who stuck your foot out.

655
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,190
Cut the excuses!

656
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,320
What's all this commotion?

657
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,760
This guy just came out of nowhere.

658
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,370
You too. Cut the excuses!

659
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,500
Enough!

660
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,240
Don't cause a scene out here.

661
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,070
Bring that jerk upstairs.

662
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,980
If you're going to run, now's your chance.

663
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,680
Now that...

664
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,610
is a very original excuse.

665
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:06,650
- Drag that jerk upstairs, now!
- Yes, sir!

666
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,190
I'll go myself.

667
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,130
Gosh, I wanna be like him.

668
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,500
He's amazing.

669
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,870
If I go on a diet... He took
them out in five seconds.

670
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,510
More like three seconds.

671
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:34,510
We don't go easy on people
who cause trouble in our territory.

672
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,650
And who exactly is it
that won't go easy on me?

673
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,120
Because it sure doesn't look like it's you.

674
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:41,990
Where's your boss?

675
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,150
- What?
- Goodness.

676
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,590
You think our boss would
bother meeting a punk like you?

677
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,790
I guess you don't get to
see him much either, right?

678
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,430
Kageyama!

679
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,080
Today's his big debut,

680
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,480
and you're the perfect warm-up.

681
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,150
Five minutes.

682
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:11,350
Last five minutes,

683
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,650
you get a new pair of those
precious shoes of yours.

684
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,920
If you don't,

685
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:20,360
you'll spend the rest of
your life in a hospital bed.

686
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,040
Looks like you're raring
to go. You're not scared?

687
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,560
Why so cold, guys?

688
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,840
Driver Kim will be all right, won't he?

689
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,580
What? Is it going to end this easily?

690
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,390
Stop it! Stop!

691
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,750
That idiot!

692
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,830
It got dirty.

693
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,880
But at the end of the day,
what completes the look...

694
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,210
is the face.

695
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,670
Tell your boss.

696
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,270
To buy me new shoes,

697
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,870
and when he does,

698
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:32,840
have him call me here.

699
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:09,010
My deepest apologies.

700
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,520
Some psycho suddenly went on a rampage,

701
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,250
so we were unable to select the bodyguards.

702
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,350
He's the one who tore up the gym.

703
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,960
And why?

704
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,260
He claimed someone spat on his shoes.

705
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:38,940
Tell your boss.

706
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:41,980
To buy me new shoes,

707
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,080
and when he does,

708
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,220
have him call me here.
