00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,280
Ting,

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,680
why are you getting yourself dirty

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,840
like a kid?

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,639
Ting, wait for me here.

7
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,560
(Xiaoxiao, I know the goodness
of a younger man now.)

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,360
(Daily younger makeup for beginner)
(Put on makeup to look younger now.)

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,520
(Tease him and make him fall in love.)

10
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:16,680
Ting.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,040
This is...

12
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,760
(She must be his younger sister.)

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,120
Hello, Tingting.

14
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,720
I'm Lulu's girlfriend.

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,519
I'm Xinxin.

16
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,839
Lulu always mentions you to me.

17
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,400
I didn't know that you're so pretty.

18
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,440
Thank you.

19
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:38,319
I've just finished my class.

20
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,599
Lulu told me you're hanging out here

21
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,000
so he asked me to come.

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,120
Tingting, do you mind?

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,080
I don't mind.

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,199
I need to start working.

25
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,839
Ting.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,160
What's wrong with your makeup?

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,239
The blush is too young
and not suitable for you.

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,000
It looks like a monkey's bottoms.

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
Did I say something wrong?

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,239
Don't be angry.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,559
I'm sorry, Ting.

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,239
She's young and she runs her mouth.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,599
No worries.

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Ting, let me help you with the makeup.

35
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,639
No need.

36
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,160
Let's go. Don't worry.

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,119
Lulu, wait for us here.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,320
Go ahead.

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,240
Tingting,

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,039
you didn't know that
Lulu has a girlfriend, right?

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,320
Don't get it wrong.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,639
It's okay.

43
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,360
You're not the first one anyway.

44
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,479
I'm already used to it.

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,039
Lulu treats everyone well.

46
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,440
That's how he is.

47
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,279
But if you take it seriously,

48
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,800
then you're wrong.

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,919
What's wrong?

50
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,639
Did I say something wrong again?

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,039
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,360
I need to get back to work.

53
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,199
(Today is the most embarrassing day)

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,039
(in my life.)

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,479
Ting!

56
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,240
Ting!

57
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,160
Where are you going?

58
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,440
Where's Xinxin?

59
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,720
Lu Yuanyu.

60
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,279
Where did you start
going out with Xinxin?

61
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,160
Half a year ago.

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,960
What's wrong?

63
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,080
Why didn't you tell me?

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,919
You didn't ask.

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
(So, it's my fault?)

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,520
(You have a girlfriend)

67
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,600
(and you're showing me care.)

68
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,600
Fine.

69
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,000
Let me ask you.

70
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,279
What did I promise you the other night?

71
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,600
Play the game with me.

72
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,839
You took my phone

73
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,039
and made it to the last level.

74
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,960
I asked you if you can teach me
how to play the game.

75
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,000
You said you'll tag me in your team

76
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,679
and introduce me to
the top three players.

77
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,440
You should've told me earlier.
I got it all wrong.

78
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:45,720
Tell you earlier?

79
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,679
Forget it. Forget what I said.

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,559
Here you go. It's hot.

81
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:57,839
All right.

82
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,119
You didn't like Lu Yuanyu, did you?

83
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,000
No need to feel sad about it.

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,559
If you keep drinking,

85
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,839
you'll only get more sorrowful.

86
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,559
Smile.

87
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,240
Come on.

88
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,880
Eat the skewer.

89
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,679
I thought

90
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,079
he's a pure and innocent boy,

91
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,519
but he actually

92
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,160
treats everyone well

93
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,359
even when he's having a girlfriend.

94
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,440
I was fooled,

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,040
but why did I become the mistress?

96
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
I didn't expect that Lu Yuanyu

97
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,519
is just like the mutton skewer.

98
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,320
He's dirty and smelly.

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,480
I know Lu Yuanyu

100
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:42,880
is not reliable.

101
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,799
Tingting, dating a younger boy
is not an issue.

102
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,480
The issue is whether

103
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,040
this younger boy wants to be
with you or not,

104
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:50,920
and do you

105
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
want to spend time and effort

106
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,839
to let him grow up?

107
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,640
But now, the issue is,

108
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,679
Lu Yuanyu is used to

109
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,119
crossing the boundary

110
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,640
and he couldn't be careless about you.

111
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,480
On the other hand,

112
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,679
you just want to know who kissed you

113
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,320
and you have no time to
wait for Lu Yuanyu.

114
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,959
So, you two are not meant
to be together.

115
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes, it's my fault.

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,239
I want to find that person

117
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,359
who kissed me so badly,

118
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,720
so I was expecting

119
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,839
something from Lu Yuanyu.

120
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

121
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,440
No.

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,239
I should blame

123
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,000
the person who kissed me.

124
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,399
If he had told me that he did it,

125
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,119
I wouldn't have been tortured
for so long.

126
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,200
It's just a kiss.

127
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,679
Is it that important?

128
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,279
To someone who has never dated before,

129
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,760
the first kiss means
the beginning of romance.

130
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,359
Of course it's important.

131
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,519
Look at me.

132
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:43,880
It's just started

133
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,000
and it's gone.

134
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,480
But the problem now is that

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,239
we have suspected everyone around you.

136
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,720
Who else could it be?

137
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,959
I have no idea.

138
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,600
My head aches when I think about it.

139
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,679
Why is the skewer
getting harder to chew?

140
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,720
It's full of muttony taste.

141
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,760
Tingting,

142
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,920
why not I get you a cake?

143
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:21,640
Let's eat.

144
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,760
It's heavenly.

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,720
As long as you like it.

146
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,160
I remember that you liked to
eat cake since you were little.

147
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,720
You'd get very happy

148
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,119
for eating cake.

149
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,359
So, I ate it with you every day.

150
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,200
Our bodies are the same.

151
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,519
We won't get fat for eating.

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,440
After I opened the homestay,

153
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,640
I opened this bakery.

154
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,040
Then I realised

155
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,519
I don't like to eat cake.

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
I like watching you smile.

157
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,160
When I grow up,

158
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:10,519
I want to open the biggest bakery
in the world.

159
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,320
I'll only make nice cakes for you.

160
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,399
You're lying.

161
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:17,040
Let's make a deal
if you don't believe me.

162
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,079
It's a deal.

163
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,040
Why did you make it so emotional?

164
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,559
Tingting.

165
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,640
Do you remember that I said

166
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,839
I know who kissed you?

167
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,160
Weren't you just joking?

168
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,959
What if I told you

169
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,760
