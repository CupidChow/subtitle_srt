(He Rang,
do you know where Tingting is?)

6
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,439
Is it here?

7
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,080
Yes.

8
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:04,919
Tingting!

00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:06,279
Tingting!

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,080
Tingting!

00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,599
Tingting!

00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,080
Tingting!

Tingting!

(Lu Bai)

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,400
Is there a CCTV?

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:39,839
Yes.

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,559
That direction.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,319
There are two paths.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,199
Each of us takes one.

26
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:56,599
Let's go.

Tingting.

Master!

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,240
It's okay.

35
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:48,279
I was frightened.

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,600
It's okay.

37
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,880
I'm here.

38
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,279
Don't be scared.

39
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,199
Master, why are you here?

40
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,160
I called you, but you didn't pick up.

41
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,279
I was worried about you.

42
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,960
Let's go home.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,479
Come on.

44
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,080
Be careful.

45
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:18,000
Your head.

46
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,000
What's wrong?

47
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,000
It's okay. I think I run too much

48
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,480
that there are blisters on my feet.

49
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,679
It's okay. Let's go.

50
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,279
That's the person who was after me.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,640
Hold it right there!

52
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,359
Don't be scared.

53
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,600
I don't mean ill.

54
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,920
I'm the reporter from
an entertainment channel, Tang Dou.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,160
I was chasing after you to
get a chance to interview you.

56
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,279
I didn't know I'd have frightened you.

57
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,640
Are you really
an entertainment reporter?

58
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,799
No entertainment reporter
would run and chase after someone.

59
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,200
No entertainment reporter
would talk like that.

60
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
I'm a newbie.

61
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,720
I've learned this interview skill
from my master.

62
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,200
I'm sorry to have frightened you.

63
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,119
Here's my name card.

64
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,079
Do you know tracking us
and taking photos of us are illegal?

65
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,679
If you really want to look for Tingting,

66
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,200
you can contact her in a proper manner.

67
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm sorry

68
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,720
to have troubled you.

69
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
If you're willing to take the interview,

70
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,920
you can contact me anytime.

71
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:39,600
I'm leaving now.

72
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,359
She's a cute girl,

73
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,440
but why is she interviewing
people like that?

74
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,519
She's caused me to run
for the whole night.

75
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,040
It's frightened me.

76
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:56,760
It's okay now.

77
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:09,519
Tingting,

78
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,679
are you considering about
the work planning after this?

79
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,760
I'll do Ultimate Kiss well first

80
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,720
to gain experience.

81
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,600
I hope I have the chance to plan
a few more

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,519
Otome games.

83
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,720
Have you thought about studying overseas

84
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,000
or working in our overseas branch?

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,279
My family and friends are all here.

86
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,760
My English is poor.

87
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,519
I think overseas is not for me.

88
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,239
Master,

89
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,799
why are you asking this suddenly?

90
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,079
Something

91
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,119
might sound meaningless now,

92
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,679
but if I don't tell you now,

93
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,079
maybe I'll never have
the chance anymore.

94
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,239
Tingting.

95
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,160
Actually, I...

96
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:01,640
Tingting!

97
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,160
Tingting.

98
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,000
Tingting.

99
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:13,239
Are you okay, Tingting?

100
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,559
I'm okay.

101
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,279
Is your leg okay?

102
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,119
It's okay.

103
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,320
I've sprained my leg accidentally.

104
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,000
It's good that you're okay.

105
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,079
It looks serious.

106
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,160
Shall we go to the hospital?

107
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,839
It's not that serious.

108
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,640
Thank you.

109
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:30,880
It's okay.

110
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:32,440
It's a false alarm.

111
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,600
Go home now.

112
