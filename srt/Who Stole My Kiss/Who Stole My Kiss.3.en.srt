Go now.

00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,280
Chase him away?

5
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:17,559
Sure.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,479
Who are you?

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,120
Won't you leave seeing how close we are?

8
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,040
Why are you wearing suit?

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,079
Are you a property agent?

10
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,360
Or an insurance agent?

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,319
My goodness.

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,639
Didn't we grow up together?

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,639
Can't you understand what I said?

14
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,680
He's my master.

15
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,680
My master who taught me everything.

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,159
We're talking about business.
What are you doing?

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,040
But I...

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,159
No buts.

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,959
Just leave

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,200
and that's all I need.

21
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:42,799
Go.

22
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:50,919
Master.

23
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,759
He's just a friend.

24
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,840
Don't mind him.

25
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,680
Well, what you were saying?

26
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,360
What happened

27
00:00:57,919 --> 00:00:58,599
last night?

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,440
Take a look.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,319
It's recorded?

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,559
It was amazing last night.

31
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,279
Many colleagues recorded it.

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,519
Amazing?

I'm inexperienced.)

(Shouldn't I be shy?)

35
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,720
Don't do this

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,639
anymore next time.

37
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,360
Master,

38
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,519
it's actually

39
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:31,760
a way to express feelings.

40
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:33,000
There's nothing to be shy.

41
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,040
I was not shy, was I?

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,839
Just get used to it.

43
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,400
Watch the video first.

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,680
Thank you, everyone.

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,959
Great!

Tingting.

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Stop drinking. You're drinking too much.

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,639
No way.

50
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,919
I need to thank everyone.

51
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,080
You're drinking too much.

52
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,959
Awesome.

53
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,160
Everyone saw it?

54
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,839
No wonder I felt like

55
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,600
everyone in the office was acting weird.

56
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,399
It's so embarrassing.

57
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,279
Don't worry.

58
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,839
Just pretend like nothing happened.

59
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,960
But master,

60
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,160

61
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,000
It's okay.

62
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,320
It's given by someone else.

Drink lesser next time.

00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,399
Focus more on your work.

You didn't need to be

68
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,199
asked by Kelly and not able to answer.

Qin Mochi?

75
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:13,759
Come here.

76
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,520
Why are you here in our office?

77
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,160
You didn't contact me.

78
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,440
So I had to come and look for you.

79
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,320
What do you mean?

80
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,199
Have you forgotten about

81
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,520
what happened that night?

82
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,440
It doesn't matter.

83
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:35,440
I can do it with you all over again.

84

Can't a celebrity date a normal person?

87
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Be confident.

88
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,160
I think

89

he's just a celebrity
that's not famous anymore.

What do you know?

91
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,440
He's handsome and that beats everything.

Tingting,

93
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:54,279
you won't get so lucky every day.

Seize the opportunity

95
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,600
and grab Qin Mochi.

(Qin Mochi)

Are you busy?

98
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,000
Did you see the gift that I gave you?

Open it and see.

102
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,720
You sit down for so long every day.

Your neck must be in pain.

104

The massager is therapeutic.

105

Remember to use it every day.

Thank you.

107

No worries.

Are you free tonight?

I booked the corner seats
