3
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,079
Ting, you're a patient.

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:27,959
I have to take care of you.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,639
Let me do this.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,799
I'll bring you back to your room.

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,840
What's true love?

8
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,200
It's doing things that

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,159
he doesn't know for you.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,720
He doesn't know how to cook,

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,439
but he cooked for the first time
for you.

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,479
Are you sure he's not trying
to destroy the kitchen?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,119
There's no perfect love.

14
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:02,159
Everyone needs to grow.

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,199
Love is the same.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,800
Trust me.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,800
Give the cute boy a chance.

18
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:11,800
He'll surprise you.

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,279
I can't give him a chance now.

20
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,000
I have a meeting tomorrow.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,360
I have no time

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,440
for a romance relationship.

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,559
Look at my PPT.

24
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,720
I must not give Kelly a chance

25
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,400
to pick on me tomorrow.

26
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:27,199
I thought you were just inexperienced

27
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,319
and lacked of business sense

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,239
that you only know how to create
some plots and interactions.

29
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:31,959
It seems to me now

30
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,440
you can't even do this well.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,680
Is this about a younger boy
dating an older woman?

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,599
It's more like mother and son.

33
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:41,760
More like a stepmother.

34
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:45,559
Why not you just change it
to Stepmother's Love?

35
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,839
Is it funny?

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,559
But the younger boy is a boy.

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,120
He can't be manly.

38
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,919
A boy is still a male.

39
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,760
Well, you know nothing about

40
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,599
the goodness of a younger man
at your age.

41
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,000
Do it again.

42
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Show me next Monday.

43
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,160
Ting.

44
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,520
Don't be sad.

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,839
It has nothing to do with you.

46
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,360
It's my problem.

47
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,279
It's my fault that I didn't take
good care of you yesterday.

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,600
If I didn't burn the rice,

49
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,000
you would've been prepared well
for the meeting today.

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,279
Ting, let's work overtime this weekend.

51
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,000
I promise I won't cause you trouble.

52
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:43,160
Okay.

53
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,360
Lu Yuanyu, is the address correct?

54
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,039
There's no cafe at this floor.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,160
Guess who I am.

56
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,199
There's a prize to it.

57
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,440
Stop it.

58
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,360
It's fine if you don't want to guess.

59
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,240
Here's a dog for you.

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,199
Do you like it?

61
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,240
Let's go.

62
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,279
Where are we going?

63
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,279
The amusement arcade.

64
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,080
Let's go.

65
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,479
Aren't we here to amend the proposal?

66
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,440
Why are we going
to the amusement arcade?

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,160
Ting.

68
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,759
Learn to relax

69
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,000
and change your mood.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,080
Making full preparation will not
delay your job but quicken the process.

71
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:22,919
Let's go.

72
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,199
Let's go.

73
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,320
Listen to me. Let's go.

74
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,520
Ting, try it.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,320
Isn't this a kids' game?

76
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,759
How long have you not been a kid?

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,600
Try it.

78
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,440
The difference between a kid
and an adult is

79
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,199
a kid would just make himself happy

80
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,199
and an adult will try to
make others happy.

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,000
Ting, don't think too much.

82
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,559
Just make yourself happy.

83
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:55,199
Come on.

84
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,880
We must amend the proposal
after playing this.

85
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,039
Okay, I'm done. Let's go.

86
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,799
We should play Whac-A-Mole like this.

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
We must be serious.

88
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,519
Let me do it myself.

89
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,799
Hold my bag.

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
I'll just amend the proposal.

91
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,160
Just keep torturing me.

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,959
Here.

93
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,040
Anymore?

94
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,720
Let's do it again.

95
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,760
Ting.

96
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,760
Thank you.

97
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,920
You're welcome.

98
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,279
I think you're right.

99
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,720
I need to relax.

100
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,720
I haven't been so happy
after a long while.

101
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,079
Everyone has stress.

102
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,119
We just need to release it.

103
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,839
That's why I always go to
the amusement arcade.

104
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,959
I'll be refreshed after that.

105
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,480
You're just a kid.

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,559
Why would you be stressful?

107
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,160
My stress is that

108
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,279
you all keep calling me a kid.

109
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,359
You all feel that
I'm immature, unreliable,

110
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,040
and playful.

111
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,839
But I really want to prove that

112
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,799
I'm not.

113
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,679
So,

114
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,239
I want to work harder and try harder.

115
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,600
I trust you.

116
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,480
