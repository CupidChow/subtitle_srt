(Haiyuting)

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,200
You've finally come out here.

6
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,719
Why are you here?

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,440
Didn't you post it
on your Moment last night?

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
You said you can't fall asleep.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,200
I'm afraid that you might be late.

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,040
That's why I came to pick you up.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,319
(I couldn't fall asleep because of you.)

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,680
I think riding this is dangerous.

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,799
I'm a bit scared.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,360
I'll take the subway.

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,080
Thank you.

16
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:45,919
Hold it right there.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,119
Come back.

18
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,040
Wait.

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,319
I can do this.

20
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,760
You looked good.

21
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:20,720
Let's go.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,000
Otherwise, we'll be late.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,080
Since I'm here to pick you up,

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,919
just come with me.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,360
Also, if you don't,

26
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,559
your salary will be deducted
for being late.

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,760
Ting, hurry up.

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,839
Hold tight.

29
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:44,519
Let's go!

30
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,959
How was it?

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,639
Did I ride well?

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,879
Your bike is small.

33
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,639
Don't ride so fast and drift.

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,319
I was so scared.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,559
My head aches, too.

36
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,800
Let me rest for a while.

37
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,759
(Kids are unreliable.)

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800

Ting.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,039
Why are you here again?

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,039
Drink this plant milk.

44
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,960
When you were not around in the office,

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,759
I took over your job temporarily.

46
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,320
There are a few new interactions.

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,960
Let's discuss about it.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,520
All right.

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,399
First of all,

50
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,160
the female protagonist's hair
is put down.

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,960
The male protagonist helps her
to tie it up.

52
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,360
Then

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,080
shall we do it now?

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,160
Stop.

55
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,520
We'll need to submit
the proposal tomorrow.

56
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,880
We need to be hurry.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,080
Didn't we try it out

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,039
for the previous proposal

59
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,919
and we decided to proceed

60
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,320
after we both agreed with it?

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,520
(I don't care about other days.)

62
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:27,639
(If I continue to have
close contact with him,)

63
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,960
(will he fall in love with me?)

64
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,479
(Am I that charming?)

65
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,800
Ting.

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,800
Did I make you angry?

67
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,880
You've been being cold to me

68
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,080
ever since we met today.

69
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,080
Don't think too much.

70
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,279
I'm just...

71
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,839
Ting, are you okay?

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm okay.

73
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,160
I'll be fine after drinking hot water.

74
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,520
What's going on?

75
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,479
She's not feeling well

76
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,479
and she caught a cold on her way here.

77
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,320
I think she's weak now.

78
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,479
Let me send her home.

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,080
It's okay.

80
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,880
Mr. Lu, I know where Ting stays.

81
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,119
Ting.

82
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,440
Ting, you're up.

83
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,679
Why am I at home?

84
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,760
You fainted suddenly.

85
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,880
I sent you back here.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,399
I know you have lactose intolerance,

87
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,799
so I made a glass of milk with ginger
for you using

88
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,559
plant milk.

89
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,600
Drink while it's hot.

90
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:47,519
(Is he trying to show me
that he's responsible)

91
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,519
(and he's good at taking care of me?)

92
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,000
(No way.)

93
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,600
(I must quickly)

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,760
(kill his passion.)

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,480
Ting.

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,839
Ting.

97
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,279
Thank you.

98
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,200
I'm fine now.

99
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,519
Get back to work.

100
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,720
My roommate is about to come home.

101
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,559
No way.

102
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,119
You're so weak now.

103
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,559
How can I leave you alone here?

104
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,359
What do you want to eat?

105
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,359
Tell me

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,640
and I'll cook for you.

107
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,399
You're a kid. You don't know
how to take care of others.

108
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,200
Get back to work.

109
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,799
I'm going to take care of you.

110
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,040
Also, I'm few years younger than you.

111
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,559
It just shows that I'm unlucky

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,880
and I was born later than you,

113
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,600
but it doesn't mean I know nothing.

114
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,640
There is something

115
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,720
I know better than you do.

116
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,000
You must be hungry.

117
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,040
Let me cook for you.

118
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,720
What smell is that?

119
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,399
Ting,

120
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,559
why did you come down?

121
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you trying to destroy the kitchen?

122
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,760
I'm cooking for the first time.

123
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,920
Who knows it'd get burnt so quickly?

124
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,480
You were so confident just now.

125
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,920
I thought you know how to cook.

126
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,440
It's choking me.

127
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,880
Open the window.

128
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,480
Stop doing anything.

129
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,119
Let me do it.

130
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:51,799
Stop moving.

131
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,279
Let me do it.

132
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:52,880
It's okay.

133
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,480
Let me do it.

134
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,839
It's okay.

135
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,440
Ting, let me do it.

136
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,920
Let me do it.

137
