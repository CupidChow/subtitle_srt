00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:23,719
What's wrong?

00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:24,879
It's hot?

He Rang.

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,200
We can only be friends.

7
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:44,200
I think it's not hot.

8
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,000
You think it's cold?

9
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:46,919
I'll get another bowl for you.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,599
I was indeed too childish.

11
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:52,240
I thought

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,119
kissing someone will make me like him.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
That's why I kept looking

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,319
for the person who kissed me.

15
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,200
I thought that's how

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,319
I can start a relationship.

17
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,799
But I only know today that

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,720
it's not.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
They are two different matters.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,400
He Rang.

21
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,239
When you told me that

22
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,800
you're the person who kissed me,

23
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:14,680
I was very confused.

24
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,239
I felt that it's weird.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,199
I can feel it in my heart that

26
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:22,400
the person I like is not you,

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,839
but...

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,000
But I have no reason to reject you.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,400
Because if I've rejected you,

30
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,440
it means I've ruined

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,919
all the logic that I had.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,319
I've never been in a relationship.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,120
I don't know how the feeling of love is.

34
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:40,839
I don't even know

35
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,319
what kind of person I'd like.

36
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,199
Moreover,

37
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,720
I might have fallen in love with someone

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,639
and I didn't realise it.

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,040
He Rang,

40
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,879
you're my best friend.

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,239
I apologise to you for my foolishness

42
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,239
has hurt you.

43
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,239
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,520
I know I should've

45
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,000
told you earlier,

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,919
but I...

47
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,279
I might have realised that

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,639
I'm not able to

49
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,800
face this situation.

50
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:25,000
Because I know the moment I say this,

51
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,559
I might have lost you forever.

52
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,520
I wouldn't have pursued you

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
if I knew I'd be so embarrassing.

54
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,520
It's not your fault.

55
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,880
It's not my fault either.

56
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,440
We're both not at fault.

57
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,440
Loving someone

58
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,080
is not wrong.
