Are you afraid to be alone with me
in a room

You're

so young. What are you even thinking?

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,440
Go home now.

00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,239
Sure, I'm leaving now.

I respect the company's decision.

Qin Mochi can be the ambassador,

40

but to maintain the game's quality,

41

the overall storyline

can't be changed according
to what you said.

Also,

44
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,839
it's Tingting's idea.

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,240
Even if we want to amend it,

46
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,320
Tingting should be the one in charge.

47

She has resigned.

48
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,800
There's no point talking about this.

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,039
I really don't want the company to lose

50
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,440
an excellent game planner.

51
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,520
I thought you don't want to lose

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,559
an office lover.

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,240
Are you Kelly?

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,080
Who are you?

55
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
I'm Han Tingting's...

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,839
best friend.

57
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,800
Why did you take away her project?

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,320
Don't you know that's her original idea?

59
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,639
Do you know how much effort
she has put in it?

60
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,520
She's so charming.

61
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,320
Not even Mr. Lu is supporting her,

62
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,279
even her best friend is here.

63
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
Let me tell you,
Han Tingting's best friend.

64
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,960
She's a staff here.

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,479
All her creativity
belongs to the company.

66
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,639
She chose to resign.

67
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,759
It has nothing to do with me.

68
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,839
Get the security here.

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,759
I'm not here to cause any trouble.

70
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:12,880
What do you mean?

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,880
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,839
I know you don't like Tingting
all this while,

73
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,320
but she's really a kind person.

74
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,440
If she has offended you in any way,

75
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
I apologise to you on her behalf.

76
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,279
No need.

77
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:35,600
Yes, it's necessary.

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Tingting has always been wanted
to become a game planner.

79
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,359
This is her first project

80
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,720
and it's very important to her.

81
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
It's because of this project

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,200
that she got to know

83
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,799
many unexpected people and matters.

84
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,320
You think resigning means
getting another job,

85
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,600
but to her,

86
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:52,480
it means she has to bid farewell

87
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,720
to all her efforts in the past.

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,839
It's too mean to her.

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,600
So touching.

90
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,640
But this is not something I can decide.

91
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,679
She chose to resign.

92
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,640
She can also stay to amend the proposal.

93
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,480
If you like to advise people,

94
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,399
go back and advise her.

95
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,679
I'm sorry, sir.

96
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,480
Please leave, sir.

97
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,399
I'm sorry, sir.

98
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:18,440
Don't move!

99
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:19,600
- Sir.
- Please leave, sir.

100
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,279
Don't move, sir.

101
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,519
- Sir.
- Don't touch me!

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,480
Please leave, sir.

103
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,839
Go away!

104
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,200
You...

105
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,040
Sir.

106
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,320
Calm down. Please leave, sir.

107
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,519
Move.

108
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,559
Sir, are you okay?

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,200
Sir, are you okay?

110
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,079
Hello, Mr. Wang.

111
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,040
Check on Kelly for me.

112

(I'm just throwing rubbish here.)

113
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,920
(No one should be able to recognise me.)

114
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,959
The rubbish bin is so far away.

115
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,519
(Why is she wearing like this
when it's so warm?)

116

(If it's Qin Mochi's fan,)

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,239
I'm not.

121
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,720
You're Han Tingting.

122

Why did you frame Qin Mochi?

123
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,440
Don't you feel guilty doing this?

124
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,320
Talk to me.
