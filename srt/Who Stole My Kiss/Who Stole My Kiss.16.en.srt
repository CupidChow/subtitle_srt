3
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,319
I'm going to the toilet.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,840
She must be shy.

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,720
(That's weird.)

6
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,759
(We've kissed once before.)

7
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:13,120
(I'm still not used to it.)

8
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,519
(Tingting, the movie is about to end.)

9
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,879
(I'm going back now.)

10
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,239
Got it, Mr. Guo.

11
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,599
I'll send the information to you
right away.

12
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,480
You must have waited for a long time.

13
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:40,480
No.

14
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,120
Miss Kelly.

15
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,480
What a coincidence that
you're here for a movie as well.

16
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:02,720
What a coincidence.

17
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,199
I think I saw you and...

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,239
We just happened to meet each other

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,879
so we greeted each other.

20
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,240
Kelly.

21
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:13,720
I'm not sure
if I should say this or not.

22
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,080
Qin Mochi is not the kind of person

23
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,800
who treats someone well for no reason.

24
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,919
Han Tingting.

25
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,919
Do you think saying this to humiliate me

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,000
is meaningful?

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,039
I think you dare not admit it.

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,639
Or you're getting more thick-skinned?

29
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,800
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:34,559
Excuse me.

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,440
You two should solve your issues
on your own.

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,679
I won't get involved.

33
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,559
See you.

34
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:52,320
Han Tingting.

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Can you stop disturbing my life?

36
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,000
I think you're scared of being exposed.

37
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,919
You're using the same trick
for the second time.

38
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,440
Do you really think the way
you're hyping yourself up

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,440
is smart?

40
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,600
What do you mean?

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,119
Seems like you've forgotten

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,199
how you were pretending to be pity

43
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:08,839
and asked me to take the blame for you.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,399
If I told Kelly all these,

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,759
do you think

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,919
you can get any resources
from our company?

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,360
Let's go.

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,080
Let's talk at another place.

49
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,559
Follow me.

50
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,600
Let me go!

51
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,119
Let's go!

52
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,160
Apologise!

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,479
What does it have to do with you?

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,360
You know what

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,240
you've done to Tingting!

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,839
Enough, He Rang.

57
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,399
Let's not talk to him.

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,039
Move aside!

59
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,759
Stop fighting!

60
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,240
Stop fighting! Qin Mochi, stop fighting!

61
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:44,639
Stop fighting!

62
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,440
Move aside!

63
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,399
Enough!

64
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,559
Stop fighting!

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,199
Come on!

66
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,119
Calm down!

67
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:12,839
Come on!

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,399
Enough, He Rang!

69
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,000
Stop fighting!

70
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,160
Move aside!

71
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,640
Okay, everyone.

72
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,799
Stop looking.

73
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,640
Leave now.

74
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,200
It's okay now. Leave.

75
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,359
Stop gathering here.

76
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,480
You were not cleared
from the previous incident.

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,440
If this fight is on
the trending news again,

78
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,119
your career in the showbiz is done.

79
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,160
What?

80
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,600
Are we done talking here?

81
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
Enough, He Rang.

82
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,839
So many people are taking photos.

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
If this matter elevates,

84
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,119
Tingting will be affected.

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,519
Master, thank you.

86
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,359
Don't worry.

87
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,160
Qin Mochi knows how
serious this matter is.

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
He won't make it public.

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,399
Also,

90
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,399
next time when you see
someone fighting,

91
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,880
don't just run into it recklessly.

92
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,040
Mr. Lu.

93
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:12,079
What a coincidence that you were
there to save her just now.

94
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,279
Why do we see you every time?

95
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,959
Were you following us on purpose?

96
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,160
What are you talking about?

97
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,079
Mr. Lu!

98
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,799
Mr. Zhang.

99
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,079
Let me introduce.

100
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,200
Han Tingting,

101
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,720
Ultimate Kiss's main planner.

102
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,799
Mr. Zhang,

103
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,959
Fengqi Investment Company's CEO.

104
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,320
Mr. Zhang's movie is screening today.

105
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,679
I was invited to come.

106
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,119
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

107
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,720
You're Miss Han Tingting.

108
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,399
Hello.

109
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,519
Mr. Lu always talks about you.

110
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:44,519
He said that you're talented
in planning games.

111
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,399
I've seen your proposal

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,399
for Ultimate Kiss.

113
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,440
You're creative.

114
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
If you're thinking of making it a movie,

115
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,880
we're willing to collaborate with you.

116
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:55,920
Really?

117
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,679
That's great.

118
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,519
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

119
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,559
Tingting, enjoy yourselves.

120
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,760
Okay. See you.

121
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,559
Mr. Zhang, see you.

122
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,040
You were quite rude just now.

123
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,480
Master has helped us

124
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,279
and you said things like that.

125
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,320
Was he helping you

126
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,640
or was he trying to
make you admire him more?

127
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:15,760
What do you mean?

128
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,040
Did you two have any grudges before?

129
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
I just don't want you two

130
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,720
to get too close.

131
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,720
Let me see.

132
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,399
I'm fine.
