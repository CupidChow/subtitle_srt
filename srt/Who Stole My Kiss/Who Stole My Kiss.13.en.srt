00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,079
Xiaoxiao.

00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:21,280
Xiaoxiao.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,079
What's wrong?

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,680
Why did you come back alone?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,399
I've found the person who kissed me.

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,559
Weren't you at the dessert shop?

9
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,479
How did you find him?

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,200
He Rang.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,920
He Rang is at the dessert shop.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,959
Tell me who the person is first.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,720
He Rang.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,880
If you want He Rang to be here,

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,720
I'll go get him now.

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,319
He Rang?

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,599
He Rang.

18
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,919
He Rang?

19
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:44,360
He Rang.

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,240
He Rang, it's all your fault.

21
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,680
You've confessed in a hurry.

22
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,400
Do you know you've frightened her?

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,680
No.

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,440
It's Tingting's fault.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,040
It's all because that Tingting

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,839
has made the atmosphere like that.

27
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,839
I had to confess or it will be too late.

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,440
Tingting.

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,559
What are you thinking?

30
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,279
I'm so tired, Tingting.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,239
Tingting.

32
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,800
How can I even think?

33
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,160
After he told me that,

34
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,559
my mind went blank.

35
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,160
I had to find an excuse

36
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:35,000
to come home quickly.

37
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,199
No wonder He Rang always changes
his girlfriends.

38
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,760
He has always liked you.

39
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:43,480
What a coincidence.

40
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:46,000
The one who kissed you
is just around you.

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm not listening.

42
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:52,199
What should I do now?

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
He Rang is my best friend.

44
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,760
It will affect our friendship no matter

45
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,400
I accept him or reject him.

46
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,000
What should I do now?

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,080
Just let things be.

48
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,399
Take one step at a time.

49
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:30,479
Good morning.

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,759
Good morning.

51
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,399
Well, Tingting,

52
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,520
I've made breakfast for you.

53
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,399
Why not you eat first?

54
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm running late to work.

55
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,600
Thank you.

56
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,600
Sure.

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,960
Why did you confess suddenly?

58
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,639
You've frightened Tingting.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,679
I can't help

60
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,600
but to finish the breakfast.

61
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,160
You're not allowed to eat.

62
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:07,880
Xiaoxiao.

63
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,039
Why not you read the tarot cards for me?

64
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,839
Sure, but

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,039
I'm hungry.

66
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,700
(Zhuoyuan Gaming Company)

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,080
Ting, let me help you.

68
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:32,880
No need.

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,759
I can do it.

70
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,559
Well, how's the project planning

71
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:39,520
that I asked you to handle?

72
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,559
I've sent it to your email.

73
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,639
But, Ting,

74
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,160
why did you leave

75
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,559
half way that day?

76
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,240
I was not feeling well.

77
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,160
Tingting, Yuanyu,

78
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,080
Mr. Lu asked you

79
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,160
to meet him in the office.

80
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,279
Mr. Lu.

81
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,279
Mr. Lu, are you looking for us?

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,880
We lack of manpower
for League of Legends planning.

83
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,119
We need an intern that's good
at planning strategy video game.

84
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,919
Since Lu's good at

85
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,880
games designed for male,

86
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,040
so I'm sending him there.

87
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,200
Tingting,

88
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,440
you don't have to guide him anymore.

89
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
Great! Thanks, Mr. Lu.

90
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,959
From now now,

91
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,320
I don't have to plan
romance games anymore.

92
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:24,880
Ting.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,640
Thank you for taking care of me.

94
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
All right.

95
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,399
All the best working in that team.

96
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
(Not bad.)

97
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
(He'll be far away from me.)

98
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,079
Since there's no objection,

99
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,720
we'll do it that way.

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,239
Tingting, meet me 15 minutes later

101
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,399
to discuss about the plot
of Ultimate Kiss.

102
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,440
All right.

103
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,760
All the best.

104
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,079
Can we start picking the cards?

105
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,760
Not yet.

106
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,359
Pick now.

107
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,839
Suit of Goblets?

108
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:34,399
It seems like you've done
so much for Tingting.

109
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Be it the good memories

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,959
between you and her

111
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,920
or your expectations
towards your future with her,

112
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,359
I can tell

113
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,839
you can't let go of this relationship.

114
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,079
What should I do?

115
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,239
Xiaoxiao, the guest is
about to be here.

116
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's make it simple.

117
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,480
You're reckless.

118
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,200
No wonder you confessed suddenly.

119
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,839
Magician.

120
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,640
It seems like there's hope

121
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,959
for your relationship with her.

122
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,640
There will be a turning point
if you persist.

123
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,320
Your relationship with her
will improve, too.

124
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:20,000
So, based on the original plot,

125
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:22,679
I've added the twist where
the childhood buddy

126
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,920
has become her boyfriend.

127
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,839
It can refine

128
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,119
the logic of the entire story.

129
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,279
On the other hand,

130
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,119
the character

131
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,200
will be more lively.

132
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,679
However, I'm not too familiar

133
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,200
with this kind of dating mode,

134
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,839
so we need to work

135
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,160
on the details.

136
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,040
Not bad. I think it's good.

137
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,279
Not bad, Han Tingting.

138
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,480
This planning is much better.

139
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,839
The new setting

140
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,160
of childhood buddy becoming boyfriend

141
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,959
can attract

142
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,600
more female users

143
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,839
and they can associate with it.

144
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,959
Kelly, speaking of
childhood buddy becoming boyfriend,

145
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,200
didn't you marry to

146
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,679
your childhood buddy?

147
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,519
You should share with us.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,320
Yes, you should share with us.

149
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,559
Yes, you should share with us.

150
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,000
We're talking about work.

151
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,359
But indeed,

152
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,239
be it getting married or dating,

153
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,160
you'll be happier being

154
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,519
with someone who knows you well.

155
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,799
So, be it childhood buddy
or boyfriend,

156
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,559
(as they've been through
what you've been through,)

157
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,920
(they know your habits)

158
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,160
(and temperament better.)

159
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,760
(After becoming your boyfriend,)

160
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,519
they know better how to

161
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,920
take care of your feelings
and love you.

162
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,000
Tingting.

163
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,480
I'm leaving.

164
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm leaving as well.

165
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,119
Bye.

166
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:55,239
Tingting.

167
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:55,760
Master.

168
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,519
Let's leave together.

169
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Master, you're not
working overtime today?

170
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,279
The project went well today.

171
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,279
