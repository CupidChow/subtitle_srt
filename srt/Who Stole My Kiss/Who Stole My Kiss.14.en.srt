00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:27,639
Hello.

5
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,600
I'm Tingting's landlord
and childhood friend,

6
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,040
He Rang.

7
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:36,720
I'm leaving.

8
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:37,599
Carry on.

9
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:38,639
See you tomorrow.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,119
I'll pick you up every day from now on.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,680
Tingting.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,799
Let's go home.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,839
Why are you not sitting next to me?

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,559
Why did you come to my office today?

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,879
I just come whenever I want to.

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,120
Why not today?

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,639
Tingting, why are we like strangers now?

18
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,360
What do you think?
It's all because of you.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,199
You knew that I've been looking for

20
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:25,400
the person who kissed me.

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,239
Why were you being a coward?

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,160
Even though you think saying it

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,239
will affect our friendship,

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,959
you should've just kept it a secret

25
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,000
and said nothing to me.

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,639
Why did you confess to me

27
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,000
suddenly yesterday for no reason?

28
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,800
Even though you've confessed
to me yesterday,

29
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,959
you can't just come to the office

30
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,080
and look for me like nothing happened.

31
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:44,919
You even said that to my master.

32
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:51,800
I'm sorry, Tingting.

33
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,400
I didn't mean to be a coward.

34
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,680
I just didn't know how
to face my feelings.

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,919
We've known each other for a long time.

36
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm used to taking care of you
and being nice to you.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,559
I take it as the mutual understanding

38
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:11,279
as friends.

39
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,479
Until you started looking for
the person who kissed you.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
You even went for a date
with Lu Bai, Qin Mochi

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,800
and Lu Yuanyu.

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,880
Then I realised I was being jealous

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,279
because...

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,440
Because I was afraid that
you'll fall in love with them.

45
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,479
Why did you confess to me

46
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,240
yesterday suddenly?

47
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,720
Because I hope that
we're getting together

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,880
because we love each other,

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,039
not because of the accident that night.

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,559
When I saw you were troubled

51
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,320
by Lu Yuanyu's matter,

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,960
I can't help but to tell you

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,160
the truth.

54
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,639
He Rang,

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,720
we've known each other
more than 20 years.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,160
Did you wrongly take companion as love?

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,960
It's totally the opposite.

58
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,960
I wrongly took love as a habit.

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,960
Tingting, love is not
necessarily a feeling,

60
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,039
but a responsibility.

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,279
I like you

62
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,080
and I know what to do exactly.

63
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,440
You don't have to be stressed.

64
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,039
Just try to accept me.

65
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,199
I remember when I wanted

66
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,320
to be your friend,

67
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,000
you rejected me

68
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,679
because you said you don't
want to hang out with boys.

69
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,520
Then

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,880
I spent more than 20 years

71
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
to become your buddy.

72
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,839
Now, I'm confessing to you.

73
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,720
You doubt the possibility between us,

74
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:34,399
but I'll use more time to become

75
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,919
the best couple with you.

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,919
Tingting,

77
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,600
are you willing to give me the chance

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,080
to pursue you?

79
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,440
So, you agreed?

80
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:06,039
I was not thinking straight actually,

81
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,960
but when I saw how serious He Rang was,

82
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,639
I felt the peace

83
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,039
for no reason.

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,279
I think

85
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,320
I won't be cheated this time.

86
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,519
Then I agreed for no reason.

87
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,480
The World.

88
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,359
What does it mean?

89
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:32,239
When you got The World
for relationship issue,

90
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,760
it's generally a good sign.

91
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,640
As long as you're willing

92
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,079
to work on the relationship,

93
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,519
it will

94
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,959
be lasting long.

95
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,160
But if you're not willing to,

96
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,239
you'll still meet someone.

97
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,679
In short, it's all up to you.

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,000
You're the key to this relationship

99
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,320
whether it works or not.

100
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,640
He Rang is my best friend

101
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,440
and the person who kissed me.

102
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,600
Logically speaking,

103
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,760
I should treat it seriously.

104
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,880
But I've never been pursued before.

105
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,679
You talked about working on it.

106
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,679
What should I be working on?

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,320
Just enjoy it.
