(Haiyuting)
Xiaoxiao.

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,120
Do I look good?

5
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:17,319
This is good.

6
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:18,840
It matches well. Wear this.

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,200
Don't try to say it for saying's sake.
I can tell.

8
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:21,040
Get me the mirror.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,239
Let me look at my hair.

10
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:26,079
Not bad, right?

11
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:26,479
Not bad.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,319
Xiaoxiao

13
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:28,959
Give me your perfume.

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,319
My perfume?

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,719
That's for ladies.

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,319
What? It's all the same.

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,840
I'm sorry. I woke up late.

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,240
I'll be ready soon.

19
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,240
Let's go.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,319
He Rang, won't you feel hot
wearing that?

21
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:45,880
Tingting,

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,000
you're wearing mask
and your hair is messy.

23
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,880
You are...

24
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:50,959
Too messy?

25
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,880
Lend me your cap.

26
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,360
Okay. Let's go.

27
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,880
You're going out like this?

28
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,319
Don't we usually go out like this?

29
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,559
That's on the normal days.

30
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,160
This is your first date with him.

31
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,120
Let's go.

32
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,160
Let's go.

33
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:21,120
Hold on.

34
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:21,919
I suddenly remember

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,720
I have something important to tell you.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,400
He Rang, wait here.

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,559
We'll be coming down in a few minutes.

38
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:27,400
We'll be quick.

39
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,760
Don't worry.

40
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,239
Wear this.

41
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,319
Don't worry.
You'll look young with this makeup.

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,760
I'll get it done for you
in five minutes.

43
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,160
Stop all these.

44
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,800
I'll be late.

45
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,760
Also, He Rang is not an outsider.

46
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,720
He Rang has seen every side of me.

47
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,279
If he's your buddy,

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,199
you're fine.

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,559
But he's trying to pursue you,

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,959
wearing like this is like telling

51
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,919
him to get lost.

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,040
I don't care who he is,

53
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,680
you need to treat him as an outsider

54
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,000
before you're his girlfriend.

55
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's put on the makeup.

56
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,520
Row number three, the third seat.

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,160
Well...

58
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,000
Be careful.

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,639
Be careful with the staircase.

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,399
Here. This way.

61
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,000
Come on.

62
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,800
Sit down.

63
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,399
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,360
When we were at home,

65
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,759
I was not in the mode of dating.

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,800
No worries.

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,960
I'm ready now.

68
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,039
No worries.

69
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,839
We're inexperienced for the first date.

70
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,399
We'll get used to it.

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,080
What are you doing?

72
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:40,479
Don't you have yours?

73
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,559
(♪Loving you♪)

74
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,479
(I'm sorry.)

75
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,320
(I really love you.)

76
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,200
Tingting,

77
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,480
just cry if you want.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,839
Stop holding in.

79
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,720
Why is the guy so pretentious?

80
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,239
How can the girl take it?

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
I bet RMB 50 that they'll break up.

82
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,959
They're really being together.

83
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
They have known each other
for a long time.

84
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,359
They know how to stay together.

85
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,720
Although others think that

86
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,160
they're better at being friends,

87
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,480
only they know that

88
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,480
they will get together.

89
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,200
