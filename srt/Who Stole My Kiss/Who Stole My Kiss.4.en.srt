I'm just walking around.

Hello.

31
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,599
You're such a pretty planner.

32
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,599
Mochi, since when
have you started dating?

33
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,599
Why didn't you tell me?

34
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,000
We're not dating.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,879
Qin Mochi?

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,839
It's him.

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,080
I'm the reporter from Reap What You Sow.

38
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,879
You're not famous lately.

39
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,040
Have you thought about
changing your field?

40

Girls.

- Is she your girlfriend?
- Stop taking photos.

42

Is she your girlfriend?

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,199
Are you so focusing on dating

44
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,199
that you've neglected your career?

45
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,239
- Stop taking photos.
- You've misunderstood.

46
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:46,919
She's Mochi's assistant.

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,879
She's not his girlfriend.

48
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,279
An assistant won't dress up like her.

49
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:50,319
This gossip is shocked.

50
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,800
Let me take a photo.

51
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,639
Stop taking photos.

52

We'll report the truth as it is.

Trust us.

54

We just need one photo.

55
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,919
Just one photo.

56
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:58,680
Stop taking photos.

Really? Don't lie to us.

61
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,320
Why should I lie to you?

62
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,960
Leave now.

63
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,919
No, you're alone here.

64
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,399
It's fine.

No worries.

I don't disclose it.

That's great.

After all, he's the candidate
for your ambassador.

they might hold prejudice against him.

It won't happen.
