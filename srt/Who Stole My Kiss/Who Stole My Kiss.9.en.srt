00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,719
Hello.

4
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,639
(Ting, you can come back
to the company.)

5
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:29,959
Come back to the company?

6
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,000
Mr. Lu has got the evidence that

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,880
you were framed in the afternoon

8
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:34,040
and given it to the police.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,240
Now, everything has come to light.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,840
(Ting, you can come back to work here.)

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,639
Evidence?

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,919
But, didn't our company decide

13
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:41,840
to collaborate with Qin Mochi

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,040
and make him the ambassador?

15
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,680
That was the leader's plan.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,919
But Mr. Lu

17
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:48,720
has made Qin Mochi's manager

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,919
to tell the truth

19
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:51,799
(and he's got it recorded.)

(The valid evidence)

21
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,599

- Good morning, Ting.
- Good morning.

25
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,519
Not bad, Tingting.

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,720
Ting.

27
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:14,239
Mr. Lu's looking for you.

28
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,279
Master, good morning.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,440
You've got to know the matter, right?

30
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:28,760
Yes.

31
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:30,680
Thank you for helping me.

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,639
At the same time,

33
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:33,800
I'd like to apologise to you.

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,680
I was being impulsive in the cafe
the other day.

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,120
I was too immature.

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,839
I'll consider things from
the company's perspective

37
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:42,480
more often in the future.

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,839
Suspending you

39
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,040
and the endorsement agreement

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,319
were part of the plan.

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,400
I didn't tell you in the beginning

42
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,319
because I wanted to tell you

43
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,080
when everything is solved.

44
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,000
No worries, master.

45
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,360
I've figured it out.

46
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,480
I won't be reckless anymore.

47
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,120
Okay, get back to work.

48
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,120
Master, here are some gifts

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,160
as a token of appreciation.

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,320
Ting.

51
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,639
Congratulations for coming back strong.

52
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,479
This cactus is a gift for you.

53
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,800
If anyone bullies you again,

54
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,279
use the cactus to poke him.

55
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,720
I think you're trying to poke me.

56
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,320
Anyways, thank you.

57
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:33,440
But Ting,

58
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,199
why are you wearing like this today?

59
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,320
I'm changing my fashion style.
What's wrong?

60
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,279
Is it not nice?

61
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,960
You were cuter.

62
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,559
What do you know?

63
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,919
This is called growing up.

64
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,639
You were not around

65
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,639
and I was so lonely as your assistant.

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,880
No one was taking care of me.

67
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:55,919
Thank you for stepping up

68
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,639
for me in the cafe the other day.

69
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,720
I didn't know you acted like a man

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,160
at the critical moment.

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,000
A man

72
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,679
doesn't need muscle and height,

73
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,520
but we must have the attitude.

74
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,080

75
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,000

why are you eating so little?

If we're walking on the street,

others might think
you're my younger sister.

94

I don't have a silly brother like you.

I can't stop you.

100

That night?

101
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,639
What did I do?

102
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,559
You were active and dominating
that night.

103
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,839
You were acting willfully.

104
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,679
You even made me blush.

and starting a sweet relationship.

No way.

121
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,799
He's just a kid.

122
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,480
He knows nothing at all.

123
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,920
I usually take care of him like my son

124
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,480
in the office.

125
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,359
Do you think I can date my son?

126
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,880
Don't refuse it first.

127

and this photo,

131
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,559
it's all the selfie
that he took with you.

132
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:33,600
Look at the company group photo.

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
Who is that standing next to you?

134
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:36,799
It's Lu Yuanyu.

135
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,359
Look at how he looks

136
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,279
at you. So sweet.

137
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
He's so cute.

138
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,959
Won't you consider him?

139
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,880
I can't take it.

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,079
I'll get sick.

141
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,040
Are you sure he's not your type?

142
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
What if he suits you

143
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,160
and won't cause you sick?

144
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,200
But if I'm going out with him,

145
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,480
I'll be his girlfriend, superior,

146

elder sister, mother and maid.

147
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,760
That's five roles.

148
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,640
I'm not Naruto.

149
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,959
He's not Hinata Hyuga either.

150
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,079
It's not worth it for me.

151
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,000
What if the one who kissed you

152
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,040
was Lu Yuanyu? What will you do?

153
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,279
If the one who kissed you was Lu Yuanyu,

154
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,279
I will

155

pretend like I've forgotten it.

156
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,399
As long as I don't admit it,

157
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,040
it's like it has never happened.

158
