00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,039
Be careful.

4
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:18,360
Thank you.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,719
I'm going in now.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,479
Good night.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,760
Rest early.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,280
Your clothes are wet.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,040
Why not I dry it for you?

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,520
Thank you.

11
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:36,080
Well,

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,439
this is a homestay that
my best friend is running.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,319
Another friend of mine
is staying here as well.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,319
After all, you're a celebrity.

15
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,240
I'm afraid it might cause a sensation.

16
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,319
Let me go in and check

17
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:46,200
if they're here.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,680
Okay, no problem.

19
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:48,840
Hold on.

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,319
Xiaoxiao.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,080
He Rang.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,480
Surprise!

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,919
Are you surprised and shocked?

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,959
Happy birthday to you!

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,440
Happy birthday to you!

26
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,319
Happy birthday to you!

27
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:14,919
Tingting.

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,319
He Rang insisted on giving you
a birthday surprise.

29
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,959
I can't stop him.

30
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:21,839
Happy birthday to you!

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,199
Qin Mochi?

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,440
I'm done.

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,480
My image of a wise lady is all gone.

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,919
It's He Rang's bad.

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
If I stay single,

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,680
I'll stay here for free.

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,879
Come on.

38
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,440
Qin Mochi stayed

39
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,720
to celebrate your birthday

40
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,519
and cooked longevity noodles for you.

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,519
It shows that he's serious.

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,400
Really?

43
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:16,600
Hello.

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,399
Welcome to my house.

45
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,559
Thanks for

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,520
having me here.

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,119
(Why did you come?)

48
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,119
I know you.

49
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,080
You're a celebrity.

50
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,800
I remember that you debuted as an actor.

51
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,960
The movie was called
The Four Heroes of Peking.

52
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,039
You played the role of the fifth son.

53
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,600
You died in a few episodes.

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,320
(This guy is an idiot.)

55
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,639
Yes.

56
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,199
I think everyone has

57
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,679
their own career planning.

58
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,880
I prefer

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,160
the feeling on the stage,

60
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,559
so I chose

61
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,919
to become a singer and a dancer.

62
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,360
I support you.

63
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,440
After all, you were not famous

64
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,839
as an actor.

65
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,639
I even advised Tingting

66
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,880
not to pursue a celebrity

67
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
that's not famous,

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,639
right?

69
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,199
I didn't know you're so funny.

70
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,679
When are we going to eat?

71
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,520
- Right away.
- Right away.

72
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,440
Is there anything

73
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,160
special about the noodles?

74
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,839
The noodles are cooked with water.

75
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,039
It's worse than eating oatmeal.

76
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,880
I've cooked your favourite...

77
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,240
Maybe you don't know.

78
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,559
When I was a trainee,

79
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,600
I ate this noodle every day.

80
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,360
I have yet to finish telling you
what I cooked.

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,119
This is Yangcheng Lake's
Chinese mitten crab.

82
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,160
The everyday training was tough.

83
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,360
The company was
very strict with our diet.

84
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,160
So, the most expected thing

85
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,679
after the training

86
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,199
every day

87
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,479
is the noodles cooked with water.

88
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,279
It's simple,

89
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,679
but

90
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,479
it's heartwarming.

91
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,559
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

92
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,880
You're a man with stories.

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,480
My great-grandmother taught me
how to make this dish.

94
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,160
Although...

95
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,239
Tingting.

96
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,399
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,920
I didn't get to

98
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,160
prepare a birthday gift for you.

99
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,559
This

100
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,359
is the lucky bracelet
my mother made for me

101
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,160
for my debut performance.

102
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,359
I hope

103
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,160
you'll be as lucky as me.

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,720
(It won't go wrong this time.)

105
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,880
I'll keep it then.

106
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,279
Actually,

107
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,480
Mochi,

108
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,720
you can say

109
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,679
something now.

110
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,920
You know what I'm going to tell you?

111
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,440
Thank you.

112
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,920
Thank you, Tingting.

113
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm counting on you for

114
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,559
becoming the game ambassador.

115
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,040
The game ambassador?

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,480
Yes.
