3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,600
Miss Kelly.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,120
Did you see the news?

5
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:18,360
Let me explain.

6
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:19,680
I was just about to look for you.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,879
Let's talk in the meeting room.

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,000
This matter went like that.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,719
My friend was trying to protect me
the other day.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,799
He definitely wasn't thinking
of causing trouble.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,200
Mr. Chen, please trust me.

12
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:37,319
What the netizens wrote was fake.

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,240
Qin Mochi and I have nothing
to do with each other.

14
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:40,240
When I met Qin Mochi by chance

15
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:41,360
at the cinema the other day,

16
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,599
Miss Kelly was there as well.

17
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,080
Kelly, what happened?

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,439
We only met by chance the other day.

19
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:49,799
I left after greeting them.

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,520
I'm not sure

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,680
what happened after that.

22
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,639
Han Tingting, as a staff of the company,

23
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,319
you've never earned a dime
for the company

24
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:03,479
and the company has been affected twice.

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,480
Mr. Chen,

26
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:08,360
I was there the other day.

27
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,440
I can testify that

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,360
Han Tingting is telling the truth.

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,879
It doesn't matter anymore.

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,599
The most important thing
is to stop the company's losses.

31
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
We've decided to use

32
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,199
Qin Mochi as the ambassador
of our new game.

33
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,800
So, the setting of the storyline

34
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,040
and the character development

35
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,440
must be amended.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,919
Qin Mochi has become the ambassador?

37
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:34,760
Given the situation,

38
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,440
we have to let him be the ambassador.

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,000
Miss Kelly,

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,080
did you and Qin Mochi...

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,639
Mr. Chen, I have yet

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,680
to tell Han Tingting about this.

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,839
She might need some time
to get used to it.

44
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:01,720
Sure, execute it immediately.

45
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,680
I hope your collaboration

46
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,279
will make a trending game

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,959
and earn some money for the company.

48
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,320
Mr. Chen, see you.

49
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,639
Miss Kelly.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
If we work with people like Qin Mochi,

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,240
the company's benefits will
be compromised.

52
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,479
It doesn't do you any good either.

53
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,360
Han Tingting, you have two options.

54
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,160
Either

55
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,440
you change the character
and the storyline

56
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,839
based on Qin Mochi

57
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,759
or just resign.

58
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,119
We'll get another planner.

59
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,679
Our team has changed the content
many times.

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,960
Why should we change it again?

61
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,679
Kelly, the project is now
in the Alpha testing.

62
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,479
If we get someone to replace Tingting,

63
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,800
it will affect the overall progress.

64
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,440
It was because of her that

65
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,800
our newly launched game

66
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,639
was boycotted by the netizens.

67
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,399
Now, we're collaborating
with Qin Mochi's company

68
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,559
to amend the mistake that she made.

69
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,679
No matter what,
this is our team's project.

70
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,080
Tingting's the main planner.

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,240
You shouldn't even interfere.

72
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,320
I'll talk to Mr. Chen.

73
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,800
Mr. Lu.

74
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,720
You let go of the chance to get promoted

75
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,600
because of her last time.

76
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,919
What?

77
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:24,160
Are you going to tender resignation
together with her?

78
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Do I need to explain to you

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,160
what I'm doing?

80
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,520
You gave up on the promotion
because of me?

81
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,800
Do you think Mr. Chen

82
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,039
will listen to you?

83
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,080
That's my business.

84
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,720
I know this matter happened
because of you.

85
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't care what's your relationship

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,839
with Qin Mochi.

87
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,360
You need evidence to prove that.

88
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,240
Enough!

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,160
I'll resign.

90
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,320
(I'm not afraid of anything,)

91
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,559
(but I'll not trouble others.)

92
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:12,160
Tingting, don't worry.

93
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,320
I'll help you clarify this matter.

94
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,559
You've helped me a lot,

95
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,440
but I can't get you in trouble anymore.

96
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,760
You're my team member.

97
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,359
I need to be responsible for you.

98
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,559
Yesterday, my project
has carried out the Alpha testing.

99
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,440
Today, something happened
and I had to resign.

100
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,480
Maybe life

101
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,279
just likes to pull my legs.

102
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:43,279
Oh, right.

103
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,720
Do you remember

104
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,079
what happened during our meal?

105
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,399
I helped you to drink all the wine.

106
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,239
After that, you got drunk.

107
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,399
Do you remember what happened

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,399
before I got you in the car?

109
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,640
Tingting.

110
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:06,959
It's okay, master.

111
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,320
He Rang, you're here.

112
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,720
Let me do it.

113
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:20,040
Mr. Lu, thank you for taking care of me.

114
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,239
Let's go.

115
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,079
Let me tell you, Tingting.

116
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,440
I've cooked a lot of seafood for you.

117
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,839
Congratulations

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,239
on escaping the trouble.

119
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:35,399
Hold this for me.

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,320
Who is it?

121
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,480
Hello?

122
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,279
Something happened at home.

123
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,200
There are reporters here.

124
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,480
Hello, everyone.

125
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,239
We're the reporters
from Dongcheng Entertainment.

126
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,279
Now, we've come to Han Tingting's house.

127
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,239
Anybody home?

128
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,820
(Haiyuting)

129
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,600
Anybody home?

130
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,239
Is Han Tingting home?

131
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,239
We're reporters.

132
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,040
Can you come out for an interview?

133
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,440
Look.

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,000
They're at the doorstep.

135
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,279
Why is this happening?

136
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,880
I can't even go home now.

137
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,000
The project was carrying out
Alpha testing yesterday

138
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,200
and we're asked to change
the storyline today.

139
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,440
Also, she's being so firmed.

140
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,320
Something is not right.

141
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,359
Maybe they're hooking up.

142
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,200
Are you saying that

143
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,839
Qin Mochi and Kelly are hooking up?

144
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,000
You saw them at the cinema
the other day.

145
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,200
Kelly must be thinking that
you're a time bomb.

146
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,079
She'll force you to resign one day.

147
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,880
What should we do now?

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,920
Look at what's happening.

149
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,079
I'm considered lucky
if I'm not banned from the industry.

150
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,040
I can't use my real name anymore

151
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,279
when I look for a new job.

152
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,119
Don't worry.

153
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,720
Although the Internet has memory,

154
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,839
it won't last long.

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,959
After a while,

156
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,239
no one will remember.

157
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:50,799
That's right.

158
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,959
If you can't find a job,

159
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,640
just lie down at home.

160
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,640
I'm able to feed you.

161
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,399
It's late now.

162
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm tired.

163
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,679
This place is too small.

164
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,440
I'll stay at my friend's place
for a few days.

165
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,640
I'm leaving. Bye.

166
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,279
Wait, Xiaoxiao.

167
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,760
It's still bright out there.
