3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,359
Why did he kiss me?

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,559
Was he drunk

5
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:17,959
or was he pranking me on purpose?

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,559
Let me make a call and ask him.

7
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:22,639
Otherwise, I can't fall asleep.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,600
He was so drunk.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,680
Would he have forgotten everything?

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,200
If I ask him,

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,279
would it be a little awkward?

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,040
Forget it. I'm not asking him.
Let me go to bed.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,799
But,

14
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,400
what's going on with

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,680
my feeling?

16
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,400
No.

17
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:08,160
It was He Rang,

18
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:09,199
and now it's Lu Bai.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,080
I can't be dating two guys
at the same time.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,360
No, it's too sinful.

21
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,160
I should sleep now.

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,780
(Interviewing)

23
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,879
What's the highlight of the game,
Dreamy Bubble?

24
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,239
I think the greatest highlight
of the game is

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,199
the worldview is brand new.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,519
The storyline is great as well.

27
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,360
The plots are interlinked.

28
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:45,599
The main storyline...

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,519
If it was me,

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,000
I'd like to make

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,199
a simple game.

32
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,400
I hope everyone will
be happy and satisfied

33
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,839
for playing the game.

34
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,160
Evaluate the fee for game.

35
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,879
Actually, to be frank,

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
I think the only flaw

37
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,959
of the game is

38
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,880
it charges too much.

39
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,119
Actually,

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,360
I miss the feeling of playing games

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
when I was little.

42
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:19,520
As long as I played it well,

43
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,880
I can continue playing the next level.

44
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,440
But when I'm playing games now,

45
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,960
I'll always be stopped by the fee.

46
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,720
I think it affects my user experience.

47
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,520
Another rookie.

48
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,520
If you're a normal user,

49
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,039
thinking like that is okay,

50
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,119
but as a professional game planner,

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,479
you should first think of

52
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,679
how to make your users into consumers.

53
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:43,399
You can leave now.

54
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,119
Thank you.

55
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:48,880
Thank you.

56
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,119
Next.

57
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,479
Hold on.

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,399
Come to work next Monday.

59
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,839
Come here and have a look.

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,039
These are the rooms of
the two directors.

61
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,119
This is Mr. Lu's.

62
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,119
This is Kelly's.

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,039
Friendly reminder.

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,600
Mr. Lu's very picky with the candidates.

65
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,919
He'd only take in
one disciple at a time,

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,679
and many candidates will choose him.

67
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,839
The competition is fierce.

68
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,559
The scenes to provide the solutions
are too little.

69
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,639
A terrible game setting like this

70
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,839
will be blacklisted

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,600
by the users in 30 minutes.

72
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,839
Okay, Mr. Lu.

73
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,559
I'll amend it again.

74
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,100
(General idea for the game)

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,720
Mr. Lu.

76
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,240
This is the proposal that I've amended.

77
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,559
You've been working overtime.

78
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,079
Go back early and take a rest.

79
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,359
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

80
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,920
Tingting, wake up.

81
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,720
Tingting.

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,079
Wake up.

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,320
Otherwise, you'll be late.

84
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
So annoying.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,239
I'll drive and send you to work.

86
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,079
Otherwise, you'll be late.

87
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,679
Let's go.

88
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,799
There might be a traffic jam
if we're driving.

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,279
I think it's faster to take a subway.

90
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,600
But my car...

91
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,000
(I don't care anymore.)

92
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,000
(I must ask master clearly today.)

93
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,799
(Otherwise, I can't face He Rang.)

94
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,160
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,119
Here you go.

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,000
No.

97
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,119
Just don't hold grudges against me.

98
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:52,320
Don't ask someone to beat me up.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,279
That's weird.

100
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,239
I thought I'm on the news again.

101
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,320
Ting,

102
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,839

103
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,239
