becoming the game ambassador.

The game ambassador?

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:09,840
Yes.

5
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:11,119
Have you forgotten?

6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,199
From now on,

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,280
your business is my business.

8
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,680
You're my brother.

9
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:22,120
You're my sister from now on.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,399
Can you help me become

11
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:25,719
the game ambassador?

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,719
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,239
I'll design the male protagonist

So, you approached me
for the endorsement?

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,759
Of course not.

20
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,759
I really want to be your friend,

21
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,200
Tingting.

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,439
But, shouldn't friends

be helping each other?

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,319
I'm sorry to make you misunderstand.

25
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,119
I don't have the authority
to decide that.

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:58,919
Tingting,

27
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,080
that's what you promised me.

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,559
So, it's just

29
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:11,760
a deal to you,

30
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,160
isn't it?

31
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,599
This is not a deal.

32
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,040
Time is precious.

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,080
No one will treat you well
for no reason.

34
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:21,680
Isn't this

35
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,919
the way of engagement

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,559
of the adults?

37
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,639
Let me put it this way.

38
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:29,720
I'm willing to spend time and effort

39
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,440
to sustain our relationship

40
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,040
because you can give me the chance

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,760
to endorse the game.

42
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,639
If I become the game ambassador,

43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,639
I'll make the game

44
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,879
more popular.

45
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,839
It's a win-win situation to us.

46
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,800
It's a win-win situation,
do you understand?

47
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,800
A win-win situation.

48
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,400
Yes.

49
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,319
I think there's misunderstanding

50
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,080
between us.

51
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't have the authority
to decide about the endorsement.

52
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,160
I shouldn't be biased either.

53
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,160

a handsome guy who came to you

is either a playboy or a scammer.

I just want to find the person
who kissed me.

Why is it so hard?

When one is in love,

it's easy to be tricked.

63

That's why I advise you

to just listen to music, pursue
a celebrity and watch a series

when you're lonely.

Stop looking for a handsome guy.

Isn't that great?

That room is yours forever.
