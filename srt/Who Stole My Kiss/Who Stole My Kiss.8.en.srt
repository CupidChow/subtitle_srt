Wake up.

You've eaten three days for free.

6
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,399
You're so shameless.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,560
Didn't you say you'll keep me here?

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,720
I can keep a human,

not a pig.

Wake up.

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,200
Look at you.

12
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,319
Won't you wake up?

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:39,799
I want to sleep.

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,319
Will you wake up or not?

15
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:41,759
I want to sleep.

00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,239
Why not you work here?

17
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,080
Be the best assistant here.

18
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,800
It's easy, high-pay,
and near your house.

19
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:09,480
You can even sleep until morning.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,839
Are you listening to yourself?

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,599
I have yet to fulfill my dream

22
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,639
as a game planner.

23
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:16,239
I'm young. Why would I

24
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,360
idle here?

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,199
You should just resign.

26
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,919
There's other company

27
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,599

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,720
I owe my master a favour.

I can't just resign

35
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,680
Look. What I said was correct.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,680
I saw Mr. Lu
drafting the endorsement agreement

37

in the office by himself

38

and he left.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,919
The technical department has verified

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,520
that the video was edited.

41
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,520
Why does he still look for her
to sign the contract?

42
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,000
Actually, you don't have to do this

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,679
and we can still collaborate.

44
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,279
After all, Qin Mochi has always
been our alternative.

Mr. Lu,

46

I've told you that

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,399
it has nothing to do with us.

48
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,839
Of course, if we can collaborate,

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,240
I believe the negative rumours

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,559
will be over very soon.

51
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,080
Helen, the way you talk

52
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,399
is really careful.

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,759
Did you ask me here

54
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,919
to record what I said to sabotage us?

55
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,759
You've worried too much.

It's a shame that your talented planner

has been terminated.

59
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,080
She's young.

60
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,679
She needs to learn to grow.

61

You're an ordinary girl.

71
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,199
You should have thought of the outcome

72

73

You knew that I was framed.

Why are you collaborating with her?

Does it have anything to do with you?

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,240
You've caused the company to lose money

81

and I didn't ask you to compensate us.

Fine.

You're new here.

It's good enough that

you came here with me today.

Ting.

101
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,320
Will you do something silly?

102
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,200
Don't worry, I won't.

103
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,359
But I want to be alone now.

104
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,559
Go back first.

105
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,200
All right.

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,399
Thank you.

107
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,440
No problem.

108

Did the kiss

take away all my luck?

I'm sorry.

Why are you here?

113
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,920
You've misunderstood what
happened this morning.

Actually...
