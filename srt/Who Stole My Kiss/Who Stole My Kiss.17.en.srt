We're so close.

Why are you shy?

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,159
You have guests.

00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,880
Go ahead.

00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,919
I won't stop you from earning money.

So romantic?

How did it go?

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,400
Were you moved?

13
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,279
No.

14
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,959
I didn't want to kiss him at all.

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,400
When He Rang got close to me, I'd...

You don't understand.

17
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,519
There is something

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,040
we do when we're not sober so that

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
we won't feel the guiltiness.

20
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,400
Think about that night.

21
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,120
You did it because you were drunk.

22
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,400
You were sober today.

23
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,360
You had the moral sense and shame.

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,559
It's normal that you can't kiss him.

25
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,559
What's going on with
Kelly and Qin Mochi?

26
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:53,959
Why are they together now?

27
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,599
Isn't it obvious?

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,400
Kelly's our company director.

29
00:01:58,559 --> 00:01:59,839
If Qin Mochi wants to

30
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,000
become the game ambassador,

31
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,480
of course he'd look for her.

32
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,440
Don't worry.

33
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,879
She's in the middle management.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
I'm sure she's an independent woman
who is experienced.

35
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,960
She won't fall for the tricks.

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,399
Furthermore,

37
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,320
she's married.

38
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,679
Her kids are in primary school.

39
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,279
I think she won't make

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,039
this kind of silly mistake.

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,119
The competition of the gaming market
is fierce,

42
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,440
so the group meeting

43
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,559
has decided to simplify
our Alpha testing.

44
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,000
13 projects were proposed

45
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,000
and two were chosen.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,839
The first one was Wonder Closet.

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
We've integrated fashion

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,399
and fantasy well.

49
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,600
Especially the art was done well.

50
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,520
So, it's passed the Alpha testing.

51
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,119
There's one more left.

52
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,919
Your team's Ultimate Kiss.

53
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,080
Great!

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,119
Yes!

55
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,360
This game

56
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
stands out among

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
all the female audiences.

58
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,639
So, Han Tingting,

59
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,240
I know you've spent so much effort

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,679
on the planning

61
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,960
and you've improved
what was lacking before.

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,399
The leaders are thinking highly of you.

63
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,320
Keep it up.

64
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,679
Thank you.

65
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,000
Tingting, it's not easy to
get to the Alpha testing.

66
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,479
Shouldn't we celebrate it?

67
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,399
Yes.

68
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,320
That's right.

69
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,720
We've been your tools every day,

70
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,679
doing all the acting on the table,
against the walls and on the chairs.

71
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Well, let me buy everyone
dinner tonight.

72
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,440
Order whatever you'd like to eat,

73
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,000
okay?

I'm meeting a client tonight.

80
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,559
Go ahead without me.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,320
Okay, everyone, get back to work.

82
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,759

I want to speak to you

87
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,959
regarding that incident.

About Qin Mochi?

We're talking about business.

Don't think too much.

91

Have fun tonight.

I'll go amend the proposal.

I suggest

100
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,640
each of us should give
Tingting a toast

101
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,079
and say something to encourage her.

On one hand,

we're cheering for Tingting.

- Great!
- Not bad!

107
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,559
Okay.

108

After all, today's a happy day.

109

We're all so happy.

110
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,559

and interactions.

Thank you.

117
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,440
You're not good at drinking.

118
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,640
You've already drunk one glass.

119
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,359
I got it, Mr. Lu.

120
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,799
You're afraid that
Tingting will be drunk

121
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,559
and she might tear
your shirt open again.

122
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:40,920
Tingting has a meeting tomorrow.

123
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,799
She can't get a hangover.

124
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,119
I'll drink the rest of the wine for her.

125
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,880
Okay.

126
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,000
Fill the glass for Mr. Lu.

127
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,359
- It has to be full.
- Yes.

128
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,359
That's enough.

129
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,119
Okay.

130
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:53,600
Drink it.

131
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,200
Next.

132
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,320
Here.

133
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,519
The car is about to be here

134
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:14,679
and we can go home.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,519
No.

136
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,399
Tingting?

137
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,600
Why are you here?

138
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,279
Where's your

139
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,480
follower?

140
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,399
Who are you talking about?

141
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,799
It's your

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,720
childhood buddy.

143
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:51,720
Tingting,

144
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,119
listen to me.

145
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
You two

146
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:56,679
are not meant for each other.

147
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,000
Master, I didn't know that

148
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,760
you're gossiping after drinking so much.

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,679
As your childhood buddy,

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,679
he's not keeping his boundary.

151
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,480
It shows that
he's not thinking straight.

152
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,279
Also,

153
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,239
you've been friends for years.

154
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,160
It shows that you're not fated

155
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,640
to further the relationship.

156
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
But master,

157
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,200
do you remember

158
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,760
the kiss in the first proposal

159
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,399
that was rejected by Kelly?

160
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,959
Actually, that kiss came
from my real life.

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,480
He Rang

162
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,000
was the person who kissed me.

163
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,640
So what?

164
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,359
Are you going to be with whoever

that kissed you?

166
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,519
That's not what I meant.
