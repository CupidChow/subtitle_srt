[Episode 37]

4
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,280
My lord,

5
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,230
we've searched this mountain.

6
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,290
There is only one house

7
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,280
in the valley ahead.

8
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,010
There was smoke

9
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,210
rising this morning.

10
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,290
Jiang Xinbai and his company

11
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,490
must be hiding there.

12
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,630
Lead the way.

13
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,230
Yes.

14
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,310
All right, stop watching me.

15
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,270
Go get some rest.

16
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,900
Nanxing.

17
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,350
You haven't eaten in a day.

18
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,820
Yao made some porridge outside.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,130
You should eat some.

20
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,350
Nanxing.

21
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,990
Enough.

22
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,240
Go eat something.

23
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,290
Get me a bottle of wine while you're at it.

24
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,350
I'd like a word with

25
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,410
my son-in-law privately.

26
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,440
Hurry and go.

27
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:00,950
Go.

28
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,390
Help me up.

29
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
I made you some porridge.

30
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,590
Eat it while it's hot.

31
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,510
Yao.

32
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,760
Have you ever felt

33
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,020
completely hopeless?

34
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,290
It's like nothing can be done.

35
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,079
You can only wait and see what happens.

36
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,240
Of course.

37
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,270
So how did you get through it?

38
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,070
I just prayed.

39
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,829
Just face the sky,

40
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,680
see which deities are free,

41
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,150
and ask them for help.

42
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,000
You believe in this?

43
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,070
I don't believe in Buddha

44
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,790
until I'm at my wits' end.

45
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,400
But...

46
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,670
It's been a long time

47
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,270
since I've done such a thing,

48
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,829
because I have Mr. Jiang.

49
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,360
What do you mean?

50
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,430
I'm not afraid when he's around.

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,590
I know he has my back.

52
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,560
He would take a knife for me,

53
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,830
and I'll also sacrifice my life for him.

54
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,710
That's great.

55
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,770
By the way,

56
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,010
Mr. Jiang has told me about

57
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,060
what happened to you two in Yazhou.

58
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,269
Actually, on that day when you guys

59
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,270
were surrounded,

60
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,130
I was there too.

61
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:23,970
Later,

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,110
I became Mr. Jiang's

63
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,310
personal bodyguard.

64
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,870
Her Highness asked me to protect

65
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,330
and take care of Mr. Jiang.

66
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,910
Besides Her Highness

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,030
and the imperial physician,

68
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,690
I'm the third person who knows

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,730
about Mr. Jiang's face blindness.

70
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,370
So my relationship with Mr. Jiang

71
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,020
is closer than that of family.

72
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,320
He is like my brother.

73
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,720
You...

74
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,830
don't have to worry too much.

75
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,380
Mr. Jiang and I will protect

76
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,510
you and your mother.

77
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
We'll all be fine.

78
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,409
Have it while it's hot.

79
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:01,790
Here.

80
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,360
I've already called you son-in-law.

81
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,790
How should you be addressing me?

82
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,450
Mother.

83
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,750
Here.

84
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:22,920
Slowly.

85
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,070
It's sweet.

86
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,550
Okay. Put it down.

87
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,350
Put that down.

88
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,930
I asked Xing'er to go out

89
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,630
because there is something important

90
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,630
I need to tell you.

91
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,390
Here, open it.

92
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,380
This is?

93
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,590
Is what written in

94
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,120
the letter true?

95
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,830
Xing's mother

96
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,830
was my senior.

97
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,600
We studied medicine together.

98
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,250
After our Master passed away,

99
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,270
she played the role of both father and mother.

100
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,190
She raised me up.

101
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,590
When she grew up,

102
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,870
she took me along as she followed

103
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,490
her husband into the capital.

104
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,990
We live in a small village

105
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,450
in the capital's suburbs.

106
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,670
Later I found out

107
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,720
they came to the capital

108
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,030
to investigate a case of Zornia.

109
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,230
Her husband

110
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,070
was Yan Zhizhong.

111
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,600
Yan Zhizhong

112
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,190
is the spy of Xi Zhaoming.

113
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,070
But despite years of investigation

114
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,790
into this case of Zornia,

115
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,090
there was no sign of movement either.

116
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,030
So,

117
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,390
Yan Zhizhong

118
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,550
could only use himself as a bait

119
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,130
and went to the capital to report to His Majesty.

120
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,430
He tried to

121
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,630
lure the culprit out.

122
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,630
At that time, Xing

123
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,470
was just one year old.

124
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,200
She was very smiley.

125
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,550
But...

126
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,910
since she was born,

127
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,280
she had weak constitution.

128
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,550
One day,

129
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,910
I went to the mountain to collect herbs.

130
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,590
When I came back,

131
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,440
the whole village was burned down.

132
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,690
Xing's parents

133
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,910
died in the fire.

134
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,310
Xing...

135
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,310
She was being shielded by

136
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,049
her mother under her body,

137
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,270
and that saved her life.

138
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,669
That year,

139
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,830
I was 12.

140
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,110
Xing and I have been together ever since.

141
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,400
I asked her to call me mother

142
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,000
I told her...

143
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,510
she was an orphan I adopted.

144
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,950
At first,

145
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,060
I didn't want you two to be together.

146
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,040
After all, your father is partly responsible

147
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,550
for the death of her parents.

148
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,190
But Xing told me

149
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,950
you really love her,

150
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,870
and she's in love with you too.

151
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,950
Even so,

152
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,680
I feel that

153
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,240
it still doesn't make up for

154
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,850
the tragedy of her losing her parents when she was young.

155
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,850
This letter...

156
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,590
I had written it a while ago.

157
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,680
I was going to send it to the capital...

158
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,870
and break you guys apart.

159
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,930
It's better to suffer now than to prolong the agony.

160
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,380
But I saw how much

161
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,990
you cared for Xing

162
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,140
in the past few days.

163
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,000
I couldn't bear to do so anymore.

164
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,310
This time,

165
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,590
why did you come back

166
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,550
from the capital?

167
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,810
If you don't want to share,

168
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,880
I don't want to ask either.

169
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,400
But you must always remember.

170
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,110
You and your father

171
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,520
owe it to Xing and her whole family.

172
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,750
You'll spend your life

173
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,000
risking everything

174
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,030
to protect her.

175
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,510
Mother.

176
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,870
I swear...

177
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,070
I will.

178
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,690
I definitely will.

179
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,080
I trust you.

180
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,260
In that case,

181
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,100
hide...

182
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,630
this letter away.

183
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,350
Burn it sometime,

184
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,120
and let it remain a secret forever.

185
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,360
Dear immortals,

186
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,710
Bodhisattva.

187
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,740
I’m begging you.

188
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,440
Please turn me back

189
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,420
to my original self, will you?

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,060
In the future, I can

191
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,130
shapeshift as many times as you want.

192
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,790
But this time,

193
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,110
can you please turn me back right away?

194
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,020
I just wish to

195

I'm fine.

My lord.

239
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,980
Yan Nanxing, you go first.

240
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,020
After them!

241
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,260
Don't let anyone escape!

242
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,510
Yes!

243
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,990
Split up!

244
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,750
Jiang Xinbai.

245
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,410
Let me see

246
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,470
if you can

247
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,070
recognize this Yao Qianshu.

248
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,240
Jiang Xinbai.

249
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,960
You really are face-blind.

250
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,950
Yao!

251
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,570
Yao, you...

252
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,760
Are you okay?

253
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,230
I'm fine.

254
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,110
Hang in there.

255
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,230
I'll carry you back for treatment.

256
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,590
You're injured too.

257
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,110
Is it serious?

258
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,910
Stop talking. Let's go.

259
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,430
My lord, I'm fine.

260
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,280
I can still kill.

261
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,950
Yao!

262
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,310
Yao!

263
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,060
Yao!

264
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,280
Xing.

265
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,110
No matter what you'll become,

266
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,100
I will

267
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,070
recognize you at a glance.

268
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,430
Remember,

269
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,030
I love you forever.

270
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,060
Don't say that.

271
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,950
You haven't seen me transform back.

272
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,670
You can't leave me yet.

273
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,510
You can't leave. You mustn't leave!

274
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,550
Come here.

275
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,190
Come closer.

276
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,430
Yao!

277
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,590
Yao!

278
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,670
My lord.

279
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,790
I'm afraid

280
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,630
I won't make it.

281
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,830
This is as far as I can go with you.

282
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,350
From now on...

283
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,830
Yao!

284
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,990
Stop talking!

285
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,930
I'll take you back now.

286
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,550
Hang in there.

287
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,000
My lord, I...

288
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,110
I...

289
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,270
Yao.

290
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,110
Yao.

291
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:40,830
Yao.

292
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,230
Yao!

293
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,230
Yao!

294
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,350
Yao!

295
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,820
I'll be more careful next time.

296
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,510
Mother!

297
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,030
Mother!

298
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,770
[Tomb of Yao Qianshu]

299
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,720
[Tomb of Phantom Physician]

300
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,360
Yan Nanxing.

301
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,160
There's something

302
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,740
I have to tell you.

303
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,030
Actually,

304
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,910
you're not an orphan.

305
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,870
Your father

306
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,930
was Yan Zhizhong.

307
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,800
It was the case which

308
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,920
I've mentioned to you

309
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,110
at the file room that day.

310
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,710
On the night before the witness testified

311
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,440
against the masterminds behind the Zornia case,

312
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,670
the witness died.

313
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,750
His whole family was killed.

314
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,430
This matter

315
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,620
has been a lifelong agony for my father.

316
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,120
That witness shared

317
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,000
the same surname as you.

318
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,000
His surname was Yan too.

319
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,090
His name was Yan Zhizhong.

320
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,110
Back then,

321
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,760
to investigate the mastermind behind the Zornia case,

322
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,540
your father

323
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,630
used himself as a bait

324
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,310
to lure the real culprit out.

325
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,150
But my father

326
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,370
failed to protect him.

327
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,690
That's why you lost your parents.

328
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,640
When you were young,

329
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,170
you were poisoned by Zornia

330
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,070
because of me.

331
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,380
Phantom Physician

332
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,440
wanted to detoxify the poison in you,

333
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,900
and died of poisoning

334
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,160
as she tried different medicines.

335
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,910
She didn't

336
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,310
manage to see your

337
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,710
original appearance before passing away.

338
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,170
Yan Nanxing.

339
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,910
I owe you too much.

340
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,830
This is a letter Phantom Physician

341
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,150
handed me before she passed.

342
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,020
You'll understand

343
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
after reading it.

344
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,540
[To my child, Nanxing]

345
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,670
Yan Nanxing.

346
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,350
Let's divorce.

347
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,430
Yao.

348
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,510
General Nan.

349
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,210
They all died because of me.

350
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,290
And this time, Blossom Beauty was framed

351
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
as a result of them

352
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,590
trying to get to me.

353
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,790
I can't let you

354
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,240
be in anymore danger

355
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,570
because of me.

356
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,230
I can't protect you now.

357
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,310
Why?

358
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,710
Why can't you protect me?

359
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,450
I want to go back to the capital

360
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,910
to avenge Yao.

361
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,040
There'll still be movement from

362
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,500
Yan Biqing in the capital.

363
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,370
I must make him confess and face justice.

364
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,730
Only in this way...

365
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,050
I can protect you completely.

366
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,680
I'll go with you.

367
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,680
We are husband and wife.

368
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,990
From now on,

369
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,190
we are no longer husband and wife.

was about the righteousness of my real parents.

387
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,470
♫Can we just follow our hearts?♫

388
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,110
There was

389
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,720
no resentment towards your father.

390
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,200
♫If there was no need to hide our feelings♫

391
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,750
I feel the same about you.

392
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,590
Without you,

393
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,710
♫How bold could we be?♫

394
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,670
I wouldn't have had

395
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,730
so many happy days.

396
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,400
♫Like you and me♫

397
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,990
Xinbai.

398
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,310
♫Running away in the rain♫

399
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,030
In the past,

400
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,390
you were always by my side

401
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,170
to protect me.

402
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,590
♫With no umbrella♫

403
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,310
Now,

404
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,030
I'm willing to exchange my life

405
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,150
for your safety.

406
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,070
As time goes by,

407
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,270
these symptoms will

408
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,200
gradually show.

409
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,230
For example?

410
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,630
For instance, your five senses may decline,

411
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,690
especially your hearing and vision.

412
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,970
It's also very likely that

413
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,060
you'll go blind and deaf.

414
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,590
There's not much time left.

415
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,560
I need to hurry up

416
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,630
and resolve this.

417
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,940
[Taiji Hall]

418
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,830
The incense you blended for me

419
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,060
is really effective.

420
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,870
I haven't had a headache for days.

421
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,530
That's great.

422
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,680
It's great that Your Majesty finds it effective.

423
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,430
But it's burning too fast.

424
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,540
There were several times I wanted

425
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,890
to continue it at night,

426
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,830
but there's none left.

427
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:26,770
That's easy.

428
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,640
I'll

429
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,990
blend some more

430
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,910
in case Your Majesty needs them.

431
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,590
Okay.

432
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,070
Grand Councilor.

433
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

434
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,450
Do you think it's disgraceful for you

435
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,310
to blend incense for me as the Grand Councilor?

436
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,440
Not at all.

437
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,070
It's definitely my duty

438
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,160
to blend incense for you.

439
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,310
Your Majesty, you have to

440
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,270
be healthy and happy,

441
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,070
in order to

442
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,730
bless our people.

443
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,400
Good.

444
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,510
Sir,

445
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,710
they are here.

446
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,720
Mr. Pei.

447
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,510
Zhiyi.

448
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,910
Qingyun.

449
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,610
My father...

450
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,760
Don't worry.

451
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,580
I've visited

452
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,450
him.

453
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,730
He's fine.

454
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,430
He's just

455
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,230
very worried about you.

456
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,250
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

457
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,430
The Ministry of Defense sealed Yuejiang's Residence,

458
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,100
so I can't visit you.

459
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,620
I had to send someone

460
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,970
to bring you here.

461
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,330
After two hours,

462
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,540
I'll arrange someone

463
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,470
to send you back.

464
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,700
I understand.

465
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,750
Grand Councilor,

466
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,390
did you ask us to come here

467
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,350
because something

468
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,880
had happened in the palace?

469
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,750
His Majesty is furious.

470
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,020
He said

471
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,110
the Jiang family is protecting criminals.

472
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,650
The Inspection Office embezzled the money.

473
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,520
I want to help you.

474
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,910
But...

475
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,400
I would love to help,

476
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,110
but I'm not capable enough.

477
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,680
Mr. Pei.

478
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,510
Since you asked us to come here today,

479
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,970
there must be a way, right?

480
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,690
At this moment,

481
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,430
if Xinbai can come back,

482
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,210
there will be a turning point.

483
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,340
I think

484
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,550
instead of letting the Ministry of Justice

485
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,630
bring Xinbai back,

486
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,590
Why don't we

487
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,630
bring him back ourselves?

488
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,860
Grand Councilor, you mean...

489
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,500
Qingyun,

490
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,550
you are the right person

491
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,830
to persuade Xinbai to come back.

492
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,350
No.

493
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,630
Why?

494
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,830
Xinbai is not a

495
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,420
reckless and willful person.

496
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,670
He must have his reasons

497
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,800
for not coming back.

498
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,270
We trust him.

499
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,400
At this critical moment,

500
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,670
why are you still

501
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,990
be so emotional?

502
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,300
Xinbai is a young man.

503
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,790
He is bound to make mistakes.

504
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,750
But all of you...

505
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,920
must not simply

506
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,030
just tolerate him.

507
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:35,590
Mr. Pei.

508
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,750
It's not tolerance,

509
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,480
but understanding.

510
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,860
Since I understand him, I should trust him.

511
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,640
Qingyun was right.

512
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,560
Precisely at this critical moment,

513
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,440
we must give him

514
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,390
enough trust.

515
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,910
In that case,

516
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,440
then let's play it by ear.

517
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,030
Remember,

518
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,710
you have to also

519
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,770
be well-prepared.

520
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,429
-If...
-Mr. Pei.

521
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,020
No matter what the result will be,

522
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,489
we have no regrets.

523
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,370
Your Highness.

524
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,429
Yuchen dropped her earring.

525
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,489
That earring was given by you.

526
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,100
I think...

527
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,070
Go find it.

528
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Grand Councilor.

529
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,110
I'm begging you to

530
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,430
save the Jiang family.

531
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,440
Ms. Bai.

532
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,500
Stand up and talk.

533
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,030
Grand Councilor.

534
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,690
The Jiang family is innocent.

535
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,270
All the crimes

536
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,630
were committed by that freak,

537
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,400
Yan Nanxing.

538
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,510
Freak?

539
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,790
Yes.

540
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,470
Yan Nanxing

541
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,170
is a freak who can shapeshift.

542
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,910
Shapeshift?

543
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,170
The Duchess of Yuejiang can shapeshift?

544
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,170
I heard that personally from Duchess Suolo.

545
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,070
Yan Nanxing

546
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,330
was previously poisoned by Zornia.

547
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,120
Her body had mutated, and she can shapeshift.

548
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,520
She's taken advantage of this shapeshifting

549
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,440
to involve herself in the Zornia case,

550
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,770
and bewitched everyone the Jiang family.

551
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,830
Grand Councilor,

552
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,070
you must trust me.

553
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,190
Now...

554
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,550
the Princess, Duke and Duchess

555
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,950
are all unrepentant.

556
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,960
Only you can help the Jiang family

557
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,120
to get through this.

558
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,190
My dear child,

559
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,400
don't worry.

560
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,400
I...

561
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,990
know what to do.

562
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,190
Thank you, Grand Councilor.

563
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,740
[Guangde Gate]

564
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,890
My lord, the prisoner is here.

565
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,240
Yan Nanxing.

566
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,120
You are involved in the Zornia case.

567
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,720
You refused arrest and fled.

568
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,750
Let me ask you.

569
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,650
Who is your accomplice?

570
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,670
My lord,

571
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,710
my accomplice Bai Yuan has died.

572
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,150
This is the evidence.

573
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,050
So, you admit that Bai Yuan

574
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,380
is your accomplice?

575
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,110
Yes.

576
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,380
He used Blossom Beauty to profit from Zornia.

577
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,110
Only the two of us

578
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,150
know about this.

579
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,430
It has nothing to do with others.

580
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,070
I will find out if

581
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,120
it has anything to do with anyone else.

582
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,320
The suspect, Yan Nanxing.

583
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,170
has confessed truthfully to her crimes.

584
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,270
She is to be detained immediately

585
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,870
and executed at a later date.

586
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,070
Is she...

587
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,810
Is she the Duchess of Yuejiang?

588
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,430
What did she do?

589
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,190
Really?

590
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,230
Boss.

591
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,710
Boss! Boss!

592
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,370
Boss!

593
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,020
Let’s go.

594
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,310
Boss!

595
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,620
-Boss!
-Go back.

596
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,060
Boss!

597
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,150
Boss, I’m Sai'er! Boss!

598
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:04,830
Get in.

599
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,370
Boss!

600
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,390
Behave yourself.

601
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,510
Ruoqian, Sai'er.

602
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,830
Are you all right?

603
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,270
We are fine, Boss.

604
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,040
Didn’t you run away?

605
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,550
Why did you come back?

606
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,190
Boss.

607
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,030
You didn't plead guilty alone,

608
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,710
did you?

609
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,430
It's death sentence for those who are involved in the Zornia case.

610
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,390
Death penalty?

611
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,430
Boss!

612
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,150
Boss!

613
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,340
You musn’t plead guilty.

614
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,070
This has nothing to do with you.

615
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,150
Sai'er.

616
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,200
Ruoqian.

617
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,080
Listen to me.

618
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,250
As long as I've been your boss,

619
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,370
I will always be your boss.

620
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,790
Remember,

621
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,480
I will always

622
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,950
protect you.

623
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,030
In the future,

624
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,080
no matter what happens,

625
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,030
remember to

626
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,110
live well.

627
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,050
Go and live well.

628
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,100
You must live well.

629
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,390
Yan Nanxing walked right into the trap.

630
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,810
What about Jiang Xinbai?

631
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,840
Not news yet.

632
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,630
Okay.

633
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,750
Send my order

634
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,750
to free to Yuejiang's Residence.

635
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,870
In this way,

636
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,500
they will think

637
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,770
things have turned around.

638
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,030
Jiang Xinbai will definitely come back.

639
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Sir, you're wise.

640
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,320
Ruoqian!

641
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,910
Ruoqian!

642
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,550
Ruoqian!

643
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,360
Sai'er!

644
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,110
Sai'er!

645
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,810
Who are you?

646
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,060
Interesting.

647
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,330
This hallucinogenic smoke

648
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,770
doesn't work on you.
