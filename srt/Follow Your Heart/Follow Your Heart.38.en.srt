It's your job

00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,150
to study her.

Bai Yuchen.

15
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,510
You colluded with a criminal

16
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,300
behind the back of the Jiang family.

17
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,450
You let Her Highness down.

20
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,670
As long as you tell me

21
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,760
how to shapeshift,

22
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,360
I'll spare your life.

23
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't know.

24
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,270
How is her pulse?

Grand Councilor.

26
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,990
Her pulse

27
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,440
is indeed similar to that of someone

28
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,700
poisoned with Zornia.

29
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,250
But what's strange

30
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,560
is that the poison we used on her

31
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
didn't work.

32
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,670
Great.

33

I heard

34
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,770
even knockout drops couldn't work on you.

35
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,030
Are you indeed immune to all poisons?

36
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,090
Not only can you detoxify Zornia,

37
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,390
but you also know how to shapeshift.

What are you going to do?

40
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,900
Feed them with her blood.

42
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,870
Not only can you detoxify Zornia,

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,950

She's severely poisoned.

51

Yan Jinglun and his son

85
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,530

86
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,220
as they transported tributes,

99
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,090

As you saw,

although Yi Yuanshan had committed a serious crime,

119
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,830
I didn't kill him.

120
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,540
Instead, I brought him back to the capital for trial.

121
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,830
My attitude towards Bai Yuan

122
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,790
was the same.

123
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,720
I wouldn't kill him.

124
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,070
Only those who wanted to silence him for good

125
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,990
would do it.

126
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,550

trying to protect me and Yan Nanxing.

130
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,480
I told him

131
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,770

132
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,990
his death.

It's you.

134
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,740
You caused his death!

135
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,630
Before he died, he told me

136
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,150
there is something

137
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,450

141
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,810
Chief Bai actually...

142
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,110
Tell me.

He put Zornia in the Yan family's house

150
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,820
on purpose.

151
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,510
He did this

152
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,430
in case Yan Biqing

153
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,810
betrayed us.

154
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,190

161
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,390
It's also what Bai Yuan wanted,

175
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,560
We found Zornia under Yan Biqing's bed.

176
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,180
Let go of me!

177
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,890
On what grounds are you arresting me?

178
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,350
You sold Zornia without permission.

179
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,610
The evidence is solid.

180
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,110
Take him away.

181
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,910
Your words can't serve as proof.

182
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,190
What evidence do you have?

No Zornia dealer

186
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,130
would keep Zornia at home.

187
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,780
You would.

188
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,770
The Jinwu Guards are here to investigate a case.

189
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,080
How dare you!

190
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,530
This is the Ministry of Justice.

191
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,430
How could you

192
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,640
barge in here?

193
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,790
Yan Jinglun sold Zornia without permission.

195
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,790
Nonsense!

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,400
How could I possibly have something to do

197
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,130
with Zornia?

198
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,010
Arrest him!

199
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,320
How dare you!

200
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,270
Go.

201
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,630
Go.

202
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,110
This is the Ministry of Justice!

203
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,430
Go.

204
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,470
Let go of me.

205
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,990
I can walk myself.

206
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,450
Behave.

207
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,000
Behave.

208
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,240
Go.

209
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,150
Go.

210
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,870
Hurry!

211
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:40,970
Go in.

212
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,010
Father.

213
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,070
Biqing.

214
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,160
How are you?

215
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:45,840
I'm fine.

216
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,010
Father.

217
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,250
Why did they

218
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,210
arrest you, too?

219
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,630
You're the Assistant Minister of Justice!

220
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,950
They said

221
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,280
they found Zornia in our house.

222
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,770
What happened?

223
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,010
It was Bai Yuan.

224
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,750
He hid Zornia in our house on purpose.

225
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,550
You...

226
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,330
Gosh. I'm speechless!

227
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,430
He's already dead.

228
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,640
Yet he succeeded

229
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,170
in taking us down with him.

230
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,750
Father.

231
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,990
What should we do now?

232
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,590
Father!

233
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,950
Leave me alone!

234
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,510
What should we do?

235
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,880
We should wait.

236
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,160
The case

237
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,320
hasn't been closed.

238
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,350
Shang Bieli doesn't dare do anything

239
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,000
to us.

240
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,120
They found Zornia in our house.

241
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,710
It's solid evidence!

242
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,430
With the grand councilor behind us,

243
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,030
what's there to be afraid of?

244
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,470
The grand councilor?

245
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,390
Will he save us?

246
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,850
He didn't save Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

247
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,390
back then!

248
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:57,950
We...

249
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,750
There's a saying,

250
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,750
"That was then, and this is now."

251
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,380
Yan Nanxing has pleaded guilty.

252
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,530
Jiang Xinbai has been dismissed.

253
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,370
His Majesty

254
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,920
trusts the grand councilor very much.

255
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,430
Everything will be fine.

256
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,990
Don't worry.

257
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,740
Everything will be fine.

258
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,150
Everything will be fine.

259
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,170
Sai'er.

260
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,080
Shang.

261
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,540
Sorry, Sai'er.

262
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I made you suffer.

263
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,990
It's okay, Shang.

264
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,110
Please save Ms. Yan.

265
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,400
Yan Nanxing?

266
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,860
What happened to her?

267
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,950
She pleaded guilty

268
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,410
and was sent to prison.

269
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,870
Then, she suddenly disappeared.

270
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,000
She pleaded guilty?

271
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,790
And she disappeared?

272
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,250
What happened?

273
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,030
[Taiji Gate]

274
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,660
Your Majesty.

275
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,160
His Majesty is resting.

276
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,980
Why do you keep

277
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,270
stopping me?

278
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,850
I dare not.

279
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,670
Your Majesty.

280
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,400
Your Majesty.

281
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,630
You're awake.

282
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,150
How dare you!

283
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,550
Who let you in?

284
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,270
Get out.

285
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,430
Your Majesty.

286
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,070
Please go.

287
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,730
Where is the grand councilor?

288
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,550
Grand Councilor.

289
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,430
I, Pei Linfu, bow in respect

290
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,710
before Your Majesties.

291
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,790
Rise.

292
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Grand Councilor.

293
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,180
Make some incense for me.

294
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

295
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,589
Why are you still standing here?

296
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,470
Get lost!

297
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,990
From now on,

298
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,829
except for the grand councilor,

299
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,390
no one

300
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,290
is allowed to enter

301
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,650
without being summoned.

302
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,310
Grand Councilor.

303
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,390
I can finally get some rest.

304
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,950
I'll leave all state affairs

305
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,550
to you.

306
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,710
Grand Councilor.

307
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,910
This token

308
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,900
represents me.

309
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

310
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,650
Your Majesty, please leave.

311
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:37,760
[Zhaode Hall]

312
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,670
Grand Councilor.

313
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,910
Today, Shang Bieli and his men

314
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,470
found Zornia in the Yan Residence

315
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,670
and took Yan Biqing and his father away.

316
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,910
How dare they?

317
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,470
I suspect

318
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,170
Jiang Xinbai is back.

319
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,510
Do you know his whereabouts?

320
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,880
Where are

321
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,640
Yan Biqing and Yan Jinglun now?

322
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,340
In the Jinwu Guards' prison.

323
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,130
Xinbai is really back?

324
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,360
He's inside.

325
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,190
Follow me.

326
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,740
Xinbai.

327
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,720
Xinbai.

328
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,720
Is everything okay?

329
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,580
I heard

330
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,470
Yuejiang's Residence was sealed.

331
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,550
The grand councilor has ordered someone

332
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,630
to unseal it.

333
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,350
It was because of Yan Nanxing.

334
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,590
She went to the Ministry of Justice to plead guilty.

335
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,120
How could she plead guilty?

336
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,150
Xinbai.

337
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,540
You're wanted.

338
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,480
You can't go out.

339
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,310
But I can't let anything

340
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,570
happen to Yan Nanxing.

341
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,750
Jiang Xinbai.

342
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,210
I went to the Ministry of Justice.

343
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,050
Yan Nanxing was not there.

344
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,870
What?

345
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,910
She had been kept

346
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,970
in the Ministry of Justice's prison.

347
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,050
But last night,

348
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,270
she suddenly disappeared.

349
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,070
Disappeared?

350
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,720
What does that mean?

351
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,710
Did she find a way

352
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,420
to escape?

353
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,030
That's impossible.

354
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,030
If she'd run away,

355
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,720
she'd have taken Sai'er and Ruoqian with her.

356
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,680
How are they now?

357
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,120
Don't worry.

358
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,590
I've taken them

359
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,630
to my place.

360
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,110
What about Yan Jinglun and Yan Biqing?

361
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,710
I found Zornia in their house

362
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,870
and then sent them to the Jinwu Guards' prison.

363
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,430
I'm sure they know

364
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,630
where Yan Nanxing is.

365
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,770
Take me to them.

366
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,530
Xinbai.

367
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,200
I'll go with you.

368
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,790
Mr. Yan.

369
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,870
Suoluo.

370
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,730
The situation is unclear.

371
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,310
We also need to take care of my grandfather

372
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,970
and mother.

373
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,890
Don't act rashly for now.

374
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,600
Alright.

375
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,390
Don't worry about your mother

376
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,390
and grandfather.

377
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,870
We'll stay together.

378
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,070
If anything happens,

379
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,090
we can take care of each other.

380
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,470
Xinbai, take care.

381
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,130
Father.

382
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,790
You are...

383
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,750
-Grand Councilor!
-Grand Councilor!

384
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,670
It's really you!

385
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,670
Grand Councilor.

386
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,750
Grand Councilor, you're finally here!

387
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,410
Greetings, Grand Councilor.

388
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,850
Grand Councilor.

389
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,880
We were careless

390
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,190
this time.

391
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,830
We fell into Bai Yuan's trap,

392
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,050
which gave Shang Bieli

393
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,120
and Jiang Xinbai a chance

394
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,190
to arrest us.

395
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,750
It...

396
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,100
It was my fault.

397
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,450
Please forgive me.

398
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,390
Grand Councilor,

399
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,430
for all the work I've done for you

400
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,290
over the years,

401
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,260
please save our lives.

402
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,010
You want me to save your lives?

403
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,830
Yes.

404
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,750
Are you two

405
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,340
still of value

406
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,490
to me?

407
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,590
-Grand Councilor.
-Grand Councilor.

408
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,150
Grand Councilor!

409
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,870
-Grand Councilor!
-Grand Councilor!

410
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,070
Please don't do this.

411
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,520
Grand Councilor, please save us!

412
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,100
I'm begging you, Grand Councilor.

413
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Grand Councilor.

414
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,160
Which one of you

415
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,520
will drink the wine?

416
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,370
Which one of you will live?

417
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,830
It's your choice.

418
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:39,750
Father.

419
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,150
Biqing.

420
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,270
Grand Councilor.

421
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,870
Biqing is inexperienced

422
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,990
and has no official position.

423
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,320
He's unable to help you.

424
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:51,950
Father!

425
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,280
If you hadn't brought Bai Yuan to our home,

426
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,300
he wouldn't have had the chance to hide Zornia there.

427
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,750
You should take responsibility for your mistake!

428
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,220
Father.

429
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,590
I'm still young!

430
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,310
You're old.

431
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,350
You should have lived long enough.

432
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:04,750
You...

433
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,350
Bullshit!

434
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,990
You have to die sooner or later!

435
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,410
You...

436
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,840
-Die!
-You bastard!

437
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,470
Think of this as leaving Grandfather's descendant in the world!

438
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,600
Grand...

439
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,390
Grand Councilor.

440
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,280
When will you get me out?

441
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,240
Alright.

442
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,050
Biqing.

443
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,820
I'll send you on your way now.

444
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,550
Thank you, Grand Councilor!

445
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,110
Come on.

446
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,650
Send him to his death now!

447
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,670
Pei Linfu!

448
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,550
How could you let this happen?

449
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,210
Commander.

450
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,160
Two hours ago,

451
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,200
two people came here.

452
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,630
They had His Majesty's token with them

453
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,830
and asked us to leave.

454
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,270
They are from the palace?

455
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,970
The only way now

456
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,270
is to meet His Majesty.

457
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,390
But you are still a criminal.

458
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,440
I, Shang Bieli,

459
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,480
brought criminal Jiang Xinbai

460
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,880
to see Your Majesty.

461
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,490
Greetings, Grand Councilor.

462
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,170
Commander Shang.

463
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,650
You did a fabulous job

464
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,080
bringing the criminal to His Majesty.

465
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Grand Councilor.

466
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,430
Guards.

467
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,410
Yes.

468
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,790
Jiang Xinbai,

469
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,200
you colluded with Zornia criminals.

470
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,570
Take him down

471
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,330
and send him to the Imperial Prison.

472
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:00,650
Yes.

473
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,670
Grand Councilor.

474
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,660
Commander Shang,

475
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,620
you have also worked hard.

476
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,770
From now on,

477
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,050
you are relieved of your command.

478
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,760
Go home and rest.

479
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,850
I'll do what you said.

480
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,270
Commander Shang.

481
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,930
Her Majesty wishes to see you.

482
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,350
Your Majesty.

483
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Commander Shang.

484
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,670
No need to stand on ceremony.

485
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,770
I know what happened

486
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,030
in the Imperial Study.

487
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,450
Your Majesty, please help us.

488
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,350
There's nothing I can do now.

489
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,250
Since the grand councilor

490
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,590
used incense to relieve His Majesty's headache,

491
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,630
he's been the only one His Majesty trusts.

492
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,430
But recently,

493
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,910
His Majesty's condition has deteriorated.

494
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,570
He's been asleep all the time.

495
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,690
This is unusual.

496
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,890
He's been asleep all the time?

497
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,510
Your Majesty, do you suspect

498
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,790
the incense is poisonous?

499
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,470
Yes.

500
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,060
But Pei Linfu

501
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,490
has His Majesty's token.

502
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,030
Seeing the token

503
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,580
is like seeing His Majesty.

504
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,070
Commander Shang.

505
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,990
You must find a way.

506
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,770
Forgive me for asking.

507
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,370
If I have a way to save His Majesty,

508
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,430
will you cooperate?

509
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,530
Of course.

510
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,890
Did you kill

511
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,910
Yan Jinglun and Yan Biqing?

512
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:27,390
Yes.

513
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,110
They sold Zornia without permission.

514
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,640
They should be executed according to the law.

515
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,590
What?

516
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,850
You think I shouldn't have

517
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,720
killed them?

518
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,910
Don't you think what you said

519
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,700
is ridiculous?

520
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,790
Li Jun.

521
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,750
Lu Dingzhao.

522
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,360
Yan Jinglun and Yan Biqing.

523
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,240
These people

524
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,990
were just your pawns.

525
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,190
You are the mastermind

526
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,080
behind the Zornia case.

527
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,110
Lu Dingzhao

528
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,230
was not ruthless enough.

529
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,560
He was willing to kill himself

530
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,760
to save his grandson.

531
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,310
Yan Jinglun

532
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,940
was weak and incompetent.

533
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,070
He couldn't even

534
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,070
control Bai Yuan.

535
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,510
As for your father...

536
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,780
My father

537
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,630
was also killed by you?

538
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,030
He

539
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,540
didn't know how to evaluate the situation

540
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,800
and asked for trouble.

541
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,510
Anyway,

542
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,890
these three people

543
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,750
signed their own death warrants.

544
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,870
You sold Zornia without permission

545
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,070
and caused the deaths of so many innocent people!

546
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,550
What?

547
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:56,870
You

548
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,270
want to kill me?

549
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,140
Jiang Xinbai.

550
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,470
You

551
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,120
are weak now.

552
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,510
What can you do to me?

553
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,140
However, the lives of the Jiang family

554
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,230
and Yan Nanxing

555
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,030
are all

556
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,910
in my hands.

557
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,670
It's super easy for me

558
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,510
to kill you.

559
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,270
Now,

560
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,910
I'm giving you a chance.

561
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,590
I've been working on the elixir of life for years,

562
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,990
but I haven't succeeded.

563
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,790
Maybe

564
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,390
I can find the answer

565
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,290
in Yan Nanxing.

566
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,630
If you tell me how Yan Nanxing

567
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,680
shapeshifts,

568
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,320
I can consider

569
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,280
letting you two

570
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,720
die quickly together.

571
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,870
Otherwise,

572
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,670
I'll make you wish you were dead.

573
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,220
Pei Linfu.

574
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,310
If you want to know,

575
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,440
I can tell you

576
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,200
everything.

577
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,350
But

578
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,640
I want to see Yan Nanxing first.

579
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,790
Fine.

580
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,150
Very well!

581
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,150
How dare you bargain with me?

582
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,710

I'll give you one day to think

584
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,190
about whether

585
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,550
to tell me.

590
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,950
I want to see

591
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,660
how many people will die

592
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,690

00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,070
The grand councilor?

611
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,040
How could it be him?

612
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,250
I'll confront him face-to-face.

613
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:21,750
Let me see how hypocritical he is.

614
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,489

615
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,270

616
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,670
Calm down.

617
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,750
If you make a scene at this moment,

618
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,060
it'll make things worse.

619
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,020
Besides, Grandfather is still sick.

620
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,110
We can't put him under any stress.

621
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,630
But Xinbai...

00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,580
We need to take our time to think of a plan.

Yes.

Xinbai is still in the Imperial Prison.

629
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,440
We can break into the palace

630
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,560

Open your eyes

How dare you be rude to me?

639
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,030
I'll ask the grand councilor to kill you.

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,840
I dare not.

00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,990

I'm here to replace you.

Go to the palace after you leave here.

652
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,310
Don't break into the palace.

653
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,920

00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,780

00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,230
caught her

659
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,960
and locked her in a secret room.

660
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,570
How did you know?

661
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,810
Your Highness.

00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,750
It was all my fault.

663
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,190
I shouldn't have trusted Pei Linfu.

664
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,390
I thought I could protect the Jiang family

665
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,710
if I turned to his side.

666
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,220
I didn't expect he'd use me

667
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,180
to harm the duke and his wife.

668
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,100
Although you did something wrong,

669
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,790
you realized your mistake and decided to make up for it.

670
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,870
That means you're still loyal

671
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,000
to the Jiang family.

672
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,050

674
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,340

I'm going to the secret room

676
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,670

Your Highness, listen to me.

679
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,750
The grand councilor only knows

680
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,350
the duchess can shapeshift,

681
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,790
but he doesn't know how she does it.

682
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,350
So,

683
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,110
by telling him the duchess has shapeshifted into me,

684
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,240
I can buy us time.

685
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,870
No. It's too dangerous.

686
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,550
I made the Jiang family

687
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,410
and you suffer.

688
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,750
I must make up

689
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,720
for my mistake.

Trust me.

Yuchen.

695
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,160
Pei Linfu used you to divide the Jiang family.

696
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,760
It's good that you realized your mistake.

697
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,500
Your Highness,

698
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,410
I'm also a member of the Jiang family.

After Ms. Bai swaps Yan Nanxing out,

701
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,670
take her to the palace

702
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,880
to meet the Empress.

703
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,150
She has promised

704
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,770
to find a way to let us see His Majesty.

705
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,310
Okay.

706
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,380

707
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:53,910
Yes.

00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,500
Only you can cure

709
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,390
His Majesty's Zornia poisoning.

710

What will happen to you

712
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,240
if Pei Linfu finds out?

713
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,400
No.

714
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,800
You'll be in danger!

715
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,440
You must get out.

716
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,310
Yan Nanxing,

717
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,860
I'm not doing this for you

718
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,480
but for His Majesty's life.

719
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,310
Only when His Majesty is fine

720
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,000
will the Jiang family be safe

721
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,680
and the whole country be safe.

722
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:22,870
Ms. Bai.

723
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,680
Are you alright?

724
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,430
Yes.

725
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,970
Go. There's not much time left.

726
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,820
This is our only chance.

727
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,080
Only in this way can we save Jiang Xinbai.

728
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,190
Please

729
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,550
take care of the princess in the future.

We can't put all our hopes

732
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,330
on Nanxing.

733
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,690
We must do whatever it takes

734
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,880
to get Xinbai out.

735
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,960
This is what I think.

736

But both of us

738
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,920
How can we enter the palace?

739
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,330
We can barge in.

740
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,510
Stop!
