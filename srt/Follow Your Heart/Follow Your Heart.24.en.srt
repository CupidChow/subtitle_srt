00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,670
Missing?

5
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,509
According to Daqi's law,

6
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,440
every adult man

7
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,729
should be registered.

8
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,509
There are three copies of the register.

9
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,509
One in the county,

10
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,840
one in the state,

11
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,120
and one in the Ministry of Revenue.

12
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,910
The register is updated every three years.

13
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,040
The record of the man

14
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,950
you're looking for

15
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,950
hasn't been updated

16
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,940
for 15 years.

17
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,509
I copied his record

18
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,170
from the Ministry of Revenue.

19
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,330
Take a look. Is it him?

20
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,070
Went missing?

21
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,980
What does that mean?

22
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,090
His whereabouts are unknown.

23
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,310
Or

24
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,720
he may have died.

25
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,800
I've said what needs to be said.

26
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,510
Thank you

How about this?

104
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,830
If he's upset you,

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,060
I'll go beat him up.

106

No, no, no.

107
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,030
Sit.

108
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,910
Sit down.

109
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,470
Actually, he didn't do

110
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,090
anything wrong.

111
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,920
He saved my mom and me after all.

112
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,760
I just feel

113
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,870
a bit embarrassed.

114
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,270
Why are you embarrassed?

115
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,540
He'll regret rejecting you.

116
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,409
You're adorable, Sai'er.

117
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,130
You have a point.

118
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,810
It seems that

119
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,870
I have to work hard.

120
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,370
You're already working hard.

121
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,470
Well,

122
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,260
I'm talking about Blossom Beauty.

123
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,640
The store has reopened.

124
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,530
I'm going back.

125
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,310
Here.

126
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,550
Take this.

127
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,900
Take it.

128
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,590
Smell it.

129
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,070
Okay.

130
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,300
Pack up later.

131
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,540
I'll send you back.

132
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,510
You're always jabbering around me.

133
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,070
After you leave,

134
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,190
I don't know if I can get used to the quiet.

135
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,070
Don't worry.

136
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,660
I promised you

137
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,430
to help you regain your sense of smell.

138
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,790
I'll visit often.

139
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,330
It's not visiting.

140
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,510
It's coming back.

141
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,120
Apart from Blossom Beauty,

142
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,610
this is also your home.

143
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,210
Understand?

144
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,670
Smell this.

145
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,710
This one is nice too.

146
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,120
Here.

147
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,190
And this one.

148
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,480
This is good.

149
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,800
Take it.

150
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,810
Stay close to me.

151
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,710
Mr. Shang.

152
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,250
You don't have to escort me to work.

153
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,790
Don't you think it's too high-profile?

154
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,670
I want everyone in the capital to see us.

155
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,530
Why?

156
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,000
You're a troublemaker.

157
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,720
When I'm not around,

158
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,210
they'll recognize you

159
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,400
and know you're under my protection,

160
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,380
so they won't dare mess with you.

161
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,090
Thank you, Mr. Shang.

162
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,610
Sai'er.

163
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,419
You can take your time

164
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,690
to find your fiancé.

165
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,669
Your mother asked you to find him

166
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,789
because she wanted you

167
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,250
to have someone to rely on.

168
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,380
If you can find someone

169
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,810
who can take care of you

170
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,240
and give you a home,

171
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,960
she'd be relieved, right?

172
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,510
Although I don't have a home now,

173
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,110
I can set down roots here.

174
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,200
I will build

175
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,510
my own home

176
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,240
and invite all the people I love

177
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,040
to live in it.

178
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,870
Mr. Shang.

179
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,950
I want you to live in it too.

180
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,440
Will you be my family?

181
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,190
Family?

182
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,440
Let's become brother and sister.

183
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,950
Brother and sister?

184
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,230
There's no time like the present.

185
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,760
Let's take the oath today.

186
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,790
With heaven and earth as witnesses,

187
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,830
I, Tong Sai'er, take you, Shang Bieli,

188
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,520
as my sworn brother.

189
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,710
Wait.

190
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,690
It's not the right time.

191
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,430
Then when is the right time?

192
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,590
No rush.

193
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,160
I'll walk you back first.

194
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,790
Mr. Shang.

195
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,320
Do you not want

196
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,610
to be my sworn brother?

197
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,280
That's not the case.

198
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,510
I just…

199
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,790
It's okay.

200
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,190
I'm just a country girl.

201
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,950
You're too good for me.

202
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,350
Sorry, Mr. Shang.

203
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,610
I-I'm too abrupt.

204
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,560
Why did you call me Mr. Shang again?

205
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,920
That's too polite.

206
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,550
Then…

207
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,430
Shang?

208
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,450
Stay close to me.

209
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,380

You've only been here for a few days,

212
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,150
yet you've broken

213
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,550
ten plates in the kitchen

214
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,910
and overwatered six plants in the yard.

215
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,370

216
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,470
tore the commander's coat

217
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,450
when washing it.

218
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,550
Try this.

219
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,700
This is also delicious.

223
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,260
Who made these dishes?

00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,700
Well…

225
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,450
Why does this fish dish have fish?

226
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,680
The tofu is so soft. How can I eat it?

227
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,310
And the eggplant…

228
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,510
It tastes just like eggplants!

229
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,240
Remake them!

230
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,350

The fatal wound

243
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,640
is the stab through his chest.

244
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,310

00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,220
of going to them now?

311
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,869
Without evidence,

312
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,810
you can't take revenge

313
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,609

pay with their lives today!

If Yao Qianshu had died,

317
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,849
would you still be so calm?

318
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,900
Move aside!

00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,790
Calm down.

Lady Gaya and General Nan

326
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,950

327

I'll ask His Majesty

331
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,110
to allow me to look into the Li family and the Lu family.

332
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,030

If I hadn't

349
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,620
asked General Nan to go to Tingzhou…

350
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,590

00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,270

365

It's early in the morning.

369

Are you going to see His Majesty?

370
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,870
Are you going to use these fake artworks

371
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,980
and ledgers to denounce me?

372
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,150
Mr. Jiang.

373
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,110
Let me remind you.

374
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,280
Some of the paintings

375
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,910
on these ledgers aren't in my hands.

376
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,920
For example,

377

the painting called Flying Fairy.

378
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,840
Does it sound familiar?

379
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,390
Your Highness, I know you love paintings and calligraphy,

380
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,030
so

381
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,270
I went to Qiuci to get the painting

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,700

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,840
your grandfather in a long time, right?

387
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,980
He's old now.

388
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,990
Spend more time with him.

389
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,140
The sun is setting, and the boat is drifting away.

390
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,960
The fairy is dancing in the air as gracefully as a swan.

391
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,630
Brilliant.

392
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,670
This is brilliant!

393
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,640
Your Grace, you're indeed

394
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,050
the most talented woman in the country.

395
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,790
This poem

396
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,110
and this painting

397
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,750
really

398
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,990
complement each other, My Highness.

399
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,660
If you can stamp it,

400
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,070
this painting

401
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,470
will become

402
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,030
priceless

403
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,610
and unparalleled.

404
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,950
Really?

405
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:36,890
Yes.

406
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:37,820
Then…

407
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:38,940
Stamp it?

408
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,490
Stamp it.

409
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,510
Stamp it.

410
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,540
Great.

411
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,580
I

412
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,880
got to appreciate this painting

413
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,910
with Your Highness and Your Grace.

414
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,360
I feel very honored.

415
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,220
The honor is mine.

416
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,240
I just came to visit my grandfather

417
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,150
and didn't expect

418
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,110
to see such a great painting.

419
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,350
Xinbai?

420
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,090
What brought you here?

421
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,430
Hi, Mr. Jiang.

422
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,750
Are you here to appreciate the painting?

423
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,680
What a pleasant surprise.

424
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,750
Lu Dingzhao.

425
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,060
You're so despicable.

426
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,630
Xinbai.

427
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,110
That's no way

428
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,400
to talk to an elder.

429
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,610
Your Highness.

430
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,630
There must be some misunderstanding.

431
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,670
Mr. Jiang.

432
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,840
I've given His Highness

433
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,200
many artworks as gifts.

434
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,990
Flying Fairy

435
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,000
is just one of them.

436
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,300
Why did I do that?

437
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,030
I believe

438
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,990
someone as smart as you

439
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,470
can definitely

440
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,300
have it all

441
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,160
figured out,

442
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,230
right?

443
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,210
Your Highness.

444
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,430
Since both your grandson and granddaughter

445
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,540
are here,

446
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,710
I

447
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,830
will leave you guys to talk.

448
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,950
Mr. Jiang.

449
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,200
Take care.

450
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,670
Grandfather.

451
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,110
Xinbai.

452
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,330
What did Mr. Lu mean?

453
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,350
Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

454
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,790
are the ringleaders in the Zornia case.

455
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,230
General Nan

456
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,160
was also killed by them.

457
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,990
What?

458
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,590
What?

459
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,570
General Nan died?

460
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,310
Does Shang know?

461
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,210
Lu Dingzhao has had a trap set for me.

462
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,450
The paintings he sent Grandfather

463
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,260
are the beginning of his trap.

464
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,410
If I expose him,

465
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,110
Grandfather

466
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,960
will be implicated.

467
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,870
I…

468
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,740
I…

469
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,790
I'm tearing it apart.

470
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,590
It's too late.

471
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,870
[Yanxing Gate]

472
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,550
Jiang Xinbai.

473
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,360
Looks like he's not coming.

474
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,950
Dead?

475
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,220
How did Nan Jifeng die?

476
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,130
On his way to Tingzhou,

477
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,960
he was ambushed and killed.

478
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,350
Tingzhou?

479
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,720
When did he leave the capital?

480
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,470
Why didn't he come to meet me first?

481
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,110
He…

482
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,440
He and I were looking for evidence.

483
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,690
What evidence?

484
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,190
The evidence that Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

485
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,050
have been profiting from Zornia.

486
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,150
Have you found any?

487
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,030
Do you know

488
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,700
it's a felony

489
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,170
to falsely accuse

490
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,890
a high-ranking official?

491
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,810
I'm telling the truth.

492
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,690
Your Majesty,

493
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,710
please let me investigate them.

494
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,190
I can definitely find the evidence.

495
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,990
Investigate?

496
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,550
How?

497
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,120
Looking into two officials

498
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,550
to prove alleged crimes

499
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,910
or going to Tingzhou recklessly

500
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,190
to look into Nan Jifeng's death?

501
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,160
Both of them.

502
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,320
How dare you!

503
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,360
Mr. Lu and Mr. Li

504
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,550
have clean records,

505
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,870
while Nan Jifeng

506
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,400
is still a wanted criminal.

507
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,590
Without any evidence,

508
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,500
you want me to allow you to investigate them.

509
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,670
Do you want me to be laughed at

510
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,240
for not knowing right from wrong?

511
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:18,990
Your Majesty.

512
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:19,440
I…

513
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,230
Where is Jiang Xinbai?

514
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,840
I don't know.

515
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,880
I allowed you two to work together.

516
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,270
Haven't you taken my words seriously?

517
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,710
I'm afraid Jiang Xinbai

518
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,310
doesn't know when Nan Jifeng

519
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,350
left the capital either.

520
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,450
You have nothing to say?

521
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:44,980
Guards.

522
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,230
Yes.

523
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,270
Cane him 100 times.

524
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,390
Yes.

525
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:55,990
One.

526
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,350
Two.

527
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,630
Three.

528
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,150
Four.

529
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,480
If it hurts,

530
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,860
just say it.

531
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,370
How could this happen?

532
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,820
You and Mr. Jiang…

533
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,730
Don't mention him.

534
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,390
Father.

535
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,270
I don't think you can

536
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,180
get off the hook this time.

537
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,070
Father!

538
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,310
Are you a fool?

539
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,150
Why did you

540
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,530
accept these things?

541
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,770
They're using them against us now.

542
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,400
What should we do?

543
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,910
Zhiyi.

544
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,410
Father has been deceived.

545
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,190
It's my fault.

546
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,890
I won countless wars on the battlefield,

547
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,430
yet

548
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,080
I've been fooled

549
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,640
by that old fox Lu Dingzhao.

550
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:17,990
Tomorrow,

551
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,470
I'll explain everything to His Majesty.

552
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,070
Xinbai.

553
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,440
Back then,

554
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,190
I gave up on your father.

555
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,230
This time,

556
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,550
I won't drag you down too.

557
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,160
No.

558
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,470
Since this is their trap,

559
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,870
I'm afraid no one will believe you're innocent.

560
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,430
Besides,

561
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,450
His Majesty

562
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,790
has always seen the Jiang family

563
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,870
as a threat.

564
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,140
If this matter

565
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,180
gets out of hand,

566
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,360
I'm afraid His Majesty won't help us.

567
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,950
Suoluo is right.

568
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,810
End of the day,

569
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,790
their target is me.

570
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,170
If anyone is to blame,

571
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,160
I'm to blame for dragging Grandfather in.

572
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,550
Boy,

573
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,190
over the years,

574
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,790
because of the Jiang family,

575
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,760
I've misunderstood you

576
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,990
and been harsh on you.

577
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
Sorry.

578
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,340
Lu Dingzhao is such a scumbag.

579
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,440
I won't let him

580
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,440
get away with it!

581
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,270
Sai'er?

582
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,270
Mr. Jiang.

583
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,430
His Majesty gave Shang the cane.

584
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,610
[Peace Reigns]

585
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,200
Mr. Jiang.

586
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,430
Check on Shang.

587
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,310
Why didn't you come?

588
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,030
Why didn't you fight back?

589
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,310
I stood you up.

590
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,860
I failed you

591
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,360
and General Nan.

592
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,350
Why did you fail us?

593
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,150
Why?

594
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,570
Jiang Xinbai, listen.

595
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,460
No matter what reason you have,

596
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,550
my brother and I

597
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,880
will never forgive you.

598
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,120
Shang.

599
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,290
Shang, calm down.

600
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,300
Let me treat your wounds.

601
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,430
They're too severe.

602
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,440
Let's go.

603
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,150
Slow down.

604
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,250
Be careful. Slow down.

605
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,850
What happened?

606
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,080
Shang Bieli said Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

607
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,120
have been profiting from Zornia

608
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,580
and murdered Nan Jifeng.

609
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,590
Do you agree?

610
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,370
They're indeed suspicious.

611
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,150
But

612
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,630
I have no evidence.

613
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,150
Then, did Nan Jifeng

614
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,160
go to Tingzhou

615
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,070
to find the truth?

616
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,630
Yes.

617
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,510
General Nan

618
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,290
died wrongly because I was arrogant

619
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,940
and willful.

620
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,710
Mr. Shang

621
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,870
didn't know General Nan

622
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,630
left the capital.

623
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,710
Did he?

624
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,350
I didn't tell Mr. Shang about it

625
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,810
until General Shang left.

626
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,710
Mr. Shang

627
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,080
and General Nan

628
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,070
were very close.

629
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,330
If he had known,

630
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,190
he wouldn't have let General Nan

631
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,250
take the risk of leaving the capital.

632
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,510
General Nan's death

633
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:17,840
should be

634
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,630
blamed on me.

635
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,699
Blamed on you?

636
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,280
You're in big trouble yourself,

637
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,940
yet you're trying to help him?

638
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
You're right.

639
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,719
You're too arrogant.

640
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,270
Jiang Xinbai.

641
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,909
I'm so disappointed in you.

642
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,270
From now on,

643
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,690
you're dismissed.

644
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,070
Go home and reflect on yourself.

645
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,010
Wait for further instructions.

646
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,390
Yes,

647
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,710
Your Majesty.

648
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,450
My lord.

649
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,310
[Prevent Wrongful Convictions and Don't Coddle Criminals]

650
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,830
Xinbai.

651
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,870
Mr. Yan?

652
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,860
His Majesty appointed me

653
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,550
the new chief constable.

654
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,810
With you leading the Inspection Office,

655
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,000
I can be relieved.

656
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,010
I was worried Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

657
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,020
would get a henchman of theirs

658
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,330
to take charge of the Inspection Office.

659
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,440
Mr. Yan.

660
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,950
They won't give up.

661
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,910
Be careful.

662
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,550
Don't worry, Xinbai.

663
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,590
As long as I'm here,

664
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,170
you still have hope

665
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,550
to turn the tide.

666
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,810
Now that he's been dismissed,

667
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,690
there won't be

668
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,970
any severer punishment.

669
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,040
It seems that

670
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,550
the death of Nan Jifeng

671
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,020
is not enough to completely

672
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,710
defeat Jiang Xinbai.

673
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,640
Father-in-law.

674
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,470
What should we do now?

675
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,430
As long as Jiang Xinbai

676
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,640
continues the investigation,

677
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,440
he'll make mistakes.

678
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,310
But

679
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,480
what if he doesn't make any mistakes?

680
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,800
If he doesn't,

681
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,770
the woman by his side

682
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,320
will make mistakes.

683
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,220
I'll send someone…

684
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,910
to keep an eye on Yan Nanxing.

685
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,160
The tea

686
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,940
only tastes good when it's hot.

687
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,270
It won't taste good when it's cold.

688
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,310
It's the same in life.

689
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,110
Understand?

690
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,590
Yes.

691
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,300
Yao Qianshu.

692
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,110
You're not a drinker

693
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,430
but are now drowning your sorrows

694
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,290
and wallowing in self-loathing.

695
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,830
Is this what General Nan would want to see?

696
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,030
I let you down, my lord.

697
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,780
I failed General Nan.

698
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,110
My lord.

699
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,140
Why didn't I die?

700
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,780
General Nan died.

701
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,860
I got badly injured.

702
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,340
You were dismissed.

703
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,310
Have we

704
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,630
lost the game?

705
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,490
Wickedness runs rampant.

706
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,400
His Majesty is merciless.

707
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,030
Is such a country worth saving?

708
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,390
Is it really worth sacrificing so much?

709
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,100
I remember,

710
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,150
when I was young,

711
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,370
I asked my father similar questions.

712
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:27,630
Father,

713
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,330
you devoted yourself to the country and the people,

714
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,670
but you ended up

715
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,090
being criticized by all.

716
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:33,990
Father.

717
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,510
Why aren't you angry?

718
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,070
Why?

719
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,890
The country asked everyone to obey me

720
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,390
because it believed

721
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,430
that I had some strengths

722
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,880
and could endure the humiliation and bear the heavy burden.

723
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,450
I don't understand.

724
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,560
You'll understand,

725
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,710
Son.

726
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,690
Do you have the answer now?

727
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,430
All I know is that

728
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,450
I seem to have understood

729
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,160
why my father

730
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,920
was so adamant back then.

731
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:26,950
Because

732
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,140
this is our mission

733
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,630
and duty.

734
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,240
Have you figured something out?

735
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,550
Maybe

736
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,710
we should try

737
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,590
everything.

738
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,270
Even if we'll hit a wall,

739
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,870
it's better than doing nothing.

740
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,650
Take the medicine.

741
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,070
Get better soon.

742
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,510
Leave the rest

743
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,710
to me.

744
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,830
I'll find a way.

745
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,930
General Nan's death

746
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,330
was not your fault.

747
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:18,840
But General Nan died

748
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,870
because of me.

749
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,030
Maybe

750
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,250
when Yan Zhizhong died back then,

751
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:30,790
my father

752
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:34,070
felt the same way I do now.

753
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,990
No.

754
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,110
This is those bad guys' trap.

755
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,590
If you break down,

756
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,230
they'll get what they want.

757
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,730
We need to make a comeback.

758
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,600
Yan Nanxing.

759
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,240
Don't worry.

760
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,130
I won't break down.

761
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,050
And I won't give up easily.

762
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:57,820
But

763
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,360
I want to ask you,

764
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,930
if we can't

765
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:03,870
make a comeback

766
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,820
and I can't be reinstated,

767
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,710
or even worse,

768
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:11,070
if I can't stay in the capital…

769
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,070
That's fine.

770
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,450
I'll take you away.

771
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,000
This is a big world.

772
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,930
