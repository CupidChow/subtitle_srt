00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:04,022
Light Shop

2
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,449
She must have been
in a lot of pain.

3
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:19,454
That's why we clean and shroud,
so painful reminders are put out of sight.

4
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,872
Right.

5
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,374
When she moves on...

6
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,168
she'll forget things,

7
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,545
like what went on here.

8
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,634
- Let's put her in.
- Okay.

9
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,352
- Do you know why we do a three-day wake?
- Uh.

10
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,439
Isn't it so that those in mourning
can have some time

11
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,191
to gather after a death?

12
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,235
Partly yes, but it's not just that.

13
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,945
So, what else?

14
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,948
It's our tradition.

15
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,783
We've done it for centuries.

16
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,579
We waited three days...

17
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,166
in the hopes that the deceased
might come back to life.

18
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,255
So it's the family's last chance
to hold onto hope

19
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,924
before they have to say
their final goodbyes.

20
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,760
Not just the living need to say goodbye.

21
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,887
The deceased need to say goodbye, too.

22
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,559
To the deceased, those days are a gift.

23
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,394
One last courtesy.

24
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,731
That's why it's a three-day wake.

25
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,526
Or in other words,

26
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:35,655
three days is all that remains
before there is nothing left.

27
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:44,372
Episode 6: Three-day Funeral

28
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,294
I love you.

29
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,641
I love you, Lee Jiyoung! Can you hear me?

30
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,815
Me, too!

31
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,363
Jiyoung, I love you, too.

32
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,508
Hhhh... huhh...

33
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,721
Hhh... huh...

34
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,185
Kim...

35
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,938
Hyun...

36
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,483
Min.

37
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,864
Kim...

38
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,992
Hyun...

39
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,621
Min.

40
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,382
Love you.

41
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,971
Miss you so much.

42
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,813
NOT IN SERVICE

43
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,163
Pay respects.

44
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,128
Ms. Lee Jiyoung, 32 years of age.

45
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,423
We are now going to remove
that which was left behind.

46
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,426
Um, I feel like a burglar
doing this at night, you know?

47
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,388
The landlord's trying to keep it quiet.

48
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,807
Oh, jeez.

49
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,184
You have no heart at all.

50
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,186
The lady only passed away just last night.

51
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,439
She's at rest, wherever she is.

52
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,734
Let's start with the store.

53
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,653
- Then we'll do her room.
- Right.

54
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,575
Let's start.

55
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,538
PRESS THE BUTTON IN CASE OF ABSENCE

56
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,665
Oh... she's a deaf per--

57
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,209
What's wrong?

58
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,550
- We need to go.
- What?

59
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,928
I don't think
she's left just yet.

60
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,014
What are you saying?

61
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,184
We'll come back later.
We're leaving.

62
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,729
Get the light.

63
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,821
What the hell.

64
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,410
What is this place?

65
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,730
Jeez.

66
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,290
Do you hear that sound?

67
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,499
What sound?

68
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,712
It's like a cutting sound.

69
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,256
Is it coming from the movie?

70
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,575
Hey, what are you doing?

71
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,998
There was a suitcase right here.

72
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,792
Wait, what?

73
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,503
Right here,
the seat's still down.

74
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,879
Maybe it's broken.

75
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,590
- I'm scared. I wanna go.
- Hey. Wait for me.

76
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,124
Don't... you recognize me?

77
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,211
Have we met already?

78
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,805
Sorry if that was forward.
I'll, uh, leave you.

79
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,935
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

80
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,647
We met right here yesterday
and we talked and everything.

81
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,610
Oh, this is...

82
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,864
'Cause you saw me today, and yesterday,
and the day before that?

83
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,992
What about tomorrow?

84
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,410
What?

85
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,955
Well, it's nearly midnight,
and the day's ending soon.

86
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:19,251
Three days is all that remains
before there's nothing left.

87
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,421
I don't have much time left.

88
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,300
Hey, what is it?

89
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,928
- We have a problem, sir.
- Problem?

90
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,555
We need to clean the body,
but the door won't open.

91
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,640
Hmm?

92
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,311
That's odd.

93
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,022
The fridge is still working,
but the door is stuck.

94
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,025
Should I get someone to come take it off?

95
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,652
She must be resentful.

96
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,029
Let's give her time.

97
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,699
Uh, resentful?

98
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,992
Oh.

99
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,662
NAME: LEE JIYOUNG
AGE: 32

100
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,289
GENDER: FEMALE
REMARKS: FUNERAL ARRANGEMENT CONFIRMED

101
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,917
Why don't you stay a while?
It's raining hard.

102
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,043
I'll be fine.

103
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,879
You don't have an umbrella.

104
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,509
This is the only place open
at this hour.

105
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,762
The one you're looking for
could end up coming around.

106
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,606
You mind if it's instant coffee?

107
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,941
It's fine. Thanks.

108
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,011
What's with the look?

109
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,722
You've been studying my face
for quite some time now.

110
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,641
Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,728
You always keep
a close eye on people, huh?

112
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,565
Well, it's my job to deal with customers.

113
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,486
You're wearing sunglasses,
I assume, because it's so bright?

114
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,363
Yes.

115
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,368
The young lady from before.

116
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,870
Young lady, stop.

117
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,583
Oh, that young lady.

118
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,294
It seems as if...

119
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,463
when you look at someone,

120
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,089
you seem to notice something's off.

121
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,216
Yeah, well, that's my job, you know.

122
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,807
Someone made that for me.

123
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,895
The girl who was here?

124
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,605
Yes.

125
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,026
You don't look old enough
to have a daughter her age.

126
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,862
My line of work has taught me

127
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,698
how to get a decent read on someone
with just a look.

128
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,660
Yet I just can't figure out
how old you are.

129
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,709
I had a daughter.

130
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,670
Do you have any children?

131
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,714
Yes, I did.

132
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,175
Named her, too.

133
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,930
We had a miscarriage.

134
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,102
The rain has stopped.

135
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,145
That's enough for now.

136
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,815
Will you look for him all night?

137
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,274
It's what I do.

138
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,568
Why are you working so hard to find him?

139
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,029
There isn't anything else I have left.

140
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,491
See you again.

141
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:41,912
Yeah.

142
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,822
I should be showing already,
don't you think?

143
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,867
I'll buy some meat in the morning, okay?

144
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,079
You need to slow down.

145
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,372
You working today?

146
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,082
They need me on the night shift,
last minute.

147
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,835
Why do you work all the time, huh?

148
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,879
It's about saving lives.

149
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,213
I need to do it.

150
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,798
I'm sorry.

151
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,365
ILKWANG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

152
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,737

HAETSAL

157
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,843
I was four months along...

158
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,720
and I wasn't showing at all.

159
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,473
It was a miscarriage.

160
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,564
I was alone at the hospital
and they told me.

161
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,026
I knitted her a hat,

162
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,569
I bought her shoes,

163
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,574
gave her a name, and a nickname too.

164
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,121
Your health... are you okay?

165
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,956
Hm.

166
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,791
I think so.

167
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,503
I'm just, uh...

168
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,718
I'm sorry.

169
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,137
Truly.

170
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,599
I'm sorry.

171
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,810
You feel sorry for our child?

172
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,357
Of course I do.

173
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,900
You're that dog, aren't you?

174
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,904
Stay quite.

175
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,242
There's a strange guy looking for you.

176
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,035
You'll get in trouble if he finds you.

177
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,080
Hey, hey.

178
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,206
Go away.

179
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,128
I said go away. Go. Go.

180
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,811
Hey, Mom! Mom! I'm home! Can--

181
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,077
Excuse me.

182
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,955
Do you live there?

183
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,042
What? Oh, yes.

184
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,337
Have you seen me before by chance?

185
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,132
Uh... no.

186
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,344
When did I even move in?

187
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,557
How long have you been living there?

188
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,309
Uh... uh...

189
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,230
Mister!

190
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,150
Leave him.

191
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,110
He's mine.

192
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,903
What?

193
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,239
Move. I'm in a hurry.

194
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,843
You two... remember each other.

195
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,350
We are the same, but...

196
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,356
...why am I different?

197
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,108
Why?

198
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:31,037
Mom! Mom, she's gone.

199
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,831
She's gone already!

200
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,376
Ah, jeez.

201
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,753
Mom, couldn't you hear me?

202
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,547
Didn't you hear me calling for you?

203
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,423
Why didn't you open the door?

204
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,509
And-- And what did that woman just say?

205
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,511
Mom, will you answer me?

206
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,721
You've been acting really weird lately.

207
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,060
Aw, come on,
just give me an answer!

208
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,230
What?

209
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,940
Light bulb?

210
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,025
No, I didn't buy a light bulb.

211
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,237
I can't go to the light shop anymore.
I'm scared to go!

212
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,989
I can't go, Mom!

213
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,324
I said I don't have a light bulb.

214
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,161
I've been running
into a lot of really weird people lately.

215
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,998
Mom, are you listening to me?

216
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,084
This is so frustrating!

217
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,503
You don't care about me at all!

218
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,591
I have no friends.

219
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,802
They ignore what I say
and pretend they don't even know me,

220
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,804
and think I'm weird.

221
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,265
Get rid of this!

222
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,185
You broke all this stuff!

223
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,355
If you're going to break it,
then why make me buy more?

224
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,066
I'm not going to buy a light bulb,

225
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,610
I can't do it!

226
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:47,405
I'm not leaving here again!

227
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,254
I don't know why...

228
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,257
you can't remember me.

229
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,698
Where do we go now?

230
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,777
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

231
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,529
Oh.

232
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,823
You can see me?

233
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,908
Yes.

234
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,160
Are you dead?

235
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,121
No.

236
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,831
I nearly died once.

237
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,751
Oh, my goodness. That's a new one.

238
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,715
The world is full of all sorts of people,
including those who are different.

239
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,010
Is that so?

240
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,518
May I ask what you're doing here?

241
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,354
They're crying.

242
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,858
And it's because of me. I can't stand it.

243
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,984
So I left.

244
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,779
- Hm.
- It was my time,

245
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,655
but they're all crying.

246
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,540
Who was that young man
who was sitting next to you earlier?

247
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,377
My youngest grandson.

248
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,671
I doted on him all the time.

249
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,548
He's a good-looking guy.

250
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,176
Right? So good-looking.

251
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,141
I'm going to forget my grandson.

252
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,810
That's the one thing I regret.

253
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,229
You will?

254
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,316
I get shrouded today.

255
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,609
Next day, I go.

256
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,903
Oh.

257
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,989
I'll forget
about this world when I go,

258
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,658
everything I knew.

259
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,493
Hmm.

260
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,662
Huh...

261
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,414
You have to forget it all.

262
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,874
It's the way it is.

263
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,502
Today is my last day.

264
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,549
I'm supposed to forget everything.

265
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,761
Yet I can't stop thinking
about my grandson.

266
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,891
I'd love it if someone could say I'm fine.

267
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,976
Could you do that?

268
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,894
Uh...

269
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,911
What is that?

270
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,373
It's my lunch.

271
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,170
Oh, you have to eat something hot,
it's not enough for you.

272
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,213
There's yukgaejang inside.

273
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,426
I'm eating this because it's good.

274
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,180
Tell me more about your grandson.

275
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,182
- Should I?
- Mm.

276
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,728
I loved and cared for him very much...

277
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:32,315
and I raised him
since he was just a little baby.

278
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,608
Mm.

279
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,153
Every time
I changed his dirty diaper,

280
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,531
he would smile so beautifully.

281
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,701
That's how I raised him.

282
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,453
And he is such a good boy.

283
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,413
He always put me first...

284
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,921
Hm.

285
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,314
What?

286
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,692
Huh? Nothing.

287
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,736
You have a cotton swab?

288
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,571
My ears are so itchy.

289
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,783
It's like I'm hearing things.

290
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,119
Maybe tinnitus?

291
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,622
Maybe your ears are sensitive.

292
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,332
Sensitive? Not tinnitus?

293
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,205
We've already done
everything we could for him.

294
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,083
There's nothing more that we can do.

295
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,378
His will to live is what's key now.

296
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,347
I'm sorry.

297
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,059
Where he'll find it...

298
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,603
is unfortunately something I don't know.

299
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,614
Maybe... I don't know...

300
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,742
there's a chance...

301
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,163
that will might not be his and his alone.

302
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,434
I have no idea
what kind of forces are keeping him alive.

303
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,769
It's a mystery.

304
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,271
Your guess is as good as mine.

305
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,653
This patient remains unconscious.

306
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,698
Where does his will come from?

307
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,416
You're in the way.

308
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,424
Go away, fuck!

309
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:15,139
Sounds like you're saying it's my fault
and we shouldn't see each other anymore.

310
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,145
- I'm the reason we--
- We?

311
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,688
We?

312
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,649
Then what the fuck are we gonna do?

313
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,698
- Sunhae, we should--
- Ugh, don't, don't!

314
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,328
I don't want you to say my name like that.

315
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,664
I don't ever wanna hear you say my name
like you care about me,

316
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,874
so just don't say it!

317
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:54,011
Her clasped hands are stuck
due to postmortem rigor mortis.

318
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,682
The person behind
saved the person in front.

319
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,607
EUGENE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

320
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,674
I don't even know
how to look you in the eye right now.

321
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,970
I don't wanna be around you anymore, okay?

322
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,972
Turn around and get out of my sight!

323
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,179
IT WAS SUCH A TRAGIC ACCIDENT.
IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

324
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,806
I HOPE YOU ARE WELL AND BE HAPPY THERE.

325
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:26,312
RESTRICTED AREA
OUTSIDERS NOT ALLOWED

326
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,899
- I'm going home.
- Ugh, I should go home, too.

327
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,485
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

328
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,200
What are you doing here?

329
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,286
Huh?

330
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,996
Shouldn't you be in school?

331
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,041
I was looking for someone who's in there.

332
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,294
Who?

333
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,921
Visitors can't see patients
unless they're family.

334
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,634
He's a friend though,
and there's something I wanna give him.

335
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,970
Hmm, what should I do?

336
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,097
You're not allowed
to bring stuff from the outside.

337
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,144
What do you wanna give him?

338
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,480
I wanted to return this.

339
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,315
Who's it for?

340
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,317
I don't know his name,

341
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,570
but he put this around my neck
on the day of the accident.

342
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,408
I guess he really liked basketball.

343
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,160
Uh...

344
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,330
I know who that is.

345
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,581
I can return it to him.

346
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,667
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

347
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,293
That's what I do.

348
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,504
What is it that you do?

349
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,839
Give me the ball.

350
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,012
- That thing you just did there...
- What?

351
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,181
...was an assist.

352
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,261
Shit.

353
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,970
Could I get another coffee?

354
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,750
It's weird.

355
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,629
It's not hot, and I can't taste it.

356
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,133
I suspected as much.

357
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,719
But I couldn't just go off a feeling.

358
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,138
You had to see yourself.

359
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,768
Yeah, so I was wandering around...

360
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,229
and noticed what was wrong.

361
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,231
It was my body.

362
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,985
How did you realize it?

363
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,412
A housewarming gift.

364
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:57,457
We've been saving for this house,
and I never got you anything to celebrate.

365
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,584
Hope you like.

366
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,508
I could see something was weird about it.

367
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,387
Other people don't notice anything at all.

368
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,850
- Other people?
- Yes.

369
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,229
A lot of different people
come into this light shop.

370
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,482
This is just a light shop.

371
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,278
So then where is this place?

372
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,993
I feel like... it's different.

373
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,787
How is it different?

374
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,874
The night never ends.

375
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,213
I need to know if I'm weird or if...

376
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:49,635
this place is weird.

377
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,930
Where is this place?

378
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,475
I used to ask the same question.
