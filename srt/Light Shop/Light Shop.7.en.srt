Light Shop

2
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,739
I need to know if I'm weird or if...

3
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,910
this place is weird.

4
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,332
Where is this place?

5
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,773
I used to ask the same question.

6
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,766
Come on, Daddy's almost here.

7
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,227
It's okay. It's...

8
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,235
Everything is okay.

9
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,320
Papa.

10
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,119
Let's get out of here.

11
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,497
All right? I'll get you.

12
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,921
Papa... wait...

13
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,425
I don't think I can go with you.

14
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,261
No, I've got you. It's okay.

15
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:17,030
Papa... I feel so scared.

16
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:22,035
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

17
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,069
Papa...

18
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:59,113
It'll be all right.

19
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,616
Just give me a minute.

20
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,535
We're gonna be leaving soon. I'm sorry.

21
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,405
Good girl.

22
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,533
There you go.

23
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,118
Have some candy.

24
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,037
That's for you.

25
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,461
Papa...

26
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,587
Have that.

27
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,756
You should wake up.

28
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,512
Look at that.

29
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,265
Good job.

30
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,186
I always needed to open those, right?

31
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,209
Yuhui.

32
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,174
By the time you're done with your candy...

33
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,678
I'll be...

34
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,017
right back.

35
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,649
I promise I'll be here...

36
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,655
...before you're done.

37
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,620
Are you okay on your own?

38
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,758
Wait... right here.

39
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,387
I'll come to get you.

40
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,669
Papa...

41
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,046
I'm tired...

42
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,803
Yuhui.

43
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,138
Stay awake.

44
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,140
All right?

45
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,309
I'll come back and get you soon.

46
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,561
Don't fall asleep.

47
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,942
Just wait. I'll be back.

48
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,362
Hello?

49
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,619
I need help!

50
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,998
Anyone?

51
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,044
Hello?

52
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,256
Anyone there?

53
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,133
Hello?

54
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,847
Please, somebody help!

55
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,522
Can anybody hear me?

56
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,734
Please.

57
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,656
Somebody, somebody help.

58
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,659
Help.

59
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,455
Okay.

60
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,625
Have to find someone.

62
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,539
Hello?

63
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,462
Can you help me out?

64
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,466
What brings you here?

65
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,678
She's still...
She's still out there.

66
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,139
Please help me, I need your help.

67
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,267
Unfortunately, it's already too late.

68
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,144
Wait, wait, what? I don't...

69
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,313
Is anyone else here?

70
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,648
There is no one else.

71
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,943
No, please, listen to me.
It's my daughter.

72
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,653
She's only this big.

73
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,864
She's so little... she... please,
she's trapped.

74
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,866
You have to help her.

75
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,494
It's not your concern. You should go.

76
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,709
What do you mean
it's not my concern?

77
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,211
She's... she's my daughter...

78
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,591
This... this was
the only place with the lights on.

79
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,594
I... I'm begging you, help me.

80
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,139
You...
you have to help my daughter...

81
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,184
I'm afraid I can't.

82
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,650
Help me,
she's lying there in the dark,

83
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,526
and she's alone.

84
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,111
Oh, please, I need your help.

85
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,449
If she's going to come here,
she has to on her own.

86
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:02,203
No.
I already said she can't move.

87
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,209
So for fuck's sake!

88
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,049
What's wrong with you?
Why won't you do anything?

89
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,349
Shit!

90
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,893
And what if I broke all of this? Huh?

91
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,772
This?

92
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,440
Don't.

93
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,763
Your daughter's light is also here.

94
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,556
What?

95
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,132
So you're saying...
these lights...

96
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,181
Does that mean...

97
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,607
So is this what I think it is?

98
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,486
Just a light shop, that's all.

99
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,488
No.

100
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,407
There's more to this...

101
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,245
this place.

102
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,125
How do you know that?

103
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,325
Papa, you should eat this.

104
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,327
Are you awake?

105
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,912
Papa.

106
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,623
I'm so scared.

107
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,959
I want a hug.

108
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:35,768
Papa,
I don't think I can go with you.

109
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,775
Papa, you gotta wake up...

110
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,986
It was me.

111
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,614
I was the one who died.

112
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,202
She's all alone.

113
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,206
She must've been scared.

114
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,711
She must've been so scared.

115
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,806
Oh, my poor little Yuhui...

116
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,805
LIGHT SHOP

117
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,190
What am I doing here?

118
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,360
Because you can't accept
that you're in this place.

119
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,946
What the hell does that mean?

120
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,032
Just accept it.

121
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,910
It will make it a lot easier
for you to move on.

122
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,378
I need you to give me her light.

123
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,759
She has to find it herself,
of her own free will.

124
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,386
She's pinned,
she can't get here.

125
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,515
There's no way she can make it.

126
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,726
She has to find it of her own will.

127
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,814
I would do anything for her.

128
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,192
Tell me what I need to do to help her.

129
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,532
Are you really willing to do anything
to help her, then?

130
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,616
Yes.

131
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,203
No matter how long it would take to do so?

132
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,454
Yes.

133
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,581
Yes.

134
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,606
Why don't we trade, then?

135
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,488
So?

136
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,449
What's the deal with this place?

137
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,621
"It's a world
where everybody can eventually move on."

138
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,250
I'm confused.

139
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,004
I got here after an accident.

140
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,382
Are you saying I'm dead?

141
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,969
Technically, you're still alive.

142
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,637
Alive?

143
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,102
I really thought that I was a ghost.

144
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,054
I think... I've seen a ghost.

145
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,725
She died from smoke inhalation.

146
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,770
But...

147
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,440
if I'm still alive,
then why do I look like this?

148
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,983
I look different.

149
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,239
The dead tend to look strange
when they walk around the other world.

150
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,324
That's why they're referred to as ghosts.

151
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,411
But when living people
try to walk around here,

152
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,413
they're the ones that appear strange.

153
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,500
So still alive.

154
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,585
Tell me what exactly am I doing here then?

155
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,671
It's difficult to comprehend.

156
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,840
Those who've had
their lives cut short

157
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,759
due to unfortunate incidents

158
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,928
can continue them in this place.

159
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,348
There are those
who can't accept their deaths as well.

160
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,683
They wander here.

161
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,394
- And are known as--
- Come on man, stop.

162
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,439
Where is this?

163
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,983
I want a straight answer.

164
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,527
Tell me where we are.

165
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,947
My head is full of shit
and it's annoying as hell.

166
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,657
Why are you making this hard?

167
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,951
I keep asking.

168
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,829
Where am I? What is this place?

169
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,458
You're pretty rude.

170
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,379
I'm sorry.

171
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,464
I prefer transparency.

172
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,591
And I know...

173
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,011
I know it won't make sense.

174
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,639
But if you keep going on and on,
that's just totally useless.

175
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,308
It makes it more confusing.

176
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,936
Just be straight with me
and keep it simple.

177
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,856
So just say it.

178
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,358
This place...

179
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,696
What is this place?

180
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,914
You're in the afterlife.

Ugh, you son of a bitch!

What the hell is wrong with that thing?

185
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,534
If I ever see you, you're gonna be dead!

186
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,080
Shut the hell up!

Man, you wait till I get my hands on you!

00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,115
There you are, you mutt!

189
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,789
Someone get that dog!

190
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,627
Starting today,
she'll be working with us.

191
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,504
Say hi.

192
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,383
Hello, everyone, I'm Song Buyeong.

193
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,721
Uh...

194
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,474
This is actually my very first job.

195
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,435
But I'll do the best I can.

196
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,895
She still needs to learn
how it works in the ward,

197
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,731
so she'll be relying on you
to train her in the meantime.

198
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,194
Nurse Kwon,
preceptor duties will fall on you.

199
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,365
Oh... great.

200
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,700
Let's get to work.

201
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,034
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

202
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,371
Sure. This way.

203
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,627
So every day,
when you come to work,

204
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,880
we need you to get the supplies ready
before you take over

205
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,048
- from the on-duty nurse you're relieving.
- Okay.

206
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,221
The most important things to remember,

207
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,891
identify patient, presentation,

208
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,519
history as well as current status,
and why they're at the ICU.

209
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,146
You need to be aware of all that.

210
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,731
Mmm. Okay.

211
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,027
We had
a really big accident recently.

212
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,906
They told us it was urgent,
that our hospital was the closest to it.

213
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,324
There were so many critical patients

214
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,117
that we couldn't even separate them
by care.

215
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,119
Hmm, right. It was on the news.

216
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,287
The city bus that went down.

217
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,415
All right then.
Follow me out to the patients.

218
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,084
Take that with you.

219
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,092
Damn it. Crap.

220
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,020
You really wanna do this?

221
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,648
Fuck.

222
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,193
You son of a bitch.

223
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,956
He was the one
who arrived at the hospital first

224
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,124
on the day of the accident.

225
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,169
Oh, so he was...
he was on the city bus, or...

226
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,213
He wasn't in the traffic accident.

227
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,969
Different accident
that happened on the same day.

228
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,059
KANG BYEONGJIN

229
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,435
Kang Byeongjin!

230
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,354
We just wanna know where you are!

231
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,940
If you can hear me, say something!

232
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,608
He got lost
out in the mountains,

233
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,069
- and then tripped.
- Was his injury from the fall?

234
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,988
It was actually hypothermia.

235
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,072
Hypothermia - Dangerously low
body temperature

236
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,532
He was knocked out and then got sick

237
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,117
since it was raining so much.

238
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,494
- Hey.
- I see a shoe.

239
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,373
Max! Max! Kang Byeongjin!

240
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,250
Over there! Over there!

241
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,127
The rescue dog kept him warm,

242
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,962
so his vitals didn't get too low.

243
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,840
- He was lucky.
- Hmm.

244
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,467
Rescue dogs are trained to bark

245
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,179
so when it finds someone who needs help,
it can let others know where they are.

246
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,473
The dog was right there.

247
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,268
He stayed. Even in that rain.

248
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,088
Mr. Kang!

249
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,674
- Mr. Kang, do you hear me? Mr. Kang!
- Are you okay? Sir!

250
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,070
I'm sorry.

251
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,097
By the time he came in,
he was already unconscious.

252
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,474
What about the dog?

253
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,730
Unfortunately, he didn't survive.

254
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,651
Do you think
the patient knows that?

255
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,697
What I know is...

256
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,825
it's trained to stick with rescues
until they're saved.

257
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,845
ICU

258
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,681
Let's just check that again.

259
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,976
Yes, hello?

260
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,978
- This is Hyunju's dad.
- Hi.

261
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,772
How's she doing today?

262
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,232
Not awake yet.

263
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,901
Okay.

264
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,402
I'm so sorry.

265
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,238
Please, don't be.

266
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,656
I'll still give you a call...

267
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,658
to let you know if she gets better.

268
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,368
Thanks, I'd appreciate that.

269
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,495
Sure.

270
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,249
She's not showing
any signs of serious injury.

271
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,126
So, what is she doing in here?

272
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,797
She was also a passenger
on that city bus this week.

273
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,466
The head trauma's
why she lost consciousness.

274
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,967
So it was like a concussion?

275
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,469
Subdural hemorrhage.

276
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,889
The impact to her inner dura mater
caused a blood vessel to burst.

277
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,933
Though it's not externally visible.

278
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,309
JOO HYUNJU

279
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,853
We get a patient like her
every now and again.

280
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,606
From the outside, it doesn't look
like anything's wrong with her.

281
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,901
However,
a traumatic subdural hemorrhage...

282
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,822
...has a very low survival rate.

283
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,741
How come there isn't a single wound?

284
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,284
The accident looked devastating.

285
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,787
That's because she was with her mother
when it went down.

286
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,707
I think her mom
did her best to protect her.

287
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,709
She was able to avoid the worst.

288
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,045
But the impact of the fall
was just too great.

289
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,964
What happened to her?

290
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,976
She looks like she's asleep.

291
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,020
And it'll be a nightmare when she's awake.

292
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,607
So I hope
she's having a nice dream right now.

293
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,779
NAME: JUNG YUHUI

294
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,406
Jung Yuhui.

295
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,408
Your funeral will be held tomorrow.

296
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,976
JOO HYUNJU

297
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,207
When she was transferred here,

298
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,043
another woman was holding onto her
so tightly,

299
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,836
it was like they were one.

300
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,588
Did the accident cause that?

301
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,839
It was intentional.

302
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,008
She was clinging pretty tightly to her.

303
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,261
We could barely separate them
before the surgery.

304
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,346
YOON SUNHAE

305
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,223
She still hasn't woken up yet.

306
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,599
And the other woman?

307
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,906
Her family came
all the way here from overseas.

308
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,449
How nice of them.

309
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,617
Yes, it is.

310
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,830
Park Hyewon,

311
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,832
we will prepare you for your funeral.

312
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,461
NAME: PARK HYEWON
NOTE: FUNERAL SCHEDULED

313
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,991
Sunhae?

314
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,160
Hmm?

315
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,039
You should get out of bed.

316
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,708
Did you wanna get up?

317
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,630
Sunhae... Baby...

318
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,591
This house is too dark.

319
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,177
You're right.

320
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,555
You should go and get us a new light.

321
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,100
I can't get out.

322
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,770
I ended up breaking the lock

323
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,814
'cause I couldn't get the passcode
right when I tried to get out.

324
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,693
That's impossible.

325
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,945
That door lock panel is on the outside.

326
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,033
So you can go anytime.

327
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,452
The door's wide open for you to go.

328
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,546
Sunhae.

329
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,427
When you walk out the door,

330
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,678
there's a light shop...

331
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,766
at the very end of the alley.

332
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,980
Go there and find a light.

333
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,869
Okay.

334
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,608
MORGUE ENTRANCE
OUTSIDERS NOT ALLOWED

335
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,279
This patient
has been in the ward the longest.

336
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,867
- Maybe you could help me lift him?
- Okay.

337
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,951
To prevent bedsores,

338
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,495
we have to change his positioning
quite a lot.

339
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,206
Uh... one second.

340
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,042
If you could just reach over
and grab his shoulder?

341
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,170
- Yes.
- Lift him at the count of three.

342
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,089
Good, one, two, three...

343
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,341
and let him down.

344
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,185
Oh, I pulled out his headphone I think.

345
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,104
Oh.

346
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,567
Why's he wearing that, anyway?

347
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,987
To encourage him.

348
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,573
- Encourage?
- Mmm.

349
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,826
To help him out.

350
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,745
And so he doesn't get lost.

351
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,371
He's gotta find the light.

352
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,958
You think he hears the music?

Oh...

367
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,823
I think that it was his favorite sport.

368
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,326
But who put it there?

369
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,413
I did.

370
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,500
I assisted him.

371
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,092
We should go.

372
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,097
The patient in the other ward
is going to get taken downstairs soon.

373
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,223
Mmm.

374
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,101
Uh, Nurse Kim.

375
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,603
- Keep an eye on the monitors, okay?
- Okay.

376
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,235
See you later.

377
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,159
This was a patient who came in
with the others from the TA yesterday.

378
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,703
He's no longer in a coma.

379
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,331
- So does that--
- Let's bow.

380
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,401
What? We can't stick around too long.

381
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,405
There are still lots of others
we can do something for.

382
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,949
Okay.

383
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,993
You just gotta get used to it.

384
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,371
It's the hardest part
of working in the ICU.

385
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,452
Ms. Kwon...

386
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,996
is it common for every patient
to be in a coma?

387
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,170
Days like this are rare.

388
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,297
This was a serious accident.

389
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,178
There's a line that exists where we are.

390
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,556
Many patients don't get this far.

391
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,059
You and I are guardians of that border.

392
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,310
And these patients...

393
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,647
are gathered at the border now.

394
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,882
So if they don't come out,
what happens then?

395
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,633
- Do they live or do they--
- Stop.

396
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,636
You shouldn't mention that, hear me?

397
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,184
They either return,

398
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,727
or they remain there.

399
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,203
Is he...

400
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,330
the driver from the bus accident?

401
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,706
Mmm-hmm.

402
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,459
Ahh... It was this guy.

403
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,543
Enough.

404
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,630
The bus might have needed repairs,

405
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,466
but the road conditions were a factor too.

406
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,468
Oh.

407
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,527
Oh Seungwon.

408
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,612
We'll prepare for your funeral now.

409
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,911
NAME: OH SEUNGWON
NOTE: FUNERAL SCHEDULED

410
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,336
I've been looking for you everywhere.

411
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,090
And then I followed the ball here.

412
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,554
I found you.

413
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,514
Huh?

414
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,808
Do I know who you are?

415
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,478
It must've been hard.

416
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,108
Let's go. I'll explain on the way.

417
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,611
Where to?

418
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,489
We have to get out of here.

419
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,284
And you wanna go where, exactly?

420
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,413
I was trying this whole time
to find a way out.

421
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,374
There's no end to this alley.

422
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,090
I can get you out of here.

423
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,177
Please hurry, we don't have time.

424
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,641
I'll try carrying you, okay?

425
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,815
You're in the afterlife.

426
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,339
This is the afterlife,
where everyone can eventually move on.

427
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,677
So if a person's life is cut short
due to an accident,

428
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,637
they get to continue on here.

429
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,431
And since I'm not entirely dead,

430
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,392
I look like this.

431
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,936
I appear different.

432
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,566
Pretty hard to swallow.

433
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,444
Well, you just talked yourself through it.

434
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,655
Is believing so hard?

435
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,573
Yeah, 'cause I'm a cop.

436
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,325
I'm always gonna doubt, you know.

437
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,954
Maybe I don't wanna believe it yet.

438
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,124
It could be you don't wish to,

439
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,211
because you don't have a reason yet.

440
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,175
Did you say you had a child?

441
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,388
Yes.

442
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,433
And the name of that child?

443
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,729
We had a miscarriage.

444
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,066
Bom.

445
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:37,818
Yeoreum.

446
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:39,945
Gaeul.

447
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,030
Gyeowool.

448
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,116
Eutteum.

449
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,577
Huimang.

450
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,454
Suksuk.

451
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,789
Teunteun.

452
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,875
Haengbok.

453
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,877
Somang.

454
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,004
Sarang.

455
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,760
Haetsal.

456
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,438
Those are popular nicknames for a baby.

457
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,734
The children here...

458
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,029
often have those names, you see.

459
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,047
Whether you believe or not is up to you.

460
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,967
People do live in this world.

461
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,222
And they're doing as best as they can.

462
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,695
I wanna...

463
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,280
I wanna believe.

464
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,206
I know I've gone
through this alley before.

465
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,793
Why didn't I see you then?

466
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:23,674
I kept getting lost in the alley,
so I guess I must have missed you.

467
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:27,302
No matter how long I walked,
I would always end up here.

468
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,973
It was like this alley had no end.

469
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,853
Sounds scary.

470
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,147
Left alone in the dark.

471
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,527
I wasn't the only one
stuck in this alley, you know.

472
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,030
Where we were before,

473
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,491
I saw a lady by the window.

474
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,244
She kept screaming
that she couldn't get out of the house.

475
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,142
Why didn't you tell me?

476
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,186
Because you could go back.

477
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,649
Knowing the truth of this place
means you get to remember it.

478
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,570
Those who want to go back...

479
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,907
will have to leave here
without any of their memories.

480
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,995
Should you try to return
to things the way they were,

481
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,914
you'd confuse the worlds,

482
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,374
unable to distinguish
between time and space.

483
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,504
Delirum. I see.

484
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,090
That's why those who want to return...

485
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,552
shouldn't forge any relationships
in this place.

486
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,099
So...

487
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,519
I am a guardian of the border.

488
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,735
Wait, I don't even hear
the scooter anymore.

489
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,822
Why were you chasing him?

490
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,241
I thought he was a murderer.

491
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,955
The two of you have
the same eyes, you know.

492
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,374
And you said
you lost track of him around here?

493
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:25,087
Yes.
I was following the sound of the scooter.

494
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,174
It led me here, so I looked all around.

495
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,178
And then when I turned to leave,
I heard it again.

496
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,686
I tried chasing it one more time,
but ended up back at the light shop.

497
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,230
LIGHT SHOP

498
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,108
I believe it's possible
he might've led you to the shop.

499
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,947
Are you going to keep chasing him?

500
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,908
Need to check something face to face.

501
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,202
Then you should go do that.

502
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,707
Go where?

503
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,084
And how do I get there?

504
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,545
You're a customer.

505
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,588
Haven't you found a light yet?

506
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,146
You'll see him again.

507
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,291
- Get the doctor in here.
- Okay.

508
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:50,964
Mr. Yang? Can you hear my voice? Mr. Yang?

509
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,854
What brings you--

510
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,068
Did your w--

511
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,408
Huh?

512
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,981
Sir, are you okay?

513
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,567
Yeah, I'm okay.

514
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,321
- You see that light shop?
- Yes.

515
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,491
Go in there...

516
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,870
and find your light.

517
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,205
My light?

518
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,709
It's about you.

519
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,335
Your will to go on.

520
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,462
I don't...

521
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,258
You have to do it yourself.

522
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,429
I guess I never considered going in there.

523
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,515
Eh? You... But you have to...

524
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,145
You gotta go.

525
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,772
Go and find your light.

526
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,984
That's the only way for you
to get out of this alley.

527
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,571
Go on.

528
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,657
Okay.

529
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,166
Hey, wait.

530
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,587
Yeah?

531
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,177
I apologize.

532
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,766
I'm sorry.

533
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,312
That's what
I've been wanting to say to you.

534
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,316
I'm so sorry for everything.

535
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,331
Hello.

536
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,291
Hello again.

537
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,126
What?

538
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,546
I've been watching you a while.

539
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,508
You've passed by here,
more than once or twice.

540
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,302
Oh.

541
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,566
So, what are you doing here?

542
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,321
I... Uh...

543
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,240
Something you need?

544
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,010
My light.

545
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,459
I hope...

546
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,295
we don't meet again.

547
