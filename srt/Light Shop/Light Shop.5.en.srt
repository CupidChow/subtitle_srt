Near-Death experience - An experience
of being on the verge of death.

3
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,798
"An overview of research results suggests

4
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,176
that approximately 4 to 18% of people
resuscitated from cardiac arrest

5
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,844
have had a near-death experience."

6
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,475
Many people who have had
near-death experiences...

7
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,936
tend to give similar testimonies.

8
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,860
These individuals...

9
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,154
in their descriptions...

10
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,865
claim to have seen a bright light...

11
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,249
The doors are opening.

12
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,335
Please watch your step.
Please watch your step.

13
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,931
They claim...

14
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,142
that before they woke up...

15
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,935
they saw a dark tunnel.

16
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,732
And they report...

17
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,527
that while they were unconscious...

18
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,488
they were reunited with their loved ones.

Episode 5: Reunion

21
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,310
THIS STATION IS GANGDONG MARKET

22
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,812
THE DOORS ARE ON YOUR RIGHT

23
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,489
Yeah, I'm on the train.

24
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,576
Really. On the train.

25
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,163
I told you... I'm on the train now.

26
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,373
I'll call you later.

27
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,000
Mm-hmm

28
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,465
MY LOVE

29
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,008
DID YOU HAVE DINNER?

30
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,010
I HAD DINNER WITH MY CO-WORKERS AT WORK
IT WASN'T THAT GOOD

31
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,225
I'M ON MY WAY TO YOU

32
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,740
IT'S TOO LATE THOUGH

33
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,328
I JUST HAD WHATEVER I HAD AT HOME

34
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,080
WHY!! YOU SHOULD'VE HAD SOMETHING GOOD
DID YOU MEET MY MOM BY ANY CHANCE?

35
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,164
NO
THANK GOODNESS - YEAH

36
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,884
I'M ON THE SUBWAY
AND GETTING OFF AT THE NEXT STATION

37
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:35,400
IT'S TOO LATE, LET'S MEET TOMORROW

38
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,620
GET HERE SAFE

39
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:58,715
I MISS YOU

40
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:12,770
ME TOO. I MISS

41
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,628
HAPPY BIRTHDAY. THANKS FOR BEING BORN
I WANT TO BE REBORN TODAY

42
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,607
I'LL CUT TO THE CHASE
STOP SEEING HYUNMIN

43
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,691
I LIKE HIM A LOT

44
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,693
HE CAN'T HANDLE YOU
DON'T EVER SEE HIM AGAIN

45
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,869
- Have a look, please.
- Okay.

46
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,332
In order to cross the bridge,
you'll have to take a bus.

47
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,543
We're pretty close to the subway station.

48
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,212
It's a short walk, more or less.

49
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,506
The store's a five-minute car ride.

50
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,676
That's the laundry room,
and that's the pantry.

51
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,805
Oh, also, while it says
this is Hanam-si in Gyeonggi-do,

52
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,473
we're actually in Seoul.

53
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,058
Here's another room.

54
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,103
- Hm... The master bedroom?
- Please take a look around.

55
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,106
The bathroom and the walk-in closet
are right here.

56
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,152
- Feel free to go inside.
- Thanks.

57
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,037
A house in a location like this.

58
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,373
It won't be on the market very long.

59
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,751
I know I called you here late,

60
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,422
but I swear I only did it
because I really like you two.

61
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,217
- All you need is to put down...
- Hey, you like it?

62
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,428
...a million one deposit
and you'll be good to go.

63
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,847
This is more than enough for you two.

64
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,724
Is she your mother?

65
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,322
You're in the way.

66
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,249
Hey, Mom!

67
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,336
You're all wet.

68
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,131
What is wrong with you?
I told you to bring an umbrella.

69
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,675
- I know, I forgot.
- Use this.

70
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,346
- The bus is nearly here.
- What? Where's dad?

71
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,056
- He took the car?
- He's on a business trip.

72
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,808
Why did he leave
when it's raining so hard?

73
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,811
He doesn't have a say in when
he has to take these trips you know that.

74
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,105
Guess I just miss him
a lot today.

75
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,607
But you don't miss me, huh?

76
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,275
I'm getting sick
of looking after my daughter,

77
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,486
- who is grown, by the way. Hurry up.
- What?

78
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,530
Of course I missed you!

79
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,698
So, Mom, why did you bring two umbrellas?

80
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,824
We can just share.

81
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,368
Ugh, you're crowding me!

82
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,204
Don't say that! It's nice,
it's like we're on a date!

83
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,081
Ah! Whatever you say.

84
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,585
- Mom.
- Yeah?

85
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,796
- Are the renovations all done?
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,215
Then, when do we finally
get to move into the new apartment?

87
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,009
Well, whenever
they feel like letting us in.

88
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,806
Ugh, moving away is so sad, huh?

89
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,724
What's so sad about it?

90
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,812
Trying to go across that bridge to school
every day was a huge hassle.

91
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,564
You know, I still want you

92
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,774
to come pick me up at school
at the end of the day.

93
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,402
All right, Little Miss Clingy, get off me.

94
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,822
Why? I like being close like this.

95
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,074
- All right, whatever.
- What?

96
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,993
Are you saying that I don't?

97
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,372
I'll still pick you up after we move.

98
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,833
Really?

99
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,298
- Promise?
- What was that?

100
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,924
Was that supposed to be singing?

101
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,468
Don't you think
it's getting too late?

102
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,429
Come on, man, my mom will get mad.

103
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,347
Hey, what's your problem, dude?

104
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,308
Our moms are just gonna think
we're studying.

105
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,475
Yes!

106
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,312
Did you see me? Did you guys see it
when I almost scored a goal?

107
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,106
- Yeah.
- We should totally play again tomorrow.

108
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,859
- Would you let go already?
- Ah! Jiung!

109
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,114
Oh, man, Jiung, seriously!

110
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,992
Yeah, man, I left class for this,
why didn't you go all out?

111
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,286
Because he was trying
not to ruin his shoes.

112
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,622
What do you mean? I had a lot of assists.

113
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,540
Yeah, that's right. He was great today.

114
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,833
Well done, Jiung.

115
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,128
You didn't score,
but you still did good. Be nice!

116
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,380
You can't score on your own.

117
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,091
You always need someone to assist.

118
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,676
Ooh!

119
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,470
I'm going to step
on your shoes, you idiot!

120
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,805
Hey, no, no, no! Get back, okay?
Don't you dare!

121
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,560
Uh... this is Oh.

122
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,354
I'm at the terminal.

123
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,774
Um, I wanna let you know
that there's a noise

124
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,275
coming from the rear wheel.

125
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,778
Yeah.

126
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,199
My guess would be
either the brake pad or the lining.

127
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,578
It doesn't seem like it's that serious,
to be honest.

128
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,123
Uh, well...

129
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,918
People are already waiting
for the last bus.

130
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,336
Can I take another?

131
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,091
Ah... that's right.

132
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,387
So should I get it checked or not?

133
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,890
There's probably a place
I can take it to nearby.

134
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,434
What?

135
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,022
If I don't get it checked at our garage,
I have to pay for it myself?

136
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,733
Oh.

137
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,694
Oh. Okay.

138
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,530
All right, all right. Bye.

139
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,830
Geez, I can't believe this.

140
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,851
ROUTE NUMBER 362

141
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,524
You can get on now!

142
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,444
...especially
in the metropolitan area.

143
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,363
Let's connect to
the Korea Meteorological Administration

144
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,615
to check
on our current weather conditions.

145
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,828
Our reporter is there now to give us
insight as to why it's not only chilly,

146
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,122
but we have an unusual amount of wind.

147
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,751
Between tonight and tomorrow morning,

148
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,463
meteorologists are expecting heavy
rainfall of up to one hundred fifty...

149
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,714
Go and sit down.

150
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,217
...with rates of 30
to 50 millimeters per hour.

151
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,346
Get home safe. Call me
when you get there, okay?

152
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,307
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,934
Excuse me. Could please
keep an eye on my grandson?

154
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,102
Yeah.

155
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,857
...100 millimeters of rain.

156
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,235
Thunder and lightning will occur,
as well as strong winds.

157
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,614
Let's take a look at this forecast image

158
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,617
provided by the
Korea Meteorological Administration.

159
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,829
As you can see here,
rain that began off the coast of Jeju

160
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,748
is already spreading nationwide.

161
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,043
Tonight, a low pressure system
over the West Sea

162
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:18,130
will cause rain clouds to form,
which will contribute to the downpour...

163
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,638
Oh, shoot.

164
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,145
Oh, shoot.

165
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,065
Ah, shit.

166
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,276
Ah geez.

167
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,654
Dang it.

168
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,573
Ugh, wait.

169
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,536
Why am I such an idiot?

170
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,205
Ah, shit.

171
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,166
How could I forget that?

172
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:59,922
GANGDONG UK TOWER
GANGDONG MARKET STATION

173
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,298
Hey, honey.

174
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,051
Sorry, I was on the subway
when you called earlier.

175
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,344
You angry?

176

I'll bring you something good.
What do you feel like?

178
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,892
Soju?

179
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,019
Yeah, I can get that.

180
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,313
Five bottles? Wow.

181
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,024
Don't you have work tomorrow? All right...

182
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,568
Hey there, Jiyoung.

183
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,404
It's still raining and the bus
hasn't shown at all yet.

184
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,574
I'm not sure if you're gonna wait around
outside the station,

185
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,284
but I'd rather you don't.

186
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,828
I can't write you a text
'cause of the umbrella.

187
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,455
I'll be as fast as I can.
Just wait at the house.

188
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,960
Miss you so much.

189
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,753
I love you.

190
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,131

00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,797

198
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,056
- Ugh, good evening, sir!
- Good evening.

199
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,666
This stop
is Sangeui High School.

200
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,216
Hmm.

201
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,261
THIS STOP
SANGEUI HIGH SCHOOL

202
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,111
I gotta go to the shop soon.

203
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,952
NOT IN SERVICE

204
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,787
NO STOPPING

205
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,766

Hmm-hmm.

207
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,822
What? What do you want?

208
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,659
Now you're clingy cause no one's around?

209
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,828
- Sunhae...
- Stop following me.

210
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,794
You don't like it
'cause there're a lot of residents.

211
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,045
And they'd be too close to us.

212
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,505
We shouldn't be around others, right?

213
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,799
You didn't see this coming?

214
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,093
- What are we, criminals?
- Sunhae!

215
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,386
How much longer are you gonna hide?

216
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,890
- Sunhae.
- What?

217
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,185
- You know we don't--
- We don't what?

218
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,979
Look like we're together.

219
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,364
So what?

220
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,534
What's so wrong with two women going out?

221
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,245
It'll be tough.

222
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,705
Everyone we see will talk.

223
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,293
We'll have to explain our relationship,
giving excuses constantly.

224
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,213
I still don't see how that's so hard.

225
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,299
You're going to have a harder time
at it than I will.

226
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,263
Sounds like you're saying it's my fault
and we shouldn't see each other anymore.

227
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,722
Not at all.

228
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,975
- I'm the reason we--
- We?

229
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,601
We?

230
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,021
Then what the fuck are we gonna do?

231
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,816
Are we just gonna keep living like this,
the two of us a secret?

232
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,696
- Sunhae, we should--
- Ugh, don't, don't!

233
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,200
I don't want you to say my name like that.

234
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,787
I don't ever wanna hear you
say my name like you care about me,

235
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,497
so just don't say it!

236
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,916
Ever.

237
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,877
For the rest of your life.

238
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,211
It's our ages.

239
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,923
Everything wrong is my fault.

240
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,925
You look like you're my daughter.

241
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,220
Go away, fuck!

242
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,308
I don't even know
how to look you in the eye right now.

243
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,729
I don't wanna be around you anymore, okay?

244
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,440
Turn around and get out of my sight.

245
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,072
Whoa... whoa!

246
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,602
Are you getting in?

247
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,230
We're already running behind schedule.

248
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,863
- So sorry.
- Yeah.

249
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,353
- Oh! There it is!
- Hey! Hey! Wait!

250
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,480
Over here! Stop!

251
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,358
Sorry, I can't. I gotta go to the garage!

252
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,820
- Wait, sir! We wanna get on the bus!
- Oh! Wait, wait! Wait, stop!

253
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,533
Ugh, fine.

254
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,373
Ugh, seriously?

255
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,710
Now I'm wet.

256
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,838
Hey, sir, why didn't you stop for us?

257
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,006
I was just--

258
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,424
My mom has a bad leg.

259
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,051
I'm sorry for all that.
Careful on the way in.

260
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,873
Hm?

261
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,795

00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,317
Hello? I can't hear you.

283
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,402
- Ma'am, can you please repeat that?

284
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,072
Are you unable
to respond right now?

285
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,946
I MISS YOU TOO

286
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,812

- Slowly now.

288
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,649
- How's he doing?
- Unconscious and no heartbeat.

289
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,900
Okay, let's try
and move him now.

290
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,860
- One, two.
- Charge to 150.

291
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,155
TA trauma patient here.
No breathing, no pulse.

292
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,367
Let me check the OR.

293
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,618
- Please be careful.
- Call the doctor!

294
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,620
The patient's back
has been severely damaged.

295
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,622
We can move him into the OR!

296
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,165
Ready?

297
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:39,254

00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,841
There are more outside!

299
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,968
...29, 30.

300
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,678
Come on, open your eyes.

301
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,931
- Doctor, again!
- Right. One, two...

302
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:54,143

305
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,988
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

306
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,823
- Chest hurts...
- Uh... Sorry--

307
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,117
Could you help me, please?
It's my chest.

308
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,035
Can you wait over there?

309
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,954
What are you doing?

310
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,754

One, two. Clear!

313
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:28,970
One more time.

314
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,770
Straight to the operating room.

315
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,105
Open the door, please!

316
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,453
Oh Seungwon's family?

317
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,165
I'm sorry to tell you...

318
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,876
but he passed away this evening at 7:05pm.

319
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,880
That gurney you just rolled out...

320
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,549
- My husband was on there?
- Yes.

321
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,579
Where's Heo Jiung's family?

322
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,663
- Here.
- Yes.

323
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,873
- We're here.
- Us.

324
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,794
Jiung...

325
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,463
Jiung.

326
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,173
Jiung, it's mommy.

327
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,390
The family for Joo Hyunju?

328
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,588
- The family for Yoon Sunhae?
- Yes.

329
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,590
Sunhae.

330
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,880
Uh...

331
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,591
are you Park Hyewon's family?

332
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,967
Uh, okay.

333
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,113
They're right here. Go ahead.

334
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,661
Excuse me.

335
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,371
You're Kim Hyunmin's relatives?

336
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,538
Yeah.

337
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,376
We believe this phone we retrieved
from the bus was Hyunmin's.

338
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,878
We thought you might want it.

339
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,776
Don't die, Hyunmin.

340
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,406
You need to live, Hyunmin.

341
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,548
MY LOVE

342
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,359
HYUNMIN DIED

343
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:44,655
HE DIED BECAUSE OF YOU

344
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,438
Are you the family
for Kim Hyunmin?

345
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,647
Hyunmin.

346
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,419
I'm so sorry, patients only.

347
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,837
Okay.

348
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,798
- We'll need you to wait outside.
- Okay.

349
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,966
Please save him.

00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,651
Hyunmin will live, right?

353
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,153
He has to.

354
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,409
It's up to him.

355
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,328
There's nothing else we can do now.

356
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,164
We have to trust him.

357
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,256
You shouldn't have texted her.

358
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,676
It was inappropriate to text her that.

359
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,558
She has to be worried sick right now.

360
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,101
You ought to call her.

361
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,022
She's deaf
so she wouldn't be able to hear it.

362
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,776
That's why I was against her.

363
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,116
Let's at least send her another text.

364
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,291
MY LOVE

365
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,710
I'LL GO WHERE YOU ARE

366
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,390
HYUNMIN IS ALIVE
HYUNMIN DIDN'T DIE

367
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,287
HYUNMIN IS ALIVE

368
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,422
Many people
who have had near-death experiences

369
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,549
tend to give similar testimonies.

370
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,268
They claim...

371
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,103
that before they woke up...

372
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,522
they saw a dark tunnel.

373
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,067
And they report...

374
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,612
that while they were unconscious...

375
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,157
they were reunited with their loved ones.

376
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,412
You smell really nice, Mom, you know that?

377
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,248
Like flowers.

378
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,050
You know who I am, don't you?

379
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,900
