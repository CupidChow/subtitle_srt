Light Shop

2
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,609
And, there's a festival to enjoy.

3
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,779
ONE MONTH AGO

4
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,698
- ...108 times, something like that.

5
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,451
- ...no lanterns or anything.

6
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,330
It's only a matter of time
before Korea follows suit.

7
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,169
Don't you think we should keep up
the tradition though?

8
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,077
Damn it, fuck.

9
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,673
You bastard, I know it's you out there!

10
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,885
I told you I'm done with you!
I don't wanna see you anymore!

11
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,847
Fucker, I called the police, so go away!

12
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,725
You better stay away from me,
you son of a bitch!

13
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,634
Attention, please.

14
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,637
Passengers taking the 11:15 p.m.
late night bus

15
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,515
to Gangneung should board at platform 13.

16
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,258
Departing now.

17
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,267
Sir, open up.

18
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,819
- I'd appreciate your cooperation.
- Sure.

19
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,113
Could you turn off the engine, please?

20
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,365
This will only take a moment.

21
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,160
All passengers, please exit the bus.

22
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,038
I know it's inconvenient. I apologize.

23
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,173
Young lady, let's go.

24
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,437
Those windows don't open
for a reason.

25
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:01,569
Can't have an open window on the highway.
Too dangerous.

26
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,742
Just think about it.

27
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,744
What would you do if there's a fire?

28
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,122
Burning to death is one thing,
but the smoke you'd inhale...

29
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,836
You know...

30
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,214
a person died in a Cheonho-dong villa.

31
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,258
She lived alone on the third floor.

32
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,927
Smoke inhalation.

33
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,012
There's a fire, you see.

34
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,226
It was arson.

35
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,610
You did it.

36
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,007
Why do you look so shocked?

37
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,593
Hey, watch out.

38
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,602
- You're with the Eastern station, right?
- Yeah.

39
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,814
We're your support.
From here on, we'll take the suspect in.

40
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,232
- Sure, thanks.
- Okay.

41
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,986
Oh, wait. I didn't read that bastard
his Miranda rights.

42
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,070
Why not?

43
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,490
You're a newbie. Am I right?

44
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,616
Yeah.

45
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,412
He didn't deserve the courtesy. You do it.

46
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,125
- Uh, detective?
- Yeah? What?

47
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,127
This is a no-smoking zone.

48
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,754
Thank you, sir.

49
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,091
Ah, shit.

50
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,051
What the hell?

51
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,725
Great.

52
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,863
Come on, seriously?

53
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,531
Is nothing working?

00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,999
Episode 3: The Detective

55
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,880
Boiling it
made it very tender,

56
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,840
which is exactly what we want because--

57
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,133
And the broth!

58
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,093
The taste of the broth
is top-notch, isn't it?

59
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,763
Yeah.
You should seriously try the galbi!

60
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,016
And know what?
The pork is so good on its own.

61
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,476
You don't even need side dishes.

62
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,645
Just add
some green onions as you go,

63
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,648
and then you eat it at home
with a slice of warm kimchi.

64
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,068
- So delicious.
- It turned out great.

65
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,531
- There's nothing else like it.
- I can't wait to try it at home.

66
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,282
Who is it?

67
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,909

73
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,298
Dispatch, we're at the scene.

74
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,134
Sorry for the trouble.

75
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,845
The charges have been cleared
following the investigation.

76
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,722
If you could just please sign here,

77
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,266
and then you're free to go.

78
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,310
Acknowledged.

79
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,978
Thank you.

80
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,191
Take care.

81
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,864
What?

82
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,450
The Amsa-dong elderly death case.

83
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,786
Yeah, and?

84
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,121
According to the witness,
that man was there at the scene,

85
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,289
so I called him in, but...

00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,415
WITNESS KIM SANGHOON

87
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,668
This whole thing was an accident,
as it turns out.

88
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,960
Accident?

89
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,004
Well, the medical examiner
took one look at him

90
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,924
and confirmed it was a sudden death
from a stroke.

91
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,134
The Cheonho Villa
arson case is closed, right?

92
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,222
When we got the confession,

93
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,808
we learned
that he was the victim's stalker.

94
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,311
Since she refused to leave her house,
he just set it on fire.

95
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,981
Her ghost should punish that asshole
and send him to hell.

96
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,111
Nothing to report.

97
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,280
You haven't had lunch, right?

98
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,616
- What do you want?
- Uh, do you mean it's your treat?

99
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,368
How about this new
kimchi jjim restaurant--

100
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,871
- Let's eat jjajang.
- Jjajang.

101
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,821
The line isn't drawn.

102
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,784
That's right, sir,
'cause it's unnecessary.

103
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,702
Is this a case, or an accident?

104
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,245
It looks like an accident.

105
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,955
Your mole's gone.

106
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,457
Oh, yes.

107
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,167
You can't smoke around here.

108
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,467
- You removed your mole?
- Yeah.

109
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,345
Wow, that's crazy.

110
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,933
We met in passing when I was called in
for the arson case, you know.

111
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,392
How did he even remember that?

112
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,853
He's famous for his keen eye.

113
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,231
He remembers a face from just a look.

114
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,024
Captures every little detail.

115
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,110
Wow, you know
he has to have the best record.

116
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,447
Well, uh, no, not really.

117
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,617
I mean, if anything catches his eye,
then the case isn't truly closed.

118
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,703
He'll keep at it until everything
is completely settled.

119
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,832
His arrest rate is high,
but his performance rate is low.

120
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,625
His persistence is a waste.

121
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,132
- Oh, you made it here.
- Yeah, yeah.

122
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,760
- Why do I have to work so late?
- Tell me about it.

123
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,893
Who found the body?

124
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,103
The landlord.

125
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,774
Sir.

126
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,609
Examination record?

127
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,153
We'll get it soon.

128
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,948
And the presumed cause of death?

129
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,326
Sudden death.
Likely an acute myocardial infarction.

130
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,704
- Family?
- None present.

131
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,998
His wife passed away years ago.

132
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,667
And his children went overseas,
so he was alone.

133
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,010
So this acute myocardial infection...

134
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,428
Infarction.

135
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,762
Okay, sure. That one.

136
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,055
An infarction would mean

137
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,475
signs of squeezing
his heart in agony, is that right?

138
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,312
Then why is his expression like that?

139
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,897
Peaceful.

140
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,565
Maybe it wasn't acute.

141
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,484
You're right, who knows why?

142
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,655
In some cases, people become lively
before they really die, you know.

143
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,158
Yeah... Terminal lucidness.

144
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,327
Uh... "Terminal lucidity."

145
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,953
Well done. You want a medal?

146
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,832
I think it was
an acute myocardial infarction.

147
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,336
The deceased was taking
cardiovascular medication regularly.

148
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,005
Don't all old people have heart issues?

149
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,924
Uh... true.

150
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,926
Why? What's going on?

151
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,553
This expression is familiar.

152
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,721
Give me his cellphone.

153
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,312
RECENT CALL LIST

154
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,396
Look at that.

155
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,440
Guess he didn't know
how to set a password.

156
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,734
It's, uh, not a smartphone.

157
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,694
Well done. You want a medal?

158
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,617
He called his children and grandchildren,
one after another.

159
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,412
So, you're suspecting suicide?

160
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,248
Not possible with an acute infarction,
don't you agree?

161
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,543
And committing suicide
is usually something you plan in advance.

162
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,628
Yeah.

163
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,838
An acute infarction
means it's sudden.

164
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,591
- You can't really prepare that.
- Yeah.

165
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,760
- Not possible.
- You hear that?

166
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,118
Huh? Wait. This show wasn't live?

167
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,664
2018 WORLD THEME TRAVEL

168
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,625
Oh, I guess it was his first time
using replay.

169
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,420
He didn't know how to use it, I bet.

170
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,631
So, then, why is it on right now?

171
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,094
Only the channel buttons are worn out.

172
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,306
Honey, my period's late.

173
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,264
Now that
the Sujan tour is starting,

174
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,433
Papa Anoj should be able
to take some pressure off himself.

175
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,645
I think he'll definitely let loose.

176
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,606
For Papa Anoj,
his real journey begins now.

177
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,568
This whole trip has only revolved
around his kids so far!

178
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,654
He's a real dedicated dad,
isn't he?

179
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,823
So, which one do you like?

180
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,449
I'm so conflicted.

181
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,743
- How about I choose?
- Mmm.

182
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,078
That one.

183
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,080
Oh, it's too difficult.

184
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,873
Then how about something cheerful?

185
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,958
HAETSAL

186
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,042
This one.

187
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,796
Oh, good choice.

188
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,591
Yeah?

189
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,884
Got it.

190
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,096
I'll come right back after my shift,
so don't worry, we'll sort it all out.

191
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,974
- Take your car keys and police ID.
- Yeah, right.

192
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,725
See you soon.

193
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,060
You be careful.

194
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,729
HAETSAL

195
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,957
SEOUL EASTERN POLICE AGENCY
INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS

196
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,541
This way.

197
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,967
I prefer instant stuff.

198
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,011
When it's hot, it tastes better.

199
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,679
Then buy it yourself.

200
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,848
Give me.

201
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,100
The Seongnae-dong file.

202
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,897
Wait, we already caught
the culprit from that case!

203
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,565
Couldn't find the victim though.

204
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,611
But we've wrapped everything up,
and the search...

205
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,906
Uh, never mind.

206
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,533
"Unsolved" means unresolved.

207
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,204
- Don't confuse it with a solved case.
- Okay.

208
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,710
Exam record shows
it was likely an infarction.

209
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,379
"Likely"?

210
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,174
- I mean, it was.
- Are you sure?

211
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,384
Yes, I'm sure.

212
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,471
This the one?

213
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,182
Blood samples from the deceased
were collected

214
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,309
- and his troponin levels were checked.
- Autopsy?

215
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,396
The examiner said
an autopsy wasn't needed,

216
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,107
based on the condition
and history of the deceased.

217
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,110
The family didn't want one either.

218
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,031
They don't want their loved one's
body cut open,

219
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,701
so the deceased has already
been handed over to them.

220
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,495
This case is closed.

221
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,330
Got it. You can go.

222
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,082
Yes.

223
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,185
SEOUL EASTERN POLICE AGENCY

224
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,646
It's hard to specify
since it rained the night before,

225
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,357
plus the CCTV has a high traffic volume.

226
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,945
We could request dash cam footage
since we have cars in the alleys.

227
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,949
Technically, the case is closed.

228
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,952
If it's already closed, why...

229
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,999
- Search the jurisdiction data.
- Okay.

230
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,084
Chinese restaurants.

231
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,503
So, Chinese, then...

232
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,804
Sergeant Mun,
here's your iced coffee!

233
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,932
Huh? Why are you here, sir?

234
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,310
- More like why are you here?
- Uh...

235
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,978
Coffee.

236
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,647
Ah, have you eaten yet, sir?

237
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,733
- Jjajangmyeon sound good?
- I'm good.

238
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,986
Uh, take care.

239
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,871
Huh?

240
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,291
- I like hot.
- Hot.

241
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,045
Oh, yeah, why did he come down here?

242
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,630
He wanted to go over the case.

243
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,257
Oh, the lonely man
in Seongnae-dong?

244
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,552
- It was ruled a natural death.
- I know.

245
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,763
There has to be something about it
that's still on his mind.

246
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,350
He's just lonely, too, that's all.

247
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,743
Do they order alcohol? Or not?

248
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,663
- Now and then. It's more often now.
- Deliveries?

How far do you deliver in the area?
Just this neighborhood?

252
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,934
- Well, we cover almost all of it.
- Oh, the whole area?

253
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,603
Seongnae-dong is too far from here.

255
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,345

Then you'll get to eat tonkatsu

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,206
Welcome.

269
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,305
What would you like to order?

270
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,857
Jjajangmyeon's good.

271
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,942
All right, one moment, please.

272
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,604

If you could just please sign here,

274

and then you're free to go.

275
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,997
I searched all day
for a Chinese restaurant.

276
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,876
Please enjoy your meal.

277
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,599
Do you also deliver?

278
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,769
Sometimes I do.

279
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,021
Delivery apps don't list you.

280
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,232
I don't get many orders.

281
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,193
So how did he order?

282
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,197
Customers always find a way to order food.

283
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:55,108
He called his children and grandchildren,
one after another.

284
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,276
RECENT CALL LIST

285
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,198
The truth is
he didn't order at all.

286
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,037
From here to Seongnae-dong
is too far though.

287
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,503
It is. Jjajangmyeon would get soggy.

288
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,923
I never said what he got.

289
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,857
Even though they declared it
a natural death...

290
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,443
to me, it was suspicious.

291
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,447
His calm expression
was anything but natural.

292
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,288
What went on, I wonder.

293
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,084
Crime scenes reveal the truth, you know.

294
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,795
TV replay.

295
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,380
I guess it was his first time
using replay.

296
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,716
That was just the first clue.

297
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,844
He was a right-handed person.

298
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,388
But the remote control was on his left.

299
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,435
So that's why I thought...

300
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,314
someone was clearly there and then gone.

301
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,657
The liver spots I saw...

302
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,538
...were jjajang sauce.

303
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,379
You did it.

304
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,012
And who are you?

305
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,683
You dense? A detective.

306
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,310
Then why are you talking so impolitely?

307
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,234
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're talking about, sir.

308
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,655
- You sure?
- So... impolite.

309
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,115
You sure, sir?

310
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,242
Yes.

311
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,706
Well, now what? My hands are tied.

312
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,667
Guess I'll keep watch.

313
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,962
Talking to myself.

314
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,756
Sir.

315
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,724
You ought to say "see you again!"

316
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,892
Shouldn't you?

317
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,355
See you again.

318
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,357
That's right.

319
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,464
KIM SANGHOON

320
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:12,597
The hell
is this bastard doing? Shit.

321
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,849
NATURAL DEATH

322
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,291
323
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,794
ONE MONTH LATER

323
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,667
"See you again," right?

324
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,712
Get off!

325
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,548
Impolite. Huh?

326
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,092
Hey, asshole.

327
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,637
What were you trying to do?
You trying to kill again?

328
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,639
You piece of shit murderer.

329
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,685
Hey, young lady, are you okay?

330
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,688
- You see that woman, too?
- You just stay still!

331
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,190
You okay over there?
Can you stand on your own?

332
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,846
ASPHYXIATION FROM SMOKE AND ASH

333
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,276
You're already dead.

334
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,153
You have a good eye, detective.

335
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,533
- If she's here, she can't be human.
- What?

336
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,046
Hey!

337
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,438
What's with your eyes?

338
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,904
Anything you're looking for?

339
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,282
Perhaps you'll know what it is.

340
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,578
Just tell me what you need.
Maybe I can find it for you.

341
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,673
Can I ask some questions?

342
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,758
What brings you here?

343
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,218
I'm with the police.

344
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,263
What is this about?

345
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,931
I'm looking for a suspect.

346
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:45,143
A man, about mid-30s, 180, short hair.

347
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,436
He looks... plain.

348
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,315
Why are you looking here?

349
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,068
I lost him in this neighborhood.
Have you seen him, by chance?

350
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,446
This is the only place open at this hour.

351
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,957
Young lady, stop.

352
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,963
Are you injured?

353
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,260
Uh, no.

354
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,890
My body isn't well today.

355
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,446
Like you said, this is the only place
open at this hour.

356
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,240
I was trying to avoid the rain,

357
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,327
but it's never-ending.

358
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,289
Wear this.

359
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,300
Take it with you. I have other coats.

360
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,014
Your mother.

361
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,517
Go.

362
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,438
Oh, no.

363
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,816
Ah, Mom told me to buy a bulb though.

364
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,735
Geez.

365
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,441
Sir!

366
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,943
Hyunju. Go home now.

367
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,615
Your mother must be waiting.

368
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,659
I'm all right, okay?

369
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,204
Okay.

370
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,550
You have a lot of customers late at night.

371
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,929
Well, I was also drawn here in a way.

372
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,351
This place is strange.

373
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,395
And what is it
that brings you to this place?

374
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,441
The store's noticeable
with all these lights on.

375
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,370
No.

376
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,622
I'm not talking about the store.

377
