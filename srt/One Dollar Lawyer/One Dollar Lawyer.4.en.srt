EPISODE 4

12
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,508
Ms. Baek, are you all right?

13
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,053
Ms. Baek, are you okay?

14
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,889
She's totally drunk.

15
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,848
- Yes.
- That's right!

16
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,267
Let's go for another round!

17
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,062
- Hello.
- Ms. Baek.

18
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,563
Let's go…

19
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,482
Where's our second round?

20
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,965
Since that was our fourth round,
we should go for our second!

21
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,861
- Oh, my.
- Oh, boy.

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,033
What are you looking at?

23
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,286
Gosh, she really drinks a lot.

24
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,455
- Mr. Cheon.
- Yes?

25
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:04,582
- Take good care of her.
- Take good care of whom?

26
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,043
Jun is asking for me.

27
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:08,669
Stop lying, Mr. Sa.

28
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,090
The moon is glowing so beautifully.

29
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,637
Ah…

30
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,597
The moon is pretty, isn't it?

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,226
Twinkle, twinkle…

32
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,103
Mari?

33
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,937
Mari?

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,108
Ms. Baek, please wake up.

35
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,902
Ms. Baek, please wake up.

36
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,071
Hey. Where do you live?

37
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,330
Where's her address?

38
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,625
Here it is.

39
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,420
Why didn't she write her address?

40
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,927
Geez, she is sleeping so well.

41
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,088
Look here. If you close your eyes,
it won't recognize your face.

42
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,633
Open your eyes. Go like this.

43
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,051
Look over here.

44
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,513
I have to know where you live
or at least your phone number.

45
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,224
Hey, look over here.

46
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,393
You have to go home.
Give me your home address.

47
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,353
I have to contact...

48
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,737
Whatever. Who cares?

49
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,328
Why do I remember all of it?

50
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,381
MOM

51
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,511
MOM

52
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,269
Ms. Baek…

53
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:13,561
Yes?

54
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,731
Please open your eyes.

55
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,650
You have to open both of them to go home.

56
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,742
What's up?

57
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,161
What?

58
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,913
DIVORCE, LAWSUIT INHERITANCE, LITIGATION

59
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,748
Mari!

60
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,478
My goodness.
My daughter's face is finally glowing.

61
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,524
How did you think of
bringing a makeup trailer?

62
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,610
You're the only mom in the world
who would do this.

63
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,489
You have to care of your skin
every day from now on.

64
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,993
Mari, do you have to work here?

65
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:13,664
I don't think it's the type of place
you should work.

66
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,918
Do you want me to call your grandfather?

67
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,255
No way. It's only for two months.
I'll be fine.

68
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,051
Does the lawyer treat you well?

69
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,219
He isn't too bossy, is he?

70
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:28,929
Are you sure he's normal?

71
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,098
Mom, please stop.

72
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,726
Is he handsome?

73
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:37,897
Mr. Cheon. Mr. Cheon.

74
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:39,190
He's in deep sleep.

75
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,525
I borrowed Vol. 16
of <i>Boy Detective Jaemin</i>.

76
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,236
Open your eyes and go home!
Open your eyes and go home.

77
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,404
Did you have a nightmare?

78
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,115
Ta-da!

79
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,077
I borrowed Vol. 16
of <i>Boy Detective Jaemin</i>.

80
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,954
Is it out already?

81
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,165
I had a hard time trying to borrow this.

82
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,667
- Gosh. I think I had a nightmare.
- Really?

83
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,214
ROOM 201 YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE

84
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,132
I didn't sleep well
because I was so curious.

85
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,760
Who do you think committed the crime?

86
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:10,012
- The culprit?
- Yes.

87
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,764
Didn't he do it?

88
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:14,100
No, he had no reason to kill him.

89
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,518
I'm sure he did.

90
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,814
Mr. Sa, in detective stories,
the ones who seem like the villain

91
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,441
are not the ones who did it.

92
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:23,984
Aah…

93
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,068
Good morning.

94
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:26,070
Hello.

95
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,030
Hi, Mari.
Did you get home okay last night?

96
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,115
Of course.

97
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,034
No, she didn't.
She fell asleep here last...

98
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,417
What are you talking about?

99
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,752
I tried to wake you up,
but you didn't budge.

100
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,213
I waited until the taxi came
and just left.

101
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,424
I can't sleep anywhere else
but in my own bed.

102
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,260
Mr. Cheon wouldn't even know
if you carried him away in his sleep.

103
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,053
Aah.

104
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:55,182
This is unbelievable.

105
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,184
Let's say you're right.

106
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,104
Ah!

107
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,190
What is it?

108
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,859
Gosh, I almost saw a spoiler.

109
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,902
Spoiler? Did you see who did it?

110
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,279
Fortunately, I didn't.

111
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,408
Mr. Sa, can you check for me?

112
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:14,535
No, I'll read it later.

113
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:17,788
You couldn't guess who did it anyway.
Check it out for me.

114
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,957
No way. I'm going to read it later.

115
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,127
Darn it. Who the heck did it?
They did this last time as well.

116
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,378
What is it?

117
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,756
THE VILLAIN

118
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,259
- Are you talking about this?
- Come on.

119
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:32,052
Ms. Baek. You really have to be careful.

120
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,804
If you ruin it for me, you're done here.

121
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,474
Stop.

122
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,060
I'll fix it for you.

123
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,812
This isn't such a big deal.

124
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,064
You're going to fix it for us? How?

125
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,024
Grant me a wish?

126
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,569
Fine. Think of whatever wish you'd like.

127
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:49,945
Okay.

128
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,364
BOY DETECTIVE JAEMIN

129
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,160
There. Take a look.
It's all taken care of.

130
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,129
Okay.

131
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,136
Hmm?

132
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,059
What the heck? Did you fix it like this?

133
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,102
THE VILLAIN, THE VILLAIN, THE VILLAIN

134
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,146
Now, that's one way to fix it.

135
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,732
How did you come up with that?

136
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,283
Well, all right.

137
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,786
Well done, Ms. Baek.
I admit that you did a good job.

138
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,413
You'd better keep your promise
about my wish.

139
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,707
Of course. I'll keep my promise.

140
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,752
I can't believe she fixed it like this.

141
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:51,423
Gosh, how did she think
of fixing it like this?

142
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,969
By the way, do you remember
the files I asked you to organize?

143
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,429
Bring it to my desk later.

144
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,682
Ah…

145
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,227
Was that due today?

146
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,436
Yes.

147
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,314
Why?

148
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,067
You didn't do it?

149
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,613
No, not yet.

150
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,781
What did you say?

151
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,741
- I haven't done it yet.
- What?

152
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,118
I haven't done it.

153
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,787
I see. You didn't do it.

154
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,756
Mari, you shouldn't be
fixing things like this.

155
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,633
You should be doing your work.

156
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,927
Come to your senses.

157
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,310
Excuse me.

158
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:47,563
How can I help you?

159
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,988
What can we do for you?

160
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:58,282
I hope you can take this case.

161
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:00,075
There aren't any lawyers available.

162
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,577
There aren't any lawyers available?

163
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,035
Why aren't there any lawyers?
There are over 30,000.

164
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,374
Why aren't there any lawyers?
There are over 30,000.

165
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,962
It's a murder case.

166
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:19,345
I'm sorry… We don't take
on violent crimes like murder.

167
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:21,388
I swear he didn't do it.

168
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,308
I'm sorry, but it's our office policy.

169
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:27,603
He said he was sure
you would help him out.

170
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,272
That I'd help him out?
Is it someone I know?

171
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,983
He said that I'd help him?

172
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,031
Please read through this.
My brother is waiting for you.

173
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,632
Why look at it
when we aren't taking it on?

174
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,550
We promised not to do anything scary.

175
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,762
Mr. Cheon is a scaredy-cat.

176
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,057
I'll just see what kind of case it is.

177
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,851
Mr. Cheon, aren't you curious?

178
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,436
It seems like someone you know.

179
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,105
I am curious. Yes.

180
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,357
Then, how about this? Let's vote on it.

181
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,775
Vote?

182
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,985
Since when did we vote on things?

183
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,149
Since there are three of us,
why don't we vote on it?

184
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,157
Okay. Since I work here too,
let's take a vote.

185
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,242
Very good.

186
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,828
Okay. We'll take a look at the case file,
yes or no?

187
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,037
One, two, three.

188
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,423
I'll look at it first.

189
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,434
I didn't see anything.

190
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,978
What's wrong? You were dying
to find out only a moment ago.

191
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,605
Then, let me take a look…

192
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,193
I didn't see anything either.

193
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,250
Oh.

194
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,420
Isn't it that case?
The one that happened up there.

195
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,839
It is. Thanks to this case,

196
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,718
the whole country knows
of our neighborhood, Pungjin-dong.

197
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,059
A FORTNIGHT AGO

198
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,478
YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE

199
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,708
Hey, where did the knife go?

200
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,572
POLICE

201
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,545
Any words to your late mother?

202
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,381
You claimed that the murderer
is your missing father, is that true?

203
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,983
- Didn't they get along?
- A comment, please!

204
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:45,217
Give us a statement!

205
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,013
Please move out of the way!

206
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,306
A word, please!

207
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,768
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

208
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,311
<i>He killed his parent.</i>

209
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,272
I'm against it. No.

210
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,565
I'm against it too.

211
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:02,860
He didn't go to trial,
but isn't it already a done deal?

212
00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:04,653
He's clearly the murderer.

213
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,447
Look, Mr. Cheon.

214
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,284
You aren't considering
taking this case, are you?

215
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,164
Look at this.

216
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,834
"The devil of the ages."

217
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,919
Even the title is horrifying.

218
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,171
"The murder of an artist couple.

219
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,092
"All of the lawyers withdraw." Okay.

220
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,259
Let me see.

221
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,802
Look.

222
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,182
"When the public criticized them
for being the devil's lawyer,

223
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,352
Law Firm Baek who were representing him
decided to withdraw…"

224
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,980
LAW FIRM BAEK

225
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:41,690
- Baek?
- Yes, Baek.

226
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:44,109
If a huge law firm like that
would withdraw from it,

227
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:45,652
why would we take it on?

228
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:50,574
This case doesn't go
with the characteristics of our office.

229
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:52,451
I think so too.

230
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,035
We're indebted to him.

231
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:56,580
- Indebted to him?
- Yes, we are.

232
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:58,415
Don't you remember him, Mr. Sa?

233
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,583
What?

234
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,151
It's perfect.

235
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,915
- Wow.
- Hang on, Mr. Sa.

236
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,710
Let me appreciate it for a moment.

237
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:49,132
Who knew you had such a talent?

238
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,843
It's alive. It's as if it's moving.

239
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,387
It's running through a meadow.

240
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,932
Isn't it a cow?

241
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:03,689
It was me. I'm just going to erase it.

242
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,773
It was a self-portrait.

243
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:08,735
I can see the agony.

244
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,865
Want me to do it for cheap?

245
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,119
Pardon?

246
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,748
Ms. Cho, how's your heart?
Prepare your heart for this.

247
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,833
Ta-da!

248
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,295
How is it? Isn't it nice?

249
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,090
You do have something you're good at.

250
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:31,973
For a month's rent,
I did this work for cheap.

251
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,387
But I was thinking about this mural…

252
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,683
If we drew this mural
all the way up to the top,

253
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:43,353
the painting would look very majestic and…

254
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:47,107
- Spectacular!
- Spectacular, don't you think?

255
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:51,236
Should we cut a deal for six months' rent?

256
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,363
No way!

257
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,449
Unbelievable.

258
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,951
My goodness. Geez!

259
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,454
The whole neighborhood
looks totally different.

260
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,372
It looks so warm and friendly.

261
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,708
- It's so nice!
- So, nice!

262
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,168
You're a lawyer, aren't you?

263
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,175
Yes, I am. I am… a lawyer.

264
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,510
I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.

265
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,305
I don't know how I can thank you.

266
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,931
You don't have to thank me.

267
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:24,269
If I need your help later on,
just help me out.

268
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,690
I can't believe someone who drew
something like this

269
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,941
could do something like that.

270
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,279
Now that I know what he's like,
even this picture gives me the creeps.

271
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:38,784
No, he didn't seem like that at all.

272
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,994
Didn't we say that we'd help him?

273
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,205
I'm sure it was just in passing.

274
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,791
Even if it was just in passing,
it's still a verbal promise.

275
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,503
You didn't give him an answer, though.

276
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,423
He did ask you to help him out,

277
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,717
but you didn't say that you'd help him.

278
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,345
Come to think of it, I don't think...

279
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,679
You didn't give him an answer.

280
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,975
- Let's just go grab a bite. Come on.
- Yes, let's go grab a bite.

281
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,602
I didn't answer, did I?

282
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:12,192
Mr. Cheon, you said you didn't
give him an answer,

283
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:13,985
so why are you looking at that again?

284
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,072
Didn't you say we should go eat?
Aren't we going to go eat?

285
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,281
Mr. Cheon.

286
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:19,865
Mr. Sa.

287
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,662
Why did Kim Minjae want me
to represent him?

288
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,372
Don't you think it's rather strange?

289
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,832
Why is that strange?

290
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,875
I guess you were the only lawyer he knew.

291
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,545
- Don't you think so, Ms. Baek?
- Exactly.

292
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,088
He doesn't know anyone else.

293
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,592
If Law Firm Baek refused to represent him,
shouldn't he go to another big law firm?

294
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,253
Don't you think so, Ms. Baek?

295
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,095
Oh.

296
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,346
That's true.

297
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:44,558
That is kind of strange.

298
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,519
If he comes from a famous artist family,
he must be rich.

299
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:49,896
Shouldn't he look for
another famous lawyer?

300
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,315
He has been wrongfully charged
with murder.

301
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,985
So, why did he ask for you?

302
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,905
Exactly. Ms. Baek, you are so sharp!

303
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,740
How are you so smart? Hmm.

304
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,119
All right. That's why
we should go see him.

305
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:06,454
What? Who?

306
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,373
Kim Minjae.

307
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,125
What? Why?

308
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,668
We have to meet him

309
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,005
to ask him why he wants me
to represent him.

310
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,258
Mari, can you drive?

311
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,550
You have a nice car.

312
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,432
Let's head over there.

313
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,268
Darn it.

314
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,951
PROSECUTORS FOR THE PEOPLE,
TRUSTWORTHY PROSECUTORS, FAIR PROSECUTORS

315
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,070
Gosh, this smell.

316
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,323
It hasn't changed at all.

317
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,168
Have you heard of the Pungjin-dong case?
The son murdered his parents.

318
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,413
That case is giving me a headache.

319
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:49,664
Yes, I heard about it.

320
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:52,125
Was it already handed over to us?

321
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,252
The higher-ups are very interested
in this case,

322
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,629
so I was told to do a good job.

323
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,339
The higher-ups are interested?

324
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,674
It'd be weird if they weren't.
The news is all over it.

325
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,846
- Want to take this opportunity to join us?
- What? Me?

326
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,058
If you join us,
it'll make things much easier for me.

327
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,019
Why not? You can get
some of the spotlights too.

328
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,481
Spotlight?

329
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:19,361
From now, the investigation
of the Pungjin-dong case…

330
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,448
The Pungjin-dong case…

331
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,912
The Pungjin-dong case...

332
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:32,999
The result of the investigation…

333
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:36,378
The Pungjin-dong case…

334
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,506
Wait! Who is behind all this?

335
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,091
I can't see anything!

336
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,846
IN-DEPTH COVERAGE

337
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:50,307
No.

338
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,311
I… Well…

339
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,897
No. I don't want to take on a murder case.

340
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:00,193
My gosh. What a shame.

341
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:03,363
It would be nice for you
to get some publicity.

342
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,451
Do you know Prosecutor Park
in Violent Crimes?

343
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,536
He looks like a gangster.

344
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,663
Yes, I thought he was arrested
when I first saw him.

345
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:12,956
Yes, that's Prosecutor Park.

346
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,334
After he caught that gang member
and was in the news…

347
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,796
How many more followers
did he get on his social media?

348
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,134
Oh, I think it was over 100,000.

349
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,553
Over 100,000?

350
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,929
Over 100,000?

351
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:33,226
He got 100,000 followers
over something like that?

352
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,104
15 FOLLOWERS PROSECUTOR SEO MINHYEOK

353
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,692
You can easily have one million followers.

354
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,988
Come on. One million followers?
That's insane.

355
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,493
ONE MILLION FOLLOWERS

356
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:55,373
You're the most handsome
in our district prosecutor's office.

357
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,626
That is true.

358
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,919
Won't you do it?

359
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:01,963
I'll think about it.

360
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,259
What are you going to do
when you meet him?

361
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,511
I'm going to ask him since I'm curious.

362
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,310
Mr. Cheon, there's something more to it
than what I know, isn't there?

363
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:17,103
What do you mean?

364
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,267
You aren't meeting him
simply because you're curious.

365
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,109
I am meeting him because I am curious.

366
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,576
PROPER CORRECTION

367
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,259
REFORMATION

368
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,044
It's been a long time, Mr. Kim Minjae.

369
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,278
This is Ms. Baek Mari, attorney-at-law.

370
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:09,447
Hello. Nice to meet you.

371
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,282
I am meeting you for the first time,

372
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:13,827
but it isn't nice for me.

373
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,829
Oh, you're right.

374
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,413
I'm just kidding.

375
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:24,087
It did pay off to help you out back then.

376
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,841
We haven't decided
to take on your case yet.

377
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:31,636
But the fact that you came
all the way here means there's a chance.

378
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,141
The rest is left to how I answer.

379
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,809
Isn't that right?

380
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,061
That's about right.

381
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:44,899
Both of your parents died. Aren't you sad?

382
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,068
Do I have to be sad?

383
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,282
It isn't both of them.
Isn't it just one of them?

384
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,493
My father hasn't been found yet,
so he's missing.

385
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,829
I heard you claim innocence.

386
00:24:57,912 --> 00:24:59,414
It's not a claim, it's the truth.

387
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,751
The prosecution says
I disposed of my father's dead body…

388
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,755
and did that to my mother,

389
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,216
but I was simply taking a bath.

390
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,760
I didn't know what was
going on downstairs.

391
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:17,515
If I had known, do you think
I would've taken a bath?

392
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,310
A bubble bath at that?

393
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,146
It doesn't seem normal
to take a bubble bath at that hour either.

394
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:26,149
Just because it isn't normal
doesn't mean it's a crime.

395
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:31,738
Then, Mr. Kim,
who do you think did that to your mother?

396
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:36,701
My missing father.

397
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,832
The two didn't get along.

398
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,627
You didn't get along with them either,
did you?

399
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,467
I was looking forward
to meeting my lawyer.

400
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,387
But it feels like a prosecutor is here.

401
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:58,932
I'm sorry. Actually,

402
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,059
there's a particular reason
why we came here.

403
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:05,355
There's a huge gap
between Law Firm Baek and our office.

404
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,857
Why do you want us to represent you?

405
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,568
I thought they'd be good
because they're big and expensive,

406
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,892
but they weren't so impressive.

407
00:26:13,112 --> 00:26:14,155
They kept minding others.

408
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,494
They wanted to withdraw,
so I told them to do so.

409
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,827
So?

410
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,956
I thought about hiring another law firm,

411
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,875
but it might appear as though
I'm getting away with it using my money.

412
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,713
While I was searching for one,
you came to my mind.

413
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,340
Okay, and?

414
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,680
Is that all?

415
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,932
You aren't putting much effort into it.

416
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,601
You may not be released
if you lose the trial.

417
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,980
You should be more careful
about hiring a lawyer.

418
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:50,233
But I'm not guilty.

419
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,778
Why would I worry about that?

420
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,532
Don't you think so?

421
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:04,289
Doesn't he seem rather creepy?

422
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,832
What do you mean?

423
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,294
Well, he doesn't act
like he was wrongfully charged.

424
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,131
It's odd that he is so relaxed
in a situation like this.

425
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,550
And he seems pretty clever.

426
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,551
Mm.

427
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:24,892
You won't take it, right?

428
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,646
You've got all your answers.

429
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,130
Let's drop by one more place.
I need to figure something out.

430
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,153
Where are we going now? Hey.

431
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,696
Mr. Cheon.

432
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,540
Why do you want to go here?

433
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,752
This law firm withdrew from this case.

434
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,503
I have to ask them something in person.

435
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:53,921
Aah.

436
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,716
Did you make an appointment?
You should make one first.

437
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,635
Sure. I'll make one when I see them.

438
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:02,847
Who makes an appointment
when they see the person?

439
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,515
Right here.

440
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:08,186
He's driving me insane.

441
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,525
Ms. Baek.

442
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:17,403
What are you doing? Let's get going.

443
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,036
It was ruled as unconstitutional,

444
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:28,247
so please thoroughly search
for related materials and instances.

445
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,375
Yes, sir.

446
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,799
A lawyer called Cheon Jihun
is here to see you.

447
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,968
We're in a meeting, so tell him
to make an appointment next time.

448
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,345
No.

449
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,639
Let him in.

450
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:45,973
Pardon?

451
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:48,685
Let's take a brief break.

452
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:51,771
Let's take a break.

453
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:53,147
It's been a long time, sir.

454
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,233
Yes, it has been a long time.

455
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,485
Pretend you don't know me.

456
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,206
Oh, this is my probationary employee.
Ms. Baek, say hello to them.

457
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:13,584
Hello. Let me greet you. I'm Baek Mari.

458
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,002
Nice to meet you.

459
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,629
Nice to meet you too.

460
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,383
Anyway, what brings you here?

461
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:25,513
I heard you withdrew
from representing the Pungjin-dong case.

462
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:29,559
Yes, is there a problem with that?

463
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,185
I thought I'd take that case.

464
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,896
- Mr. Cheon.
- Yes?

465
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,608
You're about to take on a difficult case.

466
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,652
You'll receive a lot of criticism too.

467
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,863
When Mr. Seo took on the case,

468
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,032
- he was called the devil's lawyer.
- Well,

469
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,577
that's not why I quit though.

470
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:50,747
I came here to see
if I could get your help.

471
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,708
As long as there aren't any legal issues,
of course, I can.

472
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,169
So, why did you withdraw from the case?

473
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,758
- Mr. Cheon.
- Yes?

474
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,888
Isn't that a bit rude?

475
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,558
You came here without an appointment.

476
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,685
Now, you're asking me
why I withdrew from the case.

477
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:15,313
Yes, you're right.

478
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,523
I'm sorry. I'd like to apologize.

479
00:30:18,232 --> 00:30:19,984
I accept your apology.

480
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,279
You know that Mr. Kim is
pleading not guilty, don't you?

481
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:26,157
- Yes.
- He claims that his father did it

482
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,242
and that his father is still alive.

483
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:29,994
Yes.

484
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:32,705
Do you think his father is
still alive too, Mr. Cheon?

485
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,127
That's why I withdrew.

486
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,299
I take on the case
as long as I believe he's alive,

487
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:44,675
but I couldn't believe that.

488
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,845
So, I couldn't figure out a way
to defend Mr. Kim.

489
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,429
Anyway,

490
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,518
why are you thinking
of taking on this case?

491
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,562
Because I believe he's alive.

492
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,491
Do you believe he's alive? Says who?

493
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:09,784
Says me.

494
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,744
The body simply hasn't been found.

495
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,122
It's obvious that Mr. Kim Minjae
killed him and disposed of the body.

496
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,888
Are you a probationary judicial officer
or my probationary employee?

497
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,797
Of course, I am your probationary employee
at the moment.

498
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,967
You've only worked for two months,
but you see him as the murderer.

499
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,594
What if the body is found tomorrow?

500
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,971
- If it's found...
- Yes.

501
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,264
- If it's found...
- Yes.

502
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,515
It won't be found.

503
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,101
Hmm?

504
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:42,066
B, A, E, K.

505
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:43,985
How is that read in Korean?

506
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,946
- Baek.
- What is your last name?

507
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:49,614
Baek.

508
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,868
Law Firm Baek.

509
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,579
Baek Mari.

510
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,081
Are you…

511
00:31:58,457 --> 00:31:59,542
Well…

512
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:02,920
There are so many Baeks out there.

513
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,759
Who?

514
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,639
- Baek Jongwon.
- And?

515
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,433
- Baek Zyoung.
- And?

516
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,435
- Baek Yoonsik.
- And?

517
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,395
And?

518
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:23,316
Baek Seungsu.

519
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,479
Oh, there's Baek Seungsu.
Did you watch <i>Stove League</i>?

520
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,569
Of course.

521
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:29,488
That was really good. I don't know
why they aren't making season two.

522
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,324
Don't you know either?

523
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,662
No, I don't.

524
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,461
You know, it looks so good
every time I see it.

525
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,172
You can go here.

526
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,966
PROSECUTOR SEO MINHYEOK

527
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,468
DAD

528
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:54,597
Yes, Dad.

529
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,937
Yes, Father. What is this about?

530
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,994
<i>Where are you?
At the Prosecutor's Office?</i>

531
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,649
Yes, I'm unpacking at the moment.

532
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:06,525
Come downstairs.

533
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,569
What? You're here?

534
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,448
Are you okay, Mr. Seo?

535
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:14,033
ROOM 401, PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

536
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:15,117
I'm on my way.

537
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,753
You know about the Pungjin-dong case,
don't you?

538
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,630
Of course.

539
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,385
I keep hearing about Pungjin-dong.
Why is it such a hot topic?

540
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:33,636
I want you to be in charge.

541
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:36,847
Didn't you want me to be
strategic in my choices?

542
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,099
Why would I take that case?

543
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,852
You can win that case no matter what.
No matter what.

544
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,145
No matter what?

545
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,108
They haven't even found the weapon
used in the murder nor the body.

546
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,609
I'm sure they'll find it soon.

547
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,404
Do you think I'd tell you
to take a case you'd lose?

548
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,991
Also, Cheon Jihun took this case.

549
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,661
He came by with Mari a while ago.

550
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:03,124
I'm sure he had a reason
for sending Mari there.

551
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,167
You should win that case

552
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:08,462
so that you can leave a good impression
on Mr. Baek...

553
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:12,299
Detective, can you please compile
the files on the Pungjin-dong case?

554
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,262
No, lunch isn't important right now.
I'll buy you something good later.

555
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,223
I was still talking. Geez.

556
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,071
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me right now?

557
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:35,990
How could you take this case?

558
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:38,159
What are you taking this case for?

559
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,536
You are driving me insane!

560
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,872
Let's go insane together, Mr. Sa.

561
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,790
Look at that.

562
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,677
He notified the Prosecutors' Office
and copied all the related files.

563
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,336
You just went to see him.

564
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,756
Kim Minjae didn't do it.

565
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,632
- Why do you say that?
- Why?

566
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,594
Ms. Baek.

567
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,805
Do you know what kind of person I am?

568
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,724
I'm the person…

569
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:05,144
who guessed the villain
of <i>Boy Detective Jaemin</i>, Vol. 16.

570
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,772
You can count on me.

571
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:16,572
I figured it out. The villain is…

572
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:25,748
Ms. Baek.

573
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:29,627
Let's begin on the day before

574
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,505
the incident occurred.

575
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,589
Sorry.

576
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,679
According to the prosecution's records,
on May 1st, at 6:00 p.m.,

577
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,847
in their residence,

578
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,769
<i>there were the famous artist Kim Chungil
who was celebrating his 58th birthday,</i>

579
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,272
<i>his wife and director
of Gallery Yeongwon Yoo Heeju,</i>

580
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,733
<i>their children Kim Suyeon and Kim Minjae,</i>

581
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,362
<i>art journalist Park Jaeu,</i>

582
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,239
<i>Gallery Yeongwon's curator Ju Seowon,</i>

583
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,491
and the housekeeper Han Jaesook.

584
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:03,119
There were a total of seven people there.

585
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,664
- Happy Birthday, Mr. Kim.
- Happy Birthday, Mr. Kim.

586
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,208
I told you not to make a fuss about this.

587
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,210
If you were okay with it,

588
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:14,255
I would've invited people over
for a garden party,

589
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,549
but you don't like to be
the center of attention.

590
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,385
An artist speaks through his paintings.
There's no need to meet up.

591
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:22,513
Mr. Park, this is how he is.

592
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,683
So many people are interested
in his exhibition this time as well.

593
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,185
Hopefully, that interest
will lead to the auction.

594
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,480
I'll support you well
through my article, sir.

595
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,065
That isn't necessary.

596
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:38,863
<i>According to Ms. Han Jaesook,</i>

597
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,115
there wasn't any issue before,

598
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:43,492
but after Mr. Kim Minjae
was told to go study abroad,

599
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,703
he started having issues with his parents.

600
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,788
<i>Gosh, you're free now.</i>

601
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,872
I'm so jealous.

602
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,002
Do you want to go to my place?

603
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,628
What?

604
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,088
Don't mind him. Let's go hang out.

605
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,215
<i>According to his friends,</i>

606
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:02,136
<i>his parents were forcing him
to study abroad, so he didn't want to go.</i>

607
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:09,935
<i>Mr. Kim Minjae took a taxi home
and arrived at 00:50 a.m.</i>

608
00:37:10,644 --> 00:37:12,229
What are you doing to me?

609
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,440
- Let go.
- Hey, Kim Minjae.

610
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,808
01:05 A.M., HAN JAESOOK SEES
YOO HEEJU AND KIM MINJAE ARGUING

611
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,500
After that, it was pretty quiet.

612
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,254
Didn't you say the curator
and the journalist stayed at the annex?

613
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,089
Did the two say anything in particular?

614
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,260
The annex was quite far
from the main house,

615
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,512
so they didn't hear anything.

616
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:48,217
Then, what about Kim Minjae?

617
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,934
Well, he testified

618
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,853
he went upstairs to his room
and fell asleep.

619
00:37:52,978 --> 00:37:55,981
Then, what about Kim Suyeon?
Didn't she hear them fight?

620
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,151
No, she didn't hear anything either
as she was asleep too.

621
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:01,904
What? No one heard anything then.

622
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:03,405
How couldn't they hear anything?

623
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,758
- And...
- Maybe the rooms are soundproof.

624
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,617
Yes, they used good building materials.

625
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,780
I didn't sleep well
since my neighbors were fighting.

626
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:10,246
- And...
- Call the police.

627
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,872
- Should I?
- Yes.

628
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,250
Please pay attention. Focus.

629
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,420
All right. What goes on from now
is important.

630
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,507
The prosecution thinks that
between two to three o'clock,

631
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,094
Mr. Kim Minjae murdered his father
in an unknown method…

632
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:30,349
<i>and left the house
to dispose of the body.</i>

633
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,981
<i>At that time, the CCTV at the gate</i>

634
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,608
<i>caught Mr. Kim Minjae
driving away in the car.</i>

635
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:43,612
The prosecution is focused
on this statement.

636
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,532
How much have you found out
about the movement of the car?

637
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,735
Its location's been confirmed
up to Mt. Yongho Tunnel.

638
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:53,080
<i>It is estimated that he stayed
around there for one and a half hours.</i>

639
00:38:53,872 --> 00:38:56,792
<i>Prosecution suspects that he has
disposed of his father's body</i>

640
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:59,920
<i>in the vicinity of
Mt. Yongho at that time.</i>

641
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,634
<i>But Kim Minjae is claiming that
he came to Mt. Yongho to get some air</i>

642
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,178
<i>and fell asleep in his car, right?</i>

643
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:12,641
Yes, but the prosecution's claim
is much more convincing.

644
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,019
Why? There isn't even dashcam footage.

645
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,438
It isn't a convincing claim.

646
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,691
Maybe it isn't that there wasn't
footage but that Mr. Kim got rid of it,

647
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,193
since he had to get rid
of his father's body.

648
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,321
Well, all right.

649
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,740
Then, where is
his father's body now, Ms. Baek?

650
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,827
In the vicinity of Mt. Yongho.

651
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,704
They'll find it in no time.

652
00:39:33,787 --> 00:39:36,165
It's a large area,
but it's only a matter of time.

653
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,374
No.

654
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,627
The father is alive
and probably hiding somewhere.

655
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,129
Are you going to be like this?

656
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:44,590
Mr. Cheon,
do you really believe he's alive?

657
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:48,093
Until the prosecution finds the body,
we have to believe he's alive.

658
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,347
We're his attorneys. Don't you think so?

659
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,307
Yes.

660
00:39:56,643 --> 00:40:00,189
Han Jaesook went to get groceries
at four in the morning.

661
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,358
<i>She says the house was quiet then.</i>

662
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,697
<i>And at around 5:00 a.m.,
Mr. Kim Minjae returns home.</i>

663
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,664
KIM MINJAE

664
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,380
Where's Father?

665
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,385
Pardon? What are you talking about?

666
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,136
I can't find your father.

667
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,641
Why are you asking me about that?

668
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,685
Yes, you're right.

669
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,563
Go upstairs and get some sleep.
I should try calling him.

670
00:40:55,702 --> 00:40:58,080
DIRECTOR YOO HEEJU, ATELIER

671
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,666
<i>The person you are calling
cannot answer the phone.</i>

672
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:36,285
How could he do such a thing
as a human being?

673
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,747
Ms. Baek, can you give me some time
to calm down?

674
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,792
Mr. Cheon, I'm shaking.

675
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,589
Kim Suyeon gets
an urgent call at 5:30 a.m.

676
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,924
and leaves the house at 5:40 a.m.

677
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:53,302
She didn't see anything
at that time either?

678
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,678
Or heard anything?

679
00:41:54,761 --> 00:41:57,681
According to Ms. Kim Sooyeon,
she couldn't see anything as it was dark.

680
00:41:57,764 --> 00:42:01,101
And she says she can't hear anything
from downstairs in her room.

681
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:05,522
This family never sees or hears anything.
I'm sick and tired of it.

682
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,648
I know.

683
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,945
After that, Han Jaesook
returns home around 6:00 a.m.

684
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,491
and discovers Director Yoo Heeju
who was lying in the atelier.

685
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,244
The prosecution thinks that

686
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:23,415
Mr. Kim Minjae stabbed his mother
Ms. Yoo Heeju between 5:10 to 5:30 a.m.

687
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:26,376
But Kim Minjae is claiming

688
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:31,882
he came home,
washed his hands at the sink,

689
00:42:31,965 --> 00:42:33,091
drank some water,

690
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:36,762
and went straight to his room, right?

691
00:42:37,262 --> 00:42:39,056
What do you think, Ms. Baek?

692
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:41,934
If he really disposed of
his father's dead body,

693
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,853
why would he leave his mother's body

694
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,481
and go to his bathroom

695
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,816
to peacefully take a bubble bath?

696
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,612
He tried to get rid of her body,

697
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,406
but Ms. Kim Suyeon got
an unexpected urgent call

698
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,076
and left at a time
that was different from usual.

699
00:42:59,826 --> 00:43:02,246
And Ms. Han Jaesook
was about to return home as well.

700
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,706
He didn't have time
to get rid of her body.

701
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,499
<i>On top of that…</i>

702
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,271
- Tell me about the patient.
- It's an abdominal stabbing.

703
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:11,296
Mom.

704
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,715
Suyeon.

705
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,303
Minjae…

706
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,181
- We don't have time. Take her inside.
- One moment, sir!

707
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,476
Get me epinephrin and blood.

708
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,525
Yes!

709
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,780
<i>Their mother Yoo Heeju's
last words were,</i>

710
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:38,949
"Suyeon, Minjae…"

711
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,035
The prosecution is
taking note of those words.

712
00:43:42,744 --> 00:43:44,371
He did it. He sure did.

713
00:43:45,038 --> 00:43:50,085
"Suyeon, Minjae… stabbed me with a knife."

714
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,380
What do you call one's last words
before they die?

715
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:55,215
A dying message?

716
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,551
That's it. Dying message.

717
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,388
That's not how you act.

718
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:03,432
Do I have to show you how to do this?

719
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,771
"Suyeon, Minjae…"

720
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,527
didn't see me and walked right by me."
She might've said that.

721
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,156
Gosh, why does a lawyer even have to act?
How embarrassing.

722
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:22,951
You are the perfect person
to be called the devil's lawyer.

723
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,746
Try saying that in court
and see what people say.

724
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,456
What do you think people would say?

725
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,790
You went too far.

726
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,835
What I'm saying is that
Director Yoo's last words can't be used

727
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:33,337
as a testimony in court.

728
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,341
Most importantly, we haven't even
found the knife that was used.

729
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,842
<i>Have you found the knife?</i>

730
00:44:40,093 --> 00:44:41,595
How did you know it was a knife?

731
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,597
Don't people normally use a knife?

732
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,725
You stabbed her, didn't you?

733
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:52,147
So, how are you going to prove
Mr. Kim Minjae's innocence?

734
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,858
The knife hasn't been found
and there's no body.

735
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:56,568
Are those your only claims?

736
00:44:56,652 --> 00:45:00,113
Ms. Baek, what is the prosecution doing
to prove Mr. Kim's guilt?

737
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:04,826
I have been telling you that they are
searching for Artist Kim's dead body.

738
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,180
That's certainly an answer
from someone who got 85 points.

739
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,039
Then, what should we do from now?

740
00:45:09,122 --> 00:45:10,374
- What?
- What?

741
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,167
- What?
- That's it.

742
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,628
As lawyers representing Kim Minjae,

743
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,057
we need to search
for the living Artist Kim.

744
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,341
What on earth are you...

745
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,552
How are we supposed to find him?

746
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,722
That's why we should find someone
who knows him well first.

747
00:45:34,272 --> 00:45:36,525
Can't this car go any more quietly?

748
00:45:37,275 --> 00:45:39,528
Good driving.

749
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,113
What are you talking about?

750
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,994
Isn't that Ms. Kim Suyeon?

751
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,746
She's calling me.

752
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,915
Suyeon, I'm right up front...

753
00:45:51,998 --> 00:45:54,167
Mr. Cheon, I have a patient
that needs urgent care.

754
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,419
We'll have to meet tomorrow.

755
00:45:56,294 --> 00:45:58,380
Yes. Okay.

756
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,675
All right. See you tomorrow. Bye.

757
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,844
What? She's right there.

758
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,638
- Over here...
- Stop. It's suspicious.

759
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,725
She said she has an emergency patient
and asked to meet tomorrow.

760
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,813
Duck!

761
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,692
Why don't you just tell
everyone we're here? She's gone.

762
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,402
Let's see who her emergency patient is.

763
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,822
Okay.

764
00:46:57,939 --> 00:46:58,939
Welcome.

765
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,343
Under whose name is the reservation?

766
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,116
Oh, we were in a rush
so we couldn't make a reservation.

767
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,244
During the first week
of the previous month,

768
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,664
we take reservations of all the guests
who will come in the following month.

769
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,374
Can't you make an exception for today?

770
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,920
Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry,
but would you please leave?

771
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,243
You're the manager, aren't you?

772
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:26,092
This is confidential, but we are
actually doing an investigation.

773
00:47:26,676 --> 00:47:29,471
An investigation? Are you the police?

774
00:47:31,097 --> 00:47:32,766
No, I'm a private detective.

775
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,184
A detective?

776
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:35,477
Well…

777
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,119
MENU

778
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,634
Who is she waiting for?

779
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:10,804
I'm not sure. Let's wait and see.

780
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,475
By the way, it's really nice here.
I've never been to a place like this.

781
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,435
Mr. Cheon, isn't a place like this pricey?

782
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,063
Mr. Sa, stop embarrassing me.

783
00:48:20,313 --> 00:48:22,233
If you don't know,
just go along with it like me.

784
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,627
What language is this?

785
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,505
French? Don't you know
how to speak French, Ms. Baek?

786
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:51,261
Oh, I speak a little English
but not French.

787
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:55,849
Let's just ask for the same thing
as that table.

788
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,601
Okay. Ask for the same thing.

789
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,608
Hmm.

790
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,325
There's only one dinner course.

791
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,536
We have to pick the main dish.

792
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,832
There's steak, duck breast,
and lamb chop. We'll go with steak.

793
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,167
Are we all okay with medium?

794
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:24,419
Three wine pairings.

795
00:49:24,502 --> 00:49:28,048
And we'll have ice cream for dessert.
Ms. Baek,

796
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,634
please pass that on.

797
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:50,570
Gosh, the meat is so tough these days.

798
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:07,003
- Hey, that person is…
- That person.

799
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,468
She's the housekeeper, Han Jaesook.

800
00:50:13,551 --> 00:50:14,552
RÉSUMÉ
NAME: HAN JAESOOK

801
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:22,018
- What are they talking about?
- Hush, Ms. Baek.

802
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:25,355
Be quiet. I can't hear a thing
they're saying.

803
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,316
What do you think they're talking about?

804
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,777
What does she have to talk about
with the housekeeper?

805
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,278
You don't think...

806
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,489
You don't think it's about the case,
do you?

807
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,867
You don't think it's about the case,
do you?

808
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,412
Aah.

We have to pick the main dish.

814
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,287
There's steak, duck breast,
and lamb chop. We'll go with steak.

815
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,832
Who really is he?

816
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:33,923
Ms. Baek.

817
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,260
Aren't you hungry?

818
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,596
Do places like that
usually give that little?

819
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,140
How do French people survive
eating that little?

820
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,392
I'm hungry.

821
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:49,564
We should've eaten <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.
Why did we eat that?

822
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,942
Are you going somewhere at this hour?
Why did you change?

823
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,778
There's a place I want to check out.

824
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,906
I changed into something that was
more suitable to move around in.

825
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,577
Okay. Well, where?

826
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,039
I need to see the crime scene in person.

827
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,290
What?

828
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,168
At 11 o'clock at night?

829
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,506
It's so dark outside.
Where do you think you're going?

830
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,425
Are you kidding me right now?
Let's get going.

831
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,595
From now on,

832
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,181
call me Detective Cheon.

833
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,241
Aren't we leaving?

834
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:45,537
DETECTIVE CHEON JIHUN
DETECTIVE CHEON

835
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,501
Aren't we leaving?

836
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,135
Detective Cheon?

837
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,513
BEWARE OF DOG NO TRESPASSING

838
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,489
Come on. I thought
you wanted to see it for yourself.

839
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,414
Wait. My leg is cramping up.

840
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,048
Mr. Cheon, aren't you coming?

841
00:53:39,632 --> 00:53:41,509
It's too dark, so I'll come back later.

842
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,261
Take those sunglasses off.

843
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
Ah.

844
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:50,059
Shall we go in, then?

845
00:54:25,678 --> 00:54:27,138
Hey.

846
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:29,097
Here.

847
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:31,517
I think the power went out.

848
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,645
Let's come back during the day.

849
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:36,564
I didn't expect the power to be out.

850
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,441
That was my mistake.

851
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,027
Stop messing around.

852
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,877
Why is he breathing like that?

853
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,561
Hmm.

854
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,191
Do you think
Mr. Kim Minjae really didn't know?

855
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:22,944
If it was dark and he was drunk
at the time,

856
00:55:23,027 --> 00:55:25,196
we can't rule out that possibility.

857
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,240
Aren't you taking his side too much
as his lawyer?

858
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,951
I think it is possible.

859
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,997
Ms. Kim Suyeon said she didn't hear
the fighting from her room.

860
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,124
Let's check.

861
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,626
Mr. Sa.

862
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,712
By myself?

863
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,632
I don't want to.

864
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,716
Mari.

865
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,719
What?

866
00:55:50,471 --> 00:55:52,932
The person who wants to check
should go upstairs.

867
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,642
You should go, Mr. Cheon.

868
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,643
No.

869
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,186
- Why not?
- I'm scared.

870
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,189
I'll go upstairs with Mr. Sa, okay?

871
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,774
- No.
- Why not?

872
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:02,858
I'll be left alone.

873
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,403
My goodness. Fine, I'll go upstairs
by myself. Are you happy?

874
00:56:05,486 --> 00:56:06,529
Yes.

875
00:56:37,101 --> 00:56:39,228
Do you know what time it is?
Why are you so late?

876
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,606
It can happen. Why do you care?

877
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,024
You jerk!

878
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:46,652
- Mother, I...
- Ms. Baek!

879
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,071
Can you hear us?

880
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,657
It doesn't seem like she can.

881
00:56:52,116 --> 00:56:55,161
Ms. Baek, tell us if you can't hear us.

882
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:57,872
How can she answer you
if she can't hear you?

883
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,707
- Mm.
- Mm.

884
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,705
Mr. Cheon, someone is out there!

885
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:48,793
Mr. Cheon.

886
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:54,882
Stay here.

887
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:28,916
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

888
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,451
<i>As Kim Minjae claimed,</i>

889
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:06,537
<i>the likelihood that his father killed
his mother and disappeared is…</i>

890
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,261
He isn't even your real brother.
Do you believe everything he says?

891
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,708
<i>He can't even kill a bug.</i>

892
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:11,791
I'm the one who killed.

893
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,878
<i>Is that Mr. Kim Minjae's true self?</i>

894
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,772
- Why on earth did you do that?
<i>- Am I strange?</i>

895
01:01:15,796 --> 01:01:18,174
<i>Something isn't quite right.</i>

896
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,760
<i>Everyone is suspicious.
They're hiding something.</i>

897
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,596
<i>I think I finally solved the mystery.</i>
