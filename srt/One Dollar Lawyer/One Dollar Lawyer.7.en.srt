<i>What is Mr. Cheon like?</i>

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,381
<i>Tell me how he was as a prosecutor.</i>

-You're bolder than I thought.

15
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,637
Mr. Choi Kitae, you're under arrest
for destroying evidence.

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,890
<i>You guys are all dead
with this one phone call.</i>

17
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:57,807
Hey, you jerk!

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,975
<i>How dare you go there?</i>

19
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,228
You'll go far if you listen to your boss.

20
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,773
We'll have to release him immediately
as he said.

21
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,816

become famous, Minhyeok.</i>

24
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,656
<i>What are you going to do now?</i>

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,450
They will hire an above-average lawyer.

26
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,785
Tell them to come at me.

27
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,496
Shouldn't a jerk like him be made
to pay for his crimes?

28
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,873
Yes, you're right.
But this is the men's room.

29
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,708
It's Mr. Baek's firm. What do we do?

30
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,919
I guess we have to go another round
with the old men.

<i>She was their lawyer.</i>

00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,090
Excuse me. Were you playing with me?

00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,382

I meant… what I said earlier.

00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,970
The person who committed a crime
must be punished accordingly.

36
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,013
That's what I think.

37
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,057
Please win this trial.

38
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,518

LAW FIRM BAEK

44

JQ SLUSH FUND INVESTIGATION REPORT

45
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,113
Prior to concluding the investigation
of the JQ Group slush fund,

46
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,948
the prosecution arrested
President Choi Kitae

47
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,283
for destroying evidence.

48
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,745
For now, we stopped them
from arresting him.

49
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,246
They were supposed to close the case

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,082
saying that a finance officer
embezzled the funds and disappeared.

51
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,086
Yes, that's what they told us.

52
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,631
Then why are they doing this now,
all of a sudden?

53
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,886
They must've found something new.

54
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,389
Who's the prosecutor
that caused the trouble?

55
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,016
Yes.

56
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,979
It's Prosecutor Cheon Jihun.
He was in charge of search and seizure.

57
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,107
He lived in Paris, France
with his mother until high school.

58
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,152
After his mother passed away,
he returned to Korea.

59
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,946
What a special case.

60
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,032
I looked into him because he trained
with Minhyeok at the institute together.

61
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,784
He has no other family in Korea.

62
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,869
He has hardly any friends
or schoolmates here either.

63
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,872
He's so stubborn that
even the prosecution gave up on him.

64
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,418
It seems the senior officials
had no idea about this either.

65
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,006
So, how do you plan to respond?

66
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,802
Right now, we don't know
what the prosecution has.

67
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,931
So it will be most effective to say
Yang Sanggu has embezzled and disappeared.

68
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,641
President Choi

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,687
prefers to be interviewed
without attending as much as possible.

70
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,232
Can we ask for a written investigation?

71
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,944
I think it would be difficult

72
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,737
considering Prosecutor
Cheon Jihun's style.

73
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,198
Hmm.

74
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,783
Don't worry too much.

75
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,703
I will make a call tomorrow.

76
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,006
<i>Who drove the public opinion
that the investigation is overly harsh?</i>

77
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:02,635
<i>If one has committed a crime, they must
be punished accordingly. That's justice.</i>

78
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,348
<i>Please help us
to ensure justice lives in Korea.</i>

79
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,648
Must be punished accordingly…

80
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,151
That's justice.

81
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,365
Yes, Mr. Seo.

82
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,825
You can count on me.

83
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,079
Then President Choi Kitae will do a
written investigation without attendance.

84
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,541
Let's get a drink sometime.
Is Minhyeok doing well?

85
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,002
Do you mean Prosecutor Seo?

86
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,547
Yes.

87
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,349
For Choi Kitae, we will do
a written investigation.

88
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,894
-Yes.
-We can't.

89
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,147
We can't?

90
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,816
If you couldn't find Yang Sanggu,

91
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,403
you shouldn't have made this mess.
What if he's gone off and died?

92
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,447
Are you gonna investigate
until you find him?

93
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,991
It sounds like that's what you want.

94
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,534
What?

95
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,288
Have you lost your mind?

96
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,499
He wrote a will and disappeared.

97
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,209
He must've died somewhere!

98
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,920
Then why don't you
go find him and bring him in?

99
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,848
We're sorry, Deputy Prosecutor General.

100
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,683
Come on, let's go.

101
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,527
You better train your juniors better.

102
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,405
Yes, sir. Understood.

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

104
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,999
-Did you get yelled at a lot?
-Yes, a lot.

105
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,794
Are you going to keep causing trouble?

106
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,505
I'm sorry. But Yejin,

107
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,299
we weren't causing trouble.
We were trying to fix the--

108
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,386
-Hey.
-I just don't understand.

109
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,346
Everybody knows
Choi Kitae committed a crime.

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,348
We do. So what?

111
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,144
So is it right to starve our conscience
to feed their greed?

112
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,186
No!

113
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,358
Of course, not.

114
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,364
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to feed my conscience.

115
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,660
Wait for me.

116
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,137
Mr. Yang Sanggu gave this to you?

117
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,390
Yes. He told me to keep it safe.

118
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,686
Do you think he did something bad?

119
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,023
The kids think he's on a business trip.

120
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,652
Prosecutor Cheon, please find my husband.

121
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,863
Yes, of course.

122
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,792
You're back. What happened?

123
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,922
Choi Kitae's attendance was approved.

124
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,466
But it's only for one time.

125
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,552
-Is that okay?
-Mm.

126
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,095
Once...

127
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,181
is enough.

128
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,975
Really? How?

129
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,275
I paid you, lawyers, hundreds of millions.
Why can't you take care of it?

130
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,736
We agreed to a one-time attendance today.

131
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,947
I don't want to see that lunatic again.

132
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,408
Don't answer questions other than
the ones we practiced in advance.

133
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,620
"I don't know. I don't remember."
Do I need to say just those two things?

134
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,874
And for other tricky questions,
you can exercise the right to silence.

135
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,503
Do you have anything
you're keeping from me?

136
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,089
Don't you believe me?

137
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,634
No, I do not believe you.

138
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,302
Are you sure you're my lawyer?

139
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,555
That's why I don't believe you.

140
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:21,018
If you betray me as well,
then I really won't be able to defend you.

141
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,813
What else is there to hide?

142
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,148
There's nothing.

143
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,063
I have 2,000 people working for me.

144
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,899
How can I keep track
of what each one is doing?

145
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,192
It's not me.

146
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,362
Go after that jerk who embezzled
the company money and disappeared.

147
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,282
That will clear up your misunderstanding.

148
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,118
What was the name of that jerk?

149
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,995
It's Manager Yang Sanggu.

150
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,539
That's right, Manager Yang.

151
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,625
I heard he disappeared
after writing a will.

152
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,959
Then he must be dead somewhere.

153
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,669
Please be careful what you say.

154
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,087
Okay.

155
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,259
Mm, why did you kill Manager Yang?

156
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,469
-Mr. Cheon?
-What?

157
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,556
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

158
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,059
Why did you tell Manager Yang Sanggu...

159
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,644
to die?

160
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,858
Gosh.

161
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,028
You aren't a prosecutor.
You're a novelist.

162
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,363
That's some piece of fiction.

163
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,031
-Sir.
-Do you have proof?

164
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,995
Then have you met Manager Yang Sanggu?

165
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,705
You don't have to answer that.

166
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,084
Let's see, have I ever met…

167
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,711
Manager Yang?

168
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,762
I believe it's been quite a while
since I saw him.

169
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,806
I haven't seen him since he disappeared.

170
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,308
I see.
What about talking to him on the phone?

171
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:25,935
On the phone?

172
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,521
Yes. Before Manager Yang Sanggu died.

173
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,231
You talked to him last.

174
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,774
Oh, that.

175
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,819
He had called to say he was sorry.

176
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,154
He stole tens of billions
from the company.

177
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,907
I told him to turn himself in.

178
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,992
A person's life is
more important than money.

179
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,411
Isn't that right, Prosecutor?

180
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,747
I guess that's why you gave his wife…

181
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,376
five hundred million won.
Take a look at this.

182
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,928
I mean, one of my employees died.

183
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,888
I can't just pretend
I don't know about it.

184
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,017
Even though he embezzled
tens of billion won?

185
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,771
Embezzlement is embezzlement.
But I'm not a heartless person.

186
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,607
His family has to live on.

187
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,194
Maybe I gave too little.

188
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,118
What is Jihun thinking?

189
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,329
But…

190
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,248
was it a crime to talk to him
on the phone?

191
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,965
Talking to him on the phone
is not a crime, but…

192
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,809
it could be a crime to tell him

193
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,520
to either fall off the building
or hang himself.

194
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:01,447
Mr. Choi, I will tell him that I did it
and go to jail for however many years.

195
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,074
Mr. Choi, I will take all of the blame.

196
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,368
So, please…

197
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,872
-You'll take all of the blame?
-Yes.

198
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,627
Fine. Let's do that.

199
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:21,300
I will take good care of your family.

200
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,886
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Choi.

201
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,638
You don't have to be that grateful.

202
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,349
I'm the one who should be grateful.

203
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,977
You said you will take
all of the blame with you.

204
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,479
Yes, then…

205
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,898
You can fall off a building…

206
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,984
or hang yourself.

207
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,362
Do as you please.

208
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,160
See?

209
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,955
I do have evidence.

210
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,877
Mr. Cheon.

211
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,216
Let's take a short break.

212
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,025
What is he talking about?

213
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,280
I need to know so I can plan a response.

214
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,656
I told him to kill himself.

215
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,616
What?

216
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,245
I told Yang Sanggu to kill himself.
I thought that would cover it up.

217
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,915
-Why are you telling me this now?
-I thought you didn't believe me anyway.

218
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,002
He must've heard it somewhere.

219
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,461
He has no proof.

220
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,382
<i>Mr. Yang, you say this now,
but you may confess that I gave the order.</i>

221
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,385
<i>What would that do to my image?</i>

222
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,972
<i>You said you will take
all of the blame with you.</i>

223
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,515
<i>Yes, then…</i>

224
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,976
-<i>You can fall off a building...</i>
-What is this?

225
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,228
<i>...or hang yourself.</i>

226
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,272
<i>Do as you please.</i>

227
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,192
That bastard…

228
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,029
How did he get this?

229
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,699
Ms. Lee, what's going to happen to me?

230
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,368
Is it something like abetting suicide?

231
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,829
-No.
-It's not?

232
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,247
That makes sense.

233
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,000
It's stupid to kill yourself
just because someone tells you to, right?

234
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,960
If this recording is true,

235
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,424
it will be a crime of suicide by force
in Article 253 of the Criminal Law.

236
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,637
Suicide by force… What is it? Is it bad?

237
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,806
No, it's not that bad.

238
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,891
That's good.

239
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,895
The punishment will be
similar to that of murder.

240
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,065
Murder?

241
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,693
Are you kidding me?

242
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,863
<i>That doesn't make sense.
I didn't kill him.</i>

243
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,741
<i>Is there no other way?</i>

244
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,661
<i>Is there?</i>

245
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,496
<i>Ms. Lee!</i>

246
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,929
Mr. Yang Sanggu?

247
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,099
Mr. Yang Sanggu.

248
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,520
How did you…

249
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,943
Mr. Cheon, how did you find me?

250
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,951
Mr. Yang Sanggu, did you think
you could solve everything by doing this?

251
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,704
It wasn't that,

252
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,665
but if I go back alive, he will kill me.

253
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,375
Who will?

254
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,918
President Choi Kitae.

255
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,339
He is capable of doing that and more.

256
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,591
That's probably not true.

257
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,136
What?

258
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,223
He will actually be happy to see you,
more than anyone.

259
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,476
He will be happy to see me?

260
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,895
Yes. I can promise you that.

261
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,692
It's your decision, Mr. Yang.

262
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,238
You can die here like this,

263
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,783
or return and pay the price
with Choi Kitae.

264
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,621
The choice is solely yours.

265
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,014
I mean, you should've talked him
into coming back.

266
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,140
Why didn't you?

267
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,934
He's not a prosecutor.
He's a crazy bastard!

268
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,604
You told him to kill himself.

269
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,899
You should pray if you want
Mr. Yang Sanggu to come back.

270
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,318
What are you trying to do?

271
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,986
What happens if he doesn't come back?

272
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,947
Tell me!

273
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,910
Mr. Choi Kitae.

274
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,997
I arrest you for the charge
of suicide of Yang Sanggu by force.

275
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,292
You have the right to remain silent,
you have the right to a lawyer…

276
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,549
I guess you don't have to hire a lawyer
since you have one already.

277
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,552
-Take him away.
-Yes, sir.

278
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,557
Ms. Lee, do something.

279
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,434
I didn't kill him.

280
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,104
Whatever you say now
can work against you at trial.

281
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,498
Mr. Yang.

282
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,377
You were alive.

283
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,880
What took you so long?

284
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,509
I'm glad you came back. I'm really glad.

285
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,678
You saved me, Mr. Yang.

286
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,222
Does this mean
I'm not charged with murder?

287
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,185
I'm so glad you're back!

288
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,857
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

289
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,905
I'm glad you're here.

290
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,409
<i>If I go back alive,</i>

291
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,536
he will kill me.

292
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,121
That's probably not true.

293
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,914
What?

294
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,796
He will actually be happy to see you
more than anyone.

295
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,381
He will be happy to see me?

296
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,800
Yes, I can promise you that.

297
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,762
Mr. Yang Sanggu.

298
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,141
There are many ways to solve a problem.

299
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,477
When you are
in the most desperate situation,

300
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,106
is it the best choice

301
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,860
to just give up on everything
that you can't handle?

302
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,754
Yang Sanggu has returned.

303
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,343
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

304
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,429
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

305
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,561
-There he is.
-There he comes.

306
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,191
-Do you admit to everything?
-What are your thoughts?

307
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,610
Everyone wants to know.
Please say something.

308
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,154
-What do you think of the verdict?
-Do you have anything to say?

309
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,490
Can you give a statement?

310
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,992
-Do you admit to the charges?
-Do you agree?

311
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,536
Yes. I admit to all of the charges.

312
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,414
It's not like I killed a man.

313
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,708
-What does that mean?
-What do you mean?

314
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,544
-Mr. Choi Kitae!
-Can you comment on that?

315
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,880
-Mr. Choi Kitae!
-Any other comments?

316
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,856
Is this the place?

317
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,111
I told you I would buy you a drink.
I never said it would be expensive.

318
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,446
I don't want to violate
the Improper Solicitation Act.

319
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,117
I said I would wager a drink.
I didn't say I would drink with you.

320
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,452
Mm.

321
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,454
So you will be difficult.

322
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,542
Technically speaking, I didn't lose.

323
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,585
He changed his lawyer after that day.

324
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,339
Do you think
the outcome would've been different

325
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,092
if you had stayed on as his lawyer?

326
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,011
Hmm. I'm not sure.

327
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,472
No.

328
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,893
Ma'am, can we have draft beers
and a plate of dried pollack?

329
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,061
Sure.

330
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,774
What are you doing?
Shouldn't I at least choose the food?

331
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,527
Don't you like dried pollack?

332
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,823
It's not that I don't like dried pollack…

333
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,453
You've never had it,
just like coffee from a vending machine.

334
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,415
How can that be?

335
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,835
Is it because you're a picky eater?

336
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,629
I've had dried pollack before.

337
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,313
Have some dried pollack.

338
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,872
So, Mr. Cheon.

339
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,585
What were you going to do
if Mr. Yang Sanggu never came back?

340
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,171
Would you have left him to die?

341
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,259
Making a choice is hard for anyone.

342
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,640
No matter how hard it is,

343
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,726
-others can't make the choice for you.
-Aah.

344
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,686
Are you sure you're a prosecutor?

345
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,565
Yes, I'm sure.
Are you sure you're a lawyer?

346
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,026
Don't I look like a lawyer?

347
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,906
No, you don't.

348
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,166
You do know how to smile.

349
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,168
Didn't you just crack a smile?

350
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,630
Is there anyone who can't smile?

351
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,635
I was just surprised you did.

352
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,181
You eat dried pollack

353
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,810
by breaking off the head
and tearing open the belly like this.

354
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,040
And cheers.

355
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,168
Sure.

356
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,009
Aah.

357
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,189
How is it? Isn't it good?

358
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,176
Mr. Cheon.

359
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,512
I have to go this way.

360
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,056
Okay. Good night, then.

361
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,686
Don't you ever go on a date?

362
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,529
No, I don't. Why do you ask?

363
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,283
Because I think I will.

364
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,457
Okay. Hope it goes well, then.

365
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,587
Are you going to continue
the investigation?

366
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,966
I don't think Choi Kitae will talk.

367
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,637
I wouldn't have started the investigation
if I was going to stop at Choi Kitae.

368
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:01,977
I'm going to find out
where he siphoned that slush fund.

369
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,481

377
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,928
Mr. Cheon, we found the document.

378
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:37,971
Let me have that.

379
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,517
Over there. Can you scroll up a little?

380
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,532
CHOI KITAE JQ GROUP PRESIDENT

381
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,966
What is this?

382
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,260
Aren't we close enough
to buy each other coffee?

383
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,098
What?

384
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,225
Close enough?

385
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,399
I thought we got a little close.

386
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,486
Aah.

387
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,989
What are you doing this weekend?

388
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,991
What?

389
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,578
"What? I see. What?"

390
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,955
Is that all you know how to say?

391
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,334
No.

392
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,924
That was your second smile.

393
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,097
If I make you smile for the third time,

394
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,725
will you go out with me?

395
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,703
So, what happened to them?

396
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,166
Are you interested in Jihun?

397
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,420
Yejin, what are you saying?
That's ridiculous. That permed hair…

398
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,922
Right? That's a relief.

399
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,842
Why?

400
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,427
There's a reason.

401
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,596
Drink up.

402
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,730
What happened to the investigation
that Mr. Cheon was conducting?

403
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,442
Choi Kitae never talked until the end.

404
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,111
Jihun continued with the investigation.

405
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,452
You never saw the one
who laundered the money?

406
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,496
No.

407
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,708
There was a car waiting each time
I went to a place Mr. Choi told me.

408
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:19,150
<i>I never saw the face
of the person.</i>

409
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,737
Did you see the license plate?

410
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,615
It was a different car every time.

411
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,660
I'm really sorry for not being much help.

412
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,162
That's okay.

413
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,967
If there was someone in the car,

414
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,636
that person must've seen you.

415
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,598
Yes, probably.

416
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,857
Come in tomorrow, just for a while.

417
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,360
This has nothing to do with Mr. Kim.

418
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,445
If it did, we would've gotten
the warrant already.

419
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,030
You know how Mr. Cheon is.

420
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,116
The lunatic of Seocho-dong.

421
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,618
You don't want him on your back.

422
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,245
Make sure you come in. Don't be late.

423
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,918
Mr. Cheon, I called all the businesses
in the Myeong-dong and Gangnam region.

424
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,420
Okay. Good work.

427
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,847
Quiet down, everyone. Please be quiet.

428
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,766
-Noryangjin Blowfish, Park Doopal.
-Yes.

429
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,643
Wolmido Pork Soup, Bae Hyeokjin.

430
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,521
You can't block the hallway.
Please move aside.

431
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,774
-Why did you tell us to come?
-Be quiet, everyone.

432
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,694
We will begin soon. Please wait a moment.

433
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,362
Let's get this over with.

434
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,739
Is everyone here?

435
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,407
-Yes.
-Let's get started right away.

436
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,496
You said it will be over soon.
What are we doing here still?

437
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,128
What is this? This is all I have to do?

438
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,421
Isn't it easy?

439
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,841
Just look through from start to finish.

440
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,843
Did you call us here
to do this?

441
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,388
It will be quick.
You can go when you're done.

442
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,557
Just take a look.

443
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,238
Are you done gathering the papers?

444
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,449
-Yes.
-You didn't find anything weird?

445
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,618
I didn't find anything either.

446
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,828
We have nothing.

447
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,207
Maybe we missed it.

448
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,168
Let's wait a little more.

449
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,964
This is good. What is this called?

450
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,050
Name-brand burgers taste good.

451
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,303
-Anam-dong Honey Fist, Bang Minhyuk.
-Yes.

-Yes.

Apgujeong Fire Bear, Kang Hwawoong.

455
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,019
Let's go in.

456
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,605
Damn. I was eating, seriously.

457
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,902
What do you want from me?

458
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,113
Take your time to look through it.

459
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,497
Who are all these people?

460
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,666
I've never seen them before.

461
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,605
You can all leave now.

462
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,858
-What a waste of time.
-How annoying.

463
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,568
Get the leftover sandwiches back.

464
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,117
You will have to wait for a little bit.

465
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,620
You said I just needed to look at this.
I looked through it all.

466
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,789
I know. It will be just for a little bit.

467
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,333
Just a moment.

468
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,837
Look. Can a prosecutor do this?

469
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,966
I'm a busy man. What do you want?

470
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,260
You've been in a lot of trouble.

471
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,678
What?

472
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,017
I said you've been in a lot of trouble.

473
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,610
Do you know Manager Yang Sanggu?

474
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,196
Manager Yang Sanggu?

475
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,407
I've never seen him before.

476
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,495
-You've never seen him before?
-No.

477
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,373
You didn't pay for what you ate.

478
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,710
That was once or twice
when I went to collect money--

479
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,504
Yes, it was only once or twice,

480
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,924
but you were charged with fraud.

481
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:57,053
Did you want to become a civil servant?
Why did you pretend to be one so often?

482
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:02,058
-Let's see what else.
-I'm sorry. I was wrong.

483
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,812
Look, Prosecutor.
Even if it's you who's asking,

484
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,649
I can't tell you anything.
Trust is everything in this kind of work.

485
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,192
How am I to make a living?

486
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,069
No, I can't.

487
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,695
-You can't?
-No.

488
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,906
-You really can't?
-No, I can't.

489
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,416
CRIMINAL OFFENSE REPORT

490
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,132
CRIMINAL OFFENSE REPORT

491
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,385
Are you sure you can't?

492
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,474
If you cooperate, I was going to expunge
your criminal records one by one.

493
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,645
Seriously. What do you take me for?

494
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,482
He came over a few times.

495
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,651
Is that so? When was it?

496
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,613
<i>The last time I saw him
was a few months ago.</i>

497
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,865
Are you running late?

498
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,325
<i>He always wanted to meet in the middle.</i>

499
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,327
<i>But he called all of a sudden.</i>

500
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,999
<i>Something seemed to be wrong
and he asked me to bring it over quickly.</i>

501
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,878
<i>At a traditional Korean restaurant,</i>

502
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,672
<i>he was waiting for me when I arrived.</i>

503
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,344
<i>But he told me not to close the trunk.</i>

504
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,266
That's when I realized
there was something wrong.

505
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,478
<i>So I waited for a long time.</i>

506
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,023
We need to have insurance too.

507
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,400
What's the license plate number?

508
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,076
N 3866

509
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,703
It's N 3866.

510
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,496
It was black.

511
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,458
Are you sure?

512
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,252
A person in the money business
never messes up numbers.

513
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,004
What about the front digits?

514
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:58,591
I tried to see that, but I couldn't.

515
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,010
A car happened to drive by right then.

516
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,597
Investigator, N 3866.

517
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,599
Please, run a search.

518
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,392
Yes, got it.

519
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,102
Let's go.

520
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,201
During your time as the head
of Central Investigation Department,

521
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,621
the prime minister candidate received
enthusiastic public support.

522
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:34,418
As an ex-prosecutor, what do you think
is the most urgent issue in our society?

523
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,757
More than anything,
I think we have to have justice.

524
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,052
What is your definition of justice?

525
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,765
I once said this to my son.

526
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:53,729
A society where a criminal
pays the price of their wrongdoings,

527
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:58,317
a society without those who gain
by cheating and breaking the law,

528
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:03,364
a society where honest people
are not discouraged.

529
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,868
I believe that is
what a just society looks like.

530
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,956
How do you think the hearing went?
Please give us a comment.

531
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,791
Are you confident you will be approved?

532
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,418
What kind of outcome do you expect?

533
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,546
-What are your plans?
-What kind of questions were you asked?

534
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,757
-What do you think will happen?
-Are you expecting a satisfactory outcome?

535
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,510
-What are your plans?
-A comment, please.

536
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:29,140
I will be spending some quiet time
with my family for a while.

537
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,516
Thank you.

538
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,446
Do that dance you learned at school.

539
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,739
I hear you have a girlfriend.

540
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,116
-Tell him.
-Why don't you tell him?

541
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,869
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-I don't have a girlfriend.

542
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,496
-I saw it on your cell phone.
-No way.

543
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,415
Tell Grandpa.

544
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,168
Why are you looking at Mommy like that?

545
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,377
I don't have a girlfriend.

546
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,754
-Good night.
-Good night.

547
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,589
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

548
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,090
Call me when you get home.

549
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,600

551
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,565
When did you get here?

552
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,233
Why didn't you come in?

553
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,736
I'm sorry I was a bit late.

554
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,280
Happy birthday.

555
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,616
Yes, thank you.

556
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,452
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

557

558
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,133
Yes.

559
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:52,390
Father, I'm sorry,
but I have to get going.

560
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,477
Why all of a sudden?

561
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,398
I forgot about the public
prosecutor meeting tomorrow.

562
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,441
Then you should get going.

563
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,278
Go inside.
I will leave after I see you go in.

564
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,157
Okay. Stop by soon.

565
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,659
Yes, I will.

00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,134
You must be in a bad mood.

639
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,929
Then I'll just quietly sip my coffee
next to you then leave.

640
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,058
What if…

641
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:16,732
the worst-case scenario
turned out to be true?

642
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,277
What would you do, Ms. Lee?

643
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,575
The worst-case scenario?

644
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,496
Can you tell me a little more?

645
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,499
Hmm.

646
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,295
I might have to investigate
someone I respect the most.

647
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,841
Mm.

648
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,845
I guess you wish you could avoid it.

649
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,436
Don't worry in advance.

650
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,605
That situation might not come true.

651
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,484
What if it does?

652
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,905
If it does?

653
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,201
If it were me…

654
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,412
I'd go ahead with the investigation.

655
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:17,543
That would be courtesy
for the person I respect the most.

656
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,774
Yes, Jihun.

657
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,150
<i>You are coming right now?</i>

658
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,694
Yes, Father.

659
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,655
I… have something to tell you.

660
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,741
Okay. I will wait for you.

661
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,483
17 N 3866

662
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:27,946
Jihun.

663
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,491
Welcome.

664
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:33,994
What about dinner?

665
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,455
You must not have eaten.

666
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,540
Come on, let's go in.

667
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,208
Father.

668
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,127
Hmm?

669
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,554
There are other good things to eat.
Why did you want this?

670
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,185
When I was little…

671
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,314
Because you weren't home.

672
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,611
When I whined that I missed you,

673
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,696
Mom always bought me <i>jjajangmyeon.</i>

674
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,158
But I…

675
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,869
really hated it.

676
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:19,665
Having <i>jjajangmyeon</i> instead of seeing you…

677
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,710
It felt like exchanging
<i>jjajangmyeon</i> for you.

678
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:34,930
I wanted to know what <i>jjajangmyeon</i>
would taste like if I had it with you.

679
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,686
It's really good.

680
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,816
Yes.

681
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,193
Go ahead and eat.

682
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,330
Thanks for the meal, Father.

683
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,875
Jihun.

684
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,131
I'm sorry

685
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,968
I didn't give you
enough attention as a father.

686
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,347
Let's get together more often from now on.

687
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:24,521
So, which case are you working on
these days?

688
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,112
Oh, no. I shouldn't have asked that.

689
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,157
The essence of an investigation
is confidentiality.

690
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,289
I'm investigating the slush fund flow
of President Choi Kitae.

691
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,461
Ah...

692
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,087
I see.

693
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,383
I guess that investigation isn't over yet.

694
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,720
No.

695
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,474
Summoning will begin soon, Father.

696
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,189
17 N 3866

697
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,448
Yes, sir.

698
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,995
Mr. Cheon,
the district attorney wants to see you.

699
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,664
The district attorney?

700
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,500
Maybe he found out something.

701
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,002
I'm sure it's not important.
I will be back.

702
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,071
Jihun.

703
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,997
When…

704
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,042
I was a prosecutor,

705
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,004
I thought I could change the world

706
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,174
if I didn't falter.

707
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,387
Just like you.

708
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,475
But it wasn't easy.

709
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,103
Even if my record is a little tarnished,

710
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,480
I believe I needed to be on this path.

711
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,193
I'm almost there.

712
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,946
All I need is your help.

713
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:43,952
"A society where honest people
are not discouraged.

714
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,582
A society without those who gain
by cheating and breaking the law.

715
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,501
A society where a criminal…

716
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,256
pays the price of their wrongdoings."

717
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,346
You taught me
that is what a just society looks like.

718
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,350
Jihun.

719
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:12,063
I will become the prime minister
and make sure that happens.

720
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,983
No, you can't.

721
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,569
I will put things right.

722
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,290
What are you doing? Introduce yourself.

723
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,629
Nice to meet you.
I am Prosecutor Cheon Jihun.

724
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,297
I believe we've met before.

725
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,382
Have you met him already?

726
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:43,511
He summoned me for an investigation.

727
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,431
What are you…

728
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,434
Mr. Cheon, why don't you tell them?

729
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,941
Yes, I need to interview him
in relation to Choi Kitae's slush fund.

730
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,442
Are you out of your mind?

731
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:58,902
What are you saying?

732
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,111
It's fine.

733
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,781
I will heed the summon.

734
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,869
I shouldn't break the will
of a young prosecutor.

735
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,419
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

736
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,130
Will Jihun be okay alone?

737
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,675
That is what Jihun wants.

738
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,512
From what I saw, things were weird
between him and Candidate Kim Yoonsub.

739
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,222
Is there something going on?

740
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,015
I should stop by.

741
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,767
Minhyeok.

742
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,563
Leave him alone.
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

743
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,662
When was the first time
you met President Choi Kitae?

744
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,331
It was probably three years ago.

745
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,208
Where did you meet him?

746
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,045
It was at a congratulatory reception
for a book publication.

747
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,466
Did you receive a contribution from him
at that time?

748
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,219
I didn't have a chance
to check every detail.

749
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,848
So, I can't give you an answer.

750
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,482
Have you seen this man?

751
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:31,286
Mr. Kim, you have received cash
from President Choi Kitae…

752
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:36,291
on many occasions. Have you not?

753
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:38,793
I'm not sure.

754
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,380
I don't remember receiving any.

755
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,682
I think you can stop now.

756
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,768
I don't think
there's anything more to investigate.

757
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,938
We should ask the prosecutor.

758
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,238
He says none. Let's go.

759
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,574
No. We will take a short break
and carry on.

760
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,952
Hey, Cheon Jihun!

761
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:29,010
PROSECUTORS WITH
TRANSPARENCY, INTEGRITY, OPENNESS

762
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,531
What is this?

763
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,660
I thought this was
the only way to change your mind.

764
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,329
Please take a look.

765
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,389
Do you think this will work?

766
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,642
Yes. I guess we will find out.

767
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,318
What if he really took the money?

768
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,573
Cheon Jihun causes a lot of trouble,
but he's a good investigator.

769
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,201
He must be doing that
because there is something.

770
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,455
If what Jihun is saying is true,
we need to make the first move.

771
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,831
-What?
-What?

772
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,126
I just received a few calls
from some assemblymen.

773
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,128
Many of them are nervous.

774
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,171
What should we do?

775
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,840
We have to get them an escape route.

776
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,592
You mean…

777
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,845
We have to make it look like
Kim Yoonsub took the money alone.

778
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,171
<i>I thought this was
the only way to change your mind.</i>

779
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,311
Did you hear everything, Father?

780
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,899
When the investigations start,
those who took the money will slip away,

781
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,860
and you will be left alone.

782
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:57,784
Ultimately,
you will take all of the blame.

783
00:58:58,409 --> 00:58:59,619
Jihun.

784
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,247
I will help you.

785
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,418
You can correct it starting now.

786
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,536
How many members of the Assembly
did you give money to?

787
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:43,997
There's a lot.

788
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,669
I don't know if you can handle it.

789
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,176
You heard it before, Father.

790
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,345
I am quite good at investigating,

791
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,724
more than you think.

792
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,941
I need evidence
that you delivered them the money.

793
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,944
I'm sure you have the list.

794
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,117
I do.

795
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,830
I will give you the list later.

796
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,251
Fine.

797
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,181
Shall we stop for today, Father?

798
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,685
Can we do that?

799
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,021
Of course.

800
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:53,941

01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,283
Go back in.

802
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,410
I will take you home.

803
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,914
No. What will they say if they see us?

804
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,085
Yes, you're right.

805
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:13,586
Okay.

806
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,216
Father.

807
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,683
I wanted to be a prosecutor just like you.

<i>Mr. Cheon,
is Mr. Kim done with the investigation?</i>

811
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,385
Yes.

812
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,138
He went down a while ago.

813
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,056
Has he not come out?

814
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,852
<i>No. I'm waiting for him.
He's not even answering his phone.</i>

815
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,146
I understand. I'll head downstairs.

816
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,502
Mr. Cheon, I will check the front gate!

817
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,503
Okay.

818
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,133
<i>The person you are calling
cannot accept calls at this time.</i>

RESTRICTED CALLER ID

822
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,003
<i>Are you still in there?</i>

823
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,131
Assemblyman Kim Yoonsub.

824
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,134
Who is this?

825
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,430
Who are you?

826
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,910
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

827
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:40,913
<i>Is it true that Assemblyman
Kim was being investigated by prosecutors?</i>

828
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,373
<i>Who was the prosecutor in charge?</i>

829
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,333
They say he's the mad dog of Seocho-dong.

830
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,837
<i>Those who act self-righteous
always get themselves in trouble.</i>

831
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,672
That wasn't your fault.

832
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:51,090
<i>He was my father.</i>

833
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:53,968
<i>The number Assemblyman Kim spoke to
on the phone was from a burner phone.</i>

834
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:55,761
<i>I have to find the ones
who did this to Father.</i>

835
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:56,679
<i>Don't dig into it anymore.</i>

836
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,639
<i>Don't do anything at all
and pull out of it.</i>

837
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,725
<i>I found someone
I want to work with.</i>

838
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:01,892
I'm so glad you're here.

839
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,853
<i>You'll absolutely love it.</i>

840
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:05,980
You don't seem like the type
to run a coffee house.

841
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,398
<i>What are you going to do here?</i>

842
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,692
Is this the lawyer's office?

843
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:11,277
<i>It has already been two years.</i>

844
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,987
<i>Shouldn't you live your own life now?</i>

845
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,948
Why don't you resign tomorrow
and join our office?
