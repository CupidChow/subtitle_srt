you touched Ms. Go Yeongseon's hips

I am Mr. Nam Pilgu, that's true.

85
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,892
I don't know who Ms. Go Yeongseon is.

86
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:15,646
How can I remember her
among so many people on the train?

87
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:19,441
Unless she was as beautiful as you.

88
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:21,568
Oh, yeah.

89
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:26,657
Which line do you usually ride?

90
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:29,201
-She's the prosecutor--
-That's okay.

91
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,498
Listen up, Mr. Nam Pilgu.

92
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,461
I've never ridden the subway in my life.

No, I don't.

95
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:49,513
Other than here,
I have no reason to meet the likes of you.

96
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,767
Are you bragging you're rich?

97
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:55,978
It's better than a rap sheet
of sexual harassment.

98
00:06:57,896 --> 00:07:01,483
Mommy will be home early today, I promise.

99
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,946
This is the warrant
for illegal personal loans.

100
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,032
Mommy will be there soon.
Wait for a little.

Mr. Sa.

117
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:44,962
What are you doing? Let's get going.

118
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:47,089
I quit.

119
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,466
Look, it's a letter of resignation.

120
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:02,437
-You're here, sir.
-Hello.

121
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:06,900
Why are you so formal to him?
Because you're like that, Mr. Cheon--

122
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:08,193
Stop it.

123
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,738
Did you forget what he did for us?

124
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:14,366
Please take him along, Mr. Cheon.

125
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:16,827
I will. He's very special to me.

126
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,662
Let's go.

127
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:21,290
-Hurry up.
-You know, but--

128
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:23,542
I don't want to hear it.
Shut it and just go.

129
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,421
Fresh fruit is here.

130
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:29,840
Why pout if you're going to come?

131
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:32,050
Where are we going?

132
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:33,176
To get paid.

133
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,346
To get paid?
You should've told me that sooner.

134
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,682
Are you very happy that I'll get paid?

135
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,017
Of course, I am.

136
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,227
How can we run a business
with 1,000 won per case?

137
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:46,231
-Just 1,000 won. I like how simple it is.
-Hello.

138
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:48,442
Simple is useless.

139
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:49,526
Let me help you.

140
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,154
Do you charge 1,000 won
because your surname is Cheon?

141
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:55,324
-Are you making a rhyme or something?
-Sure.

142
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:58,285
-Hello, Mr. Cheon.
-Hello.

143
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:01,580
Be patient. Better days will come.

144
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:05,584
I wonder when that will be.
What will that be?

145
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:09,588
You are becoming
quite informal with me lately, aren't you?

146
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:12,174
You are formal and polite
when my wife is around.

147
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:13,925
Do you think I'm easy?

148
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,218
Yes, and...

149
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:18,430
you look young for your age.

150
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,060
Wait for me, Mr. Cheon.

151
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:26,647
"NO INTEREST FOR 30 DAYS LOANS RIGHT AWAY"

152
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,023
Are they here?

153
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:29,816
Is anyone here?

154
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,985
Is anyone--

155
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:34,446
What's going on? Where are they?

156
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:37,240
Do these people owe you money?

157
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:38,533
Something like that.

158
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,702
Can we barge
into other people's offices like this?

159
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:43,288
We're here to get paid. Just have a seat.

160
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,499
The door was unlocked.
They should be back soon.

161
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,000
-Okay.
-Make yourself comfortable.

162
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,341
But what should we do while we wait?

163
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,972
CHINESE DELIVERY DEOKHWAWON

164
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:13,360
-Is that the place?
-Yes.

165
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:37,509
Mmm.

166
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:42,723
Why do you like <i>jjajangmyeon</i> so much?

167
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:45,183
Because my dad wouldn't let me have it
when I was young.

168
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:48,603
Hey. You don't look like you grew up poor.

169
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,981
Why the sob story?

170
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:53,066
Don't pour the sauce.
Dip the meat in it instead.

171
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:56,278
Okay, we'll dip it in the sauce.

172
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:08,707
Hi. What can we do for you?

173
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:12,919
Are you the guys?

174
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:15,881
Prosecution... Oh, we are just...

175
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:18,759
We're here to get some late payments.

176
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:21,928
Not that kind of "get paid,"
but to purely receive money...

177
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:23,430
That sounds bad too.

178
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:25,307
This is not our office.

179
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:29,728
Geez. Could you talk
after you swallow the food?

180
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:35,776
Excuse me.

181
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:39,404
This tastes good.

182
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:49,581
Do you know what they call
people like you?

183
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:56,379
Do you know
what they call people like you?

184
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,721
A neighborhood bully.

185
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,895
Hey! Why did you dump my bowl?

186
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:13,814
I was going to mix some rice in the sauce!

187
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:15,816
I told you it's not our office!

188
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:18,026
This is not... I can't even talk.

189
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:19,486
It's not our office!

190
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,948
What? You should have told me then.

191
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,577
I'm from the prosecutor's office.

192
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:30,372
As you can see,
I'm here for search and seizure.

193
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:31,748
I see.

194
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,292
Go ahead and seize.

195
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:36,211
All right, then.

196
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:40,423
-Let's start from the inside.
-Okay.

197
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,760
Let's just go.

198
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:46,054
-We will stay.
-Why?

199
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:51,768
If these guys are arrested,
we won't get paid.

200
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:54,062
It's not because you couldn't finish
your <i>jjajangmyeon?</i>

201
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:55,814
Either way.

202
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:59,442
Wait. Time out!

203
00:14:01,236 --> 00:14:03,029
I am executing a warrant.

204
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:05,991
I know, but what's the hurry?

205
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:08,827
If you have a warrant,
you should take time to look around.

206
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,371
I'm sorry for flipping your bowl.

207
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,081
Let's end this without any hitches.

208
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:15,584
You said this wasn't your office anyway.

209
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:19,588
But we are in the same...
How do you say it?

210
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:22,132
-Line of work.
-We're in the same line of work.

211
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:23,884
We were watching their office.

212
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:29,931
Let's have a look-see.

213
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:32,767
A search and seizure warrant.

214
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:33,852
That's right.

215
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:37,856
The reason for verification. Location--

216
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:40,400
-You must have a lot of experience.
-Yes, quite a bit.

217
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:43,904
A rate higher than the statutory maximum
violates the Interest Restriction Act,

218
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:47,157
punishable by up to three years in jail
or a fine of 30 million won.

219
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:49,659
-Is that all?
-What?

220
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:52,579
If you get a good lawyer,
they could get probation.

221
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:55,665
I don't know how good their lawyer is,

222
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,501
but we'll see.

223
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,587
I don't think you need
that good of a lawyer.

224
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:06,593
Your attitude now will cost you
when you are being interviewed later.

225
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:10,555
I thought this wasn't your office!

226
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,976
It's fine.

227
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,064
Hey, let's not bother her.

228
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:20,023
Let's go.

229
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:28,657
TRUST OUR LOW-INTEREST RATE

230
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,250
Prosecator!

231
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:42,504
Gosh, Prosecator.

232
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:44,923
Why are you here again?

233
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:47,968
We are hardworking, honest citizens.

234
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:49,302
Long time no see, Fire Chicken.

235
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,429
Are you still
in the personal loan business?

236
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:54,307
It's not Fire Chicken but Fire Bear.

237
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:58,853
And the personal loan
is such an outdated term.

238
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,022
-Repeat after me, Prosecator.
-Mm.

239
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:03,441
Loan broker.

240
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:04,859
You repeat after me.

241
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:07,195
-Prosecutor, not "prosecator."
-Prosecator.

242
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:08,279
-Say, "rice."
-Lice.

243
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:09,322
Forget it.

244
00:16:10,156 --> 00:16:11,116
What is this?

245
00:16:13,702 --> 00:16:15,537
Hey. Is business good these days?

246
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,456
It's not good at all.
We barely make a living.

247
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,542
Making a living, huh?

248
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,127
Let's help each other to make a living.

249
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:25,964
That lady over there.

250
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:28,299
The lady who's glaring at us.
She's the prosecutor.

251
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:31,177
I quit prosecution. Did you know that?

252
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:32,220
What?

253
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:35,348
But that prosecutor brought a warrant.

254
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:36,891
A search and seizure warrant.

255
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:42,689
Wait. Stop!

256
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:45,066
I tried that. It doesn't work.

257
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,318
You're not a prosecutor anymore.

258
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:52,115
Why are you doing this?
I didn't do anything wrong.

259
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:54,743
You'll be summoned soon.
Make sure you attend.

260
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:55,660
What?

261
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:59,456
Hey, Fire... Come over here, Fire.

262
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,207
Come here.

263
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,127
I know how to send them away.

264
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:06,004
-Really?
-Sure.

265
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,798
You need to hire a lawyer first.

266
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:11,509
Lawyer? Where am I going to find a lawyer?

267
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:13,303
Hello. I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.

268
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:17,807
So you're a lawyer, not a prosecator?

269
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:21,478
The problem is
that my legal fees are very expensive.

270
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:22,979
How much is it?

271
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:26,149
Are you crazy?

272
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:31,196
No? If you go to jail,
you won't see daylight for three years.

273
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:34,866
Can you give me a 20% discount?

274
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,329
Mr. Sa, I guess he's going to rot
in jail for three years.

275
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:40,288
Let's go.

276
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:42,457
Gosh, you have no idea how good he is.

277
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,543
Mr. Cheon! How about 10%?

278
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:52,300
Prosecutor, may I see the warrant again?

279
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,511
Why?

280
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:56,221
I want to see if it's missing anything.

281
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:03,561
Let's see. What's missing?

282
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:06,606
What could be...

283
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,860
missing on this warrant?

284
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:12,654
It's not missing anything.

285
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:15,782
Please give it back. I don't have all day.

286
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:18,034
I understand. Hang on.

287
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,539
Five, four, three, two.

288
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:26,668
Prosecutor. This won't do.

289
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:28,169
What do you mean?

290
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:32,048
Are you interfering
with the execution of this warrant?

291
00:18:32,132 --> 00:18:35,176
I'm not interfering.
I would like to help you do it right.

292
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:37,470
A prosecutor must follow the law.

293
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:38,930
Are you saying I didn't?

294
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:41,224
You came late.

295
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:45,645
It was to be executed during daytime.

296
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:46,855
Look here, darling.

297
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:50,108
It says, "Night execution not applicable."

298
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:55,155
Today's time for sunset
in the Seoul region is 19:00.

299
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:56,781
And right now,

300
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,952
it's 19:01.

301
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:04,539
What a shame.
You should have come a minute sooner.

302
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:05,999
The traffic in Seoul is so bad.

303
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:10,587
It is. Your way back to the office
will be terribly congested.

304
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,799
What you're doing is
technically an obstruction of justice.

305
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:17,051
I won't obstruct justice next time.

306
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,304
Make sure you bring the right warrant.

307
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,354
The traffic is pretty bad now, Prosecutor.

308
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:31,608
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

309
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:32,692
Yes.

310
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:34,152
Thank you.

311
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,047
Come on.

312
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,718
Do you see any errors?

313
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:01,596
But...

314
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,515
But what? What is it?

315
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:09,896
But it's a bit much that 30 million won
became 100 million won.

316
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:13,066
I can't hear what you're saying.
Say it clearly so I can hear.

317
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:16,319
Hey. You were late with payments.

318
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:18,238
Do you know how much that cost me?

319
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:21,407
This is peanuts
compared to that, you know.

320
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,827
You are starting to piss me off.

321
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:27,747
Hey, Fire Chicken. Run the number again.

322
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,916
Are you kidding me now? Are you?

323
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:35,088
Listen. The numbers won't change
even if we run it a thousand times.

324
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:36,047
Really?

325
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,592
Let me change the numbers in one try.

326
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:41,970
Give me your calculator.

327
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:46,849
You can try it a thousand times,
but it won't change the numbers.

328
00:20:54,357 --> 00:20:55,858
This is exactly right.

329
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:59,862
You are very precise,
Attorney Cheon Jihun.

330
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:03,157
But what is the 30,000 won at the end?

331
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:04,993
-It's the price for <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.
-Huh?

332
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:07,370
Let me explain it to you again
so you can understand.

333
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:08,538
Listen carefully.

334
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,832
The retainer was 5 million won.

335
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:15,753
Plus, the search and seizure
response and defense were 50 million won.

336
00:21:15,837 --> 00:21:18,381
Plus, an interview with the prosecutor
was another 40 million won.

337
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:22,844
Plus, countermeasures and consultation
was 5 million won.

338
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,763
Lastly, the food expense was 30,000.

339
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:26,681
So the total...

340
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:30,393
comes out to 100,030,000 won.

341
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:37,275
Gosh. Let's be serious now.

342
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:39,193
That was a small favor.

343
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:40,611
Small favor?

344
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:43,656
It was no small feat to turn
30 million into 100 million.

345
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:45,867
You are crossing the line here.

346
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,286
You're scaring me.

347
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:52,123
Mr. Sa, do you still have
the business card of that prosecutor?

348
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:54,709
Her business card? Of course, I have it.

349
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:58,421
Fire Bear, you and I go way back.

350
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:01,632
Shall we go down memory lane
in front of that prosecutor?

351
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,477
Do you have an envelope?

352
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,812
-I don't have envelopes.
-Here you go.

353
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:17,690
-Thank you.
-Are you crazy, bastard?

354
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:20,693
-Mr. Kim Eoksu.
-Yes?

355
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,738
This is your money.
You should check the amount.

356
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:25,239
Yes.

357
00:22:39,212 --> 00:22:41,339
Is the amount correct?

358
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:43,591
Yes.

359
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:45,468
Let's go, then.

360
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:51,182
No, no. Our transaction is finished.

361
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:52,642
-Overtime.
-Overtime.

362
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:54,727
-Overtime?
-Yes, overtime.

363
00:22:57,522 --> 00:22:58,856
How can I repay you?

364
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:01,943
This is not much,

365
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:05,446
but accept it
as a token of my appreciation.

366
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,701
Please keep it.
The 1,000 won you gave me is enough.

367
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,370
But still...

368
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:16,541
Don't get roped in with those guys again.

369
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:17,792
Have a good life.

370
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,168
And...

371
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:21,462
call me if you need help.

372
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:23,005
Yeah.

373
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:30,388
Don't end up again at the Han River. Okay?

374
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:33,182
Mr. Cheon, but...

375
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:36,436
This will help you get a new start.

376
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,229
I shouldn't take this.

377
00:23:38,312 --> 00:23:41,315
You shouldn't do this.

378
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:45,278
I don't know
what you're talking about, buddy.

379
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,573
It's okay.

380
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:57,373
Mr. Cheon.

381
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:14,390
Thank you so much, sir!

382
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:17,018
I am really going to live a good life!

383
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:29,405
We could have had one more drink,
but he just took off.

384
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:31,157
Stupid jerks.

385
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:35,244
Oh, my! Are you okay?

386
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:38,873
What are you doing?

387
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:40,500
Bastard. How dare you?

388
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,418
There's a pickpocket here!

389
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:44,504
-I didn't do anything.
-The hell you didn't.

390
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:45,838
There's a pickpocket here!

391
00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:47,715
There's a pickpocket here!

392
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:49,217
I really didn't do anything.

393
00:24:49,842 --> 00:24:52,428
-I didn't do it!
-It's a pickpocket!

394
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:54,138
Good morning.

395
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:57,225
-Let's get a drink sometime.
-Yes, we should.

396
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:58,392
-Hello.
-Hi.

397
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:00,269
-Good morning.
-Morning.

398
00:25:00,353 --> 00:25:02,980
Stop joking around
and play the card.

399
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:04,774
-Geez.
-That's a good one.

400
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:06,984
-I'll take that.
-Oh, no.

401
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:08,903
Great.

402
00:25:09,737 --> 00:25:10,947
-Hey!
-You scared me.

403
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,198
Sa Mujang!

404
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:24,835
Pay the rent.

405
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:27,588
Yes.

406
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:30,967
We will pay.

407
00:25:33,636 --> 00:25:34,720
Look at him.

408
00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:36,889
My goodness.

409
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:45,398
Excuse me.

410
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:48,901
What brings you here?

411
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:50,403
Hello.

412
00:25:50,903 --> 00:25:54,407
Are you the attorney?

413
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:57,785
Ah. So, you're here looking for a lawyer?

414
00:25:59,412 --> 00:26:01,747
I'm the office manager here.

415
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:04,000
Please come in.

416
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:20,850
Hello.

417
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:23,311
Have you seen Attorney Cheon?

418
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:24,729
-He went that way.
-That way.

419
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:26,188
Okay. Thank you.

420
00:26:28,816 --> 00:26:30,026
Mr. Cheon!

421
00:26:32,236 --> 00:26:33,904
What is it, Mr. Sa?

422
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:35,573
You're here again?

423
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,491
Come down. We have somewhere to go.

424
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:38,951
Where are we going?

425
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:41,203
Just come down.

426
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:42,830
Let's go.

427
00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:46,042
What kind of client
is waiting for me today?

428
00:26:51,714 --> 00:26:54,383
<i>I was thirsty
In the middle of the night</i>

429
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:57,511
<i>So I opened the refrigerator door...</i>

430
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,432
LEE MYEONGHO, CHARGE OF BURGLARY

431
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:04,644
<i>...was pickled in salt</i>

432
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:10,983
It's okay. You can listen to it.

433
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,318
No.

434
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:14,820
How is it?

435
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:17,073
You said no more pro bono cases.

436
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:19,283
That's true, but...

437
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:23,079
Four-time conviction of pickpocketing?

438
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:25,706
But he said it wasn't him this time.

439
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:27,249
He swears he didn't.

440
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:30,419
You're naive.

441
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:32,713
Nothing's to be sure. Let's meet him then.

442
00:27:34,674 --> 00:27:38,177
HIS 6-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
HAS A HEART CONDITION.

443
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:55,277
Somi, where's your dad?

444
00:27:57,446 --> 00:28:01,325
My daddy is a captain, so he went fishing.

445
00:28:01,992 --> 00:28:04,662
He's on a boat this big.

446
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:08,958
I like to fish a lot too.

447
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:14,422
You slice open the belly of a halibut,

448
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:17,091
and scrape out the intestines,
dip it in <i>chogochujang,</i>

449
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:18,384
and one for you, one for me--

450
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:22,263
What are you saying in front of a kid?

451
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:26,058
Mister. When is my daddy coming back?

452
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:28,185
Did he tell you?

453
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:33,733
-Right, it's--
-Somi.

454
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:35,901
If you take your medicine,
eat well, and get healthy,

455
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:37,361
he promises he will come soon.

456
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:41,490
That's a lie. You're pulling my leg.

457
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:43,075
I'm not pulling your leg.

458
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:47,705
Can you promise me then?

459
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:57,173
Somi.

460
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,467
Mommy.

461
00:29:08,642 --> 00:29:11,020
I work at a nearby diner
that sells night snacks.

462
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:14,148
I can work while Somi sleeps.

463
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:15,816
It must be hard for you.

464
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:18,110
I hope your husband returns soon.

465
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:20,863
He said he was done.

466
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:24,950
He said he was done for good.

467
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,538
I'll work on a fishing boat.
Take care of Somi until I come back.

468
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:31,957
Are you really working on a boat?

469
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:45,846
He smashed his hand with a rock
to show that he quit pickpocketing.

470
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,097
I'm sure he didn't do it.

471
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:50,226
So, he did.

472
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,938
He wanted Somi to be proud of him.

473
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:56,315
So, he did.

474
00:29:58,317 --> 00:30:01,237
Had he gotten on the boat sooner,
this wouldn't have happened.

475
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:04,073
No one believes him.

476
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:07,785
Every lawyer I went to see
wants a retainer up front.

477
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:10,788
They say he won't be acquitted
so he should ask for leniency.

478
00:30:12,164 --> 00:30:15,709
Mr. Cheon. My husband is falsely accused.

479
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:20,256
I'm sorry, I have to take this call.

480
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:21,549
Go ahead.

481
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:23,509
Hello?

482
00:30:24,385 --> 00:30:26,136
Yes, I will.

483
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:28,931
Ma'am.

484
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,559
I will meet your husband.

485
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:37,106
Thank you so much.

486
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:40,317
That was cool.

487
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:43,821
Their story is so sad.

488
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,241
Then don't complain
that I only charge 1,000 won.

489
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:48,659
Okay.

490
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:51,370
Can I ask
for an exemption this once?

491
00:30:51,662 --> 00:30:53,455
It's not possible any longer.

492
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:56,584
It's the hospital policy.
I'm afraid I can't help you.

493
00:30:57,585 --> 00:31:00,087
I will come up with the money.

494
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,882
She has to leave by the end of this month.

495
00:31:03,465 --> 00:31:05,384
We're very sorry about this.

496
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:07,219
I'm sorry.

497
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:11,640
How much is the bill?

498
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:28,365
How much is it? I'll pay the bills.

499
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:29,491
Well...

500
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:33,454
The total is 13,008,128 won.

501
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:39,460
-Thirteen thousand?
-Yes.

502
00:31:40,044 --> 00:31:44,006
Copay is 12,258,593 won

503
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:47,593
and 749,535 won for elective care.

504
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:50,054
Would you like to pay in full?

505
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:04,234
Don't worry.
I'll take care of Somi's medical bills.

506
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:08,739
Thank you.

507
00:32:11,784 --> 00:32:13,369
Thank you...

508
00:32:18,707 --> 00:32:21,877
I was out of my mind.

509
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:23,837
Why did I say that?

510
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:26,590
Why didn't you stop me?

511
00:32:27,174 --> 00:32:28,300
"How much is it?"

512
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:31,428
"I'll take care of Somi's medical bills."

513
00:32:32,596 --> 00:32:36,100
You were acting the hero.
Why are you asking for my help?

514
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:37,935
I'm such an idiot.

515
00:32:38,811 --> 00:32:39,770
Mr. Cheon!

516
00:32:39,853 --> 00:32:41,647
You are partially responsible.

517
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:44,274
-Why?
-I wasn't like this at first.

518
00:32:44,358 --> 00:32:45,776
I got it from you.

519
00:32:47,653 --> 00:32:50,030
Can't you do something?

520
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:52,324
Help me out.

521
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:55,995
I think the prosecutor in charge
of Lee Myeongho's case can help us.

522
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,538
The prosecutor?

523
00:32:59,581 --> 00:33:02,292
You'll stand trial soon.
Are you still claiming innocent?

524
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:06,547
<i>I really am innocent.
I was only helping him up.</i>

525
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:10,843
Even an ex-con can help a person.

526
00:33:14,555 --> 00:33:15,639
Mr. Lee Myeongho.

527
00:33:16,682 --> 00:33:20,269
You need to show remorse to get leniency.

528
00:33:20,352 --> 00:33:23,105
You have four identical convictions

529
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:25,566
and this is another offense
within two months of release.

530
00:33:25,774 --> 00:33:29,528
You will likely get a heavy penalty
as a repeat offense.

531
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,656
Think of your family.

532
00:33:33,574 --> 00:33:35,075
It says you have a daughter and a wife.

533
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:38,954
So, let's start from the top.

534
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:40,372
In your eyes,

535
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:44,126
I look like a pickpocket.

536
00:33:45,502 --> 00:33:46,545
No.

537
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:49,631
You look like that in everybody's eyes.

538
00:33:51,508 --> 00:33:52,885
Besides, it is possible

539
00:33:53,427 --> 00:33:55,596
you don't remember

540
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,766
that your hands moved before you knew it.

541
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,698
-Is it good?
-Yes. I'm so happy you're here.

542
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:19,745
Get better, so you can go
to elementary school next year.

543
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,706
You forgot my age.

544
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,084
That's okay.

545
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:29,588
Then be here for my birthday this year.

546
00:34:56,907 --> 00:34:58,992
<i>I couldn't get a job
after being released from jail.</i>

547
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:02,746
Inevitably, I committed a crime
to pay for my daughter's hospital bill.

548
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:06,542
Baek Mari.

549
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,043
You're a legitimate prosecutor.

550
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:11,880
I submitted his letter of apology,

551
00:35:12,047 --> 00:35:13,549
so can I ask for the minimum sentence?

552
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:16,218
By the way, he's not eligible for pardon
under the Criminal Act

553
00:35:16,301 --> 00:35:18,011
because of his habitual theft.

554
00:35:19,138 --> 00:35:21,974
Oh, no. I told him we would be lenient.

555
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:23,183
Submit a petition for appeal.

556
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:26,436
Weight of offense is tricky like judging
guilty or innocent, so be thorough.

557
00:35:27,563 --> 00:35:29,690
-Yes.
-What about the illegal loan case?

558
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:32,568
All of the victims dropped the charges.

559
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:34,319
Is that right? That was quick.

560
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:38,115
Ms. Baek, you have a package.

561
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:45,497
What? This book...

562
00:35:45,581 --> 00:35:47,082
LEGAL PROFESSIONALS' ETHICS AND CONSCIENCE

563
00:35:50,043 --> 00:35:52,880
<i>I'm looking forward
to your first win. From Seo Minhyeok.</i>

564
00:35:54,923 --> 00:35:57,718
PEACE, REHABILITATION

565
00:35:57,801 --> 00:35:58,927
CHEON JIHUN LAW OFFICE

566
00:36:02,055 --> 00:36:03,432
So, you want to help me?

567
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:06,518
I haven't decided yet.

568
00:36:06,602 --> 00:36:08,604
ATTORNEY CHEON JIHUN

569
00:36:09,229 --> 00:36:10,856
You don't believe me either.

570
00:36:11,523 --> 00:36:14,484
Who would believe
a four-time convicted pickpocket?

571
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:20,240
What's wrong with your hand?

572
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:24,536
If you used the right hand,
you wouldn't have been caught.

573
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,789
I really didn't do it.

574
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:31,710
Mr. Lee Myeongho.
That is only your assertion.

575
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:34,379
No one knows the truth.

576
00:36:34,463 --> 00:36:35,881
What do I have to do then?

577
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:38,592
People told me

578
00:36:39,218 --> 00:36:41,053
it would be a misunderstanding
for other people,

579
00:36:41,136 --> 00:36:42,763
but not for me so I'm guilty.

580
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,307
Right. That's not completely wrong.

581
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:47,726
Why are you here?

582
00:36:48,143 --> 00:36:50,812
Mm...

583
00:36:53,398 --> 00:36:54,858
I met Somi.

584
00:37:01,698 --> 00:37:04,159
Is she okay?

585
00:37:05,577 --> 00:37:07,120
Yes, she will be.

586
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:11,208
Mr. Cheon,

587
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:14,586
what do I have to do?

588
00:37:16,546 --> 00:37:19,883
The prosecutor tells me to write
a letter of apology and ask for leniency.

589
00:37:21,593 --> 00:37:25,180
In fact, there's nothing else I can do.

590
00:37:28,976 --> 00:37:31,853
Please help me.

591
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:38,110
<i>Can you promise me then?</i>

592
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:44,741
You promised.

593
00:38:00,632 --> 00:38:03,719
Mr. Lee Myeongho,
you say you didn't do it.

594
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:07,597
Can you swear on your daughter?

595
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:14,187
Yes. I swear on my daughter.

596
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:18,900
Very well. I will help you.

597
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:21,945
Somi misses her dad a lot.

598
00:38:27,993 --> 00:38:29,536
Be a good dad to her.

00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:20,295
So, this is where we start?

603
00:39:27,552 --> 00:39:28,678
Do you think it was recorded?

604
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:37,479
Say something.

605
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,711
Mr. Cheon. What are you doing?

606
00:40:02,462 --> 00:40:05,215
That's what I mean. Damn you.

607
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:08,218
Bastard. What did I tell you?

608
00:40:09,177 --> 00:40:11,054
What did I tell you?

609
00:40:15,517 --> 00:40:16,726
Hang on. Wait.

610
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:20,480
Oh, gosh.

611
00:40:20,564 --> 00:40:21,731
Are you okay?

612
00:40:22,524 --> 00:40:23,775
Yes. Thank you.

613
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:26,987
-You almost got hurt.
-Yes.

614
00:40:32,826 --> 00:40:33,994
What?

615
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:36,997
Geez. What's with that beard?

616
00:40:38,123 --> 00:40:41,042
So, I almost fell down
because I was drunk.

617
00:40:41,126 --> 00:40:43,753
This punk pretended to help me
then put his hand in my pocket.

618
00:40:43,837 --> 00:40:45,547
So, I caught him red-handed!

619
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,549
I was in line to use the restroom.

620
00:40:47,632 --> 00:40:50,427
He almost fell so I caught him.

621
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,720
It's true.

622
00:40:53,305 --> 00:40:55,557
I can't believe this.

623
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,726
Unbelievable. Hey.

624
00:40:58,643 --> 00:41:02,522
How dare you tell a lie?

625
00:41:03,106 --> 00:41:04,941
Hey. Take off your sunglasses.

626
00:41:05,525 --> 00:41:06,943
Take them off, bastard!

627
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:09,154
I can take them off,

628
00:41:09,237 --> 00:41:12,699
but I'm not a bastard, so why do you
keep calling me bastard, you bastard?

629
00:41:12,782 --> 00:41:13,909
What?

630
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:16,745
-You little--
-Be quiet. Remember where you are.

631
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:18,455
Name?

632
00:41:18,538 --> 00:41:21,208
Name? I can tell you my name...

633
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:24,669
-Name--
-I said I didn't do it!

634
00:41:24,753 --> 00:41:26,254
Why are you harassing me?

635
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:28,340
-Seriously. What are you doing?
-I didn't do it!

636
00:41:28,423 --> 00:41:30,634
-Sit down. Sit!
-It wasn't me.

637
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:32,802
The chair is over there.
How can I sit down?

638
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:34,304
-I didn't do it.
-What are you doing?

639
00:41:34,387 --> 00:41:36,515
-He's a total lunatic.
-Have a seat.

640
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:42,312
Hello, we are from the law office
of Attorney Cheon Jihun.

641
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,148
The law office of Attorney Cheon Jihun.

642
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:48,610
Yes, hello.

643
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:50,529
I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.

644
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,156
Hello.

645
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,282
Hi.

646
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,494
-I really didn't do it, bastard.
-Okay.

647
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,541
That was too easy.

648
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:05,252
Geez. Are you satisfied now?

649
00:42:05,335 --> 00:42:07,087
Excuse me, Mr. Cheon?

650
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:10,715
This is my card. Give me a call.

651
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:12,926
-Yes.
-Take care.

652
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,012
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, A SAFE COUNTRY

653
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:22,394
A lawyer gets off the hook
and a four-time convict gets arrested.

654
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:23,562
It's so unfair.

655
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:25,272
Anyone would think that.

656
00:42:26,106 --> 00:42:27,107
For anyone?

657
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,609
You could ask anyone off the street.

658
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:31,152
Mm.

659
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:35,282
Right. Let's ask anyone off the street.

660
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:37,993
That's a great idea.

661
00:42:50,797 --> 00:42:52,257
Ms. Baek, you're back.

662
00:42:52,632 --> 00:42:54,509
What do you mean, a jury trial?

663
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:57,012
The defendant confessed
and wrote a letter of apology.

664
00:42:57,095 --> 00:43:00,557
What kind of a lunatic lawyer
asks for a jury trial?

665
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:04,019
There are so many weird lawyers.

666
00:43:04,102 --> 00:43:06,438
Isn't there a certain level
of professional standard?

667
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:08,356
Who is the lawyer?

668
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:27,792
Yes, I am that lunatic lawyer.

669
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:39,095
What?

670
00:43:40,597 --> 00:43:43,516
Gosh. Aren't you that prosecutor?

671
00:43:49,773 --> 00:43:51,024
Was that Jihun?

672
00:43:51,983 --> 00:43:53,318
Aah.

673
00:43:54,152 --> 00:43:55,987
This is Attorney Cheon Jihun.

674
00:43:56,071 --> 00:43:58,281
He was a coworker until a few years ago.

675
00:43:58,823 --> 00:44:01,534
And this is Ms. Baek Mari. Say hi.

676
00:44:01,618 --> 00:44:03,161
Nice to see you again.

677
00:44:05,497 --> 00:44:06,790
Hello, I'm Baek Mari.

678
00:44:07,749 --> 00:44:10,835
You are still
a probationary judicial officer.

679
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:13,088
She's very tenacious
for a probationary judicial officer.

680
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:17,258
She's in the last class
of the training institute.

681
00:44:17,342 --> 00:44:19,010
She's the ace of the class.

682
00:44:20,553 --> 00:44:22,138
What is your intention

683
00:44:22,305 --> 00:44:24,766
to turn this case into a jury trial?

684
00:44:25,517 --> 00:44:26,976
Are you going to plead innocent?

685
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:28,770
Yes.

686
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:33,608
Look.

687
00:44:36,528 --> 00:44:39,280
The defendant confessed to the crime
and asked for leniency.

688
00:44:40,782 --> 00:44:42,367
Why is a lawyer changing his plea?

689
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:45,745
LETTER OF APOLOGY MY NAME IS LEE MYEONGHO

690
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:47,622
I COMMITTED A CRIME
WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF MY RELEASE

691
00:44:54,629 --> 00:44:56,464
-This is crazy.
-Jihun.

692
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:59,092
You shouldn't do that.

693
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:05,056
My client asked me to tear it up.

694
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:07,934
Here... I'll take it.

695
00:45:11,187 --> 00:45:12,188
I don't understand.

696
00:45:12,272 --> 00:45:14,357
Are you really doing this for your client?

697
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:17,736
If the defendant denies his confession,

698
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:20,613
it may be harder to prove your case.

699
00:45:20,697 --> 00:45:23,491
I know, but I'll take care of it.

700
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:26,369
Of course, you will, Attorney Cheon Jihun.

701
00:45:26,953 --> 00:45:30,373
He won't get leniency if he rescinds
and insists on his innocence.

702
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:32,751
Leniency?

703
00:45:33,543 --> 00:45:36,421
Did you ever think
the defendant may be innocent?

704
00:45:36,504 --> 00:45:38,465
If he was innocent,
I wouldn't have charged him.

705
00:45:38,548 --> 00:45:41,009
It's not that you want a guilty verdict
because you charged him?

706
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:43,928
No lawyer can change the truth.

707
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:46,848
What if the truth you believe is wrong?

708
00:45:55,523 --> 00:45:57,025
Do the fighting at court.

709
00:45:57,525 --> 00:46:00,195
I'm looking forward to the trial.

710
00:46:00,278 --> 00:46:02,947
Yes, Yejin. I'm looking forward to it too.

711
00:46:03,114 --> 00:46:05,533
What about you,
young probationary judicial officer?

712
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,086
I will be there as a prosecutor,
not a probationary judicial officer.

713
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,216
Please address me as the prosecutor
from now on, Attorney Cheon Jihun.

714
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:25,678
Very well, Prosecutor Baek Mari.
I will do that.

715
00:46:25,762 --> 00:46:27,514
Then we will see you at...

716
00:46:27,597 --> 00:46:30,600
Oh, my, you're reading a book.

717
00:46:30,683 --> 00:46:32,060
This is very thick.

718
00:46:32,143 --> 00:46:34,103
Would you like to borrow it?
You may need it.

719
00:46:34,771 --> 00:46:36,022
Me?

720
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:38,525
I think you need it more than I do.

721
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:43,071
Page 108.

722
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:46,699
-I'm off, Yejin.
-Bye.

723
00:46:58,378 --> 00:47:01,130
"A defendant has two advocates.
The prosecutor before the indictment

724
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,467
and the attorney after the indictment."

725
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:11,516
Did you know this too?

726
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,686
Yes. But it's easier said than done.

727
00:47:16,688 --> 00:47:19,274
Attorney Cheon couldn't do that
as a prosecutor either.

728
00:47:32,745 --> 00:47:34,247
<i>Was he really a prosecutor?</i>

729
00:47:34,664 --> 00:47:35,582
<i>Yes.</i>

730
00:47:38,585 --> 00:47:40,587
He was famous
for being a good investigator.

731
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,839
He was even more famous for being a rebel.

732
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:47,468
He never backed down,
no matter who he was against.

733
00:47:49,387 --> 00:47:51,139
Why did he leave the prosecution?

734
00:47:56,185 --> 00:47:58,021
How was your last trial in America?
Did you win?

735
00:47:58,104 --> 00:47:59,689
<i>Yes, we won.</i>

736
00:47:59,772 --> 00:48:01,482
What about the sentence?

737
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:03,985
<i>Just as we asked for, 150 years.</i>

738
00:48:04,694 --> 00:48:07,530
That would be impossible here.

739
00:48:07,614 --> 00:48:09,449
It's the sum of the sentences.

740
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:12,619
There's symbolic significance too.

741
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:15,204
By the way, thanks for the book.

742
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:17,123
I couldn't get it
because it was out of print.

743
00:48:17,206 --> 00:48:18,249
<i>It was nothing.</i>

744
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,085
Are you confident about the first trial?

745
00:48:21,169 --> 00:48:23,546
There's a crazy lawyer.

746
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,425
The defendant confessed to the crime
and submitted a letter of apology.

747
00:48:28,384 --> 00:48:29,802
The lawyer asked for a jury trial.

748
00:48:30,261 --> 00:48:32,138
Are you talking
about the attempted theft case?

749
00:48:32,347 --> 00:48:33,264
<i>Yes.</i>

750
00:48:33,598 --> 00:48:36,976
In America, sometimes a lawyer
can sway the jury.

751
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,896
But the defendants are
generally perceived as guilty in Korea.

752
00:48:39,979 --> 00:48:41,773
<i>Isn't he a four-time convict?</i>

753
00:48:41,856 --> 00:48:43,066
<i>It would be hard to flip.</i>

754
00:48:43,149 --> 00:48:43,983
Right?

755
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:44,901
<i>Yes.</i>

756
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:47,487
There's always that one lawyer.

757
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:49,030
They're not even competent,

758
00:48:49,113 --> 00:48:51,532
and they persuade the client
to complicate things even more.

759
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:54,744
Exactly. I think he's going to do that.

760
00:48:54,827 --> 00:48:56,037
<i>Who is the lawyer?</i>

761
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:02,585
Minhyeok,

762
00:49:04,963 --> 00:49:07,090
what if he's not a crazy lawyer?

763
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:09,217
<i>What?</i>

764
00:49:11,094 --> 00:49:12,887
It's nothing. I'll call you again.

765
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:18,851
What is he doing?

766
00:49:20,186 --> 00:49:22,021
How many hours has he been here?

767
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,465
LEE MYEONGHO ATTEMPTED THEFT CASE

768
00:49:59,684 --> 00:50:00,977
Good morning...

769
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:26,002
This time, it's a very important question.

770
00:50:26,586 --> 00:50:28,796
You like Mincheol, but...

771
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:32,508
So let me ask you,
is it love or friendship?

772
00:50:32,592 --> 00:50:34,385
-Friendship.
-Why?

773
00:50:34,844 --> 00:50:36,304
Because friendship is for friends.

774
00:50:36,387 --> 00:50:37,638
I'm bored, let's go.

775
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,518
Friendship is for friends.

776
00:50:42,602 --> 00:50:45,063
Friendship is for friends. That's deep.

777
00:50:45,146 --> 00:50:47,106
Yes, friendship is what makes a life.

778
00:50:47,565 --> 00:50:49,025
-What are you doing?
-Nothing much.

779
00:50:49,108 --> 00:50:52,153
Since we'll be doing a jury trial,
jury selection is important.

780
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:54,155
So I'm thinking
about what questions I should ask.

781
00:50:54,739 --> 00:50:57,658
Right. You should look at
the Myers-Brigg Type Indicator.

782
00:50:57,742 --> 00:50:58,785
The MBTI.

783
00:50:58,868 --> 00:50:59,952
What is that?

784
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:02,997
It's a personality type test.

785
00:51:03,206 --> 00:51:04,749
Ah, they have something like that?

786
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:07,668
Can I ask the question in court, though?

787
00:51:07,752 --> 00:51:09,587
What is your type?

788
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,381
My type is "Normal."

789
00:51:12,465 --> 00:51:14,092
I'm healthy.

790
00:51:14,175 --> 00:51:16,219
I bet I'm normal too.
I don't need the test.

791
00:51:16,552 --> 00:51:18,346
Right?

792
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:19,430
What is that?

793
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:23,810
Jun left his lunch at home
so I'm bringing it to him.

794
00:51:23,893 --> 00:51:26,729
Great. I need to go somewhere.
Can you drive me?

795
00:51:26,813 --> 00:51:28,481
-Okay.
-You can drop me off on the way.

796
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:32,735
In a jury trial,

797
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:35,071
it's important to know
the jury's tendencies.

798
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,075
It's better to have more people
who would punish a four-time convict

799
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:41,744
than those who are more forgiving.

800
00:51:41,994 --> 00:51:43,538
Your chances of winning would go up.

801
00:51:44,122 --> 00:51:46,124
But how do you find out the tendencies?

802
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:49,502
Whether they are
politically progressive or conservative,

803
00:51:49,752 --> 00:51:53,214
what economic status they are in,
if you could find those things out,

804
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:57,552
you will be able to tell
who would side with the prosecution.

805
00:51:59,053 --> 00:52:00,054
Give it a try.

806
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:10,398
Jury Candidate No. 1,

807
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:13,484
do you agree with shortening
the military service term?

808
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:15,194
Yes, I agree.

809
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:16,737
Wrong.

810
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,948
If you ask that question,

811
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:23,452
the other side will also know
what type of juror he will be.

812
00:52:25,746 --> 00:52:28,624
You have to come up with questions
that are clear to you,

813
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:30,626
but confusing to the other side.

814
00:52:30,793 --> 00:52:32,420
That's the key to jury selection.

815
00:52:35,381 --> 00:52:36,340
Baek Mari.

816
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:40,803
You should win your last trial
as a probationary judicial officer.

817
00:52:41,762 --> 00:52:43,931
Of course, I will.

818
00:52:46,225 --> 00:52:47,435
Mr. Cheon.

819
00:52:47,685 --> 00:52:50,897
Do you think you can win
Lee Myeongho's case?

820
00:52:52,648 --> 00:52:55,651
It depends on how the jury rules.

821
00:52:56,235 --> 00:52:58,946
Would the jury believe Lee Myeongho?

822
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,323
Probably not.

823
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:02,241
What do we do then?

824
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:03,743
What should we do?

825
00:53:04,202 --> 00:53:06,746
Stop playing around and tell me.

826
00:53:07,038 --> 00:53:10,082
The first principle of Criminal Law is,

827
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:13,711
"When in doubt,
rule in favor of the defendant."

828
00:53:14,212 --> 00:53:15,504
What does that mean?

829
00:53:15,755 --> 00:53:16,756
It means what it says.

830
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:19,258
-Make a right turn there.
-Okay.

831
00:53:23,804 --> 00:53:26,349
HOF & SOJU

832
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:42,490
Lee Myeongho was on this side.

833
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:51,958
Oh!

834
00:53:53,751 --> 00:53:55,795
I was wiping the floor right outside.

835
00:54:50,933 --> 00:54:52,226
Prosecutor Baek Mari!

836
00:54:57,982 --> 00:55:00,526
Hello. Good morning.

837
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:03,070
Hello, Attorney Cheon Jihun.

838
00:55:05,906 --> 00:55:06,741
What is this?

839
00:55:07,783 --> 00:55:08,784
This?

840
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,829
You will find out a little later.

841
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:15,624
-Mr. Cheon!
-Mr. Sa, you're here.

842
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,086
Let's go.

843
00:55:19,587 --> 00:55:20,546
Bye then, Ms. Baek.

844
00:55:38,898 --> 00:55:39,774
Why?

845
00:55:40,566 --> 00:55:41,400
Are you nervous?

846
00:55:41,484 --> 00:55:45,112
Does my necktie look okay?
It's been bothering me all morning.

847
00:55:45,196 --> 00:55:47,907
It looks good. It looks great.

848
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:50,701
-Does it look good?
-Yes.

849
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:53,829
Okay, hold onto this.
I have to go to jury selection.

850
00:55:53,913 --> 00:55:55,164
What is this?

851
00:55:55,247 --> 00:55:56,207
You'll see later.

852
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:58,709
The necktie looks good.

853
00:56:21,732 --> 00:56:23,275
The judges are entering the chamber.

854
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,860
Please rise.

855
00:56:32,868 --> 00:56:33,828
Have a seat, everyone.

856
00:56:43,129 --> 00:56:45,339
Shall we begin?

857
00:56:46,424 --> 00:56:48,467
-Jury Candidate No. 1.
-Yes?

858
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:51,470
Do you think the maximum age
for juvenile court should be lowered?

859
00:56:51,554 --> 00:56:53,389
I think it should be lowered.

860
00:56:53,472 --> 00:56:54,723
JURY CANDIDATE

861
00:56:55,099 --> 00:56:55,933
Thank you.

862
00:56:56,725 --> 00:56:58,144
Jury Candidate No. 17.

863
00:56:58,310 --> 00:56:59,311
Yes.

864
00:56:59,395 --> 00:57:02,189
What was on the front page
of the news today?

865
00:57:02,273 --> 00:57:06,402
National apartment prices rise
for 12 consecutive weeks or something.

866
00:57:07,236 --> 00:57:09,113
DAEHAN DAILY

867
00:57:10,448 --> 00:57:11,282
Thank you.

868
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,910
The Daehan Daily, X.

869
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:24,044
Jury Candidate No. 30,
here is my question.

870
00:57:25,588 --> 00:57:26,589
In life,

871
00:57:27,631 --> 00:57:29,425
you sometimes have important meals.

872
00:57:29,508 --> 00:57:33,012
And some of those meals could take place
at a Chinese restaurant.

873
00:57:33,095 --> 00:57:34,263
Of course.

874
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:36,891
At such meals, would you eat

875
00:57:36,974 --> 00:57:39,310
<i>tangsuyuk </i>with the sauce poured
over the dish or on the side?

876
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:43,564
Your Honor.

877
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:45,024
Yes?

878
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:47,443
The questions are too playful.

879
00:57:47,526 --> 00:57:48,944
Agreed.

880
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:50,779
Please watch it, counsel.

881
00:57:50,863 --> 00:57:54,825
Should I ask something else?
You don't seem to like my question.

882
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:56,994
Should I ask something else?

883
00:57:57,077 --> 00:57:58,204
Okay, I will.

884
00:57:58,787 --> 00:58:00,956
Let's see, then.

885
00:58:01,582 --> 00:58:03,000
Steamed or pan-fried dumplings?

886
00:58:09,673 --> 00:58:11,425
This is a very important question.

887
00:58:11,926 --> 00:58:14,637
Sir, please answer his first question.

888
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:17,181
-I would like the sauce on the side.
-On the side.

889
00:58:18,015 --> 00:58:19,350
On the...

890
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:21,685
Then, what would you do

891
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:24,855
if someone just poured the sauce all over?
Would you be mad?

892
00:58:24,939 --> 00:58:28,025
I would be annoyed,
but I wouldn't do anything.

893
00:58:28,943 --> 00:58:31,320
Okay. Thank you for your answer.

894
00:58:31,403 --> 00:58:33,489
The sauce on the side is the way to go,

895
00:58:33,614 --> 00:58:35,950
but the office manager
always pours it all over.

896
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:37,868
-Your Honor.
-Go ahead.

897
00:58:37,952 --> 00:58:39,245
The defense counsel is...

898
00:58:43,082 --> 00:58:44,458
too chatty.

899
00:58:45,084 --> 00:58:46,252
Agreed.

900
00:58:46,502 --> 00:58:48,212
Please watch it, counsel.

901
00:58:48,546 --> 00:58:49,713
I apologize.

902
00:58:50,506 --> 00:58:53,467
I will ask the next candidate.

903
00:58:54,093 --> 00:58:55,511
It's taking a long time.

904
00:59:14,154 --> 00:59:15,114
What is this?

905
00:59:15,197 --> 00:59:17,408
The jury trial
for Defendant Lee Myeongho

906
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:21,996
on the violation of the Aggravated
Punishment of Specific Crimes

907
00:59:22,538 --> 00:59:24,540
will now begin.

908
00:59:25,332 --> 00:59:27,626
We, the jury, do solemnly swear

909
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,837
to justly evaluate the facts

910
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:33,007
and to render a verdict

911
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:36,594
according to the evidence and law
presented by this court.

912
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,180
The defendant was arrested

913
00:59:40,264 --> 00:59:42,850
on the charges of attempted theft
against a drunk individual

914
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:45,060
inside a men's restroom at Seoul Station.

915
00:59:45,644 --> 00:59:48,063
The defendant's been convicted
on identical charges four times.

916
00:59:48,564 --> 00:59:51,317
In addition, the incident occurred
two months after his release.

917
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,944
Therefore, charges have been pressed.

918
00:59:54,445 --> 00:59:57,531
Does the defense agree
with the allegation?

919
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:00,951
The defendant denies the allegation.

920
01:00:01,285 --> 01:00:02,411
The defendant...

921
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:05,289
was not trying to steal a wallet.

922
01:00:05,372 --> 01:00:08,334
He was trying to help
a drunk man from falling down.

923
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,420
Prosecution, go ahead.

924
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,592
The prosecution requests as a witness,
the man who was present at the scene.

925
01:00:17,176 --> 01:00:18,010
WITNESS

926
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:22,890
Sir. What happened
at the time of the incident?

927
01:00:24,183 --> 01:00:26,602
I remember it clearly.

928
01:00:27,436 --> 01:00:30,356
<i>I was urinating in the restroom.</i>

929
01:00:30,606 --> 01:00:31,857
Oh, my! Are you okay?

930
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,277
<i>I felt someone putting his hand
in my pocket from the back.</i>

931
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:36,820
-What are you doing?
<i>-So I caught him.</i>

932
01:00:37,363 --> 01:00:38,697
There's a pickpocket here!

933
01:00:39,031 --> 01:00:41,158
I found out at the police station

934
01:00:41,617 --> 01:00:42,993
that it wasn't his first time.

935
01:00:43,077 --> 01:00:44,244
There was no doubt.

936
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:46,789
That will be all.

937
01:00:47,706 --> 01:00:49,875
The defense counsel may cross-examine.

938
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:51,251
Yes, Your Honor.

939
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:53,504
Witness.

940
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,341
At the time of the incident,

941
01:00:57,466 --> 01:00:58,884
weren't you drunk?

942
01:00:59,635 --> 01:01:00,803
So, what?

943
01:01:00,886 --> 01:01:02,763
According to the police report,

944
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:07,351
you testified that you had
two glasses of beer.

945
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:08,894
Yes.

946
01:01:08,977 --> 01:01:10,813
Did you just have two glasses of beer?

947
01:01:10,896 --> 01:01:12,106
Did you mix <i>soju </i>with it?

948
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:16,819
-No.
-Not even a drop?

949
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:19,071
I don't remember.

950
01:01:19,947 --> 01:01:22,533
You don't remember...

951
01:01:23,075 --> 01:01:24,743
Don't you usually drink <i>somaek</i>?

952
01:01:24,827 --> 01:01:26,745
I love <i>somaek</i> too.

953
01:01:27,705 --> 01:01:29,248
-Objection.
-Sustained.

954
01:01:29,915 --> 01:01:32,000
Please stick to the questions
that pertain to the case.

955
01:01:32,084 --> 01:01:34,169
I am trying to establish credibility.

956
01:01:34,378 --> 01:01:37,756
Would the witness accurately remember
the facts before and after the incident?

957
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,300
So, I brought a CCTV clip.

958
01:01:47,933 --> 01:01:49,143
Please take a look.

959
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,564
There, we can see the table where
the witness and his party were seated.

960
01:01:54,732 --> 01:01:57,151
But what was happening there?

961
01:01:57,943 --> 01:01:59,319
What were you doing?

962
01:01:59,695 --> 01:02:03,949
You were making <i>somaek</i>. Right?

963
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,328
You made it
and passed it around to your friends.

964
01:02:09,371 --> 01:02:12,416
Did you drink it too? Did you drink it?

965
01:02:14,585 --> 01:02:15,836
You chugged--

966
01:02:18,464 --> 01:02:21,091
I apologize, you took a drink.

967
01:02:23,594 --> 01:02:24,470
Your Honor,

968
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:28,223
the defense counsel
is desecrating this courtroom.

969
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:30,559
Please watch your tone, counsel.

970
01:02:30,642 --> 01:02:31,977
I will, Your Honor.

971
01:02:32,186 --> 01:02:33,979
You claimed you had two glasses of beer,

972
01:02:34,062 --> 01:02:36,190
but we now see that you had more.

973
01:02:36,273 --> 01:02:38,901
Do you agree that your memory
could be wrong?

974
01:02:38,984 --> 01:02:41,653
That was because I was drunk.

975
01:02:41,737 --> 01:02:45,574
It's possible to be mistaken.
It is possible.

976
01:02:45,657 --> 01:02:48,368
Then please tell me, would it be possible

977
01:02:48,494 --> 01:02:51,663
that the defendant was indeed
trying to help you,

978
01:02:51,747 --> 01:02:54,541
but you mistook him for a pickpocket

979
01:02:55,918 --> 01:02:57,753
while being drunk?

980
01:02:59,296 --> 01:03:03,008
Sir. There will be no harm
or disadvantage against you

981
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:04,885
just because you were mistaken.

982
01:03:05,469 --> 01:03:08,472
But the defendant's life is at stake

983
01:03:09,139 --> 01:03:10,182
based on your testimony.

984
01:03:10,265 --> 01:03:12,267
DEFENDANT

985
01:03:15,604 --> 01:03:17,856
The defense is leading the witness.

986
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,818
Under the Criminal Procedure Act,
it is permitted in cross-examination.

987
01:03:21,485 --> 01:03:22,402
Hmm.

988
01:03:22,653 --> 01:03:23,821
Didn't you know?

989
01:03:23,904 --> 01:03:28,116
Your Honor, but there is
a risk of confusion

990
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,744
or distorting the memory of the witness.

991
01:03:30,828 --> 01:03:32,287
Agreed.

992
01:03:34,665 --> 01:03:37,668
Sir. Please think it over.

993
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:41,088
The defendant clearly says
he caught you from falling down

994
01:03:41,171 --> 01:03:44,466
when you lost your balance.

995
01:03:50,013 --> 01:03:51,849
Even if it's your job,

996
01:03:51,932 --> 01:03:53,809
think about who you're defending.

997
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:56,687
That man is a pickpocket
with four convictions!

998
01:03:57,354 --> 01:04:00,274
The witness will only answer
the question that was asked.

999
01:04:00,357 --> 01:04:02,526
-It was a stupid question.
-Witness!

1000
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,154
What was the question?

1001
01:04:06,238 --> 01:04:08,782
I guess your memory is not that good
during the day either.

1002
01:04:10,075 --> 01:04:12,703
-Defense counsel.
-I acknowledge. That will be all.

1003
01:04:18,542 --> 01:04:20,544
The prosecution will now cross-examine.

1004
01:04:23,755 --> 01:04:24,631
Who is that guy?

1005
01:04:26,508 --> 01:04:28,594
That's the defendant's attorney.

1006
01:04:28,677 --> 01:04:31,346
The defendant claims
he was helping the witness

1007
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:33,640
who was drunk from falling down.

1008
01:04:33,891 --> 01:04:36,560
Let's see how credible his testimony is.

1009
01:04:39,688 --> 01:04:42,691
What we can see is
the defendant's student record

1010
01:04:42,774 --> 01:04:44,776
up to the point
he dropped out of high school.

1011
01:04:45,903 --> 01:04:49,615
There is a consistent comment
throughout his ten years of school.

1012
01:04:51,408 --> 01:04:53,785
"He frequently steals from his friends."

1013
01:04:54,536 --> 01:04:56,038
"He has a bad habit of stealing."

1014
01:04:56,747 --> 01:04:57,664
"He steals."

1015
01:04:58,999 --> 01:05:03,337
As you can see, his habit of stealing
started from a young age.

1016
01:05:03,629 --> 01:05:07,424
Even as an adult,
he lived a life of a thief

1017
01:05:07,507 --> 01:05:09,092
that sent him to jail four times.

1018
01:05:09,468 --> 01:05:13,138
I ask the jury to consider
the defendant's credibility,

1019
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:15,307
when he claimed

1020
01:05:15,766 --> 01:05:19,394
that he was helping a drunk man,
not stealing his wallet.

1021
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:28,403
<i>The prosecutor is right.</i>

1022
01:05:28,487 --> 01:05:30,530
But doesn't the defense attorney
have a good point?

1023
01:05:30,614 --> 01:05:33,200
No. If he is
a four-time convicted pickpocket,

1024
01:05:33,283 --> 01:05:35,744
his hands would act without even thinking.

1025
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:38,330
That kind of habit can't be cured.

1026
01:05:38,413 --> 01:05:41,041
But we should wait and see.

1027
01:05:41,124 --> 01:05:42,751
The trial isn't over yet.

1028
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,629
My gosh. There is nothing more to see.

1029
01:05:45,712 --> 01:05:47,214
It's obvious.

1030
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:57,057
I'm sorry. The choices I made in life
brought me here.

1031
01:05:57,808 --> 01:05:59,434
They would believe a drunk man

1032
01:06:00,185 --> 01:06:01,687
over an ex-convict.

1033
01:06:02,354 --> 01:06:03,647
I would do the same too.

1034
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,277
SOMI'S MOM

1035
01:06:09,361 --> 01:06:11,947
<i>Mr. Cheon. Somi just fainted.</i>

1036
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,907
<i>We're on our way to the hospital
for her surgery.</i>

1037
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:19,955
Mr. Lee,

1038
01:06:22,124 --> 01:06:24,626
it's not important
whether the others believe you or not.

1039
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:27,504
You know what you did,

1040
01:06:28,588 --> 01:06:29,548
better than anyone.

1041
01:06:31,925 --> 01:06:33,760
Let's turn this thing around.

1042
01:06:34,803 --> 01:06:35,929
Your Honor,

1043
01:06:36,596 --> 01:06:38,932
I would like to submit new evidence.

1044
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:40,517
Objection.

1045
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:43,854
This evidence has not been
previously agreed upon.

1046
01:06:43,937 --> 01:06:46,940
It was something that could not be agreed
prior to the trial.

1047
01:06:47,315 --> 01:06:49,401
What were you doing
during the preparatory--

1048
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,530
The list of evidence must be
submitted and agreed

1049
01:06:53,613 --> 01:06:56,116
during the preparatory proceedings,
Your Honor.

1050
01:06:56,199 --> 01:06:57,701
It was an unavoidable circumstance.

1051
01:06:57,784 --> 01:06:59,661
The prosecution cannot accept it.

1052
01:07:00,495 --> 01:07:02,956
Please approach the bench.

1053
01:07:13,842 --> 01:07:16,928
Defense counsel,
what is the unavoidable circumstance?

1054
01:07:18,305 --> 01:07:20,348
I will tell you
if the submission is allowed.

1055
01:07:20,432 --> 01:07:21,767
I can't accept.

1056
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:25,437
Why doesn't the prosecution
review it first?

1057
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,689
You can decide afterward.

1058
01:08:13,944 --> 01:08:15,654
This is your evidence?

1059
01:08:15,737 --> 01:08:19,116
Yes. Do you object to the submission

1060
01:08:19,866 --> 01:08:20,826
of this evidence?

1061
01:08:34,256 --> 01:08:37,134
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

1062
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,249
I'd like to demand the defendant
to serve five years in prison.

1063
01:09:09,332 --> 01:09:10,834
What's the point of having a trial?

1064
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:12,377
Order, defendant!

1065
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,963
To you high-and-mighty people, I'm nothing
but a convicted piece of trash.

1066
01:09:15,046 --> 01:09:16,256
<i>Bailiff, remove him from the court.</i>

1067
01:09:16,339 --> 01:09:17,299
Isn't that a bit lame?

1068
01:09:18,133 --> 01:09:20,468
<i>Ms. Baek Mari.</i>

1069
01:09:20,552 --> 01:09:22,929
It turns out you can't be
a probationary employee here.

1070
01:09:23,013 --> 01:09:25,140
-Grandpa.
<i>-If you can't last two months there,</i>

1071
01:09:25,223 --> 01:09:27,184
<i>don't even think of coming back to Baek.</i>

1072
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:30,187
<i>Is this a coffee house or an office?
What's wrong with this place?</i>

1073
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,271
<i>Who is it?</i>

1074
01:09:31,771 --> 01:09:33,023
Excuse me.
