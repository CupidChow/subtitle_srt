THIS SHOW IS FICTION,
AND THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, INSTITUTIONS,

12
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:49,070
EVENTS, GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
ON THE SHOW ARE NOT REAL

13
00:00:52,657 --> 00:00:55,702
<i>Is it true that Assemblyman
Kim was being investigated by prosecutors?</i>

14
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:58,329
<i>Did he commit suicide?
Who was the prosecutor in charge?</i>

15
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:00,290
They say he's the mad dog of Seocho-dong.

16
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:01,541
<i>You did this to him.</i>

17
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:03,459
<i>If you hadn't investigated him,
this wouldn't have happened.</i>

18
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:06,921
<i>Those who act self-righteous
always get themselves in trouble.</i>

19
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:08,965
<i>Though, I don't know
if saying that helps at all.</i>

20
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:11,217
<i>That wasn't your fault.</i>

21
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:13,094
<i>Why you had to do that,</i>

22
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:15,513
<i>and who they are.
I'm going to find out no matter what.</i>

23
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:16,639
<i>Don't dig into it anymore.</i>

24
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,433
<i>Don't do anything at all
and pull out of it.</i>

25
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:20,101
<i>It has already been two years.</i>

26
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:21,936
<i>Shouldn't you stop
and live your own life now?</i>

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,730
<i>I really like it when you smile.</i>

28
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:25,440

me right now?</i>

32
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:32,822
<i>I'll go see you
at the prosecutors' office.</i>

33
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:42,457
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,499
<i>Juyeong.</i>

35
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,169
<i>Ms. Lee Juyeong
passed away at 23:38.</i>

36
00:01:46,252 --> 00:01:48,588
<i>Last night, during a random
assault that happened on the subway,</i>

37
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:51,007
<i>a woman in her thirties
was stabbed to death.</i>

38
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,759
<i>The suspect, Mr. Cho, turned himself in</i>

39
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:55,011
<i>at a nearby police station
after the crime.</i>

40
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:56,971
You can't take this case.
The higher-ups will never allow that.

41
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,765
<i>She was the only one who drew close to me.</i>

42
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:00,225
I don't need anyone's permission.

43
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:05,104
You've never seen me before.

44
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:11,319
<i>It wasn't you.</i>

The man that did that

52
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,985
to Juyeong that day was not you.

53
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:54,529
Mm.

54
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:59,409
I know that you aren't the real killer.

55
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:03,705
And if those people think
you were the one who told me that,

56
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:04,914
do you think…

57
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,166
they'd let you live?

58
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:13,089
All right.

59
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:15,633
I'll see you again later.

60
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:17,552
Until then,

61
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:21,180
take good care of yourself, okay?

62
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:25,018
If you change your mind,
call me at this number.

63
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:26,436

Wait!

66
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:34,485
If I do so,

67
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:37,447
will I be acquitted and free to go?

68
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,534
Yes, if we catch that guy.

69
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:42,702
You're right.

70
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:45,705
I'm… not the one who did it.

71
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:49,375
Who did it?

72
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:50,793
I don't even know his name.

73
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:54,255
I've only seen his face once.

74
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:02,930
-You've seen his face?
-Yes.

75
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:06,976
Do you remember what he looks like?

76
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,813
I think I can recognize him from a photo.

are calling is unavailable.</i>

79
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:54,065
It's me.

80
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:55,900
You…

81
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:57,485
Beg for your life.

82
00:04:57,944 --> 00:05:00,196
-What?
-Beg for your life.

83
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:05,201
Let me live. Please let me live.

84
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:07,078
Please let me live.

85
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:09,914
Sir, you've been through a lot.

86

Investigator.

87
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:36,399
-Please check first.
-Yes.

88
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:39,318
-Please restrict the crime scene.
-Yes, ma'am.

89
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:47,618
-It's my turn.
-Let's go.

00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:14,103
Hey. Mr. Cheon.

94
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:19,650
Our hope, the pride of Pungjin-dong,
Attorney Cheon Jihun.

95
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:20,651
You've come at last.

96
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:24,030
What's with you?

97
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:26,032
Mari says,

98
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,576
he is draped head-to-toe in luxury brands.

99
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,287
-Mr. Cheon is here.
-He is being a little picky.

100
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,622
Is that right?

101
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:35,791
Well, hello.

102
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,388
Mari, can you prepare
two cups of tea please?

103
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:50,848
The tea I usually get.

104
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,934
-Yes, sir. Mr. Sa?
-Sure.

105
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:55,811
Okay. Please have a seat.

106
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:01,651
What can we help you with?

107
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:05,279
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Cheon.

108
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:06,864
Is there a problem?

109
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:17,250
My past is holding me back.

110
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:21,754
Hmm, your past? Which past do you mean?

111
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:23,339
When someone does great deeds,

112
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:26,259
you end up
getting your hands dirty a little bit.

113
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:29,220
-Yes, that's right.
-I need a lawyer to clean that up for me.

114
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:32,098
Hmm.

115
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,225
So, can you do that for me?

116
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,851
Money is not an issue.

117
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:44,402
I'm sorry, but we don't
take on cases like that.

118
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:46,612
Aah.

119
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:48,573
Is that so?

120
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:52,118
You seemed to be struggling,
so I thought you'd take on any case.

121
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:55,121
I must've gotten it wrong.

122
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,040
Hang on a second.

123
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,376
Did you say we seemed to be struggling?

124
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:02,295
I guess…

125
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:08,217
My pride led me to act hard to get,
but you caught on pretty quickly.

126
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,345
You brought your ID, didn't you?
Please sit down.

127
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:13,472
We are actually struggling.

128
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,235
All right. Got it.

IDENTIFICATION CARD
KIM SOONHO

130
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:44,086
Ms. Baek, please make a copy of his ID.

131
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,964
Yes, sir.

132
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:49,091
I'll take a look at it.

133
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,139
How interesting.
Is your legal fee 1,000 won?

134
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,307
Yes, it's 1,000 won.

135
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:00,311
It's 1,000 won per second.

136
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:04,857
-Per second?
-Yes, heard of a time-operating system?

137
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:06,609
We don't charge by the hour,

138
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,320
but by the second.

139
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,738
By the second.

140
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:14,075
An hour has 3,600 seconds.
3,600 times 1,000.

141
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:15,660
That's 3.6 million won an hour.

142
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,245
Was that too expensive?

143
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:20,665
It's ridiculous.
Not even Law Firm Baek charges that much.

144
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:24,251
The legal fee doesn't matter.
You can charge me any amount.

145
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:28,047
-Mr. Cheon.
-Yes.

146
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,802
Okay, Mr. Kim Soonho. We'll take
a thorough look into it and contact you.

147
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:34,470
-Here you go.
-Okay.

148
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,021
Yes!

00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:05,710
Hmm.

153
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,837
You haven't found any leads.

154
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:10,047
I'm going to change my methods.

155
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:11,799
How?

156
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:15,136
I'll make them come to me.

157
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:19,807
What's this? What happened?

158
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:21,308
Is it broken?

159
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:23,519
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

160
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:25,938
The picture didn't print.

161
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:29,150
If it was broken,
it wouldn't have printed at all.

00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:30,943
How strange. Only the photo didn't print.

YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE

168
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:02,475
Pardon me.

169
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:04,602
Oh.

170
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:06,729
-Geez.
-I'm terribly sorry.

171
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:08,898
I'm sorry.

ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

173
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:24,371
Assemblyman Oh Kichul, suicide.

174
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:28,584
Deputy head of Daesan Construction
Choi Gyuseok, suicide.

175
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:33,506
These two were both involved
in creating a slush fund with JQ Group.

176
00:11:33,923 --> 00:11:34,965
Also,

177
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:38,135
on the 20th at 3:00 a.m.,

178
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:41,055
Cayman Fund's CEO Kim Sungwook

179
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:43,015
was found dead in his own car.

180
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:46,018
This is the footage

181
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:49,104
of Mr. Kim's car
which was taken at 1:42 a.m.

182
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:51,398
As you can see, he was in the car alone.

183
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:54,652
Any other suspicious cars?
He wasn't being followed or anything?

184
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:58,322
We checked all the cars
that was caught on CCTV

185
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,783
from before and after that time,
but there weren't any.

186
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:02,117
Then, was it a suicide?

187
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,037
There is one thing that
makes me hesitate to call it suicide.

188
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:09,375
This is footage that was taken
around the time at a nearby farm.

189
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,919
Who is that?

190
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:14,672
We have confirmed
that he's not a resident of the area,

191
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:16,799
but we're still searching
to find out who he is.

192
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:19,593
So, is it suicide or murder?

193
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:20,928
Uh…

194
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:23,138
According to the autopsy,
there's no evidence of murder,

195
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:25,474
but there were
a few suspicious circumstances,

196
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:29,019
so we plan to work harder
in our investigation.

197
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:33,816
KIM SOONHO

198
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,443
What's this about?
Why'd he put a film on his ID?

199
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:38,362
I know.

200
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,285
The address is…

201
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:48,622
Hey, you're back.

202
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,499
Did you see him?

203
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:53,127
No.

204
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,296
Who was it that made you go after him?

205
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:58,132
-A swindler.
-A swindler?

206
00:12:58,591 --> 00:12:59,633
What swindler?

207
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:01,010
You know, from last year

208
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:04,221
Mr. Kim Jaehyun, who said
he was scammed 30 million won.

209
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:05,764
The one with glasses?

210
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:09,143
Yes, the smart-looking guy
that wore glasses and a hat.

211
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:10,895
He had a beard this long.

212
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:12,521
Ah!

213
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:14,356
I don't remember.

214
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,734
He came by to ask us
to catch that swindler. Why can't you--

215
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,193
He isn't answering.

216
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:19,486
What about the address?

217
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:21,030
It doesn't exist.

218
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,991
What the heck? The address
and phone number are all fake?

219
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,497
See, he's a swindler. Isn't he?

220
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:32,791
Whatever. Forget about him.

221
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,545
Gosh, that's why he said
we could charge him 1,000 won per second.

222
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:38,839
Geez. I got excited for a second.

223
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:40,841
Then, shouldn't we catch him?

224
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:42,051
Where would we catch him?

225
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:43,844
The CCTV.

226
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:46,889
What did you just say?

227
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,599
The CCTV.

228
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:52,895
We have CCTV?

229
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:56,357
Did you happen to see the man
that just left?

230
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,192
He was wearing a gray suit.

231
00:13:58,275 --> 00:13:59,401
It was gray.

232
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:02,112
We weren't in the right minds to see him.

233
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:04,448
She said "go" three times
and I had no <i>pi</i> cards.

234
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:07,159
You know, in my dream last night,

235
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:10,454
my Janggun made a huge dump.

236
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:14,500
-Janggun made a huge dump?
-That's right.

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,253
What luck you had while playing Go-Stop!

238
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:20,756
-What?
-And I was on such a good streak…

239
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,260
But luck's the most important thing.

240
00:14:37,022 --> 00:14:38,440
This is Cha Minchul.

241
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:40,401
He didn't seem to recognize me at all.

242
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,027
You don't have to worry.

243
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:43,988
Understood.

Ah, yes, I am quite all right.

247
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:18,063
You didn't go home yet.

248
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:20,733
That dream really got you spooked.

249
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,359
It's nothing.

250
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:25,237
Go on home. I'm heading out now.

Jihun is looking for.</i>

The person that did that to his father?

253
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:37,833
No.

254
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,793
Not that person.

255
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:41,003
It's another person.

256
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,212
Who is it?

257
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:46,467
There's someone
that Jihun is dying to find.

258
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:26,757
Roar!

259
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,469
Roar.

260
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:33,180
What are you up to?

261
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:36,058
I was waiting for you.

262
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:37,810
-You were following me.
-I'm sorry.

263
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:40,979
Can you buy me a drink?

264
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:42,773
Let's take this out first.

265
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,610
Gosh. It's really stuck.

266
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:49,905
Take it off for a second.

267
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:51,323
Take your shoe off.

268
00:16:51,406 --> 00:16:52,825
-Like this?
-Yes.

269
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,203
Are you okay?

270
00:16:56,286 --> 00:16:58,497
I'm fine. That was embarrassing.

271
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,498
Put it back on.

What are you doing?

274

Goodness.

275
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:17,474
I knew it. You never tried dried pollack.

276
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:21,770
Look, you're supposed to tear it
in the middle like this.

277
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:25,899
Carefully remove the bones inside
like this.

278
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:29,695
Remove the flesh like so.

279
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:34,366
Get a huge dip of mayonnaise on it

280
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,702
and just eat it. Here.

281
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:41,123
-Open up.
-What?

282
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:43,292
Your boss is giving it to you.
Do it for camaraderie.

283
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,376
Here. Open up.

284
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,088
Open up.

00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:50,716
Aah.

Isn't it so good?

00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,603
-Let's just drink.
-Clink.

288
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:09,860
Mr. Cheon, my time as
a probationary employee is almost up.

289
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:12,112
You must be happy to be rid of me.

290
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:17,868
Gosh, the beer tastes extra good today.

291
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:22,915
Mr. Cheon, you should learn to lie
a little in moments like these.

292
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,792
Fine. Since you're leaving,

293
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:28,545
why don't you tell me a lie first?

294
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:32,549
Okay. I'll go ahead and lie first.

295
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,800
Okay.

296
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:37,054
Working at your office made me…

297
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:39,223
truly happy.

298
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,976
-I learned a lot too.
-Mm.

299
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:45,062
Thank you.

300
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,775
Phew. That is a lie.

301
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:53,070
Also…

302
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:57,032
I really like you, Mr. Cheon.

303
00:18:57,699 --> 00:18:58,909
Ooh.

304
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:05,540
That's why I don't want
to see you in pain.

305
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,504
Is that really a lie?

306
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:12,130
What do you mean?

307
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:13,799
What you just said…

308
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:17,844
sounded like the truth.

309
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:20,055
Ha!

310
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:23,517
What? I don't like you.
What has gotten into you?

311
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:30,148
You meant what you said
when you didn't want to see me in pain.

312
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:33,068
That's why I asked you.
What's wrong with you?

313
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:38,156
Oh, that? Yes, I meant that.

314
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,868
Are you drunk?
I can't take you home today.

315
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:45,038
Put your phone on the table
and put in the passcode. Okay?

316
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:46,873
Go home while you're awake.

317
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:48,083
What are you saying?

318
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:50,502
Stop messing around.

319
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:54,006
I came here to tell you something.

320
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:55,590
Tell me something?

321
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,510
I'm getting a strange vibe. Go ahead.

322
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,808
I heard…

323
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:08,228
that you're searching for someone.

324
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:25,037
I told you that I meant it

325
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:28,832
when I said I didn't want
to see you in pain.

326
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:32,669
I want to help you.

327
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,177
Thanks for the thought,

328
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,971
but you can't help me out with this.

329
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:45,140
Let's stop talking about that.

330
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:47,017
I'm sorry, but I'm going to go now.

331
00:20:49,144 --> 00:20:50,103
My wish.

332
00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:53,523
What?

333
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:57,527
It's my wish.

334
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:01,198
Why should I grant you a wish?

335
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:04,910
Not that wish,

336
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:07,537
but the wish from that day.

337
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:11,375
Well done, Ms. Baek.
I admit you did a good job.

338
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,002
You'd better keep your promise
about my wish.

339
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:21,968
So you're saying…

340
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,222
this is your wish?

341
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:29,518
Yes, this is my wish.

342
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:32,479
So,

343
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,606
please tell me.

344
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:52,541
Anyway, due to Mr. Kim's death,
they don't have the right to investigate

345
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:54,543
the Cayman Fund case anymore,

346
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:57,587
so finish up your defenses.

347
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:59,047
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

348
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:00,841
-Well done.
-Thank you.

349
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:12,144
They are suspecting that
Cayman Fund's Mr. Kim has been murdered.

350
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:14,396
The prosecution seems to be investigating.

351
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:19,192
There were many
who were uncomfortable with the case.

352
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:23,280
Do you also suspect…

353
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:26,741
My goodness. Is that how you see me?

354
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:30,620
No, sir. Thanks to that,
the case was closed without much fuss.

355
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:34,791
A man has died.

356
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:38,378
I feel sorry for him,
but what can we do about it?

357
00:22:38,712 --> 00:22:41,590
I hope this doesn't cause any more noise.

358
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:44,092
Hmm.

359
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:49,973
You want us to end the investigation?

360
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:52,976
The NFS finished the autopsy.

361
00:22:53,435 --> 00:22:55,020
Is there anything else to see?

362
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:59,191
But we have the CCTV footage.
We should at least find out who he is.

363
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:01,109
-What if you do find him?
-Pardon?

364
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:03,069
Can you overturn the autopsy result?

365
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,489
Anyway, we should find him first and--

366
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:07,782
-Hey!
-Understood, sir.

367
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:11,578
-Yejin.
-He might just be a passerby.

368
00:23:11,786 --> 00:23:13,371
That's right.

369
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:15,749
You always do your job well, Ms. Na.

370
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:18,376
I'll consider it done.
Keep up the good work.

371
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:25,300
Why that…

372
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,514
Yejin, are you really going to close it?

373
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:31,681
Are you?

374
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:34,893
No.

375
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,563
You're so cool.

376
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:01,878
What do you think?

377
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:04,673
-Geez.
-What do you think?

378
00:24:04,756 --> 00:24:06,258
He's just so-so.

379
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:07,926
Take a good look at him.

380
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:09,052
Seriously.

381
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:14,766
What has gotten into you?

382
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:16,768
What's up with your reaction?

383
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:19,854
He comes from a great family,
went to a great school, and he's handsome.

384
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:20,981
All right.

385
00:24:22,148 --> 00:24:24,359
-Fold over again.
-You brat.

386
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:28,530
Fold your right leg to the front
and straighten your left leg.

387
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:30,156
That's it.

388
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:33,493
Did this person say that he liked me?

389
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:35,245
Of course, he did.

390
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,956
He said he liked me
before even meeting me.

391
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,500
Isn't that because of Grandpa,
not because of me?

392
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:44,254
So, what?

393
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:49,801
Did something happen to you or something?

394
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:51,928
Who knows?

395
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:54,389
What? What's up with that answer?

396
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,060
Did something happen?

397
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:01,021
No, nothing happened, Mom.

398
00:25:01,563 --> 00:25:05,066
I just want to meet someone
who likes me. Just like you, Mom.

399
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:09,362
I'll meet him if that's what you want.

400
00:25:09,446 --> 00:25:10,488
When is it?

401
00:25:10,572 --> 00:25:12,240
You brat.

402
00:25:13,074 --> 00:25:14,200
It's this weekend.

403
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:15,994
Stretch.

404
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:17,579
Mom, I'll do it.

405
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,831
Mom, let me do it, okay?

406
00:25:19,914 --> 00:25:21,249
Weren't his eyebrows dark?

407
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,752
They were dark. Like charcoal.

408
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:27,088
-What about his nose?
-He had a round and chubby nose.

409
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:30,842
His eyes were small and sneaky-looking.

410
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:33,345
He had a protruding chin, didn't he?

411
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:34,929
That's right.

412
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:37,223
-Mr. Sa.
-What are you two doing?

413
00:25:37,307 --> 00:25:38,683
You scared me.

414
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:41,519
It looked like you were drawing something.

415
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:44,773
No, it's nothing.

416
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:46,900
What's that behind you?

417
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:50,570
Mr. Cheon, I'm really disappointed.

418
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,198
-What?
-If something like that happened to you,

419
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:55,325
you should've told me ages ago.

420
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:57,077
I thought we were close.

421
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,453
How close are we?

422
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:00,246
We're…

423
00:26:02,707 --> 00:26:03,833
We are…

424
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:11,132
close enough not to want to stand by
while the other is in pain.

425
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,806
You always fight for your clients.

426
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:19,432
This time,

427
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:22,394
I'm going to fight for you, Mr. Cheon.

428
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:24,896
Yes, me too.

429
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,075
Let me see it.

430
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:40,036
Mm…

431
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:43,998
Is this how you'll fight for me?

432
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:46,418
Wow, this drawing…

433
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:51,548
It's a composite sketch.

434
00:26:56,803 --> 00:26:58,096
I don't know about anything else,

435
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:01,349
but I clearly remember
what his eyes looked like.

436
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:03,768
Here. Take a look. What do you think?

437
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:07,480
Are you Picasso?

438
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:09,607
I'm glad you stuck to being a lawyer.

439
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:11,484
Hmm.

440
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:12,694
It looks similar to me.

441
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,780
Mr. Sa, how did you draw it?

442
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:19,534
I remember his eyes clearly as well.

443
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:23,788
Isn't it him from earlier?

444
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:26,124
Yes, it's the complete version of him.

445
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:31,671
Gosh, what would
the two of you do without me?

446
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:46,394
Please say something.

447
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:50,190
You're a human copy machine.
This isn't a drawing.

448
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:52,400
Isn't this a photo…

449
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:54,736
It's a drawing.

450
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,112
Whoa…

451
00:27:56,821 --> 00:27:58,656
Whoa.

452
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,325
It's a drawing.

453
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,368
You really drew him well.

454
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:05,622
I studied drawing until I went to college.

455
00:28:05,705 --> 00:28:06,998
My goodness.

456
00:28:11,836 --> 00:28:12,962
Let's go.

457
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:15,548
-Where?
-To get this guy.

458
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,262
HAPPY REFORM, HAPPY CITIZENS

459
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:23,097
I think it's him,

460
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,642
but maybe it isn't him?

461
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,733
Mr. Cho Wooseok,

462
00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:36,986
are you messing with me right now?

463
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,657
You clearly said you could
remember him if you saw a photo of him.

464
00:28:41,616 --> 00:28:43,368
I can if I saw a photo of him.

465
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:46,079
What is this? It's a drawing.

466
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,332
No matter how similar it seems,
it has been too long.

467
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:51,125
That was three years ago.

468
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:53,044
And I was hung upside down at the time.

469
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:00,885
Take a good look at it.

470
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:06,224
Well, how did you end up meeting him?

471
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:09,894
That's right. If you try
to remember how you met him,

472
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:13,731
your memory might become clearer.

473
00:29:13,815 --> 00:29:16,276
Red sun.

474
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,989
I met him when…

475
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:26,744
I don't know how he found out,

476
00:29:27,787 --> 00:29:30,540
but he came to see me
knowing that I needed money.

477
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:32,917
Really? And then what?

478
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:34,460
I fold.

479
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:35,879
I fold.

480
00:29:40,925 --> 00:29:41,968
Hang on.

481
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,349
Gosh.

482
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:49,559
What's wrong with him?

483
00:29:50,393 --> 00:29:51,394
What do you want?

484
00:29:57,942 --> 00:29:58,985
Do it.

485
00:30:02,655 --> 00:30:03,656
Wait.

486
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:06,993
No!

487
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:11,122
Will you do what you're told?

488
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:12,665
I'll do anything.

489
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:15,168
Just give me the job.
Want me to kill someone?

490
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:17,712
No need to kill anyone.

491
00:30:20,673 --> 00:30:21,925
Just say that you did.

492
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,060
That's him.

493
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:35,480
It's this jerk. It's him!

494
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:36,981
-Is it him?
-Yes.

495
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,942
Where was that place?

496
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:41,402
That place? That gambling house was

497
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:44,656
near a farm at Mt. Ulseok, Paju.

498
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:48,826
Near a farm at Mt. Ulseok, Paju.

499
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,539
Okay. Ms. Baek, pack this up. Let's go.

500
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:55,917
Wait. Wait a minute.

501
00:30:57,794 --> 00:31:00,546
If you catch this guy,
I can really get out, right?

502
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,884
Of course.

503
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:13,518
What? There's nothing here.

504
00:31:14,143 --> 00:31:16,729
Is this really a gambling house?
It looks like a warehouse.

505
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:19,524
You're right.
I don't think it's here anymore.

506
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:24,195
Excuse me.

507
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:25,905
Pardon me.

508
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:28,866
Sorry to bother you while you're working,
but did this place used to be…

509
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,127
FIRE BEAR'S CASH AND LABOR

510
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,754
Fire Chicken?

511
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:43,923
-Get fatter, man!
-Yes, sir.

512
00:31:46,968 --> 00:31:48,553
-Fire Chicken.
-Boss.

513
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:50,930
Stop hitting on women. Hello, there.

514
00:31:54,308 --> 00:31:55,977
Why do you keep calling me?

515
00:31:56,894 --> 00:31:57,937
Did you look into it?

516
00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:01,441
I did look into it, but is this
the nature of our relationship?

517
00:32:01,524 --> 00:32:02,567
How is it supposed to be?

518
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,153
-This is the nature of our relationship.
-That's our relationship.

519
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:06,529
-Mm.
-Mm.

520
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,115
You are so good with words.

521
00:32:09,198 --> 00:32:12,910
Yes, wouldn't it be beneficial for you
to know a lawyer that's good with words?

522
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:14,328
-Don't you think?
-Of course.

523
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:17,290
On top of that, it'll be helpful for you
to know a prosecutor too.

524
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:20,043
You must know well
since you're a prosecutor.

525
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:23,046
Even a month is pretty long
for a gambling house to stay open.

526
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:24,297
Get rid of the prejudice

527
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,340
that prosecutors know well
about gambling houses.

528
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:28,301
-I'm not a prosecutor anymore.
-What?

529
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:29,802
-Nothing.
-Mm, nothing.

530
00:32:29,886 --> 00:32:31,971
-What?
-It's nothing. That's that.

531
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:33,973
Where's the gambling house now?

532
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:46,402
-Hmm. Mm.
-Mm.

533
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:49,864
Let's go. Let's get going.

534
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:51,157
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

535
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:54,160
Let's go.

536
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:04,045
I did it.

537
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:06,339
I'm the killer.

538
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:37,578
Hello.

539
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:40,414
If you want to catch the killer…

540
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:41,958
<i>What's up
with your voice?</i>

541
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:45,628
…one must think like the killer.

542
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:47,088
What?

543
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:50,258
I'll call you back tomorrow.
I have to hang up for now.

544
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:52,969
I'm totally cool.

545
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:57,473
All right. First of all, he was caught

546
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:00,143
on that camera.

547
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:02,603
And then, he disappeared.

548
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:07,108
So, if he didn't want to get caught,
what should he do?

549
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:22,165
Come out, jerk!

550
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:27,461
I should've come with Yejin.

551
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,840
Should I go back?

552
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:41,350
Huh?

553
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:47,064
Pause it.

554
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,944
Where did you find this?

555
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:54,572
An endangered species inhabits the area…

556
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,081
…and I discovered a camera
that monitors those animals.

557
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,543
-Seo Minhyeok.
-Awesome.

558
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:14,050
If he went over this mountain…

559
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:15,134
CCTV LOCATION, CRIME SCENE

560
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:18,095
He definitely entered Route 77.

561
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,098
Find all the cars
that went through Route 77

562
00:35:21,182 --> 00:35:22,225
on the day of the incident.

563
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:24,268
And get the CCTV footage too.

564
00:35:24,352 --> 00:35:25,519
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

565
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:27,355
You're pretty good.

566
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:38,783
-Are you sure this is the place?
-Yes, it's here.

567
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,452
-Are you sure it's here?
-Yes, it's here.

568
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:43,287
Let's go then.

569
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:53,673
It's kind of scary.

570
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:54,840
Don't be nervous.

571
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:56,509
It's kind of scary.

572
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:58,427
Stop messing around.

573
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:00,221
-Okay.
-Okay.

574
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:02,014
Guests are here!

575
00:36:08,437 --> 00:36:10,648
<i>Welcome to Neverland.</i>

576
00:36:11,357 --> 00:36:12,942
<i>Hope you all get rich.</i>

577
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,152
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

578
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:22,785
YUT

579
00:36:22,868 --> 00:36:24,161
CASH MARBLE GAME

580
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:31,043
ONE GAME OF GONGGI

581
00:36:33,379 --> 00:36:34,213
It can't be.

582
00:36:34,297 --> 00:36:35,881
What would you like?

583
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:37,383
Soju or beer?

584
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:38,634
Want them mixed together?

585
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:43,389
Here goes the <i>Panchigi </i>game!

586
00:36:43,472 --> 00:36:45,308
It's 50,000 won per chip.

587
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:48,811
If you flip it, the money is yours.
If you don't flip it, it's someone else's.

588
00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:58,654
My goodness. Well…

589
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:01,282
this is a whole other world.

590
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:05,119
Don't be nervous. Act casual.

591
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:06,662
Especially you, Mr. Sa…

592
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,415
Where did he go?

593
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:12,585
What the heck? Where did Mr. Sa go?

594
00:37:13,669 --> 00:37:14,503
Huh?

595
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:18,424
What the heck? What is he doing?

596
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:20,760
Mari, go and get him.

597
00:37:20,843 --> 00:37:22,511
-Me?
-Yes.

598
00:37:27,892 --> 00:37:29,435
-Mr. Sa!
-That looks good.

599
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:30,644
What are you doing?

600
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:32,438
You see, you can make--

601
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:35,107
Don't you see Mr. Cheon's face?

602
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,818
Are you having fun?

603
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:39,612
You're just having fun, aren't you?

604
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,489
I really don't get it.

605
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:44,325
Hang on.

606
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:48,204
I have an idea.
We should try it ourselves.

607
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:50,498
Geez. Did we come here to have fun?

608
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:51,624
That's not what I mean.

609
00:37:51,707 --> 00:37:54,335
If we just walk around,
they'll get suspicious of us.

610
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:57,546
We can act like we're playing games
while we look for him.

611
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,262
-Do you know any of these games?
-I was like a viper

612
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:08,015
in my heyday.

613
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:10,559
Okay.

614
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,815
Ms. Baek. You can just follow me around--

615
00:38:15,898 --> 00:38:17,566
-No.
-What?

616
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,486
Have you heard of the Red Wallet
of Pyeongchang-dong?

617
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,907
Okay. Anyway, in that case…

618
00:38:29,412 --> 00:38:31,747
-Let's go.
-Why do you have so many 1,000 won bills?

619
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:32,873
I raided our piggy bank.

620
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:37,711
This money is very valuable to me,
so if you lose this, you're dead.

621
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:39,839
-Okay.
-All right.

622
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:42,174
Here.

623
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,221
-All right.
-All right.

624
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:52,643
Shooting a movie, are you?

625
00:38:53,644 --> 00:38:54,728
All right!

626
00:38:55,521 --> 00:38:57,606
Use your fifth and sixth senses

627
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,150
to pick a number.

628
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:00,776
They say only the brave wins the beauty.

629
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,362
Actually, only the brave
wins a lot of money.

630
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:05,489
Place your bets.

631
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:07,324
Trust your guts

632
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:09,743
and bet on a number.

633
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:11,537
Decide whether you'll go with ten or six.

634
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,374
Bets are closed.

635
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:18,544
Now, let's see which number
the diving beetle will go to.

636
00:39:18,627 --> 00:39:20,629
Let's find out who'll get lucky.

637
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:23,174
Here goes the water beetle.

638
00:39:23,674 --> 00:39:26,385
Let's see what number it'll go to.

639
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:28,095
-Go!
-All right!

640
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:29,763
That's right!

641
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:32,433
-Yes!
-Number seven.

642
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:35,019
-What a shame.
-Gosh.

643
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:38,272
It's all right.
There's always the next round.

644
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:41,192
Our water beetle is very much alive.

645
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:43,152
-I don't get it.
-I know.

646
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:44,695
Don't be disappointed.

647
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:49,950
Okay. Here goes the water beetle.

648
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:53,954
Flip, flip, flip.

649
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:56,332
Come on! Let's go!

650
00:39:56,582 --> 00:39:59,001
-Yes!
-Here you go.

651
00:40:17,102 --> 00:40:18,354
PANCHIGI

652
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:22,107
Keep your eyes on the prize.

653
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:23,901
-Where is it?
-Show me the card!

654
00:40:26,445 --> 00:40:28,531
Thanks to you, I'm getting rich.

655
00:40:28,614 --> 00:40:30,199
Thank you! I'll make good use of it.

656
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:35,704
Stop.

657
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:43,295
Did you win some?

658
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:45,965
I didn't lose all of it.

659
00:40:46,048 --> 00:40:48,175
I lost all of it.

660
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,594
What? Then, what do we do?

661
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:52,846
We need to count on Mr. Cheon.

662
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,808
Let's start the bet again.

663
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:04,191
-Yes!
-Let's go.

664
00:41:04,775 --> 00:41:06,235
Here goes the water beetle.

665
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:11,115
-Here it goes.
-Go, go.

666
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:12,992
-Here it goes.
-Oh, my.

667
00:41:13,492 --> 00:41:16,579
-Let's go.
-Here it goes.

668
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,335
What's going on?

669
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:25,004
Who's that jerk ruining everything?

670
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:26,880
What are you doing? Go check it out!

671
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:33,512
<i>Who's Cheon Jihun?</i>

672
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,182
<i>He's the best lawyer I know.</i>

673
00:41:44,857 --> 00:41:46,650
Thank you!

674
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,195
-This is awesome!
-Bravo!

675
00:41:53,824 --> 00:41:55,200
Can you come with us, please?

676
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:56,243
Who are you?

677
00:41:57,745 --> 00:41:59,622
-He's asking who you are.
-Come with us.

678
00:42:00,247 --> 00:42:01,081
See you.

679
00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:03,626
Okay.

680
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:04,960
You should come too.

681
00:42:05,544 --> 00:42:07,338
Wait. The water beetle…

682
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:09,256
-Oh, my goodness.
-What's going on?

683
00:42:11,258 --> 00:42:14,553
Hang on a second. She's with us too.

684
00:42:14,637 --> 00:42:17,723
That woman with the lollipop.
The one with the yellow lollipop.

685
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,478
I'll go myself.

686
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,994
Can't you please leave?

687
00:42:40,496 --> 00:42:41,330
Look.

688
00:42:42,623 --> 00:42:43,957
-Hey.
-This is good.

689
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:47,961
Where did you use to play?

690
00:42:48,045 --> 00:42:49,880
Can't you just leave?

691
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,256
I don't want to.

692
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,510
I just came here to play games.
Why should I leave?

693
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:01,600
There's a traitor among you guys.

694
00:43:01,684 --> 00:43:03,477
Listen, young man.

695
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:05,396
Show some respect.

696
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:09,191
We're just here to play some games.

697
00:43:11,777 --> 00:43:12,820
Are you guys hustlers?

698
00:43:13,987 --> 00:43:16,448
These guys are hustlers.

699
00:43:17,032 --> 00:43:20,327
I don't know where you guys
used to hustle, but…

700
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:21,787
Hey, bring that over.

701
00:43:22,454 --> 00:43:24,164
Here, take this

702
00:43:25,207 --> 00:43:27,167
and go gamble somewhere else.

703
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:29,503
I beg of you.

704
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:35,801
How dare you throw some petty cash at us?

705
00:43:36,176 --> 00:43:38,512
Use this for your own ambition.

706
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:41,974
Instead,

707
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,853
if you find someone for me,

708
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:49,982
I think I can call it even.

709
00:43:50,482 --> 00:43:51,358
Hmm.

710
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,945
Do you remember this person?

711
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:58,282
I'm thinking.

712
00:43:58,365 --> 00:43:59,825
You've been thinking.

713
00:43:59,908 --> 00:44:01,535
A man came by and said that

714
00:44:01,618 --> 00:44:04,455
he'd pay off a gambling debt
three years ago.

715
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:05,914
That man is this man.

716
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:08,041
Oh, I remember.

717
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:09,126
You do?

718
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:11,253
That guy is this guy.

719
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:12,921
That guy is this guy.

720
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:15,048
This guy I've never seen before comes in,

721
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:17,801
pays off the 500-million-won debt,
and takes him away.

722
00:44:17,885 --> 00:44:19,261
Where is he now?

723
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,765
I don't know.
That day was the first time I saw him.

724
00:44:22,848 --> 00:44:24,600
How did he find you guys here then?

725
00:44:24,683 --> 00:44:28,061
I just answered a phone call
asking about guys with debts.

726
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:30,773
He said he'd pay off their debts,
so why would I refuse that?

727
00:44:30,856 --> 00:44:32,024
You got a phone call?

728
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:34,067
-Yes.
-From who?

729
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:40,824
Should I keep playing here?

730
00:44:41,784 --> 00:44:45,162
I can even hear
the water beetle breathe today.

731
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,001
Gosh.

732
00:44:51,877 --> 00:44:54,588
Mr. Sa, do I appear

733
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:56,840
to fit in that whole scene?

734
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,428
When you wear your sunglasses
and have a grimace,

735
00:45:02,763 --> 00:45:04,556
you look like a hustler.

736
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:10,938
That guy was huge, but he was so scared.

737
00:45:11,313 --> 00:45:13,440
I got so nervous
that my legs kept shaking.

738
00:45:13,816 --> 00:45:16,360
Come on. Stop with the hustling act.

739
00:45:17,486 --> 00:45:20,864
Anyway, he said we could meet him
if we go over here, right?

740
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:22,407
Yes, that's right.

741
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:24,910
How long will it take?

742
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:27,287
-About ten minutes.
-Let's go.

743
00:45:27,955 --> 00:45:28,956
I'm getting nervous.

744
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:31,333
Don't be nervous. Act casual.

745
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:36,463
It was you?

746
00:45:39,174 --> 00:45:41,218
-So it was you?
-What are you talking about?

747
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:43,095
You couldn't find the gambling spot?

748
00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:45,430
Hmm, was it you who called to ask about

749
00:45:46,348 --> 00:45:48,767
anyone who had a gambling debt
three years ago?

750
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:54,815
Oh, that place? Why do you ask?

751
00:45:55,274 --> 00:45:56,859
Get over here.

752
00:45:56,942 --> 00:45:59,695
Do you have a death wish? Do you?

753
00:46:00,863 --> 00:46:03,156
Let go of me. Do you have a death wish?

754
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:07,035
Who is this guy?

755
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,123
I heard you were asking about anyone
who had a huge gambling debt.

756
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,625
The person that requested that.

757
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:16,503
-Ah.
-Do you know him or not?

758
00:46:17,629 --> 00:46:18,964
I don't know what he looks like.

759
00:46:19,214 --> 00:46:21,550
There's no good in knowing
about the dirty details.

760
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:25,262
Fire Bear, this is very important to me.

761
00:46:28,849 --> 00:46:30,142
He contacted me not too long ago.

762
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:33,729
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

763
00:46:40,944 --> 00:46:43,030
He contacted you? What for?

764
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,416
<i>He wanted me to interfere with some guy.</i>

765
00:46:56,752 --> 00:46:59,755
PERSONAL DETAILS
NAME: KIM SUNGWOOK

766
00:47:00,213 --> 00:47:01,840
Interfere? How?

767
00:47:02,507 --> 00:47:03,926
This man had an event to attend,

768
00:47:04,468 --> 00:47:06,720
so he wanted me to prevent him
from getting there.

769
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:08,639
So?

770
00:47:09,014 --> 00:47:10,599
Stay sharp and listen carefully.

771
00:47:10,682 --> 00:47:12,059
This is an important mission.

772
00:47:12,142 --> 00:47:14,227
Who's our target? Kim Sungwook.

773
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:15,562
This is Kim Sungwook's car.

774
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:17,481
-This guy is going to…
<i>-We planned to cause</i>

775
00:47:17,564 --> 00:47:20,067
<i>a car accident on his way to the event
to delay his arrival.</i>

776
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,151
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

777
00:47:21,234 --> 00:47:23,987
<i>We had even chosen the guys
that would participate.</i>

778
00:47:24,071 --> 00:47:25,656
<i>But then, he called me all of a sudden.</i>

779
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:27,157
Yes, this is Fire Bear.

780
00:47:27,407 --> 00:47:29,284
As a matter of fact,
we set everything up--

781
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:30,494
<i>He told me to call it off.</i>

782
00:47:30,744 --> 00:47:31,828
What?

783
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:34,831
He told you to call it off? After that?

784
00:47:34,915 --> 00:47:36,166
That was it.

785
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:38,794
Ah.

786
00:47:38,877 --> 00:47:40,504
There was something strange, though.

787
00:47:42,547 --> 00:47:45,968
<i>Believed to be in hiding,
CEO Kim Sungwook of Cayman Fund was…</i>

788
00:47:46,051 --> 00:47:48,345
<i>I was watching the news a few days later</i>

789
00:47:48,595 --> 00:47:50,597
<i>and saw a very familiar face.</i>

790
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:52,641
-It's him.
-He's dead?

791
00:47:56,103 --> 00:47:57,062
Something's up, right?

792
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:00,148
Where was that event?

793
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:01,942
One moment.

794
00:48:02,526 --> 00:48:04,152
Where did I put that?

795
00:48:05,779 --> 00:48:06,863
Here it is.

796
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:12,411
I got it when he made the request.

797
00:48:16,498 --> 00:48:18,959
PLEASE ATTEND
THE JQ GROUP VIP PRIVATE PARTY

798
00:48:25,173 --> 00:48:26,258
We found it.

799
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:28,468
You were right.

800
00:48:28,969 --> 00:48:30,345
It's an unregistered car.

801
00:48:31,596 --> 00:48:32,639
Put out a search.

802
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:33,974
-Yes, sir!
-Then--

803
00:48:34,057 --> 00:48:36,393
By the way, it'll be okay, right?

804
00:48:36,476 --> 00:48:38,353
-What do you mean?
-Well,

805
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:39,938
Chief will throw a fit.

806
00:48:40,605 --> 00:48:41,898
That's why we're doing it.

807
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:43,525
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

808
00:48:44,526 --> 00:48:45,819
A long time ago,

809
00:48:46,862 --> 00:48:49,031
I asked Jihun,

810
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,783
"How do you have such good results?"

811
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:53,285
What did he say?

812
00:48:53,535 --> 00:48:54,703
Jihun said,

813
00:48:55,162 --> 00:49:00,751
"I do at least half of the things
the higher-ups tell us not to do."

814
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:07,007
How many years has it been for us?

815
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,216
It has been seven years, sir.

816
00:49:09,092 --> 00:49:10,844
Thank you for handing over
Cayman Fund to me.

817
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:12,554
Well done.

818
00:49:12,804 --> 00:49:13,930
But, you know…

819
00:49:14,765 --> 00:49:15,932
Kim Sungwook

820
00:49:17,142 --> 00:49:19,061
-wasn't your doing, was it?
-Pardon?

821
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:21,396
He betrayed us at the right time

822
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,732
and died at the right time.
It seemed bizarre.

823
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:27,235
Thanks to that,
the rat that scurried underground

824
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:28,653
got to see the light of day.

825
00:49:29,946 --> 00:49:31,156
Don't sweat it.

826
00:49:32,115 --> 00:49:35,410
I don't care about my dogs
fighting for alpha status.

827
00:49:35,744 --> 00:49:36,870
Thank you.

828
00:49:37,287 --> 00:49:39,539
Do a good job of running the Cayman Fund.

829
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:41,708
Behave, so that
there's no fault found in you.

830
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,043
Yes, sir.

831
00:49:43,126 --> 00:49:44,127
Ah.

832
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:45,587
By the way,

833
00:49:46,671 --> 00:49:49,674
if the owner happens to get hurt
while the dogs fight,

834
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,553
what do you think will happen?

835
00:49:55,472 --> 00:49:56,598
You're sweating again.

836
00:49:57,808 --> 00:49:59,017
I'm just kidding.

837
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:01,019
-I'll be sure to remember that, sir.
-Okay.

838
00:50:35,512 --> 00:50:37,430
Investigator,

839
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:40,433
can you pull up a list of cars
similar to plate number 9510?

840
00:50:40,934 --> 00:50:41,893
Yes, ma'am.

841
00:50:42,477 --> 00:50:44,604
Hey, it's 3532.

842
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:46,064
No.

843
00:50:46,565 --> 00:50:49,818
{\an8}36D 9510

844
00:50:50,402 --> 00:50:51,319
Yejin.

845
00:50:56,032 --> 00:50:57,701
-Isn't it this one?
-Yes.

846
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:15,677
My goodness.

847
00:51:16,052 --> 00:51:17,095
It's so cramped in here.

848
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:21,641
That car has been parked there

849
00:51:21,725 --> 00:51:23,560
-for three days.
-Okay.

850
00:51:23,935 --> 00:51:26,563
I got this from the manager of the CCTV.

851
00:51:27,355 --> 00:51:30,483
They didn't service the camera well,
so the resolution is a mess.

852
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:34,154
Can you recognize anything?

853
00:51:35,155 --> 00:51:37,991
I'm sure he'll show up. Let's just wait.

854
00:51:48,418 --> 00:51:49,586
It's so stifling in here.

855
00:51:50,837 --> 00:51:55,550
How do detectives do this
for a week or even two weeks?

856
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:58,053
I know. It isn't easy to catch a criminal.

857
00:52:06,978 --> 00:52:08,396
Are you kidding me?

858
00:52:08,855 --> 00:52:10,857
Why would you put your lips on my straw?

859
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:13,818
My blood is clean.

860
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:19,282
Don't touch mine. Drink yours.

861
00:52:23,036 --> 00:52:24,079
Mm.

862
00:52:25,205 --> 00:52:26,498
You're so petty.

863
00:52:27,624 --> 00:52:29,334
Where are you going?

864
00:52:29,584 --> 00:52:31,044
I'm going to get a drink.

865
00:52:52,315 --> 00:52:54,317
355R 2653

866
00:52:54,442 --> 00:52:56,236
Why isn't he answering?

867
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:25,682
Geez. Stop messing with me.

868
00:53:25,765 --> 00:53:27,684
What are you doing during a stakeout?

869
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:31,104
Minhyeok, run this license plate number.
It's 355R 2653.

870
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:39,863
Yejin, it's an unregistered car.
Where are you right now?

871
00:53:39,946 --> 00:53:41,990
I'm following what seems to be
our suspect's car.

872
00:54:13,938 --> 00:54:15,565
My gosh.

873
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,026
What do we do about this car, sir?

874
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:23,198
I'm sorry.
I was in a rush following that guy.

875
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:25,784
We can just fix the car!

876
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:27,869
What if something happened to you?

877
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:29,746
Ms. Na!

878
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:31,873
Excuse me.

879
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,584
I think we got something.

880
00:54:43,468 --> 00:54:46,262
So you think it's very likely
that he'll show up to this event?

881
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:50,016
Yes, that's right. Memorize his face well.

882
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,561
I'm going to get that scumbag.

883
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:55,063
He probably didn't do it on his own.

884
00:54:55,313 --> 00:54:57,899
If he could hide his identity
by getting someone to take the fall,

885
00:54:57,982 --> 00:54:59,484
someone's definitely behind him.

886
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:04,239
It means that person might have
something to do with JQ.

887
00:55:04,322 --> 00:55:05,407
That's right.

888
00:55:05,615 --> 00:55:09,786
But, if it's a party for VIPs,
it's probably very fancy.

889
00:55:10,078 --> 00:55:13,248
Shouldn't we dress up for it too?

890
00:55:13,581 --> 00:55:14,999
-Mr. Cheon.
-Yes?

891
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:17,001
Can you lend me some clothes?

892
00:55:17,085 --> 00:55:18,586
-Clothes?
-Yes.

893
00:55:18,878 --> 00:55:20,588
Shall I take these off? Want to see…

894
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:23,675
It won't fit you, Mr. Sa.

895
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:28,346
Don't go overboard.
Let's just go as ourselves.

896
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,431
Just be natural.

897
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:30,807
He's right.

898
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,226
If we did a sloppy job
of dressing up, it'll be more obvious.

899
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:35,353
Let's go as ourselves and take it easy.

900
00:55:35,437 --> 00:55:37,105
Let's not take it easy.

901
00:55:39,107 --> 00:55:40,525
Be natural.

902
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:43,153
Be natural.

903
00:55:44,028 --> 00:55:44,904
Mm.

904
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:48,575
Be natural.

905
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:51,578
Can't you be more natural, please?

906
00:55:51,661 --> 00:55:52,537
Geez.

907
00:56:00,336 --> 00:56:02,338
JEIL LAUNDRY

908
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,801
This isn't the employee entrance.
It's the guest entrance.

909
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:07,927
You have to go around.

910
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:11,723
Pardon me. I apologize.

911
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,510
Let's go.

912
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,251
This man. This is the man we have to find.

913
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:23,253
-Yes.
-Okay.

914
00:57:23,336 --> 00:57:24,504
Let's go.

915
00:57:25,797 --> 00:57:26,798
Oh, my. Mari!

916
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,759
Mom?

917
00:57:29,842 --> 00:57:31,719
My goodness, girl.

918
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:34,722
You should've told me
if you were going to come.

919
00:57:34,806 --> 00:57:35,890
Mom.

920
00:57:35,974 --> 00:57:37,183
What?

921
00:57:43,314 --> 00:57:44,607
Are you Mari's mother?

922
00:57:45,817 --> 00:57:46,901
Hello.

923
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:50,446
Yes, hello.

924
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:52,240
I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.

925
00:57:53,783 --> 00:57:57,495
I was wondering who Mari took after
to be this beautiful. She took after you.

926
00:58:00,748 --> 00:58:02,917
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

927
00:58:03,334 --> 00:58:05,628
Hello. I'm Sa Mujang.

928
00:58:07,505 --> 00:58:12,010
You took after Mari,
so you look very beautiful as well.

929
00:58:15,722 --> 00:58:17,473
Well, we must get going.

930
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:20,560
The two of you can continue talking.
Take care.

931
00:58:21,144 --> 00:58:22,437
Okay.

932
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:24,480
Enjoy your conversation, Mari.

933
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:29,652
Okay. What's with him?

934
00:58:30,903 --> 00:58:33,239
Gosh, you brat.

935
00:58:33,323 --> 00:58:35,450
You said it was a crappy office,

936
00:58:35,533 --> 00:58:38,244
but now I understand why
you're a probationary employee there.

937
00:58:38,578 --> 00:58:39,495
Hmm.

938
00:58:40,163 --> 00:58:42,749
He's so handsome.

939
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:46,586
What are you talking about?
Anyway, why are you here?

940
00:58:46,669 --> 00:58:47,962
What do you mean?

941
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:50,340
Is there a place in Korea that I can't go?

942
00:58:50,423 --> 00:58:52,425
It's not that, but--

943
00:58:52,508 --> 00:58:56,095
My goodness. My daughter
is looking so beautiful.

944
00:58:57,221 --> 00:59:00,266
This worked out.
There's a man you must meet today.

945
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,893
-Let's go.
-Who is it?

946
00:59:01,976 --> 00:59:03,186
-Come on. Let's go.
-But…

947
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:16,449
Who knew there was a place like this?

948
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,078
Don't get so excited. Let's look around.

949
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:22,330
I'll check this side.

950
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:30,296
Excuse me.

951
00:59:30,588 --> 00:59:31,714
Thank you so much.

952
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:35,426
Darn it.

953
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,447
-You think you can recognize him?
-I'll have to try.

954
00:59:56,531 --> 00:59:57,365
Let's split up.

955
00:59:57,865 --> 00:59:59,450
You go this way and I'll go that way.

956
01:00:00,576 --> 01:00:01,953
Yes, Ms. Cobra.

957
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:16,676
Hello.

958
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:20,596
-I'd like to ask you something.
-Okay.

959
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,683
Have you seen this man today?

960
01:00:24,183 --> 01:00:25,143
I'm not sure.

961
01:00:25,226 --> 01:00:27,353
May I have a list of the attendees, then?

962
01:00:27,437 --> 01:00:31,023
I can only get that info
by speaking to my boss.

963
01:00:52,378 --> 01:00:54,922
Isn't that Mari?
Who's that guy next to him?

964
01:00:55,339 --> 01:00:58,134
Who the heck does he think he is
to be with my Mari?

965
01:00:58,593 --> 01:01:00,386
He's the second son
of the Taesan Group.

966
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,138
Taesan? That Taesan?

967
01:01:02,597 --> 01:01:04,724
What is she doing
with that guy who has everything--

968
01:01:07,018 --> 01:01:08,561
Oh, my. Hello, Mother.

969
01:01:09,312 --> 01:01:12,190
Mother? Why am I your mother?

970
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:16,027
Ah… Since you're Mari's mother,

971
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:17,612
you're Mother to me too.

972
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,863
Fine. Whatever.

973
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:22,074
Did you just say "My Mari?"

974
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:23,242
Did I?

975
01:01:25,453 --> 01:01:28,706
I did. I did call my Mari, my Mari.

976
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:31,876
It's not like I can call her
someone else's Mari.

977
01:01:31,959 --> 01:01:33,127
My goodness.

978
01:01:35,046 --> 01:01:38,382
Don't the two of them look
so good together?

979
01:01:40,551 --> 01:01:43,262
No, they don't.
Your dress looks better on you.

980
01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:44,764
Oh, my. Really?

981
01:01:44,847 --> 01:01:46,307
-Yes.
-My goodness.

982
01:01:51,729 --> 01:01:54,315
Mari, what are your hobbies?

983
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:56,234
Pardon?

984
01:01:56,943 --> 01:01:58,027
Your hobby.

985
01:01:58,861 --> 01:02:00,780
Oh, my hobby.

986
01:02:02,323 --> 01:02:04,617
-I like to draw.
-Drawing?

987
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,746
Would you like to see my work?

988
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:10,289
Yes.

989
01:02:17,547 --> 01:02:19,674
-You drew it well.
-Right?

990
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:21,592
-You know--
-What is it?

991
01:02:22,176 --> 01:02:24,220
Did someone come to your mind?

992
01:02:25,096 --> 01:02:26,931
No. Who is this person?

993
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:30,518
What the heck? Never mind.

994
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:32,186
Did I offend you?

995
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,438
-No, not at all.
-Okay.

996
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:39,402
All right, then. I had a good time today.

997
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:41,237
Wait a minute.

998
01:02:41,737 --> 01:02:43,072
Are you leaving like this?

999
01:02:43,781 --> 01:02:44,615
Yes.

1000
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:46,784
I'm a Taesan.

1001
01:02:47,994 --> 01:02:49,203
So what?

1002
01:02:52,498 --> 01:02:54,834
Then, enjoy your time here, Mr. Taesan.

1003
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,182
<i>Why do you want to leave
Law Firm Baek?</i>

1004
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:36,644
I loathed having to defend Choi Kitae.

1005
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,897
Can you meet me right now?

1006
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:42,858
<i>No, I'll go see you
at the prosecutors' office.</i>

1007
01:06:14,825 --> 01:06:16,160
It's so pretty.

1008
01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:19,121
Oh, my goodness.

1009
01:06:21,457 --> 01:06:22,792
<i>Juyeong.</i>

1010
01:06:23,084 --> 01:06:24,251
<i>Jihun…</i>

1011
01:06:26,337 --> 01:06:27,463
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1012
01:07:44,665 --> 01:07:47,710
{\an8}-<i>There's a rumor that Cayman Fund
is a slush fund laundering company.</i>

1013
01:07:47,793 --> 01:07:49,420
{\an8}I'm the CEO of Cayman Fund, Cha Minchul.

1014
01:07:49,712 --> 01:07:50,796
{\an8}I look forward to your work.

1015
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,591
{\an8}-<i>What if the person
that you respect the most</i>

1016
01:07:53,674 --> 01:07:55,926
{\an8}does something that you despise the most?

1017
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:56,969
{\an8}How would you feel?

1018
01:07:57,052 --> 01:07:58,137
{\an8}-<i>To be honest, if it were me…</i>

1019
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,347
{\an8}Mari, the sun was very bright.

1020
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:02,558
{\an8}-<i>Wear this when you go out.</i>
Who are you?

1021
01:08:02,641 --> 01:08:04,935
{\an8}-<i>I'll make you feel
that exact same pain.</i>

1022
01:08:07,062 --> 01:08:09,315
{\an8}<i>Is this the knife you used
to kill Juyeong?</i>
