EPISODE 4

12
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,547
Ms. Baek, are you all right?

13
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,098
Ms. Baek, are you okay?

14
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,926
She's totally drunk.

15
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:38,894
-Yes.
-That's right!

16
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,313
Let's go for another round!

17
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,104
-Hello.
-Ms. Baek.

18
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,614
Let's go…

19
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,521
Where's our second round?

20
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,937
Since that was our fourth round,
we should go for our second!

21
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,901
-Oh, my.
-Oh, boy.

22
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,082
What are you looking at?

23
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,329
Gosh, she really drinks a lot.

24
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,504
-Mr. Cheon.
-Yes?

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,620
-Take good care of her.
-Take good care of whom?

26
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,093
Jun is asking for me.

27
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,708
Stop lying, Mr. Sa.

28
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,125
The moon is glowing so beautifully.

29
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,678
Ah…

30
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,641
The moon is pretty, isn't it?

31
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,272
Twinkle, twinkle…

32
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,154
Mari?

33
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,809
Mari?

34
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,152
Ms. Baek, please wake up.

35
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,942
Ms. Baek, please wake up.

36
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,108
Hey. Where do you live?

37
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,367
Where's her address?

38
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,666
Here it is.

39
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,462
Why didn't she write her address?

40
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,967
Geez, she is sleeping so well.

41
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,131
Look here. If you close your eyes,
it won't recognize your face.

42
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,676
Open your eyes. Go like this.

43
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,089
Look over here.

44
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,557
I have to know where you live
or at least your phone number.

45
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,267
Hey, look over here.

46
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,440
You have to go home.
Give me your home address.

47
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,399
I have to contact--

48
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,784
Whatever. Who cares?

49
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,371
Why do I remember all of it?

50
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,421
MOM

51
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,551
MOM

52
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,312
Ms. Baek…

53
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,443
Yes?

54
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,772
Please open your eyes.

55
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,687
You have to open both of them to go home.

56
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,783
What's up?

57
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,196
What?

58
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,957
DIVORCE, LAWSUIT INHERITANCE, LITIGATION

59
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,791
Mari!

60
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:54,521
My goodness.
My daughter's face is finally glowing.

61
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,568
How did you think of
bringing a makeup trailer?

62
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,647
You're the only mom in the world
who would do this.

63
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,526
You have to care of your skin
every day from now on.

64
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,037
Mari, do you have to work here?

65
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,714
I don't think it's the type of place
you should work.

66
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,962
Do you want me to call your grandfather?

67
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,304
No way. It's only for two months.
I'll be fine.

68
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,088
Does the lawyer treat you well?

69
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,259
He isn't too bossy, is he?

70
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,965
Are you sure he's normal?

71
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,135
Mom, please stop.

72
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,770
Is he handsome?

73
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,935
Mr. Cheon. Mr. Cheon.

74
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,227
He's in deep sleep.

75
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,565
I borrowed Vol. 16
of <i>Boy Detective Jaemin</i>.

76
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,281
Open your eyes and go home!
Open your eyes and go home.

77
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,452
Did you have a nightmare?

78
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,157
Ta-da!

79
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,121
I borrowed Vol. 16
of <i>Boy Detective Jaemin</i>.

80
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,002
Is it out already?

81
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,210
I had a hard time trying to borrow this.

82
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,714
-Gosh. I think I had a nightmare.
-Really?

83
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,256
ROOM 201 YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE

84
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,169
I didn't sleep well
because I was so curious.

85
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,798
Who do you think committed the crime?

86
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,049
-The culprit?
-Yes.

87
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,808
Didn't he do it?

88
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,139
No, he had no reason to kill him.

89
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,562
I'm sure he did.

90
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,863
Mr. Sa, in detective stories,
the ones who seem like the villain

91
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,483
are not the ones who did it.

92
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,030
Aah…

93
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,070
Good morning.

94
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,114
Hello.

95
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,065
Hi, Mari.
Did you get home okay last night?

96
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,156
Of course.

97
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,075
No, she didn't.
She fell asleep here last--

98
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,459
What are you talking about?

99
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,792
I tried to wake you up,
but you didn't budge.

100
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,258
I waited until the taxi came
and just left.

101
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,468
I can't sleep anywhere else
but in my own bed.

102
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,299
Mr. Cheon wouldn't even know
if you carried him away in his sleep.

103
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,097
Aah.

104
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,224
This is unbelievable.

105
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,225
Let's say you're right.

106
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,146
Ah!

107
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,225
What is it?

108
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,896
Gosh, I almost saw a spoiler.

109
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,944
Spoiler? Did you see who did it?

110
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,318
Fortunately, I didn't.

111
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,445
Mr. Sa, can you check for me?

112
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,583
No, I'll read it later.

113
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,830
You couldn't guess who did it anyway.
Check it out for me.

114
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,004
No way. I'm going to read it later.

115
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,172
Darn it. Who the heck did it?
They did this last time as well.

116
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,422
What is it?

117
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,799
THE VILLAIN

118
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,302
-Are you talking about this?
-Come on.

119
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,094
Ms. Baek. You really have to be careful.

120
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,848
If you ruin it for me, you're done here.

121
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,346
Stop.

122
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,103
I'll fix it for you.

123
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,846
This isn't such a big deal.

124
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,108
You're going to fix it for us? How?

125
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,070
Grant me a wish?

126
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,609
Fine. Think of whatever wish you'd like.

127
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,994
Okay.

128
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,411
BOY DETECTIVE JAEMIN

129
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
There. Take a look.
It's all taken care of.

130
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,011
Okay.

131
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,176
Hmm?

132
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,102
What the heck? Did you fix it like this?

133
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,141
THE VILLAIN, THE VILLAIN, THE VILLAIN

134
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,188
Now, that's one way to fix it.

135
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,771
How did you come up with that?

136
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,327
Well, all right.

137
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,829
Well done, Ms. Baek.
I admit that you did a good job.

138
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,461
You'd better keep your promise
about my wish.

139
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,749
Of course. I'll keep my promise.

140
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,792
I can't believe she fixed it like this.

141
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,467
Gosh, how did she think
of fixing it like this?

142
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,014
By the way, do you remember
the files I asked you to organize?

143
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,465
Bring it to my desk later.

144
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,721
Ah…

145
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,271
Was that due today?

146
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,482
Yes.

147
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,363
Why?

148
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,105
You didn't do it?

149
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,661
No, not yet.

150
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,819
What did you say?

151
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,783
-I haven't done it yet.
-What?

152
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,155
I haven't done it.

153
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,833
I see. You didn't do it.

154
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,797
Mari, you shouldn't be
fixing things like this.

155
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,682
You should be doing your work.

156
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,969
Come to your senses.

157
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,350
Excuse me.

158
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,606
How can I help you?

159
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,034
What can we do for you?

160
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,323
I hope you can take this case.

161
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,117
There aren't any lawyers available.

162
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,621
There aren't any lawyers available?

163
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,037
Why aren't there any lawyers?
There are over 30,000.

164
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,422
Why aren't there any lawyers?
There are over 30,000.

165
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,001
It's a murder case.

166
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,394
I'm sorry… We don't take
on violent crimes like murder.

167
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,430
I swear he didn't do it.

168
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,354
I'm sorry, but it's our office policy.

169
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,653
He said he was sure
you would help him out.

170
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,308
That I'd help him out?
Is it someone I know?

171
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,028
He said that I'd help him?

172
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,071
Please read through this.
My brother is waiting for you.

173
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,674
Why look at it
when we aren't taking it on?

174
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,587
We promised not to do anything scary.

175
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,800
Mr. Cheon is a scaredy-cat.

176
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,102
I'll just see what kind of case it is.

177
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,893
Mr. Cheon, aren't you curious?

178
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,477
It seems like someone you know.

179
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,152
I am curious. Yes.

180
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,400
Then, how about this? Let's vote on it.

181
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,823
Vote?

182
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,030
Since when did we vote on things?

183
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,161
Since there are three of us,
why don't we vote on it?

184
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,198
Okay. Since I work here too,
let's take a vote.

185
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,283
Very good.

186
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,867
Okay. We'll take a look at the case file,
yes or no?

187
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,083
One, two, three.

188
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,472
I'll look at it first.

189
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,476
I didn't see anything.

190
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,019
What's wrong? You were dying
to find out only a moment ago.

191
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,649
Then, let me take a look…

192
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,240
I didn't see anything either.

193
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,286
Oh.

194
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,461
Isn't it that case?
The one that happened up there.

195
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,875
It is. Thanks to this case,

196
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,764
the whole country knows
of our neighborhood, Pungjin-dong.

197
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,101
A FORTNIGHT AGO

198
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,515
YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE

199
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,751
Hey, where did the knife go?

200
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,611
POLICE

201
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,590
Any words to your late mother?

202
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,420
You claimed that the murderer
is your missing father, is that true?

203
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,966
-Didn't they get along?
-A comment, please!

204
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,259
Give us a statement!

205
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,059
Please move out of the way!

206
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,349
A word, please!

207
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,808
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

208
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,354
<i>He killed his parent.</i>

209
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,307
I'm against it. No.

210
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,607
I'm against it too.

211
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,897
He didn't go to trial,
but isn't it already a done deal?

212
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,695
He's clearly the murderer.

213
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,490
Look, Mr. Cheon.

214
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,333
You aren't considering
taking this case, are you?

215
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,212
Look at this.

216
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,876
"The devil of the ages."

217
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,959
Even the title is horrifying.

218
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,205
"The murder of an artist couple.

219
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,127
All of the lawyers withdraw." Okay.

220
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,261
Let me see.

221
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,724
Look.

222
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,218
"When the public criticized them
for being the devil's lawyer,

223
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,388
Law Firm Baek who were representing him
decided to withdraw…"

224
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,019
LAW FIRM BAEK

225
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,725
-Baek?
-Yes, Baek.

226
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,145
If a huge law firm like that
would withdraw from it,

227
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,694
why would we take it on?

228
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:50,615
This case doesn't go
with the characteristics of our office.

229
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,486
I think so too.

230
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:53,947
We're indebted to him.

231
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,616
-Indebted to him?
-Yes, we are.

232
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,455
Don't you remember him, Mr. Sa?

233
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,630
What?

234
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,194
It's perfect.

235
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,956
-Wow.
-Hang on, Mr. Sa.

236
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,753
Let me appreciate it for a moment.

237
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:49,167
Who knew you had such a talent?

238
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,888
It's alive. It's as if it's moving.

239
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,429
It's running through a meadow.

240
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,972
Isn't it a cow?

241
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,728
It was me. I'm just going to erase it.

242
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,725
It was a self-portrait.

243
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,784
I can see the agony.

244
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,913
Want me to do it for cheap?

245
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Pardon?

246
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,794
Ms. Cho, how's your heart?
Prepare your heart for this.

247
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,884
Ta-da!

248
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,339
How is it? Isn't it nice?

249
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,128
You do have something you're good at.

250
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,005
For a month's rent,
I did this work for cheap.

251
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,432
But I was thinking about this mural…

252
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,732
If we drew this mural
all the way up to the top,

253
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,398
the painting would look very majestic and…

254
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,149
-Spectacular!
-Spectacular, don't you think?

255
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:51,284
Should we cut a deal for six months' rent?

256
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,414
No way!

257
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,488
Unbelievable.

258
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,985
My goodness. Geez!

259
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,504
The whole neighborhood
looks totally different.

260
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,409
It looks so warm and friendly.

261
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,748
-It's so nice!
-So, nice!

262
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,213
You're a lawyer, aren't you?

263
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:13,223
Yes, I am. I am… a lawyer.

264
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,546
I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.

265
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,353
I don't know how I can thank you.

266
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,970
You don't have to thank me.

267
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,314
If I need your help later on,
just help me out.

268
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,728
I can't believe someone who drew
something like this

269
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,976
could do something like that.

270
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:34,322
Now that I know what he's like,
even this picture gives me the creeps.

271
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,834
No, he didn't seem like that at all.

272
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,039
Didn't we say that we'd help him?

273
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,250
I'm sure it was just in passing.

274
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,830
Even if it was just in passing,
it's still a verbal promise.

275
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,549
You didn't give him an answer, though.

276
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,469
He did ask you to help him out,

277
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,759
but you didn't say that you'd help him.

278
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,393
Come to think of it, I don't think--

279
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,720
You didn't give him an answer.

280
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,021
-Let's just go grab a bite. Come on.
-Yes, let's go grab a bite.

281
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,644
I didn't answer, did I?

282
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,226
Mr. Cheon, you said you didn't
give him an answer,

283
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,027
so why are you looking at that again?

284
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,106
Didn't you say we should go eat?
Aren't we going to go eat?

285
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,317
Mr. Cheon.

286
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,737
Mr. Sa.

287
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,701
Why did Kim Minjae want me
to represent him?

288
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,407
Don't you think it's rather strange?

289
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,867
Why is that strange?

290
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,917
I guess you were the only lawyer he knew.

291
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,591
-Don't you think so, Ms. Baek?
-Exactly.

292
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,130
He doesn't know anyone else.

293
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,634
If Law Firm Baek refused to represent him,
shouldn't he go to another big law firm?

294
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,255
Don't you think so, Ms. Baek?

295
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,047
Oh.

296
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,348
That's true.

297
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,601
That is kind of strange.

298
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,560
If he comes from a famous artist family,
he must be rich.

299
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,944
Shouldn't he look for
another famous lawyer?

300
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,362
He has been wrongfully charged
with murder.

301
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,033
So, why did he ask for you?

302
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,951
Exactly. Ms. Baek, you are so sharp!

303
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,781
How are you so smart? Hmm.

304
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,162
All right. That's why
we should go see him.

305
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,504
What? Who?

306
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,419
Kim Minjae.

307
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,168
What? Why?

308
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,710
We have to meet him

309
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,046
to ask him why he wants me
to represent him.

310
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,297
Mari, can you drive?

311
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,512
You have a nice car.

312
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,471
Let's head over there.

313
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,270
Darn it.

314
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,283
PROSECUTORS FOR THE PEOPLE,
TRUSTWORTHY PROSECUTORS, FAIR PROSECUTORS

315
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,109
Gosh, this smell.

316
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,372
It hasn't changed at all.

317
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,119
Have you heard of the Pungjin-dong case?
The son murdered his parents.

318
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,462
That case is giving me a headache.

319
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,708
Yes, I heard about it.

320
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,170
Was it already handed over to us?

321
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,291
The higher-ups are very interested
in this case,

322
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,668
so I was told to do a good job.

323
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,384
The higher-ups are interested?

324
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,724
It'd be weird if they weren't.
The news is all over it.

325
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,894
-Want to take this opportunity to join us?
-What? Me?

326
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,102
If you join us,
it'll make things much easier for me.

327
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,060
Why not? You can get
some of the spotlights too.

328
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,522
Spotlight?

329
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:19,395
From now, the investigation
of the Pungjin-dong case…

330
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,489
The Pungjin-dong case…

331
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,953
The Pungjin-dong case--

332
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,038
The result of the investigation…

333
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,418
The Pungjin-dong case…

334
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,550
Wait! Who is behind all this?

335
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,128
I can't see anything!

336
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,893
IN-DEPTH COVERAGE

337
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,269
No.

338
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,352
I… Well…

339
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,937
No. I don't want to take on a murder case.

340
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,236
My gosh. What a shame.

341
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,410
It would be nice for you
to get some publicity.

342
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,493
Do you know Prosecutor Park
in Violent Crimes?

343
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,577
He looks like a gangster.

344
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,711
Yes, I thought he was arrested
when I first saw him.

345
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,998
Yes, that's Prosecutor Park.

346
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,381
After he caught that gang member
and was in the news…

347
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,841
How many more followers
did he get on his social media?

348
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,176
Oh, I think it was over 100,000.

349
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,598
Over 100,000?

350
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,968
Over 100,000?

351
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,274
He got 100,000 followers
over something like that?

352
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,149
15 FOLLOWERS PROSECUTOR SEO MINHYEOK

353
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,726
You can easily have one million followers.

354
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,030
Come on. One million followers?
That's insane.

355
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,543
ONE MILLION FOLLOWERS

356
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,419
You're the most handsome
in our district prosecutor's office.

357
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,672
That is true.

358
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,962
Won't you do it?

359
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,007
I'll think about it.

360
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,301
What are you going to do
when you meet him?

361
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,545
I'm going to ask him since I'm curious.

362
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,352
Mr. Cheon, there's something more to it
than what I know, isn't there?

363
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,154
What do you mean?

364
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,229
You aren't meeting him
simply because you're curious.

365
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,145
I am meeting him because I am curious.

366
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,615
PROPER CORRECTION

367
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,302
REFORMATION

368
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,066
It's been a long time, Mr. Kim Minjae.

369
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,323
This is Ms. Baek Mari, attorney-at-law.

370
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,494
Hello. Nice to meet you.

371
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,323
I am meeting you for the first time,

372
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,873
but it isn't nice for me.

373
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,872
Oh, you're right.

374
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,365
I'm just kidding.

375
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,130
It did pay off to help you out back then.

376
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,883
We haven't decided
to take on your case yet.

377
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,676
But the fact that you came
all the way here means there's a chance.

378
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,183
The rest is left to how I answer.

379
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,850
Isn't that right?

380
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,102
That's about right.

381
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,941
Both of your parents died. Aren't you sad?

382
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,107
Do I have to be sad?

383
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,321
It isn't both of them.
Isn't it just one of them?

384
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,544
My father hasn't been found yet,
so he's missing.

385
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,871
I heard you claim innocence.

386
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,464
It's not a claim, it's the truth.

387
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,790
The prosecution says
I disposed of my father's dead body…

388
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,804
and did that to my mother,

389
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,255
but I was simply taking a bath.

390
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,802
I didn't know what was
going on downstairs.

391
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,563
If I had known, do you think
I would've taken a bath?

392
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,345
A bubble bath at that?

393
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,185
It doesn't seem normal
to take a bubble bath at that hour either.

394
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,191
Just because it isn't normal
doesn't mean it's a crime.

395
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,780
Then, Mr. Kim,
who do you think did that to your mother?

396
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,741
My missing father.

397
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,866
The two didn't get along.

398
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,668
You didn't get along with them either,
did you?

399
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,513
I was looking forward
to meeting my lawyer.

400
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,431
But it feels like a prosecutor is here.

401
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,973
I'm sorry. Actually,

402
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,097
there's a particular reason
why we came here.

403
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,403
There's a huge gap
between Law Firm Baek and our office.

404
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,900
Why do you want us to represent you?

405
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,613
I thought they'd be good
because they're big and expensive,

406
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,904
but they weren't so impressive.

407
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,204
They kept minding others.

408
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,536
They wanted to withdraw,
so I told them to do so.

409
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,868
So?

410
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,003
I thought about hiring another law firm,

411
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,921
but it might appear as though
I'm getting away with it using my money.

412
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,762
While I was searching for one,
you came to my mind.

413
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,379
Okay, and?

414
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,717
Is that all?

415
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,966
You aren't putting much effort into it.

416
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,638
You may not be released
if you lose the trial.

417
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,019
You should be more careful
about hiring a lawyer.

418
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,278
But I'm not guilty.

419
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,822
Why would I worry about that?

420
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,566
Don't you think so?

421
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,325
Doesn't he seem rather creepy?

422
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,868
What do you mean?

423
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,338
Well, he doesn't act
like he was wrongfully charged.

424
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,166
It's odd that he is so relaxed
in a situation like this.

425
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,589
And he seems pretty clever.

426
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:17,433
Mm.

427
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,926
You won't take it, right?

428
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,693
You've got all your answers.

429
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,152
Let's drop by one more place.
I need to figure something out.

430
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,204
Where are we going now? Hey.

431
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,742
Mr. Cheon.

432
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,575
Why do you want to go here?

433
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,790
This law firm withdrew from this case.

434
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,547
I have to ask them something in person.

435
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,961
Aah.

436
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,764
Did you make an appointment?
You should make one first.

437
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,681
Sure. I'll make one when I see them.

438
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,886
Who makes an appointment
when they see the person?

439
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,563
Right here.

440
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,230
He's driving me insane.

441
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,570
Ms. Baek.

442
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,453
What are you doing? Let's get going.

443
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,081
It was ruled as unconstitutional,

444
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,291
so please thoroughly search
for related materials and instances.

445
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,422
Yes, sir.

446
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,840
A lawyer called Cheon Jihun
is here to see you.

447
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,006
We're in a meeting, so tell him
to make an appointment next time.

448
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,394
No.

449
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,684
Let him in.

450
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,024
Pardon?

451
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,729
Let's take a brief break.

452
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,813
Let's take a break.

453
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,186
It's been a long time, sir.

454
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,283
Yes, it has been a long time.

455
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,532
Pretend you don't know me.

456
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,250
Oh, this is my probationary employee.
Ms. Baek, say hello to them.

457
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,631
Hello. Let me greet you. I'm Baek Mari.

458
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,040
Nice to meet you.

459
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,668
Nice to meet you too.

460
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,431
Anyway, what brings you here?

461
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:25,564
I heard you withdrew
from representing the Pungjin-dong case.

462
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,601
Yes, is there a problem with that?

463
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,234
I thought I'd take that case.

464
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,940
-Mr. Cheon.
-Yes?

465
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,652
You're about to take on a difficult case.

466
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,694
You'll receive a lot of criticism too.

467
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,908
When Mr. Seo took on the case,

468
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:45,068
-he was called the devil's lawyer.
-Well,

469
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,619
that's not why I quit though.

470
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,794
I came here to see
if I could get your help.

471
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,752
As long as there aren't any legal issues,
of course, I can.

472
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,213
So, why did you withdraw from the case?

473
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,801
-Mr. Cheon.
-Yes?

474
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,927
Isn't that a bit rude?

475
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,599
You came here without an appointment.

476
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,733
Now, you're asking me
why I withdrew from the case.

477
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,356
Yes, you're right.

478
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,568
I'm sorry. I'd like to apologize.

479
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,034
I accept your apology.

480
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,320
You know that Mr. Kim is
pleading not guilty, don't you?

481
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,198
-Yes.
-He claims that his father did it

482
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,282
and that his father is still alive.

483
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,038
Yes.

484
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,749
Do you think his father is
still alive too, Mr. Cheon?

485
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,173
That's why I withdrew.

486
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,335
I take on the case
as long as I believe he's alive,

487
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,724
but I couldn't believe that.

488
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,888
So, I couldn't figure out a way
to defend Mr. Kim.

489
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,351
Anyway,

490
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,560
why are you thinking
of taking on this case?

491
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,601
Because I believe he's alive.

492
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,532
Do you believe he's alive? Says who?

493
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,826
Says me.

494
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,790
The body simply hasn't been found.

495
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,160
It's obvious that Mr. Kim Minjae
killed him and disposed of the body.

496
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,840
Are you a probationary judicial officer
or my probationary employee?

497
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,837
Of course, I am your probationary employee
at the moment.

498
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:26,012
You've only worked for two months,
but you see him as the murderer.

499
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,642
What if the body is found tomorrow?

500
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,010
-If it's found--
-Yes.

501
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,306
-If it's found--
-Yes.

502
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,559
It won't be found.

503
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:35,983
Hmm?

504
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,105
B, A, E, K.

505
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,031
How is that read in Korean?

506
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,994
-Baek.
-What is your last name?

507
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,486
Baek.

508
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,905
Law Firm Baek.

509
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,617
Baek Mari.

510
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,115
Are you…

511
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,579
Well…

512
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,960
There are so many Baeks out there.

513
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,802
Who?

514
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,680
-Baek Jongwon.
-And?

515
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,484
-Baek Zyoung.
-And?

516
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,478
-Baek Yoonsik.
-And?

517
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,439
And?

518
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,361
Baek Seungsu.

519
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,491
Oh, there's Baek Seungsu.
Did you watch <i>Stove League</i>?

520
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,608
Of course.

521
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,534
That was really good. I don't know
why they aren't making season two.

522
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,368
Don't you know either?

523
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,702
No, I don't.

524
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:43,502
You know, it looks so good
every time I see it.

525
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,208
You can go here.

526
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,007
PROSECUTOR SEO MINHYEOK

527
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,512
DAD

528
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,644
Yes, Dad.

529
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,982
Yes, Father. What is this about?

530
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,976
<i>Where are you?
At the Prosecutor's Office?</i>

531
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,694
Yes, I'm unpacking at the moment.

532
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,574
Come downstairs.

533
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,611
What? You're here?

534
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,489
Are you okay, Mr. Seo?

535
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,083
ROOM 401, PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

536
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,158
I'm on my way.

537
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,802
You know about the Pungjin-dong case,
don't you?

538
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,632
Of course.

539
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,425
I keep hearing about Pungjin-dong.
Why is it such a hot topic?

540
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,683
I want you to be in charge.

541
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,891
Didn't you want me to be
strategic in my choices?

542
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,143
Why would I take that case?

543
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,894
You can win that case no matter what.
No matter what.

544
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,188
No matter what?

545
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,148
They haven't even found the weapon
used in the murder nor the body.

546
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,653
I'm sure they'll find it soon.

547
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,445
Do you think I'd tell you
to take a case you'd lose?

548
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,030
Also, Cheon Jihun took this case.

549
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,704
He came by with Mari a while ago.

550
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,168
I'm sure he had a reason
for sending Mari there.

551
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,209
You should win that case

552
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,496
so that you can leave a good impression
on Mr. Baek--

553
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,338
Detective, can you please compile
the files on the Pungjin-dong case?

554
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,296
No, lunch isn't important right now.
I'll buy you something good later.

555
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,274
I was still talking. Geez.

556
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,112
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me right now?

557
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,033
How could you take this case?

558
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,195
What are you taking this case for?

559
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,584
You are driving me insane!

560
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,905
Let's go insane together, Mr. Sa.

561
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,828
Look at that.

562
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,709
He notified the Prosecutors' Office
and copied all the related files.

563
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,384
You just went to see him.

564
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,802
Kim Minjae didn't do it.

565
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,671
-Why do you say that?
-Why?

566
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,640
Ms. Baek.

567
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,854
Do you know what kind of person I am?

568
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,771
I'm the person…

569
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,186
who guessed the villain
of <i>Boy Detective Jaemin</i>, Vol. 16.

570
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,811
You can count on me.

571
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,614
I figured it out. The villain is…

572
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,790
Ms. Baek.

573
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,670
Let's begin on the day before

574
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,552
the incident occurred.

575
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,630
Sorry.

576
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:40,716
According to the prosecution's records,
on May 1st, at 6:00 p.m.,

577
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,885
in their residence,

578
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,809
<i>there were the famous artist Kim Chungil
who was celebrating his 58th birthday,</i>

579
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,310
<i>his wife and director
of Gallery Yeongwon Yoo Heeju,</i>

580
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,778
<i>their children Kim Suyeon and Kim Minjae,</i>

581
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,404
<i>art journalist Park Jaeu,</i>

582
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,277
<i>Gallery Yeongwon's curator Ju Seowon,</i>

583
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,534
and the housekeeper Han Jaesook.

584
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,156
There were a total of seven people there.

585
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,714
-Happy Birthday, Mr. Kim.
-Happy Birthday, Mr. Kim.

586
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,249
I told you not to make a fuss about this.

587
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,254
If you were okay with it,

588
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,295
I would've invited people over
for a garden party,

589
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,590
but you don't like to be
the center of attention.

590
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,434
An artist speaks through his paintings.
There's no need to meet up.

591
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,560
Mr. Park, this is how he is.

592
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,725
So many people are interested
in his exhibition this time as well.

593
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,228
Hopefully, that interest
will lead to the auction.

594
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,521
I'll support you well
through my article, sir.

595
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,109
That isn't necessary.

596
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,909
<i>According to Ms. Han Jaesook,</i>

597
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,158
there wasn't any issue before,

598
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,530
but after Mr. Kim Minjae
was told to go study abroad,

599
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,748
he started having issues with his parents.

600
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,832
<i>Gosh, you're free now.</i>

601
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,874
I'm so jealous.

602
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,042
Do you want to go to my place?

603
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,668
What?

604
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,134
Don't mind him. Let's go hang out.

605
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,262
<i>According to his friends,</i>

606
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:02,184
<i>his parents were forcing him
to study abroad, so he didn't want to go.</i>

607
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:09,976
<i>Mr. Kim Minjae took a taxi home
and arrived at 00:50 a.m.</i>

608
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,266
What are you doing to me?

609
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,478
-Let go.
-Hey, Kim Minjae.

610
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,785
01:05 A.M., HAN JAESOOK SEES
YOO HEEJU AND KIM MINJAE ARGUING

611
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,544
After that, it was pretty quiet.

612
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,296
Didn't you say the curator
and the journalist stayed at the annex?

613
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,130
Did the two say anything in particular?

614
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,303
The annex was quite far
from the main house,

615
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,546
so they didn't hear anything.

616
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,219
Then, what about Kim Minjae?

617
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,979
Well, he testified

618
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,902
he went upstairs to his room
and fell asleep.

619
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,020
Then, what about Kim Suyeon?
Didn't she hear them fight?

620
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,187
No, she didn't hear anything either
as she was asleep too.

621
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,953
What? No one heard anything then.

622
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,449
How couldn't they hear anything?

623
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,741
-And--
-Maybe the rooms are soundproof.

624
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,664
Yes, they used good building materials.

625
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,792
I didn't sleep well
since my neighbors were fighting.

626
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,289
-And--
-Call the police.

627
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,911
-Should I?
-Yes.

628
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,288
Please pay attention. Focus.

629
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,456
All right. What goes on from now
is important.

630
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,545
The prosecution thinks that
between two to three o'clock,

631
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,143
Mr. Kim Minjae murdered his father
in an unknown method…

632
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,386
<i>and left the house
to dispose of the body.</i>

633
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,018
<i>At that time, the CCTV at the gate</i>

634
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,646
<i>caught Mr. Kim Minjae
driving away in the car.</i>

635
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,646
The prosecution is focused
on this statement.

636
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,565
How much have you found out
about the movement of the car?

637
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,737
Its location's been confirmed
up to Mt. Yongho Tunnel.

638
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:53,118
<i>It is estimated that he stayed
around there for one and a half hours.</i>

639
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,834
<i>Prosecution suspects that he has
disposed of his father's body</i>

640
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,964
<i>in the vicinity of
Mt. Yongho at that time.</i>

641
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,675
<i>But Kim Minjae is claiming that
he came to Mt. Yongho to get some air</i>

642
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,220
<i>and fell asleep in his car, right?</i>

643
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:12,679
Yes, but the prosecution's claim
is much more convincing.

644
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,057
Why? There isn't even dashcam footage.

645
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,481
It isn't a convincing claim.

646
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,733
Maybe it isn't that there wasn't
footage but that Mr. Kim got rid of it,

647
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,237
since he had to get rid
of his father's body.

648
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,356
Well, all right.

649
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,776
Then, where is
his father's body now, Ms. Baek?

650
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,870
In the vicinity of Mt. Yongho.

651
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,753
They'll find it in no time.

652
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,209
It's a large area,
but it's only a matter of time.

653
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,424
No.

654
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,670
The father is alive
and probably hiding somewhere.

655
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,173
Are you going to be like this?

656
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,634
Mr. Cheon,
do you really believe he's alive?

657
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:48,135
Until the prosecution finds the body,
we have to believe he's alive.

658
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,393
We're his attorneys. Don't you think so?

659
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,348
Yes.

660
00:39:56,685 --> 00:40:00,225
Han Jaesook went to get groceries
at four in the morning.

661
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,395
<i>She says the house was quiet then.</i>

662
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,741
<i>And at around 5:00 a.m.,
Mr. Kim Minjae returns home.</i>

663
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,708
KIM MINJAE

664
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,419
Where's Father?

665
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,432
Pardon? What are you talking about?

666
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,182
I can't find your father.

667
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,679
Why are you asking me about that?

668
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,731
Yes, you're right.

669
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,611
Go upstairs and get some sleep.
I should try calling him.

670
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,124
DIRECTOR YOO HEEJU, ATELIER

671
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,712
<i>The person you are calling
cannot answer the phone.</i>

672
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:36,327
How could he do such a thing
as a human being?

673
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,794
Ms. Baek, can you give me some time
to calm down?

674
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,832
Mr. Cheon, I'm shaking.

675
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,628
Kim Suyeon gets
an urgent call at 5:30 a.m.

676
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,974
and leaves the house at 5:40 a.m.

677
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,341
She didn't see anything
at that time either?

678
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,722
Or heard anything?

679
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,723
According to Ms. Kim Sooyeon,
she couldn't see anything as it was dark.

680
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:01,136
And she says she can't hear anything
from downstairs in her room.

681
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:05,557
This family never sees or hears anything.
I'm sick and tired of it.

682
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,688
I know.

683
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,987
After that, Han Jaesook
returns home around 6:00 a.m.

684
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,528
and discovers Director Yoo Heeju
who was lying in the atelier.

685
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,285
The prosecution thinks that

686
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:23,455
Mr. Kim Minjae stabbed his mother
Ms. Yoo Heeju between 5:10 to 5:30 a.m.

687
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,420
But Kim Minjae is claiming

688
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,923
he came home,
washed his hands at the sink,

689
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,127
drank some water,

690
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,797
and went straight to his room, right?

691
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,104
What do you think, Ms. Baek?

692
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,983
If he really disposed of
his father's dead body,

693
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,899
why would he leave his mother's body

694
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,517
and go to his bathroom

695
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,856
to peacefully take a bubble bath?

696
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,652
He tried to get rid of her body,

697
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,448
but Ms. Kim Suyeon got
an unexpected urgent call

698
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,122
and left at a time
that was different from usual.

699
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,288
And Ms. Han Jaesook
was about to return home as well.

700
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,753
He didn't have time
to get rid of her body.

701
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,461
<i>On top of that…</i>

702
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,247
-Tell me about the patient.
-It's an abdominal stabbing.

703
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,337
Mom.

704
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,763
Suyeon.

705
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,346
Minjae…

706
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,216
-We don't have time. Take her inside.
-One moment, sir!

707
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,478
Get me epinephrin and blood.

708
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,566
Yes!

709
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,822
<i>Their mother Yoo Heeju's
last words were,</i>

710
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,985
"Suyeon, Minjae…"

711
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,077
The prosecution is
taking note of those words.

712
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,406
He did it. He sure did.

713
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:50,130
"Suyeon, Minjae… stabbed me with a knife."

714
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,420
What do you call one's last words
before they die?

715
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,264
A dying message?

716
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,591
That's it. Dying message.

717
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,428
That's not how you act.

718
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,473
Do I have to show you how to do this?

719
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,810
"Suyeon, Minjae…

720
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,570
didn't see me and walked right by me."
She might've said that.

721
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,203
Gosh, why does a lawyer even have to act?
How embarrassing.

722
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,988
You are the perfect person
to be called the devil's lawyer.

723
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,794
Try saying that in court
and see what people say.

724
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,501
What do you think people would say?

725
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,831
You went too far.

726
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,876
What I'm saying is that
Director Yoo's last words can't be used

727
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,380
as a testimony in court.

728
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,382
Most importantly, we haven't even
found the knife that was used.

729
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,876
<i>Have you found the knife?</i>

730
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,635
How did you know it was a knife?

731
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,641
Don't people normally use a knife?

732
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,773
You stabbed her, didn't you?

733
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:52,188
So, how are you going to prove
Mr. Kim Minjae's innocence?

734
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,902
The knife hasn't been found
and there's no body.

735
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,613
Are those your only claims?

736
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,164
Ms. Baek, what is the prosecution doing
to prove Mr. Kim's guilt?

737
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:04,866
I have been telling you that they are
searching for Artist Kim's dead body.

738
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,162
That's certainly an answer
from someone who got 85 points.

739
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,076
Then, what should we do from now?

740
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,424
-What?
-What?

741
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,209
-What?
-That's it.

742
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,672
As lawyers representing Kim Minjae,

743
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,049
we need to search
for the living Artist Kim.

744
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,375
What on earth are you--

745
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,594
How are we supposed to find him?

746
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,761
That's why we should find someone
who knows him well first.

747
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,574
Can't this car go any more quietly?

748
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,567
Good driving.

749
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,163
What are you talking about?

750
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,035
Isn't that Ms. Kim Suyeon?

751
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,790
She's calling me.

752
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,956
Suyeon, I'm right up front--

753
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,210
Mr. Cheon, I have a patient
that needs urgent care.

754
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,463
We'll have to meet tomorrow.

755
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,416
Yes. Okay.

756
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,721
All right. See you tomorrow. Bye.

757
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,886
What? She's right there.

758
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,679
-Over here--
-Stop. It's suspicious.

759
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,771
She said she has an emergency patient
and asked to meet tomorrow.

760
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,859
Duck!

761
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,730
Why don't you just tell
everyone we're here? She's gone.

762
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,437
Let's see who her emergency patient is.

763
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,861
Okay.

764
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:58,941
Welcome.

765
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,355
Under whose name is the reservation?

766
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,160
Oh, we were in a rush
so we couldn't make a reservation.

767
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,292
During the first week
of the previous month,

768
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,710
we take reservations of all the guests
who will come in the following month.

769
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,420
Can't you make an exception for today?

770
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,957
Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry,
but would you please leave?

771
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,255
You're the manager, aren't you?

772
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:26,125
This is confidential, but we are
actually doing an investigation.

773
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,508
An investigation? Are you the police?

774
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,809
No, I'm a private detective.

775
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,231
A detective?

776
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,519
Well…

777
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,157
MENU

778
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,679
Who is she waiting for?

779
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,853
I'm not sure. Let's wait and see.

780
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,522
By the way, it's really nice here.
I've never been to a place like this.

781
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,481
Mr. Cheon, isn't a place like this pricey?

782
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,111
Mr. Sa, stop embarrassing me.

783
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,225
If you don't know,
just go along with it like me.

784
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,666
What language is this?

785
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,553
French? Don't you know
how to speak French, Ms. Baek?

786
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:51,304
Oh, I speak a little English
but not French.

787
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,890
Let's just ask for the same thing
as that table.

788
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,644
Okay. Ask for the same thing.

789
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,647
Hmm.

790
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,365
There's only one dinner course.

791
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,581
We have to pick the main dish.

792
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,869
There's steak, duck breast,
and lamb chop. We'll go with steak.

793
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,208
Are we all okay with medium?

794
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,459
Three wine pairings.

795
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:28,094
And we'll have ice cream for dessert.
Ms. Baek,

796
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,675
please pass that on.

797
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:50,605
Gosh, the meat is so tough these days.

798
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,049
-Hey, that person is…
-That person.

799
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,510
She's the housekeeper, Han Jaesook.

800
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,593
RÉSUMÉ
NAME: HAN JAESOOK

801
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,061
-What are they talking about?
-Hush, Ms. Baek.

802
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,396
Be quiet. I can't hear a thing
they're saying.

803
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,360
What do you think they're talking about?

804
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,822
What does she have to talk about
with the housekeeper?

805
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,323
You don't think--

806
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,534
You don't think it's about the case,
do you?

807
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,910
You don't think it's about the case,
do you?

808
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,452
Aah.

We have to pick the main dish.

814
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,332
There's steak, duck breast,
and lamb chop. We'll go with steak.

815
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,866
Who really is he?

816
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,973
Ms. Baek.

817
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,299
Aren't you hungry?

818
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,635
Do places like that
usually give that little?

819
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,178
How do French people survive
eating that little?

820
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,433
I'm hungry.

821
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:49,611
We should've eaten <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.
Why did we eat that?

822
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,980
Are you going somewhere at this hour?
Why did you change?

823
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,818
There's a place I want to check out.

824
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,950
I changed into something that was
more suitable to move around in.

825
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,615
Okay. Well, where?

826
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:06,082
I need to see the crime scene in person.

827
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,334
What?

828
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,206
At 11 o'clock at night?

829
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,551
It's so dark outside.
Where do you think you're going?

830
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,471
Are you kidding me right now?
Let's get going.

831
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,639
From now on,

832
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,220
call me Detective Cheon.

833
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,282
Aren't we leaving?

834
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:45,575
DETECTIVE CHEON JIHUN
DETECTIVE CHEON

835
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,540
Aren't we leaving?

836
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,184
Detective Cheon?

837
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,563
BEWARE OF DOG NO TRESPASSING

838
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,491
Come on. I thought
you wanted to see it for yourself.

839
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,458
Wait. My leg is cramping up.

840
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:39,091
Mr. Cheon, aren't you coming?

841
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,554
It's too dark, so I'll come back later.

842
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,295
Take those sunglasses off.

843
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,722
Ah.

844
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,101
Shall we go in, then?

845
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,180
Hey.

846
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:28,969
Here.

847
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,561
I think the power went out.

848
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,687
Let's come back during the day.

849
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,610
I didn't expect the power to be out.

850
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,482
That was my mistake.

851
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,074
Stop messing around.

852
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,921
Why is he breathing like that?

853
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,602
Hmm.

854
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,231
Do you think
Mr. Kim Minjae really didn't know?

855
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,985
If it was dark and he was drunk
at the time,

856
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,239
we can't rule out that possibility.

857
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,282
Aren't you taking his side too much
as his lawyer?

858
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,986
I think it is possible.

859
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:34,044
Ms. Kim Suyeon said she didn't hear
the fighting from her room.

860
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,168
Let's check.

861
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,672
Mr. Sa.

862
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,749
By myself?

863
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,666
I don't want to.

864
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,678
Mari.

865
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,761
What?

866
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,973
The person who wants to check
should go upstairs.

867
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,678
You should go, Mr. Cheon.

868
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,688
No.

869
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,229
-Why not?
-I'm scared.

870
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,230
I'll go upstairs with Mr. Sa, okay?

871
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,815
-No.
-Why not?

872
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,860
I'll be left alone.

873
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,454
My goodness. Fine, I'll go upstairs
by myself. Are you happy?

874
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,568
Yes.

875
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,273
Do you know what time it is?
Why are you so late?

876
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,654
It can happen. Why do you care?

877
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,071
You jerk!

878
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,687
-Mother, I--
-Ms. Baek!

879
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,112
Can you hear us?

880
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,695
It doesn't seem like she can.

881
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:55,198
Ms. Baek, tell us if you can't hear us.

882
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,906
How can she answer you
if she can't hear you?

883
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,746
-Mm.
-Mm.

884
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,752
Mr. Cheon, someone is out there!

885
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:48,842
Mr. Cheon.

886
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:54,923
Stay here.

887
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,960
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

888
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,493
<i>As Kim Minjae claimed,</i>

889
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,576
<i>the likelihood that his father killed
his mother and disappeared is…</i>

890
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,293
He isn't even your real brother.
Do you believe everything he says?

891
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,754
<i>He can't even kill a bug.</i>

892
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,793
I'm the one who killed.

893
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,916
<i>Is that Mr. Kim Minjae's true self?</i>

894
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,763
-Why on earth did you do that?
-<i>Am I strange?</i>

895
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,218
<i>Something isn't quite right.</i>

896
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,799
<i>Everyone is suspicious.
They're hiding something.</i>

897
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,635
<i>I think I finally solved the mystery.</i>
