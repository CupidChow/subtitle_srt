THIS SHOW IS FICTION,
AND THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, INSTITUTIONS,

12
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,923
EVENTS, GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
ON THE SHOW ARE NOT REAL

13
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:57,598
<i>Was the real killer caught?</i>

14
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,724
<i>No.</i>

15
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:02,353
Jihun did his best,
but he couldn't catch him.

16
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,479
Mr. Cheon…

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,606
What happened to Mr. Cheon?

18
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,067
<i>Yejin, I am going
to leave the prosecution.</i>

19
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,655
Why? If you want to investigate
Ms. Lee's case or your father's case,

20
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:15,283
wouldn't it be better if you stayed?

21
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:17,118
That's why I am leaving.

22
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,706
There are too many eyes watching
for me to stay in the prosecution.

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,541
Where will you go?

24
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:09,629
LEE JUYEONG

25
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:19,430
ATTORNEY, LEE JUYEONG

26
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,484
1,000 WON

27
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,779
<i>I thought about it for a long time.</i>

28
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,491
<i>Why was it 1,000 won?</i>

29
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:25,788
Anyone there?

30
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:32,545
I asked the lady lawyer
to take on my case before,

31
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,881
but I never heard back from her.

32
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:39,093
By the way, is the legal fee
really 1,000 won?

33
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,097
Yes.

34
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,893
That's right. It's 1,000 won.

35
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,863

EPISODE 9

38
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,957
Then…

39
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,459
Mr. Cheon has…

40
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,878
taken over the office?

41
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,670
Yes.

42
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:20,676
What's wrong?

43
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:27,016
Then why is Minhyeok acting like that
towards Mr. Cheon?

44
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,937
So, Minhyeok used to like Jihun a lot.

45
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,106
I mean, he looked up to him. Mm.

46
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:37,026
And then Jihun announced
that he was leaving suddenly.

47
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,362
So, he was disappointed.

48
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,281
Minhyeok doesn't know anything!

49
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,700
Hey, why are you so worked up?

50
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,910
Stop that.

51
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,497
I have no idea why you're suffering.

52
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,624
- I'm here.
- Why…

53
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,542
Jihun.

54
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,972
- Yejin, are you leaving first...
- Yes!

55
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,933
Yeowon is waiting. I have to go.

56
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,628
Okay, what is it?

57
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,005
Mr. Cheon.

58
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,673
Yes?

59
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,217
You must be suffering a lot.

60
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,219
Yes. I am suffering greatly.

61
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,683
To be a lawyer who takes
the drunk probationary employee is…

62
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,144
great suffering.

63
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:55,021
Mr. Cheon.

64
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,104
Yes?

65
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,566
- I…
- Yes.

66
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,863
I think it was a good idea
to be your probationary employee.

67
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,698
Hmm. Yes, it was.

68
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:07,033
Did you drink a lot?

69
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,493
It was a good idea.

70
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,412
It really was.

71
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,247
Did you drink a lot?

72
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,459
- That's just how I feel.
- I see.

73
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,128
So, tell me your home address…

74
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,299
Your head is falling to the side…

75
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,384
Don't close your eyes.

76
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,677
And you're asleep.

77
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,554
Hmm.

78
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,768
What is all this?

79
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,854
Today is our turn to get the lodge money.

80
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:39,648
I showed off my skills for today.

81
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:41,984
Was it our turn already?

82
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,467
DEPOSIT 5,000,000 WON
JUNE LODGE MONEY

83
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,324
It just came in. Just now.

84
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,037
Let's buy Jun some things he needs.

85
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,247
And add to the office rent.

86
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,499
I will.

87
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,043
Dad, I want the toy
I told you about last time.

88
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:00,211
The transforming robot!

89
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,670
Okay, Daddy will buy it for you.

90
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:04,048
We're rich now.

91
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:08,260
Yes, we are rich, aren't we?

92
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,430
Take this and share it with everybody.

93
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,557
Mr. Cheon seemed to like it last time.

94
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,559
Why do you like him so much?

95
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,813
Jun, did you eat a lot?

96
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,606
Yes. It was very delicious.

97
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:21,982
How much?

98
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,651
This much!

99
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,738
Daddy loves you this much too.

100
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,365
I love you.

101
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,160
Who does he take after? He's so cute.

102
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,454
JEIL LAUNDRY

103
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,539
It smells delicious.

104
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,583
Mr. Cheon and Mari will love it.

105
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,671
It's doing it again.

106
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,465
Hey.

107
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,467
What's going on?

108
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,347
You darn car.

109
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,103
USED VAN FOR SALE

110
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,109
Good morning.

111
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,495
What are you doing?

112
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,038
- Oh, my heart!
- Oh, my heart.

113
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
You're here.

114
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,544
It's an ad for a used car.

115
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:25,546
It seemed like a good price.

116
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,423
Used cars?

117
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,258
That looks like a pretty good deal.

118
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:32,052
- It does, right?
- But don't you think it's a scam?

119
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,721
- A scam?
- Yes.

120
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,514
There are a lot of fake deals these days.

121
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,683
I've worked here for many years.

122
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,853
I am quite shrewd
about most things like a lawyer.

123
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,606
Wait and see.

124
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,570
Hello? Is this Yeongeun?

125
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,031
Do you still have the New Damas?

126
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,659
Was this from the other day?

127
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,873
Let's start the meeting, Manager.

128
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,794
Who is this?

129
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,878
PROSECUTOR, NA YEJIN

130
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,006
- Ms. Na will be here soon.
- Okay.

131
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,176
Did Na Yejin shrink this small?

132
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,637
Do you know my mom?

133
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,556
What's wrong with you?
Can't you remember Uncle Minhyeok?

134
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:21,477
I adored you before I went to America.

135
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,856
And you said I was
the most handsome guy in the world.

136
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,359
No?

137
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,819
Do I look like this, then?

138
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,987
You laughed.

139
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,615
You are adorable.

140
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,952
Yeowon, didn't you go to school today?

141
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,579
I think her nanny is sick.

142
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,957
She couldn't leave Yeowon home alone.

143
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,792
Ms. Na asked us to watch her.

144
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,044
Goodness, I see.

145
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,880
- Mommy.
- Hey.

146
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,424
- Did you say hi to Uncle Minhyeok?
- Yeah.

147
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,843
- Are you done with your homework?
- I have a little left.

148
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,053
Yeowon.

149
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,098
Can you wait for me a little longer?

150
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,599
Yeah. I can wait.

151
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:09,066
Yeowon, do you want to see
your mom working today?

152
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,944
What? No.

153
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,280
Why not? I will keep an eye on her.

154
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,698
I will be quiet, Mommy.

155
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,199
- Okay?
- Okay?

156
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,662
OFFICE OF LAW, 2F

157
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:23,038
I'm here.

158
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,915
Hello, Mr. Cheon.

159
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,500
You're right on time.

160
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,001
Hmm.

161
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,756
What about Mr. Sa? Did he go somewhere?

162
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,385
He went to see about a used car,
saying it's time to get a new car.

163
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:37,468
A used car?

164
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,639
I hope he's not going to go somewhere
and get ripped off.

165
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,974
I'm worried.

166
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,058
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

167
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,768
He seemed to be quite thorough.

168
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,396
Shall I make some coffee for you?

169
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,865
No. I will make my own coffee.

170
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,948
No.

171
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,996
I will make it for you.

172
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,252
Wait, stop.

173
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,671
Stop. Stop.

174
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,633
I have to make it.

175
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,468
Why?

176
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:20,387
There's a reason.

177
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,847
Oops.

178
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:34,735
Mmm.

179
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,278
The aroma is wonderful.

180
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,863
No need to go to a café?

181
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,615
That's too bad.

182
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:42,284
If I made it for you,
it would've been even more fragrant.

183
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,996
Mari.

184
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:49,958
Tell me truthfully.
Why are you acting like this to me?

185
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,044
Hmm? What do you mean?

186
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,754
It's creepy.

187
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,632
And you are overly kind today.

188
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,510
That's right. Your left eyebrow and lips

189
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,637
are wiggling like a worm.

190
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,306
That's the kind of expression
that suits you.

191
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,974
How pretty is that?

192
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,353
Yes. That's it.

193
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,198
It's never been in an accident.
None of these parts were changed.

194
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,093
- It's my first car, I'm not sure.
- Well, then.

195
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,245
Because you don't look up those things.
You can search for accident history…

196
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,916
YEONGEUN

197
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,084
Hello?

198
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,920
I just arrived in front of the building.

199
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,257
Should I pull in? Okay.

200
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,199
Hello?

201
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,411
- Yeongeun?
- Ah, Yeongeun!

202
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,664
- Yeongeun.
- Yes, Hello.

203
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,416
Yes, hello.

204
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,543
Your clothes are…

205
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:18,797
Yes. I used to work
at an auto shop before.

206
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,007
I see.

207
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,134
There's an oil stain.

208
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,513
By the way, you're not
posting a video online, are you?

209
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,765
Tube? A what tube?

210
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,558
It's nothing. Come with me.

211
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:34,521
Anyway, is it the same price
as it was mentioned on the website?

212
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,484
Have you been swindled a lot?
We strictly follow the law in our sales.

213
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,528
I see. I work in that field.

214
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,447
In that field?

215
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:45,699
I work at a law office.

216
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,451
As an office manager.

217
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,119
Ah.

218
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,788
You don't have to worry about anything.

219
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,832
Judges, prosecutors, lawyers.
They all buy used cars from us.

220
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,751
- Is that right?
- Yes.

221
00:13:58,253 --> 00:13:59,630
This drives great!

222
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,964
Whoo-hoo! Ooh!

223
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:07,678
How was it?

224
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,848
I really like it. Really.

225
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,434
So then…

226
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,229
- What is this?
- Hmm.

227
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,731
Something was left out.

228
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,857
Left out?

229
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,569
There is a knocking in the engine.
Did you hear it while driving?

230
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,779
What?

231
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,949
Listen to the engine.

232
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,578
I hear it all of a sudden.

233
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,913
- Don't you?
- I can hear it.

234
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:35,666
If the engine breaks down because of it,
you'll lose a few million.

235
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,792
But...

236
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,253
The suspension is loose too.

237
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:40,879
What?

238
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,091
- No.
- Look. The car shouldn't shake like this.

239
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:45,759
- The suspension?
- Yes.

240
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,888
They said there was nothing wrong
and it was a vehicle in good condition.

241
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,350
You should know better.
If you lose the suspension, it's the end.

242
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,477
But… they said it was fine.

243
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,187
They said it was just a display car.

244
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,023
Would they keep it sitting here
if it was in good condition?

245
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,277
I think there is an oil leak as well.

246
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,987
- Oil?
- Take a look here.

247
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,281
No.

248
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,992
It really is leaking.

249
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,078
They said it was okay.

250
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:17,124
Sir, I am telling you this
because you remind me of my older cousin.

251
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,292
Am I older?

252
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,238
You remind me of my older cousin.

253
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,421
I see.

254
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,966
There is a similar model on our lot.

255
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:29,011
Would you like to see that one?

256
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:33,056
I thank you for being honest.

257
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,018
Yes. I will take a look.

258
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,147
Nickname, Car King.

259
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,900
Seoul's Yeongeun Market,
Bucheon's Gary Old Car,

260
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,777
Seongnam's Furious Motors,
Paju's Parrari and more.

261
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,907
The nickname belongs
to the boss of used car scammers

262
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,533
that are prevalent in these areas.

263
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,953
We suspect that he also owns
a used car lot himself.

264
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,124
They aren't a single organization
and we couldn't root them out so far.

265
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:02,836
If we catch this guy,
we can get them all with a single blow.

266
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,755
What is a single organization?

267
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,011
Let's say we get the head.

268
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,819
How are you going to rope the others in?

269
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,389
Apparently, one of these businesses

270
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,392
pays a cash bribe
at the end of every month.

271
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,769
The company changes every month

272
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,188
and it has a complicated
money laundering process,

273
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,898
so it is not easy to track it. However,

274
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:27,110
according to an informant, we will get
a better picture within a month.

275
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,237
An informant? You have a source?

276
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,781
Is he trustworthy?

277
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,616
Yes, he is.

278
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,452
You say we can make some progress
within a month, right?

279
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,871
Good. Let's go forward with it.

280
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:38,955
Yes, sir.

281
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:41,959
We will begin the next agenda.

282
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,503
Here, all you have to do
is sign the papers.

283
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:49,257
But this is more expensive
than the one I saw before coming.

284
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,301
The other car you saw is

285
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,179
a display car so it's priced
a little lower than the market price.

286
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:56,932
This one has no issues and it's clean.

287
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,309
If you buy this,
you're definitely getting a deal.

288
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,561
Aah.

289
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:05,357
So, this includes car sales service fees.

290
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,860
If you don't have enough cash,
we can provide financing.

291
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,114
But we do charge financing charges.

292
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,991
So, wouldn't it be better to pay in cash?

293
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,211
Yes, I will.

294
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:28,630
I will go ahead with the contract.

295
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,715
- Good choice!
- Yes!

296
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,053
Yes, it was a good purchase.

297
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,663
I bought it at a good price,
so Jun's mom will be happy too.

298
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,768
Jun, we will have to buy
the transforming robot next time!

299
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,439
Let's drive!

300
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:49,985
Huh?

301
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,278
What's wrong with it?

302
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,820
What's happening?

303
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,210
Are you the mechanic?

304
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,171
Please take a look at this.

305
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,382
There must be something wrong
with the car. It's smoking.

306
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,592
What's wrong with it?

307
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,553
I am the owner of this car.

308
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,723
I bought this car today and this happened.

309
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,561
I am the owner of this car!

310
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,109
I bought this car today and this happened!

311
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,528
I am the owner of this car.

312
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,867
Geez. How can this be?

313
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,953
How was it, Ms. Baek?
Wasn't it pretty good?

314
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,873
It was very good.
It's better than most must-eat places.

315
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:46,665
You're right.

316
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,418
- The food...
- Wait!

317
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:51,922
I will clear the table.

318
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,013
- I will clear...
- No, wait.

319
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,097
What's wrong?

320
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,516
I'll do it.

321
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,188
What's wrong with you?

322
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,440
Why are you being like this?

323
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,443
You look at me
all weirdly since last night.

324
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,321
When I came in today, you were like,
"Welcome," and touch my shoulder.

325
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:17,823
Why are you so nice to me?

326
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:20,909
That look. That look is weird.

327
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:23,285
What?

328
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,747
Aah!

329
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,500
Ms. Baek, sit down.

330
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,211
Mm. I got the clue.

331
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,004
Ms. Baek, be honest.

332
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,259
After working here, you feel like
you can learn a lot from me.

333
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:40,762
And when you leave this office,
you won't have anywhere to go.

334
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,306
So, you are trying to stay put.

335
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,476
So, you're kissing up to me, aren't you?

336
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,104
I have plenty of places to go!
It's not like that.

337
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,397
It doesn't look like it's not.

338
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,483
You can fool everyone else,
but you can't fool me.

339
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,318
I have the quickest wit, you see.

340
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,114
I am not easily swayed by brownnosing.

341
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:01,783
I only look at skills. Skills, okay?

342
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,786
I didn't think you were like this,
but you're a bad person.

343
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,496
You are very calculating.

344
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,747
A very bad person.

345
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,332
You play with people's hearts.

346
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,501
- I said it's not like that.
- Stop!

347
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,420
Stop.

348
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,672
No more. Finished. The end.

349
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,720
What's taking Mr. Sa so long?
I'm getting worried.

350
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,226
It isn't like that.

351
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:38,445
I am the person who just bought a car.

352
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,322
The car broke down!

353
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,742
I want to get a refund!

354
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:46,119
Give me back my money!

355
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,623
Does he want a refund?

356
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,957
Yes, sir.

357
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,127
Sir, where is the vehicle right now?

358
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,839
It broke down so I couldn't bring it!

359
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:03,845
I mean, you broke the car
by your own fault and you want a refund.

360
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:05,764
Don't you think that is wrong?

361
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,017
It was broken, to begin with!

362
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,437
Isn't that right?
You shouldn't have sold the car!

363
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,981
No matter how much I think about it,
this is wrong.

364
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:18,109
This is wrong! It's wrong!

365
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,781
Give me a refund, please?

366
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:26,159
Please give me a refund.

367
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:31,456
Sir.

368
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:38,171
How about a refund on your life,
instead of the refund on the car?

369
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,174
What?

370
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,421
<i>Yes, we are rich, aren't we?</i>

371
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,423
<i>Dad, I want the toy
I told you about last time.</i>

372
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,146
What's going on?

373
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,232
He's not here today either?
Is he making himself a used car?

374
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,318
Where is he? I'm worried.

375
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:44,904
It doesn't seem right, does it?
He's not answering his phone either.

376
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,414
MISSED CALL FROM MR. CHEON
MISSED CALL FROM MS. BAEK

377
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:08,511
JEIL LAUNDRY

378
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:24,194
JEIL LAUNDRY

379
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,997
Come back here.

380
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,332
Stop right there.

381
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:41,252
Mr. Sa.

382
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,840
Why is it so hard to get a hold of you?
I thought you went to buy a used car.

383
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,512
Tell me everything.
I suspect something is wrong.

384
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,138
You heard everything?

385
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,557
I heard nothing.
I have to hear it from you now.

386
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,643
- What?
- What?

387
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,896
Lay it all on me.

388
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:03,149
I am… on your side.

389
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,113
Mr. Cheon. What should I do?

390
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,156
What should I do?

391
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,368
Really…

392
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,829
What should I do? I don't know.

393
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,958
So you went there
after seeing this?

394
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,670
Yes. The price was so cheap.

395
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:26,756
Cheap? You are so frustrating.

396
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:28,925
Mr. Sa, think about it.

397
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:31,636
Where on earth is there
a cheap car that's good?

398
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,764
I asked about it too.

399
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,351
They said they brought
an expired display vehicle.

400
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,228
That's their thing.

401
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:44,399
They post a good car at a cheap price
and lure people in.

402
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:48,236
And when you go, they show you
another car and sell it for much more.

403
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,046
That's right. "It's a display vehicle."

404
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,949
"It's cheap because we got it
from a court auction or a public sale."

405
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:54,742
They say these things to get you to come.

406
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,995
If it were so great, they'd be driving it.

407
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,545
Ms. Baek, I just explained
the same thing to him.

408
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:07,046
Why don't you sit this one out?

409
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:08,922
Yeah.

410
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,301
Let's go.

411
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,886
What? Where?

412
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,512
To get a refund.

413
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,347
A refund? Would they do it so easily?

414
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,767
No, they wouldn't.
We have to make them give you a refund.

415
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,232
Ms. Baek, aren't you coming?

416
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,650
You told me to sit this one out.

417
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,528
Let's go together.

418
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,612
It's been a while…

419
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,990
since you got to show yourself.

420
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,874
Wait for me.

421
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:53,718
I wasn't on much either.

422
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,610
The office seems to be over there.
Do you remember the exact location?

423
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,404
- I don't know.
- What?

424
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,908
They said the office was too crowded.

425
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:19,035
I met the owner at a different location.

426
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,915
Mr. Sa, do you know
the phone number on their website?

427
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:26,709
- Yes.
- What is that number?

428
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:29,295
Hold on.

429
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,923
Are you the one who called?

430
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,720
Yes. It was me.

431
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,390
Did you look into a few used cars?

432
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:42,934
I did look here and there.

433
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:44,894
To be honest,
I don't know much about cars.

434
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,438
It's my first time buying a used car too.

435
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,357
Ah.

436
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,693
Then you came to the right place.

437
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,403
You are lucky.

438
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,946
Would you like a test drive?

439
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:56,822
A test drive?

440
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,368
Okay.

441
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,497
Even at a glance they look suspicious.

442
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,427
How was it?

443
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,888
You want to make a quick decision.

444
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,057
Another customer looked
at this car yesterday.

445
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,103
I like this car. I will take it.

446
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,107
Ah, you should be a bit more prudent.

447
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,151
No. You said someone
looked at it yesterday.

448
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,986
What if he takes it while I hesitate?

449
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,405
I will take this car. I like it.

450
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,699
If that's the case…

451
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:40,950
No. So…

452
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,620
Well, there is something
I forgot to tell you.

453
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,871
What is it?

454
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,456
This car has an engine knocking.

455
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,833
Knock… Knocking? What is that?

456
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,836
I guess you didn't hear it
when you were driving.

457
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:53,679
It's the sound from the engine.
Put your ear to the engine and listen.

458
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,755
Okay.

459
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,302
Do you hear it?

460
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:01,185
That's weird.
There is sound coming from here.

461
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,262
I know.

462
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
A sound?

463
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,229
It's weird. From the engine…

464
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:15,276
- A sound like this is coming.
- Oh, no.

465
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,903
But, I…

466
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,239
I really like this sound.

467
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,700
Did you tune it up?
I really like this sound.

468
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:26,287
No, it's not like a tune-up.
It's called knocking.

469
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,261
If the engine breaks down
because of it, you'll lose a few million.

470
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,793
What? Lose a few million?

471
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,276
How can I lose a few million?
This car isn't worth that much.

472
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:37,382
That is totally ridiculous. What…

473
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,510
is the reason you're telling me

474
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,179
comes to me all of a sudden.

475
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,807
Be honest.

476
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,891
You're trying to…

477
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,562
- sell it to that person from yesterday.
- No, that's not it.

478
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,023
This is… Look at this.

479
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:57,402
The suspension is loose too. Look.

480
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,405
The car shouldn't shake like this.

481
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,824
I see. The suspension is loose.

482
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,243
Oh.

483
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,411
Aah.

484
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,461
If the suspension is loose,

485
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:18,923
I will tighten it up.
I will take this car. Give me this car.

486
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,260
I am not trying to sell
this car to another person.

487
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,596
The steering pump
on this car is leaking too.

488
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,725
- Look. There's oil here.
- Look at that.

489
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,352
If the oil pump is leaking,
I'll plug it up.

490
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,437
I will buy this car.

491
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,814
Plugging it up won't do.
Look, there is a puddle.

492
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:37,024
I can clean up the puddle.
Give me this car.

493
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,405
Look, sir. I am telling you this…

494
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,076
because you remind me of my brother.

495
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,369
I'm like your brother? Me?

496
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:51,330
- Just your image.
- I see, my image.

497
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,917
There is another model on our lot
that is similar to this one.

498
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,210
I don't want to see it.

499
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,546
I will buy this one. Give me this car.

500
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,510
Look at that! The tire just came off.

501
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,114
It only comes off when you're driving.

502
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,805
Gosh, I can't even sell it now.

503
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,682
- The tire came off.
- I know!

504
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,183
Wow.

505
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:12,769
Such a retro look.

506
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,146
This is exactly the car I wanted.

507
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:16,731
It's the car I exactly wanted!

508
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:22,320
It totally suits my style!

509
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,367
Let's sign the contract.

510
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:31,078
Ha. Yes, let's do that.

511
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,163
Give me this car.

512
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,457
Let me make a call.

513
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,461
You... you're buying this car, right?

514
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:39,754
Yes. I will buy it.

515
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:42,423
Yes, okay.

516
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:45,384
Well, well.

517
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:52,099
What? Why are you chasing after me?

518
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,726
I said I'll buy the car!

519
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,530
Don't sell it to that person
from yesterday!

520
00:30:57,563 --> 00:30:58,563
Shoot!

521
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,943
I don't want to sell it!

522
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,236
Sell it!

523
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,155
Sell the car!

524
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:12,577
You're laughing?

525
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,669
Give me the car!

526
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:29,595
What happened?

527
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,473
Are you even hurt?

528
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,558
You…

529
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:56,913
Ah!

530
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:12,638
He says he wants to buy the car!

531
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,314
CAR SALES EMPLOYEE CARD
NAME: HWANG GEUMSIK

532
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,650
What's this? The face is different.

533
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,488
Okay, Mr. Hwang Geumsik.
Let me ask you just one thing.

534
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,074
Will you sell me the car or not?

535
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,534
I won't sell it.

536
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,202
Can you not buy it?

537
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,412
Mm.

538
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,580
"I won't sell it."

539
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:40,124
Good. Very good.

540
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:42,668
Then, let me ask you again
for the last time.

541
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,837
- Mr. Hwang Geumsik?
- Yes?

542
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,632
Will you or will you not
sell that car to me?

543
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,384
If I sell it, I will be beaten to death.

544
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,637
- By who?
- By our boss.

545
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,596
Boss?

546
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:58,309
Then what about the people

547
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:00,603
who got swindled
by your fraudulent business?

548
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:04,023
Please let it slide, big brother.

549
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:05,191
Please, big sister.

550
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:07,860
Big sister? Who? Me?

551
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:08,944
Yes.

552
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,822
I am younger than you think.

553
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,867
Even if you are… How old are you?

554
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,285
I'm 23.

555
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:21,831
I was actually…

556
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,919
orphaned at a young age.

557
00:33:26,545 --> 00:33:28,297
I didn't graduate from school.

558
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,134
I supported my younger siblings

559
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,178
and went through a lot.

560
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:39,183
The world was not so easy
for a young kid to make money.

561
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,562
Please forgive me.

562
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,819
Mr. Cheon.

563
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,655
He's too young to know.

564
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:54,907
He probably didn't know any better.

565
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,409
Right, he's too young.

566
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,955
Being young doesn't excuse you!

567
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,957
Being young is not a privilege!

568
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,252
Do you think you get a free pass?

569
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,131
- Mr. Hwang Geumsik.
- Yes?

570
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,093
The crime doesn't become lesser
because of your young age.

571
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,803
Understand that.

572
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:17,971
Okay.

573
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,434
I will forgive you under one condition.

574
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,397
Make me a dealer.

575
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:30,568
I want to make money too.

576
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,952
I need money to pay my office rent.
Please tell your boss.

577
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:43,080
I'm sorry I was informal with you
because you were young.

578
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,003
Mr. Cheon, what are you doing?

579
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:50,796
Let's get the refund and go.

580
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,965
I agree. You scared them enough.

581
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,509
Let's get the refund
for Mr. Sa's car and leave.

582
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,033
Do you want to get the refund
for just Mr. Sa's car and leave?

583
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,599
What about other people?
We should get a refund for everyone.

584
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
How?

585
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,602
Ms. Baek,

586
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,148
I will buy you an outfit.

587
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,622
- He's Geumsik's hometown buddy?
- Yes. We grew up in the same town.

588
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:26,665
Yes. Nice to meet you, sir.

589
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,793
My name is Cheon Jihun,
Geumsik's hometown buddy.

590
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,503
Please call me Hun for short.

591
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,630
- What about her?
- What?

592
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,798
She's…

593
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,551
my younger cousin.

594
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,263
She wants to become a used car dealer
and make a lot of money.

595
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,848
So, I brought her with me.

596
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,974
Is that right?

597
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,394
It's not an easy job for a woman.

598
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:49,939
Just give me a chance,
and I will do my best!

599
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,524
Let's go.

600
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,612
You've got spunk.

601
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,783
If Hun is older than Geumsik, you are…

602
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:02,827
I am 29.

603
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,038
- Then your cousin is...
- Yes. I'm 22!

604
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,292
You have a great attitude,
but let's lower your voice a little.

605
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:11,961
Yes, sir.

606
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,214
- You want to work here?
- Yes, boss.

607
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:18,217
- Why?
- Geumsik told me that you can get...

608
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,303
You can get as much as you work!
That's what Jihun taught me!

609
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,180
That's exactly it.

610
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,517
How fair is that?
You take as much as you earn.

611
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,811
I will do an honest job and do my...

612
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:30,187
I will do my best!

613
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,193
Okay. I like you. I do.

614
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,571
She's more fun than this guy.

615
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,616
Do your best. Okay?

616
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,952
Geumsik, show them the ropes.

617
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:46,035
Yes, boss.

618
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,123
- Yes, boss. Thank...
- Thank you, boss!

619
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,833
My gosh.

620
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,421
NUMBER 1 DEALER OF USED CARS!

621
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:07,057
Hey, it's worth five million won.
Do it right.

622
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,560
I checked it, I swear.

623
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,614
SEOUL USED CARS
YEONGEUN

624
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,240
What are you looking around for?

625
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,410
Since I'm here,
I should take in the atmosphere.

626
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:28,454
There's nothing to take in here.

627
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,537
Our job is simple.

628
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:32,517
Let's say the customer comes in
after seeing a fake ad.

629
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,211
We make them forget that car
by using the regular repertoire,

630
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,047
then sell them another car
for a higher price.

631
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,299
- Isn't it simple?
- It sure is.

632
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,219
Here. I prepared this for you.

633
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,303
What is this?

634
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:46,555
You just have to memorize a few things.

635
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:47,973
Mm.

636
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,642
It's…

637
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,146
This part here is important.

638
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,522
- Oh, this.
- Yeah.

639
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,732
This part is…

640
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,070
My stomach. Where is the bathroom?

641
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:04,198
- At the end of the hall.
- Is that so? Okay…

642
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,298
YEONGEUN MARKET

643
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:45,364
Look, we're missing 100 million won.

644
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:47,716
Are you sure you emptied their pockets?

645
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:50,327
Not just their pockets,
we even searched their underpants.

646
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,037
This is driving me crazy.

647
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:54,162
The guys in the other region
must've met the quota.

648
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:57,334
Then can we borrow
from the Bucheon area?

649
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,961
I have my pride, punk.

650
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:02,256
Post a lot of bait on the internet
by tomorrow.

651
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,799
Come up with 100 million somehow.

652
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:05,134
Yes, we will.

653
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,886
Hey, what are you doing over there?

654
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,347
Who are you?

655
00:39:10,597 --> 00:39:14,977
I got lost during the Yeongeun Market
new employee training...

656
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,060
I'm very sorry.

657
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,872
He's a trainee.
I think he came down the wrong hall.

658
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:19,874
- You can't be here.
- I couldn't find the bathroom.

659
00:39:19,898 --> 00:39:21,775
I'm very sorry.

660
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,859
Watch out.

661
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,529
Where is the bathroom?

662
00:39:25,612 --> 00:39:27,048
I told you it's at the end of the hall.

663
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:28,282
You had me so scared.

664
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,719
This is why you can never take
your eyes off of the newbies.

665
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,746
This is where you can't go.
The bathroom is over here.

666
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,582
But Geumsik, let me ask you something.

667
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,251
Can we… do this?

668
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,961
- Do what?
- You know.

669
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:42,755
Like this…

670
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,716
I mean, can we sell used cars
in such a clever way?

671
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,886
Of course. You have to work hard.
Or else you'll miss your chance.

672
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,637
Don't you feel guilty?

673
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,183
Feel guilty?
I guess she didn't read the survey.

674
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,310
I mean, for a billion won,

675
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,645
more than half the kids
in their early twenties

676
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,898
are willing to go to jail
on behalf of a criminal.

677
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,317
That's not because people are good,

678
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,528
but because they didn't have the chance
to make money like we did.

679
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,155
Aah.

680
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:10,240
The world revolves around money.

681
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,118
And that's why you both are here,
to make money.

682
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,746
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

683
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:17,498
Why are we here?

684
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,061
- We're here to make money.
- Exactly.

685
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:21,960
Then you should work hard
and forget about your conscience.

686
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:25,172
But aren't you afraid
you could get caught?

687
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,507
It's not a big deal.

688
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,509
Do you know where our boss is right now?

689
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,592
Where is he?

690
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,512
He's getting investigated by a prosecutor.

691
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:34,556
Ah.

692
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,231
What? I have no idea.

693
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,359
I don't know what
you're talking about. Jeez.

694
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:46,985
Who is above you?

695
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,406
There is no one up there.

696
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,577
Who could be above me? I'm the boss.

697
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,705
You are all close friends here.

698
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:03,335
Hello, you guys are all here.

699
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:04,585
- Hi.
- Hello.

700
00:41:05,003 --> 00:41:06,964
Yes, I do see them once in a while.

701
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:09,633
Don't you know the prosecutor next door?

702
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,847
What about this, then?

703
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:19,601
It's the withdrawal record of a victim
who bought a car from you two months ago.

704
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,480
Does it make sense that a 10-year-old car
costs the price of a new car?

705
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,611
These guys…

706
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:33,740
They've got great skills.

707
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:40,164
Listen. Must-eat restaurants aren't
the only ones with secret know-how.

708
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,417
There is know-how
in this business too. See?

709
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,044
That's what you call a scam.

710
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,337
Scam?

711
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,506
Is there a legal clause

712
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,468
that says you can't sell a 10-year-old car
for the price of a new car?

713
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,596
You post an ad for a good car for cheap,

714
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,849
and you sell a different car for more
by giving excuses about this and that.

715
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,934
That's fraud.

716
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,896
We did make a little profit
by selling used cars.

717
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,732
But I have never posted a fraudulent ad.

718
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:09,902
If you have evidence, let me see it.

719
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:13,363
Find each and every person
who claims to be swindled.

720
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,825
Collect every contract and bring them.

721
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,621
No, even if you bring them,

722
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:24,124
those contracts weren't made
because I told them to.

723
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,877
The ones who work for me
broke the law to make more profit.

724
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,214
How am I supposed to manage
every single one of them?

725
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,591
I will get you no matter what.

726
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:34,468
Yes, please do.

727
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,262
Don't exhaust yourself.

728
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:40,098
You need to leave some strength
for raising your kid.

729
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,231
The most important thing
is your eyes.

730
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,442
The eyes that make
the customers trust you.

731
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,278
Everyone, let's take
a break and have this.

732
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,364
- What is this?
- This?

733
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:57,824
Well, it's getting late, and for frau...

734
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,622
And for all of us
who are studying so hard,

735
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,707
I brought braised spicy chicken
for everyone!

736
00:43:08,418 --> 00:43:10,045
- Ooh...
- Ah.

737
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,760
This is so good.

738
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,804
Is this braised chicken or spaghetti?

739
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,264
Braised chicken or spaghetti?

740
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,707
Whatever it is, it's good
as the basic ingredients are good.

741
00:43:23,141 --> 00:43:24,810
A person is the same.

742
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:26,770
Did you memorize the basics?

743
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,023
Did you memorize them?

744
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,234
I did.

745
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:33,443
- She did.
- Okay.

746
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,445
Boss, you're back.

747
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,448
Are you back, boss?

748
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,410
Hun brought this and it's so good.
Would you like to have some?

749
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,496
Go ahead and eat.
I have no appetite right now.

750
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,124
What happened to the investigation
at the prosecutor's office?

751
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:59,094
Geumsik, you are moving up in the ranks.
You even ask me how I'm doing.

752
00:43:59,177 --> 00:44:01,513
I was just… worried.

753
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,475
Look at your sales.

754
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,896
Do you think I fed and raised you
for these lousy results?

755
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,980
I'm sorry.

756
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,483
If you're really worried,
bring in some money.

757
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,568
Yes, sir.

758
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,280
Sir, at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow...

759
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,865
Shut up.

760
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,367
Say those things elsewhere, okay?

761
00:44:23,785 --> 00:44:25,704
- I'm sorry, boss.
- Let's be careful.

762
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,456
Yes.

763
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,291
Our newbies, you should work hard too.

764
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:30,917
So you make a lot like your seniors.

765
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,794
- Yes, boss!
- Yes, boss!

766
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,755
- Keep eating.
- Have a good night.

767
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,299
- Good night.
- Please remember Hun!

768
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,889
LAWYER'S OFFICE, 2F

769
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,016
He's a nasty one.

770
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,019
Mr. Cheon, Mr. Sa, take a look at this.

771
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,898
There are lots of comments by victims.

772
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,777
There is this kind of fraud too.
I would fall for this too.

773
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,863
Ah, if it's this bad,
even I would fall for it.

774
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,283
Mr. Sa, you fell for it already.

775
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,580
This head of Yeongeun is
worse than I thought.

776
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,709
This market is not the only one he has.
He seems to be a middleman.

777
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,295
Hmm. Middleman for what?

778
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,255
I saw them preparing cash.

779
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,384
It's probably the bribe
they were paying the head above.

780
00:45:21,134 --> 00:45:23,970
Do whatever you can
to make 100 million by tomorrow.

781
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:28,392
These aren't neighborhood bullies.
They're a nationwide organization.

782
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,853
The leader of Yeongeun seems to be
the head of the Seoul region.

783
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,480
Then what do we do?

784
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:36,650
If we betray him,
he will cut off our fingers like…

785
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,029
Mr. Cheon, why don't we quit
after getting my money back?

786
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,031
I don't want to.

787
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,534
Mr. Cheon.

788
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,661
You're no longer a prosecutor.
What'll you do?

789
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,956
Mm, since I'm not a prosecutor,

790
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,128
I would have to call… a prosecutor.

791
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,089
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

792
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,854
Yejin, aren't you going home?

793
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,772
Yeah, after I read this a little more.

794
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:17,733
I think Yeowon will be waiting.

795
00:46:18,316 --> 00:46:21,319
Yeowon? She's okay. She's with her nanny.

796
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:29,494
From Yejin, to Yeowon.

797
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,914
From Minhyeok, to Yeowon.

798
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,503
- What is this?
- You said tomorrow is Yeonwon's birthday.

799
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:39,879
Go home.

800
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:43,717
Go home already.

801
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,512
I will review this
and take notes by tomorrow.

802
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,098
And you will read it tomorrow
and make a decision.

803
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:52,224
Dismissed.

804
00:46:59,357 --> 00:47:00,442
Thanks.

805
00:47:01,526 --> 00:47:02,846
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

806
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:06,948
We have a deal that could make or break
the fate of Yeongeun Market.

807
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,453
Who can make 100 million
in 30 minutes with this?

808
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:14,914
Is there no one?

809
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,583
I can do it.

810
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:26,885
Newbie?

811
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,639
I will come back
before this braised chicken cools.

812
00:47:35,977 --> 00:47:38,605
Are you here for a used car?

813
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:41,566
A used car is a war of nerves.
A used car is a war of nerves.

814
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,234
A used…

815
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:47,656
Min… Minhyeok?

816
00:47:48,406 --> 00:47:49,406
Jihun?

817
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,034
Minhyeok, why are you here?

818
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:52,661
Me? I'm here to buy a car.

819
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,538
But what are you doing here?

820
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,374
Me? Here, a used car is a war of nerves…

821
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,042
It looks like he knows him.

822
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,502
Actually,

823
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,964
my office rent is quite overdue.

824
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,926
Every once in a while,
I worked on the side at a dealer.

825
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:09,553
Really?

826
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,847
I thought I would meet
someone I knew eventually,

827
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,725
but it's very embarrassing…
now that I actually meet one.

828
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,686
What is there to be embarrassed about?

829
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,480
There's nothing embarrassing
about working side jobs for money.

830
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,234
Hey, hurry up and show me the car.
Where is it?

831
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:26,444
Let's go then. Over there.

832
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,782
When did you start working here?

833
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,742
It's been a while.

834
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,412
But that's not what's important.

835
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,086
What do you think?

836
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,380
Whoo!

837
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:48,675
I really like this one. I'll take it.

838
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:51,136
Okay, then let's sign...

839
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,638
What is this? Something was left out.

840
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,515
- Left out?
- Yes.

841
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,061
This car apparently
has a knocking in the engine.

842
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,229
Didn't you hear it?

843
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,439
I didn't hear anything.

844
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,983
Put your ear to the engine.

845
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,572
You can hear it, right?

846
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,616
There's a weird noise.

847
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,452
I know. Listen to it again.

848
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:21,750
Oh, my! There's a sound
coming from the center.

849
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,544
That's right.
That is exactly the spot, Minhyeok.

850
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,755
Darn it, where'd they get this car...

851
00:49:28,381 --> 00:49:29,925
Okay, Minhyeok.

852
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,178
There is a nice car
that is similar to this one.

853
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:34,930
How about looking at that one?

854
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,039
DRIVE WHEN THE LIGHT COMES ON

855
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:13,885
Whoa!

856
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,554
Minhyeok, this suits you so well.

857
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:19,182
This car has this thing right here.

858
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:22,519
These wings are its special point.

859
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,436
I agree.

860
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,314
It may not look like it,
but I think it could fly.

861
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,649
Mm-hm.

862
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,734
If I didn't run into you here,

863
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,195
I could have bought the car
that looks good on the outside,

864
00:50:32,278 --> 00:50:34,364
but makes a weird sound.

865
00:50:34,447 --> 00:50:36,491
If you did, you would've been lucky.

866
00:50:36,574 --> 00:50:38,118
- Luck what?
- Luck!

867
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,831
You would have been out of luck, silly.

868
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,626
Anyway, thanks.
Thanks to you, I got a good car.

869
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,547
Don't work here for too long,
even though you have overdue rent.

870
00:50:51,172 --> 00:50:53,216
You should stick to your day job. Okay?

871
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,759
Thanks.

872
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,928
If I were to offer you some advice,

873
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,597
you should drive slow because…

874
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,267
you could take off!

875
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:09,232
Okay, thanks. I'm going. Keep working.

876
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,362
That's me.

877
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,449
- Drive slow!
- Slowly.

878
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,743
Slowly!

879
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,371
You could take off! Bye…

880
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,915
Bye, Minhyeok.

881
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,000
Jihun.

882
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:28,668
Hey, newbie.

883
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,087
Here you go.

884
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,140
This guy is something else.

885
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:44,350
We filled the bribe quota, thanks to you.

886
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,144
Thank you.

887
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,771
Let's go!

888
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:50,815
Let's go!

889
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,444
Let's go, to get you guys.

890
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,126
- I bought the car.
- Mm.

891
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,212
Do you know who I ran into?

892
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,547
- Who?
- Cheon Jihun.

893
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,340
Oh.

894
00:52:16,382 --> 00:52:19,344
I guess he's having a hard time.
He was working as a salesman here.

895
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,353
Hi, Jihun.

896
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:32,148
Yejin, it's me.
I wanted to discuss something with you.

897
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,442
No. It's something similar.

898
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,069
But it's very important.

899
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:39,489
Let me experiment with this
and call you back.

900
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:53,461
Ooh.

901
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,214
This is the one.

902
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,384
Thanks to him, I got a good one.

903
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,927
- Ms. Na.
- Did you find it?

904
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,010
We found it.

905
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,223
- Find what?
- The money for your car.

906
00:53:05,306 --> 00:53:06,391
Close the door.

907
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:09,686
The money for my car?

908
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,979
Good work, Minhyeok.

909
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,231
What did I do?

910
00:53:13,898 --> 00:53:15,108
You did well.

911
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,399
Ms. Na.

912
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:58,860
Oh!

913
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,239
Let's go.

914
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,928
So, you're saying
this red dot is those cars.

915
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,597
- Yes.
- But why are we following them?

916
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,806
Be quiet.

917
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,558
- Catch up to them.
- Okay.

918
00:54:34,979 --> 00:54:36,397
Somebody tell me!

919
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,481
Be quiet!

920
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:56,167
UNDERGROUND PARKING

921
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:03,299
So, was all of this an operation?

922
00:55:04,842 --> 00:55:06,844
Then why did you leave me out?

923
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,513
Your acting makes it too obvious.

924
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,348
- Who said that?
- Someone.

925
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,103
It looks like all of our cars are in.

926
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,105
- What about backup?
- Not yet.

927
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,857
These guys are always late.

928
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,026
Being late is the rule with them.

929
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,319
I will call them again.

930
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,420
Ha!

931
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,598
What are you doing?

932
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,351
The body remembers.

933
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,521
Yejin, stay here. Let's go.

934
00:55:58,604 --> 00:55:59,856
Minhyeok.

935
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,941
We're storming them by ourselves?

936
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,652
There are 20 to 30 of them.
How many do we have?

937
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:07,280
Four.

938
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:09,282
- Then what should we do?
- We should wait.

939
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,533
Come back in here.

940
00:56:15,496 --> 00:56:16,706
What did they say?

941
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,169
RESTRICTED AREA, STAFF ONLY

942
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,046
Let's use this.

943
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,507
This will do, right?

944
00:56:27,091 --> 00:56:28,885
This will hold for a bit.

945
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,346
Do you think Mr. Cheon will be okay?

946
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,182
His fingers…

947
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,185
- That way.
- Right.

948
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,903
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you, sir.

949
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:53,409
Hey, newbie.

950
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,204
I think we will be
in first place, thanks to you.

951
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,747
Where did he go?

952
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,583
He was right here.

953
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,210
How unlucky.

956

The police are here!

957
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,675
- Hurry!
- Get in the car!

958
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,594
- This way!

959
00:57:11,677 --> 00:57:13,888

960

Jihun, move the car. The police are here!

963
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:51,843
Geumsik! I bought a used car yesterday.
But I think I got swindled.

964
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,095
- The car isn't moving!
- You drove it just now.

965
00:57:54,178 --> 00:57:55,430
But not anymore.

What are you saying? Get out.

967
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,851
- The door doesn't open!
- Hey, newbie.

968
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,145
What are you doing right now?

969
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,772
Boss, I think I was swindled
on a used car.

970
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,524
The car is not moving!

971
00:58:06,607 --> 00:58:08,526
You jerk, move the car!

972
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:09,609
Yes, you jerk!

973
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,738
Had you sold me a decent car,
it wouldn't have stalled

974
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,657
and blocked your path,

975
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,910
you… crook!

976
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:19,328
Not you, boss.

977
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:21,496
Get out.

978
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,583
Stupid bastard.

979
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,876
Get out...

980
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,502
The window works!

981
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,171
The window works.

982
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,006
Only the window works.

983
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:33,551
- Hey. Smash the car.
- Smash it!

984

Jihun!

987

Don't look back and go!

988
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,206
Hurry up and leave.

989
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:06,667
Jihun, you're not here.
Where have you gone?

990
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:10,838
This way, sir.

991
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,095
RESTRICTED AREA

992
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,322
Are you the Car King?

993
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,575
And this is the record book for bribes.

994
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,415
Minhyeok, what are you doing?

995
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,084
- Run!
- Get out of here!

JEIL LAUNDRY

997
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:05,393
Sing Sing gives me peace of mind.
It's the best.

998
01:00:06,143 --> 01:00:08,646
The best? I thought you wanted
to get a new car. Not anymore?

999
01:00:08,729 --> 01:00:10,356
Sing Sing may hear you.

1000
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:14,068
Mr. Sa, I think the air conditioner broke
in the past few days.

1001
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,778
How about getting a new car?

1002
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:18,114
Were you hot, Ms. Baek?
You should have said so.

1003
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,199
There. How is it? Isn't it cool?

1004
01:00:20,324 --> 01:00:21,909
The air is colder these days.

1005
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,203
You could get a cold
with the air conditioner on.

1006
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,747
At least, the windows are automatic.

1007
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,087
Mr. Cheon, tilt the rearview mirror in.

1008
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,046
Like this?

1009
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,382
A little more, a little more. Okay.

1010
01:00:36,465 --> 01:00:38,217
- I can see much better.
- Okay.

1011
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,262
I feel good.
Should we have some pork belly?

1012
01:00:41,345 --> 01:00:43,889
Pork belly is very good. Pork...

1013
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:47,393
Wait a minute. Ms. Baek said
she doesn't like pork belly a while ago.

1014
01:00:47,476 --> 01:00:48,476
Ms. Baek.

1015
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,105
How about tripe?

1016
01:00:51,188 --> 01:00:53,399
Tripe? I like tripe…

1017
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,567
Mr. Sa, how about tripe?

1018
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,319
Tripe, okay.

1019
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,696
Okay. Let's go have a tripe!

1020
01:00:58,779 --> 01:01:00,865
Let's go. I like tripe.

1021
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,450
I like tripe!

1022
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,165
Tripe is good.

01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,916
JEIL LAUNDRY

1024
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,502
- I like tripe.
- I like tripe.

1025
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:20,926
- Hi.
- You're back.

1026

You guys have to try this.

1027

What is this?

1028
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:27,016
The young man at the store gave it to me.

1029
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:28,934
He says it's good for your joints.

1030

What is it?

1031
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,147

on a regular basis to see the effect?

1035
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,823
Give me a few more.

Buy them yourself.

1037
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,829
You're so stingy.
Being stingy with food hurts the most.

The law has to change.

Mr. Cheon said,

1049
01:02:16,273 --> 01:02:19,151
the law of this country doesn't save
someone who had been swindled.

1050
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:22,738
So it's important not to be swindled.
You got that?

1051
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,383
- <i>A thorough research using the vehicle</i>
- Mm.

<i>Identification number is important.</i>

<i>The reason an investigation body exists…</i>

<i>…to protect the vulnerable…</i>

Minhyeok is pretty good now.

Right. What I meant was,

1060

Mari is a good fit for a lawyer.

1061
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:50,683
And Minhyeok was meant to be
a prosecutor, something like that.

- Yes. Let's come often.

Yes, that's it.

- I forgot.

1069

Didn't we come here

- Yes.
- I'm sorry. It slipped my mind.

1072

It looked so juicy and chewy,

1073
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,929
I couldn't help myself.

1074
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,849
Even if you were, it was Ms. Baek's piece!

Ms. Baek, don't be mad.
