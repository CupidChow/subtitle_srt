00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,420
EPISODE 2

13
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,264
This is your evidence?

14
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,726
Yes. Do you object to the submission

15
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,436
of this evidence?

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,984
Will the prosecution accept it?

17
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:09,819
Yes.

18
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,742
(tense music)

19
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,705
Your Honor,
and ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

20
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,248
look very carefully.

21
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,836
The evidence to prove
the defendant's innocence is in this box.

22
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,724
Is there anything in it?

23
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,019
-No.
-What do you see?

24
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,646
I don't see anything.

25
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,940
Yes, that's right. As you have all seen,

26
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:51,194
there isn't a single evidence
to prove the defendant's innocence.

27
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,029
(murmuring)

28
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,532
There's no evidence proving his innocence,

29
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,118
so, we can think that the defendant
is guilty, can't we?

30
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,747
Then, you are all making the assumption
that the defendant is guilty.

31
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,751
However, in Korean Law,
one is innocent until proven guilty,

32
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,628
but one isn't guilty
until proven innocent.

33
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,421
What I'm saying is,

34
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:14,968
just because the defendant
has four previous convictions,

35
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:19,264
none of us should presume
that he is guilty.

36
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,015
Article 307 of the Criminal Procedure Act,

37
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,101
"Fact-finding must be based on evidence."

38
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,727
It's the principle of trial by evidence.

39
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,813
We don't presume one's guilt,

40
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,858
but it must be proven
through definitive evidence

41
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,901
and it is up to the prosecutor…

42
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:34,988
to prove his guilt.

43
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,823
All right, Prosecutor Baek.

44
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,952
Please put in the evidence
that the defendant is guilty

45
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,912
into this box.

46
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,206
(tense music continues)

47
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,424
There is…

48
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,093
no evidence.

49
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,893
There's only the witness's testimony that
the defendant tried to steal his wallet.

50
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,227
Objection.

51
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,189
If this was a case about theft,

52
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,899
we'd have clear evidence,

53
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,609
but it was only attempted,

54
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,069
so, we can only judge
by circumstantial evidence.

55
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,905
Yes, that's a great point.

56
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:21,075
That's all the more reason
for you to prove

57
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,912
whether the defendant had any motive

58
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,080
to steal.

59
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,208
That way, as the prosecution claimed,

60
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,337
the theft attempt charge would be
proven to be true.

61
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,838
The defendant has already

62
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,841
admitted his guilt and confessed
while being examined by the prosecution.

63
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,051
Why would he have done that?

64
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,928
Article 12, Section 7 of the Constitution,

65
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,598
"If the defendant's confession
was due to torture, assault, threat,

66
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,808
prolonged imprisonment,
or deception, etc.,

67
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,519
and it seemed as though
it wasn't a willful confession,

68
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:53,024
it cannot be used to prove his guilt
nor can it be used to penalize him."

69
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,277
Are you suggesting
the possibility of torture or assault?

70
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,906
Do you think one makes false confessions
only because of torture or assault?

71
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,534
Didn't you placate the defendant
by promising him that if he confesses,

72
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,703
he'll be given some leniency?

73
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,373
Think of your family.

74
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,209
It says you have a daughter and a wife.

75
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,884
The defendant was presumably caught
in the act and arrested on the spot.

76
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:24,305
After that, he was questioned
while being in custody for 36 days.

77
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,724
There was no way for him
to prove his innocence,

78
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,477
and the only thing he could do
was ask for leniency.

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,479
Under these frustrating circumstances,

80
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,816
what if he was approached
by the prosecutor with an offer?

81
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,902
The counsel is speaking
as though his speculation is a fact.

82
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,237
JUDGE: Sustained.

83
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,072
Take caution, counsel.

84
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,699
Yes.

85
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,038
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

86
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,874
the prosecutors will soon
question the defendant.

87
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,086
What you must carefully watch for…

88
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:01,259
isn't whether the defendant seems
like a person who might steal a wallet.

89
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,889
You must carefully watch to see
if the defendant really did get caught

90
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,267
stealing the wallet. Thank you.

91
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,020
Prosecution, you may proceed.

92
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,398
MARI: Defendant.

93
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,527
You have a total of 13 million won
of outstanding hospital bills.

94
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,739
So, how much did you save for two months
after you got out of prison?

95
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,949
(sighs)

96
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,661
Did you do your best as a father?

97
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,249
Weren't you neglecting your duty
as a father?

98
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,502
(tense music)

99
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,047
Objection.

100
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,341
The question is unrelated to this case.

101
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,469
Is the defendant in trial
for being an incapable father?

102
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,346
As the counsel said,

103
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,807
this case is limited to
being judged by circumstantial evidence.

104
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:54,604
Because of that, we must consider
the situation the defendant was in,

105
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,816
as we can know the reason or motive
behind the action.

106
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,320
The counsel's objection is overruled.

107
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,702
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

108
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,996
JUDGE: <i>Counsel, you may cross-examine him.</i>

109
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,708
JIHUN: Defendant, you have been convicted
four times for theft, haven't you?

110
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,544
-Yes.
-Then, when you pickpocketed in the past,

111
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,213
where did you usually do it?

112
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,631
Mr. Cheon.

113
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,594
Isn't that a question
the prosecutor should ask?

114
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,179
Please answer, defendant.

115
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,643
Department stores, hotel saunas, banks…

116
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,852
Places like that.

117
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,355
-What was the reason?
-Because I made good money.

118
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,940
-You made good money?
-Yes.

119
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,903
So, rather than subway stations
or the restrooms at Seoul Station,

120
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,740
you preferred department stores or hotels
where you could make good money.

121
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,619
Then, when you pickpocketed in the past,

122
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,664
did you ever get caught in the act?

123
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,083
-No.
-Why is that?

124
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,252
Well…

125
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,712
Defendant, what was your nickname
when you pickpocketed?

126
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,050
Please answer.

127
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,305
It was "Invisible Hand."

128
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,850
-(chuckles)
-(snickers)

129
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,810
Invisible Hand?

130
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,645
It isn't "Invisible Love," everyone.

131
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,939
It was because he was so fast.

132
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,316
His hand was so fast
that you couldn't see it move.

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,028
So, how could he get caught
when he's the Invisible Hand?

134
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,866
Could the defendant who was
called Invisible Hand

135
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,909
-drunkenly steal the witness'--
-Your Honor.

136
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,706
During this incident, the defendant was
caught using his left hand

137
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,749
as he had injured his right hand.

138
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,336
Yes, that's right. During the incident,
the defendant did injure his right hand.

139
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,423
Defendant, how did you injure
your right hand?

140
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,429
Please answer.

141
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,474
After I got out this time…

142
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,309
I'm so happy you're here.

143
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,352
I was going to clean up my act.

144
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,896
I'm sorry, Somi.

145
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,440
No one believed me, though.

146
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,235
Be here for my birthday this year.

147
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,695
SOMI: Promise.

148
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,117
That's why I crushed my hand with a rock.

149
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,495
Objection.

150
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,373
It's a testimony
that cannot be proven in court.

151
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,627
He could have hurt his hand
while he was working.

152
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,003
Sustained.

153
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,087
JIHUN:Sustain what?

154
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,883
I didn't do it,
so what are you sustaining?

155
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,301
JUDGE: Defendant.

156
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,553
You treat me like a criminal already,

157
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,805
so what's the point of having a trial?

158
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,390
JUDGE: Order, defendant!

159
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,059
I really didn't do it!

160
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,936
If you don't calm down, you'll be removed.

161
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,522
Do you know how it feels
to be sitting here?

162
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,733
To you high-and-mighty people, I'm nothing
but a convicted piece of trash.

163
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,818
JUDGE: Bailiff, remove him from court.

164
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,571
(melancholy music)

165
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,032
JIHUN: Mr. Lee Myeongho,

166
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,577
remember what I said

167
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,205
earlier.

168
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,832
JIHUN: <i>You promised me.</i>

169
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,210
Keep that promise.

170
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:08,172
I'll keep the promise
I made to your daughter to meet you.

171
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,632
How on earth will you do that?

172
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,636
Please sit.

173
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,518
Your Honor and people of the jury,
I apologize.

174
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,146
I apologize on my defendant's behalf
for his outburst.

175
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,109
Your Honor, I have one last question
to the victim who happens to be

176
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,027
the only witness.

177
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,655
Witness, please approach the stand.

178
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,826
Please close your eyes.

179
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,536
Why should I do that?

180
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,455
It is to more thoroughly understand
the circumstances

181
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,082
surrounding the case once again.

182
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,542
(scoffs)

183
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,336
All right. Let's say that

184
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,298
this place is Seoul Station's restroom
on the day of the incident.

185
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,010
-Was the restroom completely empty?
-Yes.

186
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,471
-You were urinating by yourself.
-Yes.

187
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,765
But you claim that the defendant

188
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,768
-grabbed your wallet from behind, right?
-Yes.

189
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,105
Even though you were drunk,
you sensed something was wrong,

190
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,648
so you caught him.

191
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,899
Yes.

192
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,444
But…

193
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,240
why couldn't you feel it just now?

194
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,451
You had…

195
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,203
puffer fish stew for lunch today.

196
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,457
By the way, I like puffer fish stew too.
It's very delicious.

197
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,876
You may go back, defendant.

198
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,420
This is your wallet, isn't it?

199
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,341
What the heck are you doing?

200
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,843
How can you do this
in this sacred court of law?

201
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,928
I was checking something.

202
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,472
Checking what?

203
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,849
Were you checking to see
if he was good at pickpocketing?

204
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,435
Yes, that is exactly right.

205
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:48,606
I wanted to check how good
the defendant was at pickpocketing,

206
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,982
and at the same time,

207
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:55,571
I wanted to check how you reacted
when you weren't drunk as well.

208
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,324
Your Honor,

209
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,120
the counsel is distorting the truth
of this case.

210
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,916
When someone closes their eyes,
their other senses become more sensitive.

211
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,626
But as you just saw,

212
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,879
despite being completely sober,

213
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:15,883
the witness didn't feel the defendant
stealing his wallet at all.

214
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,218
That night,

215
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,887
<i>the witness was drunk</i>

216
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,098
<i>and he was in a bathroom
filled with various noises,</i>

217
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,476
<i>but he felt the defendant grab his wallet,
so he caught him.</i>

218
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,186
MYEONGHO: Are you okay?

219
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,145
Everyone,

220
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,399
the defendant is
a four-time convict of thievery.

221
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,859
But this is the first time

222
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,612
he was caught in the act like this.

223
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,533
Why is that? Why wasn't he
ever caught in the act before?

224
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,035
It's because…

225
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,996
he was truly an expert.

226
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,958
The man who's called the Invisible Hand

227
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,128
was caught trying to pickpocket
the drunk witness's wallet?

228
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,216
Well, if the defendant really wanted
to steal the witness's wallet,

229
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,845
would he really have been caught
by the drunk witness?

230
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,140
I think this is a reasonable doubt

231
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,184
that we must have towards this case.

232
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,520
I rest my case.

233
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,523
(upbeat music)

234
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,038
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

235
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,041
Why aren't you staying until the end?

236
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,295
Mari wouldn't want me to watch.

237
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,338
(chuckles)

238
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,924
I can't believe he made him
pickpocket someone in court.

239
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,134
How typical of him.

240
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,844
You remember, don't you?

241
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,596
Yes.

242
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,016
He acted so proud.
I guess no one wanted him.

243
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,227
Find out where he's working.

244
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,021
You don't want to recruit him, do you?

245
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,024
Do you think he would join us
if we asked him?

246
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,026
-Then, why…
-(laughs)

247
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,319
Let's go.

248
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,282
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I'm sure there are some of you who wonder

249
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,368
why we have to punish someone
for just an attempted crime.

250
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,207
But in cases of repeated theft
like the defendant,

251
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,543
the law has stipulated that
one can't simply get off

252
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,212
because it was an attempted crime.

253
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,549
That's because the nature of the crime
isn't lessened because it was an attempt.

254
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,429
If the defendant hasn't been reformed
after going to prison four times before,

255
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,015
it would be best for him

256
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,894
to go through the correctional system
again and come out as a reformed person.

257
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,525
Therefore, the prosecution thinks

258
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,443
that someone who repeatedly
committed theft

259
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,403
or has attempted it

260
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,988
must be punished in accordance with

261
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,032
Act on the Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Crimes

262
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,785
which states they must serve
a life sentence or over three years,

263
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,746
so I'd like to demand the defendant
to serve five years in prison.

264
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,625
(breathes deeply)

265
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,669
Your Honor,
and ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

266
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,131
our law requires the prosecution
to prove the defendant's guilt

267
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,885
beyond any reasonable doubt.

268
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,346
"When in doubt,
rule in favor of the defendant."

269
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,016
When it's doubtful, it should be
beneficial towards the defendant.

270
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,771
That's because it's the principle
of Criminal Law.

271
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,900
Why should it be favorable
to the defendant when in doubt?

272
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,153
What if we really let go
of a guilty person?

273
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,407
It would be a relief
to lock the defendant up

274
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,868
rather than set him free, right?

275
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,203
"Who told him to do something suspicious?"

276
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,915
"I'll never do anything suspicious,
so it has nothing to do with me."

277
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,584
No, no.

278
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,920
That's not right.

279
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,630
It is important

280
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,426
for our law to punish
someone who committed a crime.

281
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,720
(Jihun sighs)

282
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,014
But it is more important…

283
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,644
to not punish someone
who didn't commit the crime.

284
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,148
Even if we lose ten criminals,
"we shouldn't wrongfully imprison

285
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,234
even one person."

286
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,570
I'm sure you've heard that before
at least once.

287
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,699
In order to do that, our law requires
that if it is even remotely doubtful,

288
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,577
it should judge favorably
to the defendant.

289
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,414
"When in doubt,
rule in favor of the defendant."

290
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,043
That principle will one day protect

291
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,256
someone most dear to you
at the most important moment.

292
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,967
Meaning, our very selves.

293
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,847
(uplifting music)

294
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,158
JUDGE: <i>They have reached a verdict.</i>

295
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,159
OPERATING ROOM

296
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,786
<i>According to the jury,</i>

297
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,956
the verdict that they reached unanimously…

298
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,457
PROSECUTION

299
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,460
…regarding Defendant Lee Myeongho
who was charged with theft

300
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,213
under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Crimes...

301
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,050
(shaky breathing)

302
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,720
...he is found not guilty.

303
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,014
Yes!

304
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,432
(chortling)

305
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,602
The witness may have misunderstood
the defendant's attempt

306
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:23,565
to help the witness who was stumbling
as trying to steal his wallet,

307
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,778
so the prosecutor's charges
are difficult to prove

308
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,781
beyond reasonable doubt.

309
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,408
Defendant.

310
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,078
No, Mr. Lee Myeongho.

311
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,998
After the trial, the prosecution
will take steps

312
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,000
to release you immediately.

313
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,670
Thank you.

314
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,338
You've been through a lot.

315
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,634
(breathes deeply)

316
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,180

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

318
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,728
MYEONGHO: Thank you, Mr. Cheon.

319
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,273
Don't worry too much.
It'll be difficult for them to appeal.

320
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,484
You should hurry.
I was told that Somi's surgery went well.

321
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,738
Really? I'll get going.

322
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,614
Thank you. Thank you.

323
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,661
Thank you.

324
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,875
Congratulations, Mr. Cheon Jihun.

325
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,336
What are you congratulating me for?
Is this something to be congratulated?

326
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,671
Ah.

327
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,298
You're right.

328
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,466
Let's shake hands!

329
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,509
(chortling)

330
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,388
-Okay.
-Ms. Baek.

331
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,848
Are you going to appeal?

332
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,893
If you aren't,
quickly give him the final ruling.

333
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,980
You know that Mr. Lee's daughter,
Somi, needs those medical bills.

334
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,441
Let's let them receive indemnification.

335
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,776
Indemnification?

336
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,278
Yes, it's usually five times
the minimum wage.

337
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,655
Mr. Sa. How much is
the minimum wage this year?

338
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,532
-It's 9,160 won.
-What is five times of that?

339
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,450
It's 45,800 won.

340
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,661
-Since you work eight hours a day…
-That's 366,400 won.

341
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,498
-And 36 days of that?
-It would be 13,190,400 won.

342
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,625
Lastly, how much is
Somi's medical bills until now?

343
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:09,088
It's 13,008,128 won!

344
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,923
Then, her medical bills
have been sorted out!

345
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,092
(both chortling, cheering)

346
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,178
-What are you doing?
-You're the best, Mr. Cheon!

347
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,598
It's because I'm so thankful to you

348
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,266
for taking care of Somi's medical bills.

349
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,769
I'm starting to get hungry.

350
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,437
I know. What should we eat?

351
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,231
Do you like <i>jjajangmyeon</i>, Ms. Baek?

352
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,650
No, I don't like <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

353
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,819
You don't like <i>jjajangmyeon</i>?

354
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,196
-Then…
-Then,

355
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,533
what about pork belly at my place?
It's been a while.

356
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,951
Do you like pork belly?

357
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,745
(scoffs)
Even if I did, why would I go there?

358
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,539
I was just asking. What's wrong?

359
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,790
Let's go, Mr. Sa.

360
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,417
(victorious music)

361
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,379
MARI: Hang on a minute.

362
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,675
Do you really think
Mr. Lee Myeongho didn't try to steal it?

363
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,427
You think he did it,

364
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,596
but his situation was so pitiful that

365
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,306
you wanted to help him, didn't you?

366
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,478
Ms. Baek,

367
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,190
isn't that question a bit lame?

368
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,945
Neither you or I can
define the truth on our own.

369
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,656
All we can do is
to try to get close to it.

370
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,950
I think that I got

371
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,495
a little closer to it than you this time.

372
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,538
Good job, though.

373
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:30,043
MUJANG: It has been so long
since we had pork belly with soju.

374
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,336
JIHUN: Is it frozen or refrigerated?

375
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,671
It's refrigerated, of course.

376
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,007
Then, hurry up and call your wife.

377
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,509
JIHUN: I hit my knee on my way up here.

378
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,635
MUJANG: Okay.

379
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,442
Somi, are you okay?

380
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,905
Somi, do your recognize Mommy and Daddy?

381
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,371
Somi, you won't be sick anymore.

382
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,334
I won't go anywhere from now on.
I promise, okay?

383
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,298
(sentimental music)

384
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,639
(keyboard clacking)

385
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,685
MARI: <i>As it will be an objection
to the next case's judgment,</i>

386
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,687
<i>I'd like to appeal this case.</i>

387
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,405
PROSECUTOR: BAEK MARI
DEFENDANT: LEE MYEONGHO

388
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,159
JIHUN: <i>Neither you or I can
define the truth on our own.</i>

389
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,120
All we can do is
to try to get close to it.

390
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,539
I think that I got

391
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,876
a little closer to it than you this time.

392
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,087
(sighs)

393
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,100
(sentimental music continues)

394
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,692
(inaudible chatter)

395
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,686
INVESTIGATOR: I'm so sad to see you leave.

396
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,438
I know.

397
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,483
You came when we were busy,
so all you did was work.

398
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,942
You've all worked hard.

399
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,071
Good job these last two months.

400
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,656
It's a souvenir
for being a probationary judicial officer.

401
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,494
Hey.

402
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,788
I'D LIKE TO APPEAL THIS CASE.

403
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,707
(sighs)

404
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,261
YEJIN: <i>Withdrawal of appeal.</i>

405
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,889
It's a tough decision
for a prosecutor to make

406
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,141
because it's as if you're admitting
that you were wrong.

407
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,104
That was the most prosecutor thing
you've done, Baek Mari.

408
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,858
Don't forget why you decided
to withdraw the appeal.

409
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,693
When you lose focus, look at that.

410
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,320
Okay.

411
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,697
(blows air, chuckles)

412
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,618
(somber music)

413
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,078
(sighs)

414
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,672
(Minah gasping)

415
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,715
(Minah exclaims)

416
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,926
-(grunts)
-(scoffs)

417
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,387
Isn't it a bit much?

418
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,225
If not you, who would be able
to handle something like this?

419
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,520
I'm okay with it,
but I'm worried about Grandpa.

420
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,231
That gives you all the more reason
to stand out.

421
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,859
All right.

422
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,195
-(gasping, exclaiming)
-(chuckles)

423
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,905
Go to work like this?

424
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,782
Haven't you seen George Clooney's wife?

425
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,536
She's a lawyer, but she's always
in the news for what she's wearing.

426
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,038
Enjoy being in the news, Mom.

427
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,292
-You look nice.
-You brat.

428
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,044
-Doesn't she look good?
-It looks so good on her.

429
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,504
-We'll take this.
-Yes, ma'am.

430
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,672
Let's go see something else.

431
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,216
-I said it's a bit much.
-What about that one?

432
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,635
-Let me just pick.
-What about that?

433
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,763
(upbeat music)

434
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,130
MARI: Ladies.

435
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,924
-Hey, Mari.
-Hey.

436
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,051
-Sorry I'm late.
-No, not at all.

437
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,303
-Why do you look so pretty today?
-Do I look okay?

438
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,472
-Of course.
-Let's go.

439
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,559
(upbeat music continues)

440
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,400
HYUNMU: <i>Ms. Lee Bokyung, I heard</i>

441
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,571
that you are interested in finance,
so I've assigned you to that team.

442
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:37,077
And Ms. Yoo Semi and Ms. Oh Jiyoung,

443
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,956
you've been assigned
to the corporate services team.

444
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,333
Please use this.

445
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,668
(chuckles)

446
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,586
How is it? Do you like it?

447
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,963
ALL: Yes.

448
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,422
What about me?

449
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,301
When the three of you leave,
they'll show you where to go.

450
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,513
-Yes.
-All right. Thank you.

451
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,597
Bye.

452
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,809
(chuckles)

453
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,940
You could have just told me, Grandpa.

454
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,195
Ms. Baek Mari.

455
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,114
Yes?

456
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,869
It turns out you can't be
a probationary employee here.

457
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,706
What? Grandpa.

458
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,791
There you go again.

459
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,129
You promised not to call me Grandpa here.

460
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,798
Yes, Mr. Baek.

461
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,883
Why can't be a probationary employee here?

462
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:39,848
You are going to work
at a far better place, Ms. Baek.

463
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,933
A better place than here?

464
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,435
(clears throat)

465
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,980
(whimsical music)

466
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,441
Here.

467
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,278
You can go to that place.

468
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,326
SEOUL JONGNO-GU, PUNGJIN-RO 100, ROOM 201

469

470
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,001

00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,585
-Darn it. Are you going to be like this?
-(door rattles)

480
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,671
-(thuds)
-I can't let this go on any longer,

481
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,506
so either pay the overdue rent
or move out.

482
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,758
You'd better not give me any excuses.

483
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,385
They're unbelievable.

484
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,429
Geez. I'm sick and tired of them.

485
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,307
(sighs)

486
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:10,313
YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE LAWYER'S OFFICE, 2F

487
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,607
(scoffs)

488
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,275
MARI: This can't be right.

489
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,278
(clears throat)

490
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,909
Anyone there? Is no one there?

491
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,623
Of course not. Who'd come here?
I bet they went out of business long ago.

492
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,960
Since they went out of business,
how can I be a probationary employee?

493
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,380
Grandpa must've gotten it all wrong.
Even if I wanted to work here, I couldn't.

494
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,469
-(lock clicks)
-(door opens, creaks)

495
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,515
-Is she gone?
-She's gone.

496
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,059
-But there's a strange woman there.
-(gasping)

497
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,644
Who is it? Is it her daughter?

498
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,404
Oh, my gosh. This is insane.

499
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,573
HYUNMU: <i>If you can't
last two months there,</i>

500
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,493
don't even think of coming back to Baek.

501
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,331
I am counting on you, Mari.

502
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,168
(quirky music)

503
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,962
(sighs)

504
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,214
This is the last time, Grandpa.

505
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,677
(blows air)

506
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,060
(sighs)

507
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,606
(quirky music continues)

508
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,030
(ominous music)

509
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,830
(bottle clatters)

510
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,711
MUJANG (whispers):
Is that prosecutor Ms. Cho's daughter?

511
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,757
Is the prosecutor from that time
Ms. Cho's daughter?

512
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:02,801
JIHUN (whispers): Hide!

513
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,677
Excuse me.

514
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,182
Uh…

515
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,895
Oh, you were Ms. Cho's daughter, Ms. Baek.

516
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,480
(laughing nervously)

517
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,735
(gasps)
Oh!

518
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,153
Hello.
(chuckles)

519
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,697
(lively music)

520
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,621
So,

521
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,708
you're saying that you aren't
Ms. Cho's daughter, right?

522
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:40,129
My goodness. I got scared
for no reason at all.

523
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,465
You don't look that feeble.

524
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,925
Feeble?

525
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,679
She picks things up quicker
than she looks.

526
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,015
Anyway, this is your office, right?

527
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,892
(groans, scorns)

528
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,687
Is this a coffee house or an office?
What's wrong with this place?

529
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,439
Look, I get that it's dirty
and looks like a coffee house.

530
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,900
But please don't insult
someone else's office.

531
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,278
It's a precious place for me.

532
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,989
I said it the way it is.
Why are you being so sensitive?

533
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,243
All right. Anyway,

534
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,830
what brings your high-and-mighty self
to our humble office?

535
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,457
Do you want to work
as a probationary employee?

536
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,168
(comical music)

537
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,881
Sorry. My joke went too far.

538
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:27,176
Come on, Jihun.
Ms. Baek, what brings you here?

539
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,012
(laughs)

540
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,222
Your joke did go too far.

541
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,057
MARI: You see…

542
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,520
-You see.
-Yes?

543
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:47,572
Never mind. I think my GPS
gave me the wrong directions. Bye.

544
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,161
Isn't this hers?

545
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,538
Let me see.

546
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:58,958
What is this?

547
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,003
Hey, don't…

548
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,129
Don't touch that.

549
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,381
Don't open it!

550
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,051
Don't open--

551
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,599
(thuds)

552
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,270
(whimpers)

553
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,154
Are you okay? Are you okay, Ms. Baek?

554
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,447
JIHUN: It must've been quite a shock.

555
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,531
Are you okay?

556
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,577
I'm fine.

557
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,790
Oh, she came here to work
as a probationary employee.

558
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:42,961
(sighs)

559
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,005
Gosh, she photoshopped her photo.
Look at that jawline.

560
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,760
MARI: What are you talking about?

561
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,512
I don't want to be
a probationary employee.

562
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,098
It says it there that you want to do that.

563
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,059
(sighs)
This is insane.

564
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,853
Look, I totally understand.
This is an insane situation for you.

565
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:05,358
It won't be easy to work
at such a dirty, coffee house-like place.

566
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,735
Even if you wanted to work here,
I have to let you do that.

567
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,114
But it won't be easy to get my permission.

568
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,157
What will you do, Ms. Baek?

569
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,368
Should I give you the job or not?

570
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,036
(chortling)

571
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,913
-(Mujang laughs nervously)
-(scoffs)

572
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,498
How embarrassing.

573
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,085
-Isn't it funny?
-It isn't funny. Stop.

574
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,587
You can't do this
on your own anyway, Mr. Cheon.

575
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,090
MUJANG: It'll be nice to work together.

576
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,218
If you get a case early in the morning,
it'll be better to accept it together.

577
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,637
What is there not to like about this?

578
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,805
You two have teamed up.

579
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,850
Mr. Sa. What is good
about working together?

580
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,643
It's only good if she's good at her job.

581
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,437
Didn't you see her at court?
She's horrible.

582
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,856
-(scoffs)
-(mouthing)

583
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,525
There must have been a misunderstanding.

584
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,694
You know what "misunderstanding" means,
don't you?

585
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,487
I know. You don't mean it, do you?

586
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,990
Are you crazy?
Why would I want to work here?

587
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,533
And under you at that?

588
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,618
You see that?

589
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,747
I said I'd give her the job,
but she says she doesn't want it.

590
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,707
What can I do? Hmm.

591
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,168
The door is over there.

592
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,132
Why don't you clean up?
Who would come to an office like this?

593
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,677
You should pay your overdue rent
and clean up this mess, okay?

594
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,471
Okay.

595
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,307
Say all you want to say before you go.

596
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,896
-(clanks)
-But…

597
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,398
(door slams)

598
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,610
Come on. Is it good?

599
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,153
I'm just eating it.

600
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,826
Geez. Why is that guy here?

601
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,204
Darn it! This is going too far, Grandpa.

602
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:52,965
MARI: Grandpa!

603
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,176
How could you do that to me?

604
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,844
Back already?

605
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,638
Why? He wouldn't let you work there?

606
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,598
-What?
-Gosh.

607
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,520
I was worried as I sent you there
without any notice.

608
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,648
I thought you'd be able
to handle that on your own.

609
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,857
Grandpa, you see--

610
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,985
I know. He saw how you were
during the trial, so--

611
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,988
No. I don't want to work there. Me.

612
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,907
Why not?

613
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,910
I don't want to work for someone who
picks up after others for chump change.

614
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,037
Then, what about you
who lost to a lawyer like that?

615
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,706
That time, I was…

616
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,043
Even I would have lost that trial

617
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,422
to that lawyer who picks up
after others for chump change.

618
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,967
How much a lawyer makes

619
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,637
doesn't define the skills of that lawyer.

620
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,223
I know that too, but he's kind of weird.

621
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,599
His office is dirty too.

622
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,352
It's only two months, no more than that.

623
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,688
You still can't do it?

624
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,605
(sighs)

625
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,525
Why do you want me to work there so much?

626
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,237
Mmm...
(clicks tongue)

627
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,698
That's because…

628
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,201
he's the kind of lawyer we don't have
at Baek.

629
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,500
(sighs)

630
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,298
MR. SEO: My goodness. My son has been
working so hard, hasn't he?

631
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,717
(wincing)
MINHYEOK: No, I haven't.

632
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,888
I know you have. Your look so worn out.

633
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,890
I'm too old for this.

634
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,767
Get married and have a child.
You'll know how cute they are.

635
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,227
I should get married, right?

636
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,854
-Of course.
-That's why I bought it.

637
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,147
-What?
-Hang on.

638
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,236
Ta-da!

639
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,572
I'm going to propose to Mari.

640
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,865
Propose?

641
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,284
Yes. It's time for me to do it.

642
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,286
This would be good enough, won't it?

643
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,080
-How much was it?
-This? 50,000 dollars.

644
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,083
Come on, son. I told you to be frugal.

645
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,169
It's all an investment.

646
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,754
That isn't investment.

647
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,007
Anyway, a ring costs as much as a car?

648
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,135
I think it would be less than
what you lost trading stocks.

649
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,180
Did you know about that? Mom too?

650
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,265
If Mom knew, you wouldn't be here.

651
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,185
Even so, 50,000 dollars is too much.

652
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,980
Dad, if you want to get a woman like Mari,

653
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,024
you have to spend this much.

654
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,693
Didn't you say you wanted

655
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,948
to change Baek Law Firm
into Baek & Seo Law Firm?

656
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,037
You're all grown up, Minhyeok.

657
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,957
I think I'm still growing. Let's go.

658
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,500
(laughs)

659
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,377
-Do you think you can do it?
-Of course.

660
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,004
-I'm almost there.
-Good.

661
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,091
YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE

662
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,093
(sighs)

663
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,886
Two months.

664
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,849
For two months.

665
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,900
Hey, Mr. Cheon.
(chuckles)

666
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,497
(eerie music)

667
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,675
LAWYER'S OFFICE, 2F

668
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,177
Where the heck did he go? Hmm.

669
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,764
(comical music)

670
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,941
Thank you.

671
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,526
Continue your conversation.

672
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,676
OFFICE MANAGER, SA MUJANG

673
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,596
CHIEF COUNSEL, CHEON JIHUN

674
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,185
Hey.

675
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,562
What are you doing right now?

676
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,857
(gasps)
You're here, Mr. Cheon Jihun.

677
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,696
(grunts)

678
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,698
I was just cleaning.

679
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,033
Why were you cleaning?

680
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,743
I can't work in a dirty environment.

681
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,578
Who's going to work
in a dirty environment?

682
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,207
I'd like to work
as a probationary employee here.

683
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,545
(both laughing)

684
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,174
Did the GPS direct you correctly today?

685
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,803
You came by the same office again,
you know.

686
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,181
Didn't you say you couldn't
work in an office like this?

687
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,517
You were the one...

688
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,935
(clacks)

689
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,269
...who insulted my sacred office.

690
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,606
Coming here all of a sudden
and being like this is so…

691
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,275
awfully shameless.

692
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,652
(scoffs)

693
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,780
Yes. I'm sorry about yesterday.

694
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:12,368
However, regardless of how sorry I am,
I am actually shameless.

695
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,285
Is there a problem?

696
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,955
This confidence. I like it very much.

697
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:19,750
Then, may I ask you
for a cup of coffee, Mari?

698
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,504
(comical music)

699
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,383
(water sloshing)

700
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,721
Thanks. Have a seat.

701
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,516
Mmm.

702
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,686
Hmm, nice aroma.

703
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,021
(slurps, gulps)

704
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,148
Ow, hot.

705
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,484
Mari, I'm curious of something.
Let me ask you.

706
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,697
-Yes?
-Why do you really want to work here?

707
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,992
Yes, well… You see.

708
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,452
Well?

709
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,580
-The truth is--
-You haven't been recruited

710
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,874
elsewhere as long as you
worked here temporarily, no?

711
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,419
Answer the question.

712
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,507
(whimsical music)

713
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,845
After I saw how you did your best
during the trial,

714
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,430
I wanted to learn from you.

715
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,975
That's why I came here to see you
even curbing my embarrassment.

716
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,143
Mmm.

717
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,522
But your face speaks otherwise.
Your lips are very tight.

718
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,941
-Hmm?
-Mmm...

719
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,446
Good. That's very good.
I really like that attitude.

720
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,493
But let me tell you why you cannot
work here as a probationary employee.

721
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:39,246
Didn't you say that I was a weird lawyer?

722
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,082
What kind of a lunatic lawyer
asks for a jury trial?

723
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,462
Didn't you say I lack dignity?

724
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,464
There are so many weird lawyers
that lack dignity.

725
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,633
Isn't there a certain level
of professional standard?

726
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,969
If you work for a lawyer
that is weird and undignified,

727
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,847
that's no good.

728
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,190
When did I say that?

729
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,985
Didn't you say that at court yesterday?

730
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,612
When did I say that?

731
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,407
That time.

732
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,827
(whimsical music continues)

733
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,914
MUJANG: Oh, my!

734
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,251
Welcome, Mari!
(chortling)

735
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:29,672
My goodness. You are so welcome here.
(laughs)

736
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,133
How did our office become so clean?

737
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,469
-Did you clean the office?
-Yes.

738
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,721
If this is what you did on your first day,

739
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,723
I can't wait to see
how things will change here.

740
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,226
(laughs)
You are so lucky, Mr. Cheon.

741
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,978
I'm so jealous.

742
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,398
Please look after me too, Ms. Baek.

743
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,275
Yes.
(chuckles)

744
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,736
Mr. Sa. Are you the one who hires
the probationary employee?

745
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,905
No way.

746
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,865
You can't work here.

747
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,868
I'm going to work here.
I already cleaned the place up.

748
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,704
No.

749
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,289
I will.

750
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:05,791
Hmm?

751
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,670
(door rattling)

752
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,095
(rattling continues)

753
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,060
Is it her?

754
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,688
It's her.

755
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,732
(thuds)

756
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,277
(foreboding music)

757
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,253
(sniffs)

758
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,547
Did something happen to these guys?

759
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,549
How did it get so clean?

760
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,177
Gosh. They finally listened to me.

761
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,389
You're the lady from yesterday.
Did Mr. Cheon go somewhere?

762
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,808
Pardon? Well…

763
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,685
What?

764
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,812
Ａ moment ago, they were…

765
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,694
(growls)

766
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:21,325
They were here,
but I don't know where they went now.

767
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,829
(growling continues)

768
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,666
JIHUN: Ms. Cho!

769
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:30,793
Aah!

770
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,461
Long-time no see.

771
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:37,299
As the landlord, shouldn't you come down
to check on your tenants…

772
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,343
I think?

773
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:43,263
I didn't come here for the rent today,
so don't be so scared.

774
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,684
Do a good job of it.

775
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,524
Let's formally ask Mr. Cheon.

776
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,109
Okay.

777
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,319
-Do you think I'm scared?
-Humph.

778
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,906
If they had no <i>pi</i> nor <i>gwang</i>,
and I said "go" three times,

779
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,534
is the score multiplied by six or eight?

780
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,956
Why are you asking me…

781
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,333
Two times for no <i>pi</i> cards,

782
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,210
two times for no <i>gwang</i> cards,

783
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,920
and two times for saying "go" three times.

784
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,384
-Is the score multiplied by six or eight?
-(buzzing)

785
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,765
STRAIGHTENS YOUR HAIR ALL AT ONCE

786
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,937
Hurry up and tell us.
Don't you know that as a lawyer?

787
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,523
I know. It was even in the bar exam.

788
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:38,527
Well, if you won with <i>pi</i> and <i>gwang,</i>
and they had none,

789
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,988
and you said "go" three times,

790
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,198
it would be six times…

791
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,909
You see? What did I tell you?

792
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,245
-It's six times.
-It's six times.

793
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,415
Mr. Cheon, can you take responsibility
for those words?

794
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,126
Or would it be eight times?

795
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,588
Why can't I remember this clearly?

796
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,675
Oh, that's it. Let's make it clear
by checking the law books.

797
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,594
Yes, let's make it clear.

798
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,637
Mr. Sa, can you get the law books?

799
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,347
Okay.

800
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,895
All right. Let's take a look.

801
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:18,192
Which article… was it?

802
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,319
Which article was it?

803
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,197
Yes, here it is.

804
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,657
Let me go ahead and read it.

805
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:29,077
"If you win with <i>pi</i> and <i>gwang,</i>
and the other party has none of them,

806
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,329
and you say 'go' three times,

807
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,247
it's six times in Gyeongsang Province,

808
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,041
but in other provinces, it's eight times."

809
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,251
Since we're in Seoul,
it's eight times more.

810
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,169
-It's eight times.
-(book thuds)

811
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,338
Gosh, you see? I told you.

812
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,341
Look at it again.
See if it really says that. Come on.

813
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,592
He said it's eight times.

814
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,264
Open that page again. It wasn't there.

815
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,432
I didn't see it.

816
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,601
Geez.

817
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,102
Open it!

818
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,647
-JIHUN: You can't open it at once.
-WOMAN: Okay.

819
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,108
-Okay. Here it is.
-Here?

820
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:04,154
Geez, I don't know what it's saying.

821
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,157
Is this right? Are you sure?

822
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:11,119
Lawyers are total scumbags,
so how could I trust you?

823
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,913
I don't trust you.

824
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:13,956
-You don't?
-No.

825
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,001
Oh, right.
(Jihun laughs)

826
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,337
That person is a prosecutor.

827
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,632
Why don't you ask her to read it?
That would clear it up.

828
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,717
-Really? She's a prosecutor?
-Yes.

829
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:29,304
Read it for us to see if it's right,
prosecutor lady.

830
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,850
Ms. Baek.

831
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:34,726
Read it.

832
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,688
-Me?
-Yes.

833
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,357
(whimsical music)

834
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,075
-Ah...
-(clears throat)

835
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,871
(tense music)

836
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,418
"If you win with <i>pi</i> and <i>gwang,</i>
and you said 'go' three times,

837
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,132
it's six times in Gyeongsang Province,

838
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,677
but in other provinces,

839
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,099
it's eight times."

840
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,435
(sighs)

841
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,396
Eight times. I was right, wasn't I?
(laughs)

842
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,856
(both groaning)

843
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,901
Geez, my head hurts. It hurts so bad.

844
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,570
-Then, what about America? Whatever.
-See you.

845
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,155
Let's play again tomorrow.

846
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,366
JIHUN: Goodbye.

847
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,619
Did you see that, Ms. Cho?

848
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:37,039
That's why they say that it's always nice
to be acquainted with a lawyer.

849
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,790
You can count on me, Ms. Cho.

00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,675
No, we like him too. You like him too.

853
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,427

00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,523
Do you think I'll let you off the hook
because of this?

859
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:04,942
Move out.

860
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,819
Ms. Cho.

861
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,237
Move out!

862
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,491
JIHUN: Are you going to be like this?

863
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,369

-It isn't working.
-(sighs)

867
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,835
JIHUN: Did you see that?

868
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,838
Even if you work with us,
we may get evicted at any moment.

869
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,048
That's the current situation.

870
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,050
You won't get evicted within two months.

871
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,844
It'll take a few months for her
to execute that right.

872
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,431
If you pay our rent, I may reconsider it.

(scoffs)

874
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,519
That is complete nonsense.
How embarrassing.

875
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,313
You can't work with us.

876
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,317
I'm going to work with you no matter what.

877
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,865
Gosh, I feel stiff.

878
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,119
Why do I have to do this every morning?

879
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,162
(laughs)

880
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,122
Hmm.

881
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,833
Why are there so many people?

882
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,515
THE LEGAL FEE IS ONLY 1,000 WON
OFFERING FREE LEGAL ADVICE

883
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,851
-What is all this?
-MARI: Hello.

884
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:21,977
Thank you.

885
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,312
Mr. Sa!

886
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,400
Hey, Ms. Baek. What is all this? Huh.

887
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,736
You surprised me yesterday and now this.

888
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,989
If you do this for us,
well, I'd be so thankful.

889
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,907
-(laughs)
-Hmm.

890
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,452
Then, shall we start together?

891
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,496
-Please help with this.
-Okay. Take care.

892
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,665
-We'll contact you.
-(gasps)

893
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,334
Did Mr. Cheon do all this work?

894
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,336
He can't do all of this.

895
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,382
Since you're here,
it'll help him out a little.

896
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,342
Of course. You can count on me.

897
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,722
Drink this while you work. It's yuzu tea.

898
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,100
-I'm touched.
-(chuckles)

899
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,603
Next.

900
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,773
-You can hand it here.
-Okay.

901
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,529
Hello.

902
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,032
-Hello. Hi.
-Hello.

903
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,661
MAN: Hello, there. Good morning.

904
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,497
Yes, it's a good…

905
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,417
-Good morning.
-You look happy.

906
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,835
I'm fine.

907
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,630
Then, why does your face look like that?

908
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,133
Just quit if you don't want to work.
Plenty of people want your job.

909
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,760
This is so heavy.

910
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,970
-I'll carry it.
-Geez.

911
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,223
Are you going to be okay?

912
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,434
You aren't doing this
because I asked you, right?

913
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,686
I'm doing it because I like to do it.

914
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,771
Thanks, then.

915
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,527
I'm Cheon, Yeong, Bae.

916
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,404
Cheon Yeoungbae. Come on now.

917
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,406
It's all loaded.

918
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,033
YEOUNGBAE: Hang on. I'll call you later.

919
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,368
Thanks for that.

920
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,286
Hang on. Come over here.

921
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,958
This. What is this?
What will you do about this?

922
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:11,461
Well, it's unclear whether I did it--

923
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,754
What the heck?

924
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,090
Are you saying that I'm lying?

925
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,007
No, sir.

926
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,052
Hey, Mr. Kim Manbok.

927
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,471
Am I doing this because I need money?

928
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,474
-I'm Cheon Yeongbae.
-Yes, I know, President Cheon.

929
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,686
President? I'm an executive director.
I'll become president soon.

930
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:28,895
Yes, sir.

931
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,730
Come here.

932
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,025
(grunts)

933
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,820
I'm saying this to teach you a lesson

934
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,031
that you should be responsible
for your actions. Understood?

935
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,827
Darn it. I can never have a peaceful day.

936
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,580
You'd better do better, okay?

937
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,834
Yes, Mr. Lee. If you're nice to them,
they think it's their right.

938
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,419
Just teach them a lesson.

939
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,714
Gunwoo.

940
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,591
Grandpa!

941
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,342
(chuckles)

942
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,429
Are you delivering my lunch, Gunwoo? Hmm?

943
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,638
Let's go.

944
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,640
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

945
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,895
You jerk, aren't you old enough?

946
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,282
Gosh.

947
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,451
Isn't it comfortable?

948
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,411
Yes.
(nervous chuckle)

949
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,788
(blows air)

950
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,417
Doing it together did make it
go by more quickly.

951
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,630
All kinds of people come for advice.

952
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,799
That's why it's fun
even though it's tough.

953
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,971
Anyway, why did you come here, Ms. Baek?

954
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,307
I'm sure you could work anywhere.

955
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,895
(sighs)

956
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,773
I was curious.

957
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,399
I wondered what he was like.

958
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,125
CHIEF COUNSEL, CHEON JIHUN

00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,961
(knocking on door)

960
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,088
Who is it?

961
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,430
Which jerk did that?

962
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,058
(knocking continues)

963
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,479
BOY: Mister.

964
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,317
Are you that jerk?

965
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,819
Yes, I think so.

966
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:44,823
But my name isn't "Jerk," it's Kim Gunwoo.

967
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,784
Kim Gunwoo, what brings you here?

968
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,661
Is the lawyer in?

969
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,038
He is.

970
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,498
May I see him?

971
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,250
You may,

972
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,502
but that lawyer is kind of expensive.

973
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,628
Do you have any money?

974
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,382
(dings)

975
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,846
-WOMAN 1: Mr. Cheon is buying a popsicle?
-WOMAN 2: I know.

976
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,808
That's 1,000 won, Mr. Cheon.

977
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,187
What are you looking at? Pay her.

978
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:19,691
Oh, my.

979
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,779
Are you even mooching off a child now?

980
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,448
I'm not mooching off of him.

981
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,202
Gunwoo, I'm giving you a discount.
Don't forget that.

982
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,412
Thank you.

983
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,206
-What?
-I said, "Thank you."

984
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,541
What?

985
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,085
Thank you very much.

986
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,088
All right! You should say that loudly.

987
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,424
It's nice to hear that anytime.

988
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,261
-Look at him eating it up.
-It certainly doesn't make me feel bad.

989
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,180
He's unbelievable.
(woman laughs)

990
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:55,101
JIHUN: Okay, Gunwoo.
Why don't you tell me?

991
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,521
What did you say happened to your grandpa?

992
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,399
-You see, my grandpa was…
-Yes.

993
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,694
Some guy did something to my grandpa…

994
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,405
(upbeat music)

995
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,995
(inaudible chatter)

996
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,716
Hey, isn't that Jihun?

997
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,510
-(laughs)
-(horn honks)

998
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,639
Hey, Jihun. Hop in.

999
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,850
I'm glad you're here.
We have somewhere to go.

1000
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,311
-Let's go, Gunwoo.
-Okay.

1001
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,900
-JIHUN: Okay. Let's go.
-MUJANG: Here we go.

1002
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,195
Go!

1003
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,198
MANBOK: Who…

1004
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,158
I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.

1005
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,035
Pardon?

1006
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,539
Are you Gunwoo's grandfather?
He told me everything.

1007
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:02,210
Ah! My goodness.
It's nothing. Please leave.

1008
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,629
I'll get in trouble. It was my fault.

1009
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:08,258
-But I can help you--
-No, please leave.

1010
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,802
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1011
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,138
What's wrong with him?
Mr. Cheon wants to help.

1012
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,099
MUJANG: Who would hire a guard
who sues a tenant?

1013
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,185
It might be hard for him
to work here afterwards.

1014
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,397
But he'd have to spend
two to three months of his salary.

1015
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,400
From what I heard, there was
no proof that he scratched the car.

1016
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,569
I understand how you feel,
but I'd like to help you.

1017
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,903
It's all right.

1018
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,655
-(horn honks)
-(tires screeching)

1019
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,075
What the heck?

1020
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,661
Whoa!

1021
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,663
MUJANG: What's wrong with this guy?

1022
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,293
That's him.

1023
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,634
Geez. Check out this guy.

1024
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,637
MUJANG: Can't anyone do anything legally
when someone parks like that?

1025
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,183
No, he isn't blocking the road
and a parking lot is private property.

1026
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:01,352
Sadly, there isn't anything
you can do legally about that yet.

1027
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,397
Hey, I was having a hard time
hitting the ball today.

1028
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,440
It's driving me nuts.

1029
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,984
Hey, Mr. Kim Manbok.

1030
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,403
Yes, sir!

1031
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:17,243
Yes, I need to take lessons
from Mr. Kim again.

1032
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,204
Yes, he was amazing.

1033
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:22,081
YEOUNGBAE:
Let's go together next week. Sure.

1034
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,959
(upbeat music)

1035
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:30,131
Sir, you didn't park your car properly.

1036
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,884
I need to go.

1037
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,097
-What?
-You did a lousy job of parking your car.

1038
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,017
Sir, I've always been curious.

1039
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,354
Do people park the car like this
because they aren't good at driving?

1040
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,940
Or, be honest with me,

1041
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,776
they don't park like this on purpose,
do they?

1042
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,903
Yes, I did it on purpose.

1043
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,696
If you knew, why'd you ask?

1044
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:57,534
Aah. You did it… on purpose.

1045
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,203
Then, this is what I should do.

1046
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,330
-(camera shutter clicks)
-(sucks teeth, exhales)

1047
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,089
Hey, wacko. What are you doing?

1048
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:13,841
I'm going to post these
on my social media right now.

1049
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,801
Then you're…

1050
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,511
Hey, you'd better delete those.

1051
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,221
YEOUNGBAE: Delete those.
Give me your phone.

1052
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,807
No. It's my cell phone. I don't want

1053
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,770
to. You wacko. Hey, do you live here?

1054
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,648
Oh, I'm sorry.

1055
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,776
I haven't introduced myself.

1056
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,530
I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.
Here is my business card.

1057
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:37,574
An attorney?

1058
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,076
-For real?
-Yes, I am.

1059
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,538
You claimed that my client
scratched your car, so I came to see you.

1060
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,124
(laughs)

1061
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,918
Gosh, this is interesting, isn't it?

1062
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,086
So…

1063
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,047
he doesn't have money to fix my car,

1064
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,550
but he has money to hire a lawyer?

1065
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,177
No, sir. Please leave.

1066
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,637
-Well.
-Please leave.

1067
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,680
Grandpa.

1068
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,224
-Go over there. Right now!
-Grandpa.

1069
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,436
This lawyer said he'd help you.

1070
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:11,774
He said that he'd teach a lesson
to the man who bullies you.

1071
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,112
Hey, you little brat.

1072
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,822
(tense music)

1073
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,414
Darn. What is going on right now?
(Yeoungbae laughing)

1074
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:31,419
So, you're saying he scratched it
from here to here?

1075
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:32,420
As you can see.

1076
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,216
What the heck are you doing? That's gross.

1077
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,593
JIHUN: No, it isn't.

1078
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,304
I'm just trying to establish
the exact size of the damage.

1079
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,305
(scoffs)

1080
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,806
Hmm.

1081
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,233
Hey. What the heck?

1082
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,278
One moment.

1083
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,201
What the heck?

1084
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,619
YEOUNGBAE: Hey.

1085
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,121
Why you…

1086
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,543
Gosh, it's done.

1087
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,920
Hey. What did you do?

1088
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:17,340
-You can hardly see it.
-You bastard. Hey, are you joking?

1089
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,133
What are you doing? Let go of me!

1090
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,551
(coughs)

1091
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:21,636
Let go of him!

1092
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,889
Let go of him right now!

1093
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,641
-Who are you?
-Me?

1094
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,644
I'm Attorney Cheon Jihun's office manager.

1095
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,812
-So what?
-So?

1096
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,522
-Just manage his office.
-All right.

1097
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:33,898
Jeez.

1098
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,777
Who the heck are you, Blue?

1099
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,404
-Look.
-What?

1100
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,364
Aren't you the one who started it?

1101
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,743
What proof do you have
that this man did this?

1102
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:49,163
Proof? My eyes are proof.

1103
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,498
(both scoffing)

1104
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,333
-Your eyes are proof.
-Yes.

1105
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,169
-All right. Look at this.
-Okay, I will look.

1106
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:58,339
See? I'm looking.

1107
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,676
-(grunts)
-Why'd do you that?

1108
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:06,013
Why you jerk. I ought to…
I ought to poke those eyes out!

1109
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,807
Do you know any martial arts?

1110
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,684
Don't mess with me, damn it!

1111
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:12,145
With one phone call,
I can lock you all up!

1112
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,731
Forget about that.
Let's see what exactly happened that day.

1113
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,315
So, you're saying,

1114
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,694
you went this way like this, right?

1115
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:22,780
-You pushed it to the side.
-Yes, since they're expensive cars.

1116
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,449
Are you kidding me?

1117
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:27,702
Hey, how can the car get scratched
if you push it like that?

1118
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,246
Do you think I'm an idiot, bastard?

1119
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,206
He went straight, okay?

1120
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:33,916
Straight?

1121
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,918
Get it?

1122
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,172
So, go straight? Go straight.

1123
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,633
Yes. Are you finally getting
what I'm saying?

1124
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,386
Straight towards the car.

1125
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,388
Got it.

1126
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,433
Are you kidding? Hey, go faster.

1127
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,018
Faster towards the car.

1128
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,688
-YEOUNGBAE: Yes, you should go faster.
-Faster.

1129
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,482
Faster, faster, faster.

1130
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,150
(yells)

1131
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,780
-(yelling continues)
-(thuds)

1132
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,115
(clanks)

1133
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,743
(screams)

1134
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,585
(laughing)

1135
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,087
(chortling)

1136
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,756
You…

1137
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,841
crazy scumbag!

1138
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,886
-You crazy scumbag.
-Look.

1139
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,639
Your bumper got wrecked.

1140
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,350
Why did you tell me to go faster?

1141
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,185
You total wacko!

1142
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:36,646
Hey, wait.

1143
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,775
-Where did it go?
-What?

1144
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:44,153
The spot where Gunwoo's grandpa scratched
has completely disappeared.

1145
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:46,531
Are you kidding me?

1146
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:49,158
What are you going to do about my car?

1147
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:52,370
Today is your funeral. You're dead!

1148
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,287
Wait.

1149
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,581
What?

1150
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,752
From now, this is a new case,

1151
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,921
so it has nothing to do
with Gunwoo or his grandfather.

1152
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:06,259
You may speak to my lawyer from now on.

1153
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,635
What did you say?

1154
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:10,137
Didn't you say that you're a lawyer?

1155
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,014
I am a lawyer,

1156
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,559
but I'd like to leave it
to another lawyer.

1157
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,145
What the heck are you saying?

1158
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,523
(upbeat music)

1159
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,615
If you solve this, you can work with us.

1160
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:30,741
What?

1161
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,623
Mr. Cheon.

1162
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,292
Wait, Mr. Cheon.

1163
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:40,918
Wait.

1164
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,378
Excuse me!

1165
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,464
Hey, jerk!

1166
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,721
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

1167
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,640
(closing theme music)

1168
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,670
MARI: <i>A temper? A lawyer
shouldn't get so worked up like that.</i>

1169
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,257
I hear they think
differently from people like us.

1170
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:31,761
Instead of thinking
that a lawyer must use the law…

1171
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,679
The law is far, but the fist is near!

1172
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,308
MUJANG: <i>Mr. Cheon says that
a lawyer fights in their client's stead.</i>

1173
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,393
Tell me if you can't. I can do it instead.

1174
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,520
I can fight too. I'll do it.

1175
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:45,316
JIHUN: <i>You'll find out
how amazing my lawyer is.</i>
