he should serve time.

Moreover, I don't think
it's the right place for me.

Of course, there are many law offices
that are bigger and better.

But I wonder if other offices
have as much work as we do.

Although it looks like
Mr. Cheon acts recklessly,

oddly, there wasn't a single case
he couldn't resolve so far.

he can resolve this case too?

<i>I try my best to do well.</i>

638
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,528
<i>But when something goes wrong
at the office,</i>

639
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,407
<i>he will find any reason
to take it out on me.</i>

640
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,912
There are so many instances,

641
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,081
but the hardest thing to cope is

642
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,044
the way he threatens me...

643
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,796
to keep me out of work.

644
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,382
Throwing a bottle at you
is clear-cut battery.

645
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:10,136
If he threw it at the back of your head
while you were driving,

646
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,763
we can charge him with special violence.

647
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,934
It is subject to criminal punishment
even if the victim settles.

648
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,977
Were you hurt anywhere?

649
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,396
Oh, this is nothing.

650
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,149
Either way, let's get a doctor's note.

651
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,026
It is best to have as much ammo as we can.

652
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,154
If this is true,
I think we can proceed with a lawsuit.

653
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:32,200
But we shouldn't rush into a lawsuit.

654
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,911
It's clear that he was victimized.
Of course, we have to sue him.

655
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,082
But the most that can come out of a suit
will be a fine or probation.

656
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,835
That won't even phase that kind of person.
Hmm.

657
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,588
And that will put Mr. Kim Taegon
in a tough position.

658
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:49,050
I agree. A lawsuit will be rather...

659
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,720
Mr. Kim Taegon, how can we help you?

660
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,139
You don't want to be treated badly,

661
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,434
but you want to keep working. Am I right?

662
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,354
Yes. That would be ideal.

663
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,480
But...

664
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,648
would it be possible?

665
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,484
It is. That is our specialty.

666

Mr. Cheon is an expert
on these sorts of issues.

The law is far but the fist is near!

668

You make a fist to cheer like this,
and say "Let's go!"

669
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,494
to psyche ourselves up to work hard.

670

I wrote some things down before I came.

Is that right?
Please review the facts of the damages.

I wouldn't have to come all the way here.

That old man didn't scratch my car.

806

I thought about it long and hard.

807

I think I mistook a scratch
from some other place.

You were mistaken?

Whether it was a mistake or not,
I wonder if there is proof.

We truly care about each other.

What else? Keep going.

1124

Yes. we have an ideal relationship
as business partners and friends.

Isn't that right?

That must be it. We'll see.

1127

What would you like for lunch?

1128

Perhaps we can order <i>jjajangmyeon</i>
with a side of dumplings?

1129
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,829
CHAIRMAN MO: Just order one.

Who are all these people?

1131
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,133
Chairman, these are employees
of Chamyeong Construction.

1132
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,428
Isn't this your responsibility?
What is the problem again?

1133
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,180
There is no problem. They always do this.

1134

I will send them away.

Welcome.

Chairman, these are my clients.

What are you doing?

1143
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,721
We are about to sue you.

1144
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,849
What? Who's suing me now?

1145
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:02,187
I compensated for the last incident
just as you told me to.

1146
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,356
You did these people wrong again.

1147
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,608
When did I do that?

1148
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:10,320
Technically speaking,
you didn't do it personally.

1149
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,363
But one of your deputies,

1150
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,075
Executive Director Cheon Yeongbae did.

00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,252
What have you done while I was gone?

1155
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,046
I'm sorry.

1156
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:31,216
Mr. Cheon, what do you want?

1157
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,426
A sincere apology, a just compensation,

1158
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,888
and preventative measures
to ensure it doesn't happen again.

1159
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,140
Do I have to pay
for something I didn't do?

1160
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,643
Yes. I completely understand.

1161
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,395
This is not something you did personally.

1162
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:49,234
It may feel unfair to you
to meet all of their demands.

1163
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,111
So, I will propose something.

1164
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,031
What is the proposal?

1165
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,575
How about a game of bingo?

1166
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,579
What?

1167
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,122
Bingo?

1168
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,541
If I lose,

1169
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:08,628
we will withdraw
all of our demands and leave.

1170
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,296
But if I win,

1171
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,424
you must meet all of their demands
and at the same time,

1172
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,136
we demand
Executive Director Cheon Yeongbae...

1173
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,307
to leave the company.

1181

You said he fights in his client's stead.

1182
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:44,956
You said that was
this lawyer's philosophy.

1183
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:48,209
Fighting for the client is my philosophy.
That is correct.

1184
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:51,879
What does that philosophy
have anything to do with bingo?

Mari,

1186

what will happen if we take
all of these cases to court?

1187
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,763
You have to decide carefully
whether it's a civil or a criminal case.

1188
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,015
Then fight it out.

1189
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,350
We may eventually win if we fight.

1190
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,520
But when exactly is that?

1191

What?

1192
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,274
They will change lawyers
and make excuses to go to second trial,

What will these people be doing
in the meantime?

1195
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,699
They will be working at this company.

But what if you lose the game?

1200
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,381
Why would you leave
something this important to luck?

1201

He was relentless.

I have no confidence

An executive director is one
