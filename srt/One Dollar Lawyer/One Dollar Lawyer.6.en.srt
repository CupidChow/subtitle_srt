ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

11
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:46,901
My father liked that spot.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,573
The path and the lake.

13
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:53,783
Mm.

14
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:55,785
Did you kill your father too?

15
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:02,000
What are you saying?

16
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,795
Your father's last painting
that was found at the scene of the murder…

17
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:08,965
was changed.

18
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,634
Something happened to the painting

19
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:15,680
and it was changed to cover that.

20
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:16,890
Why…

21
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:19,893
did it…

22
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:23,271
have to be covered?

23
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:27,692
Why do you ask me?

24
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:29,068
Because you drew it.

25
00:01:58,598 --> 00:01:59,515
Kim Minjae.

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,231
-Why did you hit me?
-How dare you talk back at me?

27
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:08,107
What did I do wrong?

28
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,734
You can study abroad as we promised!

29
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:11,110
Did I ask you to send me abroad?

30
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:41,224
Before I came here,
I met Ms. Han Jaesook and asked her

31
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:44,727
when she saw Artist Kim last.

32
00:02:45,186 --> 00:02:47,438
And? What did she say?

33
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,276
I'm sure you know better than I do.

34
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:19,512
ABSOLUTE SILENCE

35
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:32,275
<i>The main suspect of
the Pungjin-dong artist couple's murder,</i>

36
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:34,610
<i>Kim Minjae, admitted to the crime…</i>

37
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:36,696
Hey, Mr. Cheon.

38
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:38,531
What happened? Did you see the news?

39
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,576
Yes, I saw it.
I just met up with Kim Minjae.

40
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:44,620
<i>It has been a hot topic that the father
of the suspect is Artist Kim Chungil…</i>

41
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,873
Even the news is saying
that Mr. Kim Minjae confessed,

42
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:48,708
so what are you going to do?

43
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,751
Hmm.

44
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,295
Well, he did confess…

45
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:55,798
and even told them
the location of his late father's body.

46
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:59,052
What? What are you talking about?

47
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,054
Artist Kim Chungil is dead?

48
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:03,681
Yes. The prosecution is
probably looking for the body now.

49
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:07,101
Then, did Mr. Kim Minjae
really kill his father?

50
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:08,770
No.

51
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,691
The artist killed himself three years ago.

52
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:31,918
I think Kim Minjae's statement is true.

53
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:37,173
To see if it really is Artist Kim's body
and what the cause of death is,

54
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:38,508
we'll send it to NFS.

55
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:40,802
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thanks.

56
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,142
His confession and now his body.

57
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:50,895
Things are coming together too easily.

58
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,356
I've never seen it unfold
like this before.

59
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,441
Why doesn't this sit well with me?

60
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,276
Things like this happen.

61
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,153
Sometimes,
our thorough investigation solves it

62
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:00,613
and sometimes, it's easy like this.

63
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:04,367
Let's be thankful for the evidence
presented before us, Yejin.

64
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:09,122
Wait, what happened? Then,

65
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:11,082
why did the reporter and curator

66
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:14,127
hide the fact that Artist Kim
committed suicide

67
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,420
and say that he was alive?

68
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:18,631
I'm sure it was because of the paintings
as one sells for a few hundred million.

69
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,758
They probably didn't want to quit that.

70
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:25,054
Since when did Mr. Kim Minjae
start painting for his father?

71
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,641
-From the beginning.
-What?

72
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:31,477
He said it went wrong from the start.

73
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:37,900
<i>His father,
who was an unknown artist,</i>

74
00:05:39,068 --> 00:05:43,156
<i>and Kim Minjae were poor
but lived a happy life.</i>

75
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:47,118
What a creative drawing technique.

76
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:50,163
This painting is yours, isn't it?

77
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,497
Yes, it is.

78
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:56,586
<i>That lie he said
to save his father's face</i>

79
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,504
<i>became the start of the tragedy.</i>

80
00:06:00,214 --> 00:06:03,342
Minjae, if it's too tough,
don't force yourself to paint.

81
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:06,679
If he doesn't do it,
will you do it for him?

82
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:09,724
Can you even paint as well as Minjae?

83
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:11,350
Honey, I'm sorry.

84
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:13,853
Let's not do this here.
Let's go elsewhere to talk.

85
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:15,688
<i>After their marriage,
Yoo Heeju found out the truth,</i>

86
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,482
<i>but it wasn't important to her.</i>

87
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:20,568
<i>Because the lie rather than the truth
made more money.</i>

88
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,361
Minjae, your father…

89
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:28,326
<i>In the end,
Artist Kim couldn't stand the lies</i>

90
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:31,537
<i>and took his own life.</i>

91
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:49,639
No…

92
00:06:49,972 --> 00:06:53,017
He said that for the sake
of his father who was an unknown artist,

93
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,644
but in the end, that was…

94
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:59,774
Yes, I guess that is what happened.

95
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:01,442
Anyway,

96
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,488
Artist Kim Chungil wasn't the one
who killed Director Yoo Heeju, then.

97
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:09,116
She's right.
What are you going to do now, Mr. Cheon?

98
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,660
I knew it.

99
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:13,329
You said you believed he was innocent.

100
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:14,830
It's one or the other.

101
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,251
Either plan your defense
by asking for leniency

102
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:20,044
or withdraw from representing him.

103
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:23,214
You must decide.

104
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:26,884
Or…

105
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:37,520
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

106
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:56,914
<i>Your father's last painting
that was found at the scene of the murder…</i>

107
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,541
<i>was changed.</i>

108
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,294
Something happened to the painting

109
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:04,755
and it was changed to cover that.

110
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,132
Why…

111
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:10,761
did it have to be covered?

112
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,853
It's on. Mr. Cheon,
your favorite show <i>UI</i> is on.

113
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,104
Aren't you going to watch it?

114
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:24,066
Go ahead and start watching.
We know the story already, don't we?

115
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,736
<i>In this residence
that boasts its peacefulness…</i>

116
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,363
By the way, where did Ms. Baek go?

117
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:30,865
Hmm.

118
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:32,617
Here's your delivery.

119
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:35,161
Let's have dinner while we watch <i>UI</i>.

120
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,457
You are so awesome.

121
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:42,543
-What is that?
-It's spicy braised chicken.

122
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,087
I don't really like spicy braised chicken.

123
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:46,213
Don't you dare eat any.

124
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:48,257
Please have some.

125
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:49,717
All right.

126
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:54,680
Oh, my gosh.

127
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:57,558
<i>It was none other than their family…</i>

128
00:08:58,392 --> 00:08:59,435
Mmm.

129
00:09:00,436 --> 00:09:02,855
Is it pasta or spicy braised chicken?

130
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,357
Didn't you say you didn't like this?

131
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,233
I like it when it's mixed in with pasta.

132
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:09,278
<i>Even the most prestigious
attorneys couldn't defend him…</i>

133
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,030
Oh, my. It's delicious.

134
00:09:11,113 --> 00:09:13,699
<i>However, the one who stepped up
to defend this person…</i>

135
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:17,453
As you said, it isn't that interesting
since we know everything.

136
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:21,123
They always surprise us with something,
so don't let your guard down.

137
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:22,583
Mm.

138
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,794
<i>The defense counsel had resigned
from this case…</i>

139
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:26,003
Something like that?

140
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:28,047
It is rather surprising.

141
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,884
This is a silhouette
that looks awfully familiar.

142
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,219
<i>What is that?</i>

143
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,012
Look.

144
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:37,223
I thought you weren't
going to do the interview.

145
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:39,308
Ms. Baek, be quiet.
I have to watch how I did.

146
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:44,021
What's up with my voice?
I usually have a really nice voice.

147
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,399
-Yes.
-Why did they change my voice?

148
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:48,859
Gosh. That is so annoying.

149
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:51,612
<i>If you're curious, it's 500 won.
If you're worried, it's 1,000 won.</i>

150
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:53,364
Did you hear that? 500 won.

151
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:55,700
I ad-libbed
"If you're curious, it's 500 won."

152
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:57,952
That was pretty clever. You're good at it.

153
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:02,832
<i>However,</i>

154
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,459
<i>we received a letter from Mr. Kim Minjae</i>

155
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:08,129
<i>who is in a detention center.</i>

156
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:12,007
<i>This letter directed us to a location.</i>

157
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:13,884
<i>That's it.</i>

158
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:17,430
<i>What do you think we found
at that location?</i>

159
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:22,435
<i>Shockingly, it was a knife.</i>

160
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:24,603
A knife?

161
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:34,238
<i>And he wrote this
at the end of his letter,</i>

162
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:37,742
<i>"I admit to committing everything
and I'll pay for my crimes.</i>

163
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:41,579
<i>I hope this knife is used
as the definitive evidence</i>

164
00:10:41,662 --> 00:10:43,247
<i>in solving this case."</i>

165
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:50,671
The broadcasting company
just sent this over.

166
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:52,047
Okay.

167
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,471
How interesting.

168
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:00,848
He personally presented the murder weapon.

169
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,059
Please send this to NFS.

170
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:05,603
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

171
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:09,815
Are we sure it's the knife
that was used in the murder?

172
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,734
We'll find out very soon.

173
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:34,757
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

174
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,301
-Why is it taking so long?
-What's happening?

175
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,471
He should be here by now.

176
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,473
ATTORNEY CHEON JIHUN

177
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:45,017
-Here he comes!
-He's here!

178
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:52,191
-Please stand back.
-Move back.

179
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:54,109
-Come on.
-Move!

180
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:55,444
You can't do that.

181
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,325
Why did you suddenly confess?

182
00:12:01,408 --> 00:12:03,619
-Did you feel guilty?
-Mr. Kim Minjae!

183
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:04,870
Mr. Kim Kimjae.

184
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:07,998
You aren't asking me
if I'm doing well today.

185
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:11,794
Thank you for everything.

186
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,967
Do you have anything to say
to your late parents?

187
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,219
-Were you abused as a child?
-Mr. Seo, can I have a word?

188
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,221
Please take him inside.

189
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:23,556
-Come with me.
-Thank you.

190
00:12:27,977 --> 00:12:29,270
You're here alone? Where's Jihun?

191
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:32,898
Yeah, he said he'd be here,
but he hasn't arrived yet.

192
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:34,692
Maybe he took off.

193
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:38,654
I'm just kidding.
You had something to say?

194
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,614
Do you think Mr. Kim really did it?

195
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:43,617
I understand how you feel, Mari.

196
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:47,746
As prosecutors and lawyers, shouldn't we
believe the evidence before us?

197
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,498
The evidence could've been fabricated.

198
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:52,334
Then you should bring the evidence
that it's been fabricated.

199
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,463
Let's talk later. I have to go inside.

200
00:12:58,173 --> 00:12:59,758
Unless you want to go in with me?

201
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:01,635
You're Kim Minjae's lawyer.

202
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:03,888
Okay.

203
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:25,075
Let's start the crime scene reenactment
from the atelier.

204
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,245
Starting the reenactment.

205
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:48,223
Mr. Kim Minjae, what's wrong?

206
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:50,434
This is a nice painting.

207
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,229
Mr. Cheon, what happened?

208
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:57,942
But this painting…

209
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,486
Did you bring it, Jihun?

210
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:02,488
Yes, sorry I'm a little late.

211
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:04,949
This painting was the only witness
to the crime.

212
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:07,451
Mr. Kim Minjae,

213
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:10,913
you drew this painting
instead of your father as well, right?

214
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:16,669
To be exact, your father drew the lake

215
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,797
and you only drew the man
with the black umbrella, didn't you?

216
00:14:22,257 --> 00:14:23,634
What are you doing?

217
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:27,805
Shall we go back
to the day of the incident?

218
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:30,683
On the night of the incident,

219
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:34,228
there was a painting
by Artist Kim that was

220
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:36,939
going to be presented the next day.

221
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:40,234
However, there was…

222
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:44,363
an issue with the painting.

223
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:52,079
<i>Who and why</i>

224
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:54,498
did someone tear…

225
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:59,044
this nice painting? Why?

226
00:15:06,468 --> 00:15:07,636
I did it.

227
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:10,472
You did it, Mr. Kim? Why?

228
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:13,267
I was in agony for painting
on my father's behalf.

229
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:15,894
I see.

230
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:19,231
I completely understand that sentiment.

231
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:21,066
But what if…

232
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,610
there was someone

233
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:28,532
who had that same sentiment
as you, Mr. Kim?

234
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:36,081
That person would've wanted
to tear this painting up too.

235
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:40,794
On the day of the incident,

236
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:44,339
the person who was with Director Yoo Heeju

237
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:46,633
wasn't my client Mr. Kim Minjae.

238
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:48,802
It was none other than…

239
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:50,095
Let go!

240
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:01,482
<i>It was none other than his sister…</i>

241
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,025
Mom.

242
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:04,818
…Ms. Kim Suyeon.

243
00:16:15,913 --> 00:16:16,997
Minjae.

244
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:24,379
Su… Suyeon.

245
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,636
<i>When Mr. Kim returned
from his early morning walk,</i>

246
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,679
<i>-he witnessed the scene of the crime.</i>
-Suyeon.

247
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:33,889
I didn't do it…

248
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:35,891
-Suyeon.
-I didn't…

249
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:40,020
No, I was just going to tear the painting.

250
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,481
Suyeon, look at me.

251
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:45,776
Let's say Dad did it.

252
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:47,277
What?

253
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,988
It'll be okay since no one knows
where Dad is.

254
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:51,198
-Let's do that.
-No…

255
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:52,908
<i>He said that they could</i>

256
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,786
<i>get away with it
by putting it on their late father,</i>

257
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:59,289
but he must've known instinctively
that it wasn't possible,

258
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:02,042
so after reassuring Ms. Kim Suyeon,

259
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:05,295
Mr. Kim Minjae decided…

260
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:08,090
to become the murderer himself.

261
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:22,146
<i>It wouldn't have been strange
to see a torn painting at the crime scene,</i>

262
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:25,607
but there was a reason
why he couldn't leave it there.

263
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,110
If this painting had

264
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:32,614
even a drop of Ms. Kim Suyeon's blood,

265
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:34,908
<i>it was obvious</i>

266
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:37,661
<i>that she would've been suspected.</i>

267
00:17:37,744 --> 00:17:39,204
<i>That's why Mr. Kim Min-jae…</i>

268
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:58,348
<i>That's why Mr. Kim Min-jae drew</i>

269
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:02,352
his signature,
a man with a black umbrella,

270
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:04,438
over an already finished painting.

271
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:06,982
That's a load of crap.

272
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:12,654
Stop with that crap.

273
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:17,618
There's no evidence to prove
that Suyeon did it anyway.

274
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:19,828
I painted them. They were my paintings!

275
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:21,997
I was upset that they sold my paintings
as my father's.

276
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,457
-That's why I did it.
-Minjae.

277
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:28,670
You can stop now.

278
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:32,507
Let's stop.

279
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:40,766
Mr. Kim Minjae, are you going to…

280
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:43,560
make the same mistake again?

281
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:51,193
The son who drew the great paintings
instead of his father,

282
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:54,947
the fame that he didn't want,

283
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,449
his paintings that were
to never see the light of day.

284
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:04,915
The lies that you told
for your father's sake…

285
00:19:10,295 --> 00:19:12,005
made your father unhappy.

286
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:14,633
And this time,

287
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:19,930
you'll turn Ms. Kim Suyeon
that way as well.

288
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:27,145
Mr. Kim Minjae.

289
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:33,277
If you become the murderer
instead of Ms. Kim Suyeon,

290
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,824
do you think she will be happy?

291
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:46,957
You should stop now.

292
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:57,092
I'm sorry.

293
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:02,806
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:27,539
We apologize.

295
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:31,793
The crime scene reenactment has ended.

296
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:34,129
Why was it done privately all of a sudden?

297
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:35,797
Is Kim Minjae not the real murderer?

298
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:39,468
We will let you know
during a press release later on.

299
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,886
Once again, we apologize.

300
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:43,096
-Kim Minjae is inside right now!
-One moment!

301
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,724
-Please leave now.
-Sorry, you must leave.

302
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:48,018
Kim Minjae took back his confession

303
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:50,145
and Kim Suyeon confessed.

304
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:52,856
I guess it's really over now.

305
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:55,108
Hmm.

306
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:56,735
Over? Did you say it was over?

307
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:59,905
Ms. Baek, why don't you tell me?
What will happen from now on?

308
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:05,619
Firstly, if Ms. Kim Suyeon's claim
that she only wanted to tear the painting

309
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:08,830
and didn't want to harm her mother
is accepted,

310
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:10,540
that'll be considered as manslaughter.

311
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:14,002
And Mr. Kim Minjae tried to conceal
the real killer by a false statement,

312
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:16,630
he'll be charged for harboring a suspect
and destroying evidence.

313
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:19,966
However, he'll be exempt under
the Special Exception to Relatives.

314
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,343
And?

315
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:25,263
And since Mr. Kim Minjae knew
that his mother was already dead,

316
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:30,602
he didn't purposely think that
neglecting her would lead to her death,

317
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:32,354
so he's clear of aiding a crime.

318
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:36,441
Oh, you're finally good enough
to work as my probationary employee.

319
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:41,696
By the way, Mr. Cheon,
what Director Yoo said before she died,

320
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,241
"Suyeon, Minjae…"

321
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:45,992
Why do you think she said that?

322
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:48,995
Hmm.

323
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:54,126
Have you ever experienced this?

324
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:00,215
You see…

325
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:07,639
Parents are like that.

326
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,851
Even though her daughter stabbed her,

327
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:13,395
she probably wanted to protect her
until the end,

328
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:14,688
even if it meant using Minjae.

329
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:18,191
I don't know exactly why, though.

330
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,401
Let's go.

331
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:28,326
Anyway, where did you borrow
that painting from, Mr. Cheon?

332
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,287
-It's a trade secret.
-What?

333
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:33,707
You're only an 80-point
probationary employee,

334
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,125
why are you so curious?

335
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,627
-Wasn't I 85 points?
-It was deducted by 5 just now.

336
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:39,546
-Why?
-You got smart with me.

337
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:40,714
Humph.

338
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:43,800
Where did you borrow that from?
It was sold for a lot of money.

339
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:45,135
Actually, I bought it.

340
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:49,473
Fine. I'm sure you did.

341
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:51,183
-Seriously.
-Sorry.

342
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:54,519
Where did you borrow it from?

343
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:04,905
Don't think about anything.

344
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:09,326
Don't worry about me either.

345
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:15,290
Go study abroad

346
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:19,252
and paint what you want
to your heart's content.

347
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:21,922
Okay.

348
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:36,102
Take this.

349
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:43,777
It's your father's last painting.

350
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,490
Come on.
Don't feel uncomfortable about it.

351
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:52,077
It's the price for painting that mural.

352
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,683
One, two, three.

353
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:16,685
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

354
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:17,894
Ah.

355
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:20,397
-Then, you go this way.
-Okay.

356
00:24:21,189 --> 00:24:22,983
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

357
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:47,799
Dad, why do you like it here?

358
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:49,926
What?

359
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:53,054
Look. Isn't it so nice?

360
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:56,016
All of your frustrations are gone,
so your head becomes clear

361
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,517
and you can paint easily too.

362
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:06,610
Minjae.

363
00:25:08,445 --> 00:25:09,863
Shall I tell everyone?

364
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:17,120
I'm fine. If it's too difficult,
you can stop, Minjae.

365
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:22,375
No, I'm fine too.

366
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:33,970
Father.

367
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:38,016
Have you heard of Lake Titicaca?

368
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,227
Lake Titicaca? I've never heard of it.

369
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:44,689
It's a lake with the highest elevation
in the world.

370
00:25:44,773 --> 00:25:47,067
You'll love it when you see
a picture of it.

371
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:48,401
Really?

372
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:50,862
It would be nice to go together.

373
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,114
We can all go together.

374
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,397
OFFICE OF LAW, 2F

375
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:30,068
Mr. Cheon, we solved this tremendous case,

376
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:32,112
so did we get anything in return?

377
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:34,406
Mm.

378
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:37,659
We did.

379
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:39,452
We did?

380
00:26:40,995 --> 00:26:42,914
-Yes.
-Really?

381
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,458
-You know.
-What?

382
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:47,752
-You know.
-What?

383
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:51,381
Stay here. Stay right here.

384
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,849
Yes, we did!

385
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:02,475
We did!

386
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:08,064
Wait up! Geez.

387
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:13,611
YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE, RESTROOM

388
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,626
Gosh, Mr. Cheon!

389
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:42,182
Ms. Cho, what are you doing right now?

390
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:43,558
I don't like this mural.

391
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:45,560
I'm going to draw something else here.

392
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:47,395
Do you know how much that is?

393
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,481
Why do I care? This piece of crap?

394
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,900
Wouldn't it have been
about two billion won?

395
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:54,611
Two billion won? Two billion won!

396
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:57,071
Oh, my gosh.

397
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:58,990
-Twenty won?
-Twenty won?

398
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:01,493
Gosh, it's only twenty won.

399
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,433
ATTORNEY, BAEK MARI

400
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:30,688
Maybe it's because we resolved
a huge case,

401
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:33,441
the office has been very quiet lately.

402
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:35,485
We deserve a day like this.

403
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:37,320
We worked so hard up until now.

404
00:28:37,487 --> 00:28:38,988
You worked hard as well, Ms. Baek.

405
00:28:39,072 --> 00:28:40,907
You got so busy as soon as you got here.

406
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:44,869
Mr. Cheon won't be in today,
so you can leave early.

407
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:46,329
Oh.

408
00:28:46,412 --> 00:28:48,456
You can go ahead.
I have plans this evening.

409
00:28:48,915 --> 00:28:50,583
-Plans?
-Yes.

410
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:52,126
Is it a date?

411
00:28:52,293 --> 00:28:54,170
No.

412
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,549
Anyway, where did Mr. Cheon go?

413
00:28:57,715 --> 00:28:59,968
Oh, he just told me
not to wait up for him.

414
00:29:01,594 --> 00:29:02,470
Shall I leave first?

415
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,097
Sure.

416
00:29:04,597 --> 00:29:07,058
-You don't mind, do you?
-Of course, not.

417
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,938
-All right. See you.
-Bye.

418
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:24,742
CHIEF COUNSEL, CHEON JIHUN

419
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,274
END OF PROBATIONARY PERIOD!

420
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:44,822
The two months are going to fly by.

421
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:46,240
CHEON JIHUN LAW OFFICE

422
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:08,846
Hmm.

423
00:31:10,807 --> 00:31:11,891
This person…

424
00:31:12,934 --> 00:31:14,852
-Grandpa.
-Yes.

425
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:16,521
Who is this person?

426
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:20,108
She used to be the best lawyer
at our law firm.

427
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:23,277
She isn't here anymore.

428
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,489
Ah.

429
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,157
This person…

430
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:35,206
I think this is where she was.

431
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:39,752
"Attorney, Lee Juyeong."

432
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:43,923
Why is the curly-haired guy's
name here now?

433
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,813
Prosecutor Na Yejin!

434
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,570
Why did you come?
I could've met up with you somewhere.

435
00:32:06,612 --> 00:32:08,740
How could I ask you to come?
You are my senior.

436
00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:10,408
I should come meet you.

437
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:15,955
-What?
-Something's up.

438
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,415
What are you talking about?

439
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:21,377
Why do you want to… treat me
to a meal out of the blue?

440
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:24,714
Are you interrogating me? My goodness.

441
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:26,424
Let's go grab a bite.

442
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:28,092
Something's up.

443
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,470
-Nothing's up.
-Something's up.

444
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:33,765
Hey.

445
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,975
This place is so good.

446
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,101
Not bad, right?

447
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:40,688
I came here with Mr. Cheon
not too long ago, and it wasn't bad.

448
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,649
At this rate, You'll spend
all of your probationary employee salary.

449
00:32:44,358 --> 00:32:47,904
I wanted to treat you, so this is nothing.

450
00:32:49,197 --> 00:32:51,741
If I had known,
I would've brought Yeowon too.

451
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:54,786
Bring Yeowon along next time.
I'll buy you both a meal.

452
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:56,037
I'll buy next time.

453
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:02,251
Yejin.

454
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:06,839
What is Mr. Cheon like?

455
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:11,302
He's always avoiding the landlady
because he can't pay the rent,

456
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:14,472
but his clothes and watches seem

457
00:33:14,555 --> 00:33:16,557
very expensive.

458
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:19,477
It seemed like he spoke some French too.

459
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:22,063
Were you curious about that?

460
00:33:22,146 --> 00:33:23,481
Well, just…

461
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:26,818
tell me how he was as a prosecutor.

462
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:31,239
It's a long story to tell you
about Jihun's past.

463
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:32,907
Can you handle it?

464
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,493
Yes.

465
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:41,290
Gosh, where should I start?

466
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:43,251
How many years ago was that?

467
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,463
The party after we ended an investigation.

468
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,006
You all worked very hard.

469
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:49,966
5 YEARS AGO

470
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:53,261
You worked hard
but what can we do about the bad results?

471
00:33:54,053 --> 00:33:55,930
All right. Fill your glasses.

472
00:33:57,473 --> 00:34:00,393
Since you worked hard,
forget all about it and…

473
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:05,273
Hang on a minute.
Why is there an empty seat already?

474
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:09,694
Jihun went to the restroom, sir.

475
00:34:10,653 --> 00:34:12,196
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

476
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,906
-Do you have them?
-Yes, sir.

477
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:19,328
All right. If anyone isn't here
at the end,

478
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,330
you'll pay for it.

You haven't heard from Jihun yet?

483
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:49,192
He told us to go ahead and go on up.

484
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:51,736
He said we'll find out
why the president's office is at the top.

485
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:54,989
I got the warrant for him
since he said he couldn't get it,

486
00:34:55,072 --> 00:34:56,449
so what is he saying now?

487
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,534
PROSECUTION SERVICE

488
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:03,122
All right. Let's go inside!

489
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:04,790
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir!

490
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:20,181
What is this about?

491
00:35:20,264 --> 00:35:22,308
We're from Seoul Central
District Prosecutor's Office.

492
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:23,768
Excuse us.

493
00:35:24,227 --> 00:35:25,770
-Investigators.
-Let's go in.

494
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:26,854
Stop them!

495
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,363
Gosh.

496
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:37,823
I forgot to show you this.

497
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:42,203
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT

498
00:35:42,286 --> 00:35:43,329
May I enter now?

499
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:46,207
Let's go.

500
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,000
Please cooperate with us.

501
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:48,960
Thank you. Step aside.

502
00:35:51,128 --> 00:35:52,505
We can't hold them off anymore.

503
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:54,590
They're heading up now.

504
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:55,925
Well, then…

505
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,227
Please go up as fast as possible.

506
00:36:06,435 --> 00:36:08,145
I'll see you on the top floor.

507
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:16,153
What's happening?

508
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:17,238
UNDER INSPECTION

509
00:36:17,446 --> 00:36:18,781
What on earth is going on?

510
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:20,700
Darn.

511
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:25,746
<i>I'm sorry.
It broke down all of a sudden.</i>

512
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:28,124
<i>Please wait a moment
and we'll fix it in no time.</i>

513
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:29,542
Why these jerks…

514
00:36:30,418 --> 00:36:31,544
What should we do, Mr. Seo?

515
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:08,080
-Hurry up!
-We don't have time.

516
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:09,832
-Gosh.
-Hey.

517
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:12,501
-We don't have time for that.
-Come on.

518
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:15,087
Hurry up and get it done!

519
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:17,131
-Come on!
-Gosh.

520
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:18,883
-Come on!
-What about this?

521
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:21,594
-Hurry.
-Come on.

522
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,981
JQ GROUP INCORPORATION'S SHARES
AGREEMENT OF JQ CHEMICAL JOINT ENTERPRISE

523
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:42,281
We're running out of time.
Don't you know they're on their way up?

524
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:45,826
Yes, I do know. But I think you should
get rid of this first.

525
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,787
Who are you? I've never seen you before.

526
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,330
Me? I'm…

527
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:51,665
From Central District Prosecutor's Office.

528
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:55,461
Please put down anything
you are holding at this moment.

529
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,925
What? When did he get up here?

530
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:02,718
I'm from Seoul Central
District Prosecutor's Office.

531
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:03,928
Mr. Cheon.

532
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:06,472
Yes, this is an important file,
so hold on to it.

533
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,681
Yes, sir.

534
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:10,476
So… Mr. Park Junsung.

535
00:38:14,063 --> 00:38:15,815
Where is President Choi Kitae?

536
00:38:31,038 --> 00:38:32,790
EXPENSE HISTORY

537
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:39,505
You're a little too late.

538
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:41,674
That was the last one.

539
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:44,135
Well done, President Choi Kitae.

540
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,637
You're bolder than I thought.

541
00:38:54,061 --> 00:38:55,020
Who are you?

542
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,939
Well, I'm from…

543
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:02,319
Seoul Central
District Prosecutor's Office.

544
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:05,364
Mr. Choi Kitae, you're under arrest
for destroying evidence.

545
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:10,494
You're a prosecutor?
You're an interesting guy.

546
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:13,747
If you come with me,
it'll become more interesting.

547
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:14,874
Listen, prosecutor guy,

548
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,376
do you know who I am?

549
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:20,171
Yes, I definitely know who you are.

550
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:22,923
You guys are all dead
with this one phone call.

551
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:26,594
You'll have to hire
the most expensive lawyer.

552
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:38,814
Hello.

553
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:42,693
What is it, President Choi Kitae?

554
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,782
Why did you call?

555
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:54,246
I told you to call
the most expensive lawyer,

556
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,331
but you called my boss.

557
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:57,291
He has no power.

558
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:58,918
You little…

559
00:40:00,753 --> 00:40:02,171
Let's see.

560
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:08,385
The food here is--

561
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:09,428
Sir!

562
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:12,348
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

563
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:14,850
Hello.

564
00:40:15,518 --> 00:40:16,560
Have a seat.

565
00:40:20,189 --> 00:40:21,232
Sit.

566
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,117
I keep hearing a ringing from here.

567
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,331
Yes, why do you keep calling?

568
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:43,629
It won't work.

569
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:46,048
I took…

570
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:51,929
all of them.

571
00:40:59,186 --> 00:41:00,312
Bring it on.

572
00:41:03,065 --> 00:41:05,776
Stop bragging about your connections
and come with us, Mr. Choi Kitae.

573
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:09,029
Hello.

574
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,534
It's me.

575
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:15,744
One of your employees is here.

576
00:41:26,922 --> 00:41:28,549
Yes, this is Prosecutor Cheon Jihun.

577
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:31,343
Hey, you jerk! How dare you go there?

578
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:33,512
Pull out from there right now.

579
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:42,146
-This way?
-Yes.

580
00:41:42,646 --> 00:41:43,647
Jihun.

581
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,278
Prosecutor Cheon,
we're all done out there.

582
00:41:50,863 --> 00:41:53,574
You'll go far if you listen to your boss.

583
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:57,453
What is he saying?

584
00:41:57,995 --> 00:41:59,413
Mm.

585
00:41:59,955 --> 00:42:01,915
The deputy prosecutor general is very mad.

586
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,085
Has he already caught wind of it?

587
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:07,087
Yes.

588
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:08,589
Then, what happens to us now?

589
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:12,551
So…

590
00:42:13,135 --> 00:42:15,387
why did you come here
when everyone else went for drinks?

591
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:16,847
You just got yourselves in trouble.

592
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:21,477
It isn't too late to go back.
I'll put in a good word for you.

593
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,896
What do you want?

594
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,732
I can drop by
the prosecutor's office for a bit,

595
00:42:27,983 --> 00:42:29,318
and then go home.

596
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:46,585
Do you think we'll be okay?

597
00:42:46,669 --> 00:42:47,753
What do you mean?

598
00:42:47,836 --> 00:42:50,756
We're going to be chewed out
for what we did here.

599
00:42:51,674 --> 00:42:52,508
Aren't you afraid?

600
00:42:53,425 --> 00:42:54,593
I am afraid,

601
00:42:55,594 --> 00:42:56,595
but I do it anyway.

602
00:43:00,808 --> 00:43:03,727
By the way, Jihun, I looked everywhere,

603
00:43:03,811 --> 00:43:07,439
but I think that guy destroyed
all the key documents.

604
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:09,066
If we take him in at this rate,

605
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:11,360
we'll have to release him immediately
as he said.

606
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:13,529
What should we do?

607
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:16,407
What's the date today, Minhyeok? Hmm.

608
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,533
Today? It's the 16th.

609
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:22,204
<i>Hello.</i>

610
00:43:22,287 --> 00:43:23,706
Where are you?

611
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:27,251
<i>Geez, you call me in a year
and you ask me where I am?</i>

612
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:32,089
Do you know how long I've been here
since I got kicked out because of you?

613
00:43:33,006 --> 00:43:34,049
What?

614
00:43:35,843 --> 00:43:38,804
Do you think I'd believe
what you say again?

615
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:47,312
-Let's go.
-Hey, Jihun.

616
00:43:49,189 --> 00:43:50,482
You want us to go back like this?

617
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:52,901
I think you should become famous,
Minhyeok.

618
00:43:56,405 --> 00:43:57,823
What is he saying?

619
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:25,392
MARRY ME, JEHOON

620
00:44:25,601 --> 00:44:27,102
JEHOON'S BEAUTY IS THE STANDARD BEAUTY

621
00:44:36,278 --> 00:44:37,613
Mr. Lee Jehoon!

622
00:44:38,447 --> 00:44:41,408
Mr. Lee Jehoon, please look over here!

623
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:42,701
Mr. Lee Jehoon!

624
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:44,828
Please look over here.

625
00:44:46,538 --> 00:44:47,831
Look here and say something.

626
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:51,335
Ah. I'm so nervous to be
at such a great event.

627
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:53,879
I hope that it finishes as a big success.

628
00:44:53,962 --> 00:44:54,880
Thank you.

629
00:44:54,963 --> 00:44:56,131
Thank you.

630
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:02,930
Darn it. He calls me in a year
and what does he have to say now?

631
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:06,183
What do you want?
Why do you keep calling me?

632
00:45:09,686 --> 00:45:10,771
Hello.

633
00:45:18,695 --> 00:45:20,197
I'll get you back on local news.

634
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:41,093
Hello!

635
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:43,303
This is a scoop.

636
00:45:47,307 --> 00:45:48,725
He's a bad guy.

637
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:54,940
Yes, over here!

638
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,653
JQ CONSTRUCTION CEO CHOI KITAE
ON THE RED CARPET…

639
00:45:59,736 --> 00:46:03,282
"Third Generation Chaebol and a Prosecutor
Stand Together on the Red Carpet."

640
00:46:04,157 --> 00:46:05,993
Why would you stand there, you jerk?

641
00:46:06,076 --> 00:46:09,246
Are you filming a movie?
Why would a prosecutor go there?

642
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:10,581
I'm sorry, sir.

643
00:46:10,664 --> 00:46:13,000
But I really didn't know.

644
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:16,336
You didn't know? Did you really not know?

645
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,922
How could you be smiling like this
if you didn't know? How?

646
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:20,883
If you look carefully,

647
00:46:21,717 --> 00:46:23,844
I'm not smiling.

648
00:46:23,927 --> 00:46:25,762
I'm simply not fully awake.

649
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:27,180
What do you think, Yejin?

650
00:46:29,683 --> 00:46:31,393
I've been working a lot lately,

651
00:46:31,685 --> 00:46:33,645
so I fell asleep in the car briefly
and woke up.

652
00:46:33,729 --> 00:46:36,189
When I got out of the car,
there were reporters everywhere.

653
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:38,775
I thought for sure it was
because the reporters caught wind of it.

654
00:46:38,984 --> 00:46:42,070
I never thought in a million years
that it was the red carpet.

655
00:46:44,072 --> 00:46:45,741
How did you get the warrant?

656
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:50,495
While I was in the restroom at the party,
Prosecutor Seo Minhyeok gave me a call.

657
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:52,998
He said he got the warrant
but was afraid to go alone.

658
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:54,041
That mouth of yours.

659
00:46:55,709 --> 00:46:56,668
Both of you, get out!

660
00:47:03,008 --> 00:47:04,384
You should've given me a heads-up.

661
00:47:05,093 --> 00:47:06,803
How could you two do that on your own?

662
00:47:07,596 --> 00:47:08,972
You just heard.

663
00:47:09,348 --> 00:47:11,475
I had no choice but to go
because of Minhyeok as well.

664
00:47:14,394 --> 00:47:15,395
Should I ask him?

665
00:47:16,813 --> 00:47:18,106
Well, don't ask him.

666
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:21,818
Seo Minhyeok, how did it go?

667
00:47:22,945 --> 00:47:24,446
Ah.

668
00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:27,074
Thanks for your concern, Yejin.

669
00:47:28,075 --> 00:47:29,743
Dad took care of everything for me.

670
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:32,037
He was the direct senior
to the deputy prosecutor general.

671
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,457
Your father.
I'd like to meet him one day too.

672
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:37,209
You're lucky, Minhyeok.

673
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:38,877
I'm not lucky. It's just tiresome.

674
00:47:39,962 --> 00:47:42,381
By the way, did you see the news, Jihun?

675
00:47:42,965 --> 00:47:43,924
Yes, I did.

676
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:45,592
It was on the front page as promised.

677
00:47:45,842 --> 00:47:47,260
Yes, but…

678
00:47:48,595 --> 00:47:50,639
we didn't come out so well.

679
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:00,482
It didn't… come out badly either.

680
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:03,610
Did you see any other articles?

681
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:05,362
They didn't use the same photo, did they?

682
00:48:05,946 --> 00:48:07,572
Don't they use the same photo?

683
00:48:08,824 --> 00:48:09,783
Ooh!

684
00:48:11,493 --> 00:48:12,411
Thank you.

685
00:48:12,828 --> 00:48:13,954
I have to go.

686
00:48:16,164 --> 00:48:18,125
You guys are ridiculous.

687
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,252
What are you going to do now?

688
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:22,713
They will hire an above-average lawyer.

689
00:48:23,714 --> 00:48:26,216
If I was afraid of lawyers,
I wouldn't have started to begin with.

690
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:28,510
Tell them to come at me.

691
00:48:48,113 --> 00:48:49,322
Hey, prosecutor guy.

692
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:53,952
See you later.

693
00:48:54,745 --> 00:48:56,663
Yes, looking forward to it.

694
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,251
Let go. Damn it.

695
00:49:10,218 --> 00:49:14,056
Yes, I'll head over as soon as
the habeas corpus proceeding finishes.

696
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:15,682
Okay.

697
00:49:16,975 --> 00:49:18,351
Do you think you can do it?

698
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:24,524
This isn't Mr. Choi Kitae's first time
getting into trouble.

699
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:28,153
I got so mad reading the documents.

700
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:31,948
Shouldn't a jerk like him
be sent to prison

701
00:49:32,032 --> 00:49:33,867
and made to pay for his crimes?

702
00:49:34,993 --> 00:49:38,663
Yes, you're right.
But this is the men's room.

703
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,876
He'll get an expensive lawyer this time
and try to get away with it again.

704
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:44,044
Can you handle it?

705
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:46,129
Yes, I am confident. But who are you?

706
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:51,635
You were known
for your investigative abilities.

707
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,973
I'm counting on you,
Prosecutor Cheon Jihun.

708
00:50:18,328 --> 00:50:20,247
-Hey, Jihun.
-Yeah?

709
00:50:20,956 --> 00:50:22,958
That guy must have
something up his sleeve.

710
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:24,376
He's smiling.

711
00:50:39,391 --> 00:50:41,852
PROSECUTION TABLE

712
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:55,073
It's Mr. Baek's firm. What do we do?

713
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:58,326
If it's Law Firm Baek,
it must've cost a fortune.

714
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:00,745
Hang in there.

715
00:51:02,497 --> 00:51:05,750
If you remain patient,
we'll bring you some good news.

716
00:51:05,834 --> 00:51:07,294
I'm counting on you.

717
00:51:08,128 --> 00:51:10,130
I guess we have to go another round
with the old men.

718
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:23,268
DEFENSE COUNSEL TABLE

719
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:38,825
She was their lawyer.

720
00:51:39,784 --> 00:51:41,161
What? Who?

721
00:51:41,703 --> 00:51:43,246
Hmm. Nothing.

722
00:51:49,544 --> 00:51:51,922
The defendant poses no risk
of destroying evidence or fleeing,

723
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:53,173
and his residence is clear.

724
00:51:53,256 --> 00:51:56,801
The prosecution has secured
all the evidence during their search,

725
00:51:56,968 --> 00:51:59,387
so there is no need for the prosecution
to know his whereabouts

726
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:00,847
during their investigation.

727
00:52:01,514 --> 00:52:03,600
Also, when the prosecution
requests an investigation,

728
00:52:03,683 --> 00:52:07,479
the defendant will appear
and cooperate with the investigation.

729
00:52:09,147 --> 00:52:10,982
Prosecution, you may proceed.

730
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:12,400
Yes.

731
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:14,861
The defendant was arrested

732
00:52:14,945 --> 00:52:17,948
for trying to destroy evidence
during our search

733
00:52:18,657 --> 00:52:22,160
and we suspect that there will be
additional attempts to destroy evidence,

734
00:52:22,244 --> 00:52:25,080
so we think that he must be detained
during the investigation, Your Honor.

735
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:43,807
Detained? Of course, not.
I was indicted without detainment.

736
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,851
Hey, I'm on my way. Come out right now.

737
00:52:54,943 --> 00:52:56,069
Excuse me.

738
00:53:00,198 --> 00:53:01,574
What are you doing right now?

739
00:53:02,242 --> 00:53:03,952
Were you playing with me?

740
00:53:04,035 --> 00:53:07,414
Do you want to get some coffee?
It's my treat.

741
00:53:23,638 --> 00:53:25,557
CAFE COFFEE

742
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:27,642
Are you okay with milk coffee?

743
00:53:31,438 --> 00:53:32,939
Don't you drink vending machine coffee?

744
00:53:33,857 --> 00:53:35,358
I'll give it a try.

745
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:38,278
You're saying...

746
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:40,238
...you've never tried it, are you?

747
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:46,953
Gosh. You're in for a surprise.

748
00:54:16,274 --> 00:54:17,400
How is it?

749
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,320
Well, it's sweet.

750
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,990
Isn't it? Doesn't it make you feel better?

751
00:54:25,575 --> 00:54:27,577
I'll be seeing you often from now on.

752
00:54:30,413 --> 00:54:33,666
I meant… what I said earlier.

753
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:38,880
The person who committed a crime
must be punished accordingly.

754
00:54:38,963 --> 00:54:40,215
That's what I think.

755
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:44,344
Unfortunately, I work as a lawyer.

756
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:49,057
I'm sure It must've been
hard to arrest him.

757
00:54:49,391 --> 00:54:50,350
I'm sorry.

758
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:58,525
Why are you sorry?
The trial hasn't even started yet.

759
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:02,487
As you said,
a jerk that has committed a crime

760
00:55:03,738 --> 00:55:05,698
must be punished accordingly.

761
00:55:08,284 --> 00:55:09,369
Are you confident about it?

762
00:55:12,038 --> 00:55:13,957
Yes, I am.

763
00:55:16,876 --> 00:55:20,505
Shall we say that whoever loses has to buy
the other person a drink, Mr. Cheon?

764
00:55:21,506 --> 00:55:22,465
Ah.

765
00:55:22,715 --> 00:55:25,552
But I've never lost a bet over a drink.

766
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:30,306
I guess you'll lose that bet
and the trial this time.

767
00:55:32,517 --> 00:55:33,685
I look forward to it.

768
00:55:42,694 --> 00:55:47,115
Please win this trial.
I'm counting on you.

769
00:55:53,788 --> 00:55:56,749
As an attorney, I'll do my best as well.

770
00:55:58,293 --> 00:56:02,839
Yes, I'll decide later on
whether I want that drink or not,

771
00:56:04,048 --> 00:56:05,884
but you're gonna have to buy that drink.

772
00:56:56,518 --> 00:56:59,312
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

773
00:57:41,604 --> 00:57:43,398
Who's the prosecutor
that caused the trouble?

774
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:44,607
It's Prosecutor Cheon Jihun.

775
00:57:44,691 --> 00:57:47,026
<i>He's so stubborn that
even the prosecution gave up on him.</i>

776
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,653
<i>He wrote a will and disappeared.</i>

777
00:57:48,736 --> 00:57:49,862
He must've died somewhere!

778
00:57:49,946 --> 00:57:51,614
It sounds like that's what you want.

779
00:57:51,698 --> 00:57:52,949
Have you lost your mind?

780
00:57:53,032 --> 00:57:54,534
Why did you tell him to die?

781
00:57:54,617 --> 00:57:56,786
You aren't a prosecutor.
You're a novelist.

782
00:57:56,869 --> 00:57:58,037
-Sir.
-Do you have proof?

783
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:01,332
<i>If one has committed a crime, they must
be punished accordingly. That's justice.</i>

784
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:03,042
Don't you ever go on a date?

785
00:58:04,043 --> 00:58:07,547
I'm going to find out
where he siphoned that slush fund.

786
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,215
<i>What's the license plate number?</i>

787
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:11,384
-<i>It's N 3866.</i>
-Unbelievable.

788
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:13,511
-Who is it?
-<i>He's been very busy lately.</i>

789
00:58:13,595 --> 00:58:16,848
Jihun, no matter what choice you make,
I'm on your side,

790
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:18,016
but you can stop here.

791
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:19,017
Welcome.

792
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,852
<i>You can't investigate
your own father.</i>
