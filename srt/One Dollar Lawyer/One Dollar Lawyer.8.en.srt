No. What will they say if they see us?

00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,525
Oh.

17
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,526
Yes, you're right.

Assemblyman Kim Yoonsub.

30
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,453
Who is this?

31
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,665
Who are you?

32
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,088
Is it true that Assemblyman Kim was
being investigated by prosecutors?

33
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,839
Who was the prosecutor in charge?

34
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,633
Why did you summon him in secret?

35
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,884
What was he charged with?

36
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,678
For receiving political funds.

37
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,887
Did he really commit suicide?

38
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,890
Based on the will we discovered
and the CCTV footage,

39
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,309
the deceased took
extreme measures to take his own life.

40
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,436
We will further inform you

41
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,064
after analyzing the handwriting
of the will.

42
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,694
He isn't answering.

43
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,488
He isn't on the roof either.
I'll keep looking this way.

44
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,531
I'll keep looking too.

How many members of the Assembly
did you give money to?

47
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,085
There's a lot.

48
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,298
I don't know if you can handle it.

49
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,049
I'm sure you have the list.

50
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,260
I will give you the list later.

51
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,115
What are you doing?

52
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,160
How dare you show your face here?

53
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,623
I have to find the ones
who did this to Father.

54
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:33,916
What?

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,502
When he died, someone called him
on his cell phone.

56
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,172
What are you talking about?
You did this to him.

57
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,716
If you hadn't investigated him,
this wouldn't have happened.

58
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,968
-Brother.
-It was his choice.

59
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,220
We haven't even had his funeral.
Stop causing a stir.

66

<i>Where are you, Jihun?</i>

00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,142
She's drunk.

85
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,061
She's your probationary employee,
not mine.

86

You need to take care of her.
I'll send you the address.

87
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,985
-Was that Mr. Cheon?
-Yes.

88
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:13,117
So what happened
to Prosecutor Cheon Jihun?

89
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,136
Investigator, did you find anything
on what I asked you?

90
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,222
I looked into it.

91
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,101
The number Assemblyman Kim spoke to
on the phone was from a burner phone.

92
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,188
Will you keep investigating?

93
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,273
The higher-ups
will throw a fit if they find out.

94
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,943
Let's say that you know nothing about it.

95
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,489
Mr. Cheon, you know that there's a trial
this afternoon, don't you?

96
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,037
Who knew Assemblyman Kim Yoonsub
would do something like that?

97
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,956
I guess he was scared.

98
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,583
Wasn't that guy in charge
of his case again?

99
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,919
Was his name Cheon Jihun?

100
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,630
They say he's the mad dog of Seocho-dong.

Those who act self-righteous
always get themselves in trouble--

Give it a rest.

103
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,845

110
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,179

The person you said
you respected the most before…

115
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,845
Was it Assemblyman Kim Yoonsub?

116
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,102
But…

117
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,022
that wasn't your fault.

118
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,567
Though, I don't know
if saying that helps at all.

119
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,535
No, it isn't much help.

120
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,580
He was my father.

121
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,398
<i>But Jihun didn't give up.</i>

122
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,026
<i>He did whatever he could
to continue the investigation.</i>

123
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,114
<i>What he got in return each time
was pressure from the higher-ups,</i>

124
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,535
<i>but he continued his lonely fight.</i>

125
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,288
NOT THROUGH AFFILIATES
BUT SOMEONE OUTSIDE

126
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,416
Find all the business transactions

in the Seoul area.

128

It doesn't matter if it isn't recent.

129
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,589
Bring all of them.

130
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,174
All right, drink up.

131
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,512
I'm Prosecutor Cheon Jihun.
We're here for an investigation.

-Yes.

<i>Why didn't you listen to me?</i>

134
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,395
I told you not to poke around politicians.

135
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,898
The higher-ups are in a fit.
What'll you do about it?

136
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,610
Please answer honestly.

137
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,112
Are you sure?

138
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,204
It won't take long.

139
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,623
We have the case
of the violent crimes delegated too.

140
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,832
-What is this?
-Excuse me!

141
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,543
-Everybody, out!
-What's going on?

142
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,903
I know that you won't give up
no matter what.

143
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,242
If you need my help, tell me.

144
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,081
I can't seem to
continue the investigation.

145
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,667
Thanks, Yejin.

146
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:03,467
But there was nothing Jihun could do.

147
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:09,139
In the end, he couldn't find out
the last person his father spoke to.

148
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,561
Is that why he left
the prosecutors' office?

149
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,313
No.

150
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,817
Then, why?

151
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,695
Weren't you going to work on that?

152
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,030
-You'd better do well.
-Yes.

153
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,825
Looks like it's going to rain.
Let's go inside and eat.

154
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,326
Okay. Let's go inside.

155
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,479
Let's drink together.

156
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,530
That's your third smile.

00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,495
Here.

163
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:46,083
But weren't you going to have this?

164
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,962
I was, but it looks like
you need it more than me.

165
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:54,091
Really? Then, I'll gladly take it.

166
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,926
Yes, sir.

167
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,847
Mmm.

168
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,100
Aah.

169
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,396
Aah.

170
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,982
Aah.

171
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,484
You must be exhausted.

172
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,445
This line of work
isn't always a walk in the park.

173
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,535
It took 30 years to get those words

174
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,454
inscribed over there.

175
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,208
Your dream came true though.

176
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,128
What is your dream, Ms. Lee?

177
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,299
Oh...

178
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,594
Wait, let me guess.

179
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,890
But give me a moment, okay?

180
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,519
Okay. You can take as long as you'd like.

181
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,146
All right.

182
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,898
ATTORNEY, LEE JUYEONG

183
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,534
Mr. Baek.

184
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,454
-Are you busy?
-No, sir. Please have a seat.

185
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:09,082
No, have a seat. Continue working.

186
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,128
I said that I'd guess your dream,
didn't I?

187
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,671
Ah.

188
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,967
Here. Take a look and see if this is it.

189
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,639
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

190
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:30,812
As a partner, please take the lead
in managing Law Firm Baek.

191
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,816
-Mr. Baek.
-There's no need to thank me.

192
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,902
This was my plan from the start.

193
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,785
I didn't think I'd be
handing you this today.

194
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,208
But I think I should give it to you now.

195
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,677
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

196
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,688
Did you get an offer from elsewhere?

197
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,231
No, sir.

198
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,524
Then, what is it?

199
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,110
I found someone I want to work with.

200
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,153
Bring that person to Baek.

201
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,741
He probably wouldn't ever come here.

202
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,827
What? Why not?

203
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,172
Isn't it nice? The rent isn't bad either.

204
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,426
I'd like it to be a bit more spacious.

205
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,593
There'll be two of us.

206
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,887
There's one more place. Come this way.

207
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,226
Of course. We're at the end of the season.

208
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,728
Just buy it.

209
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,229
My goodness. Long time no see.

210
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,913
-My goodness.
-Geez.

211
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,834
Oh, my. I am having a great day today.

212
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,836
You're playing really well today.

213
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,421
Sometimes, luck is on my side.

214
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,423
Here I go.

215
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,134
I'll do this. Take that!

216
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,803
Darn it. I messed up again.

217
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:27,971
Seriously.

218
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,473
Too bad for you.

219
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,515
Goodness!

220
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,142
My, my.

221
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,020
Hey! Have you lost your mind?
I was winning by a lot!

222
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,147
She came with the realtor.

223
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,232
You have to make her move in
no matter what, Eulrye.

224
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,194
Yeah. It's been vacant for years.

225
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,570
Smile, Eulrye.

226
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,031
Ma'am, you must be here
to see the second floor.

227
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,366
Hello.

228
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,826
Oh, my goodness. I'm so glad you're here.

229
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,120
You'll absolutely love it.

230
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,631
YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE

231
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,716
Why didn't you clean this place up?

232
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,634
ICED COFFEE, GINSENG TEA, GINGER TEA

233
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,763
I know. Who would move in here?

234
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,058
It's spacious and well-lit.

235
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:14,976
I like it.

236
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,895
Don't you love it?

237
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,940
You can't find a place like this
around here at this price.

238
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,691
You're getting it cheap because of me.

239
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,570
Cheap? No one comes around here
since the old men in the area are dead.

240
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,447
That's right.

241
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,658
It doesn't seem like it needs much work.

242
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,792
Tomatoes for 1,000 won.
Come and get your tomatoes.

243
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,252
-Your turn.
-Up, up.

244
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,920
Hurry up and get it.

245
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,047
HOME REPAIR

246
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,509
-Hello there.
-Hello.

247
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,885
Good day.

248
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,853
But…

249
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,147
you don't seem like the type
to run a coffee house.

250
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,899
What are you going to do here?

251
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,111
I'm going to open a lawyer's office.

252
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,498
Juyeong.

253
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,425
This is it?

254
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,428
Yes, I'd like to start
in this neighborhood.

255
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,432
When I officially open,
you'll be the first to be invited.

256
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:36,933
Mm.

257
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,228
Why do you want to leave Law Firm Baek?

258
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,772
Hmm?

259
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,234
Maybe because you won't have
a place to go when you leave?

260
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,361
I plan on recruiting you.

261
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,699
Why don't you resign tomorrow
and join our office?

262
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,742
What do you think?

263
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,456
I won't quit being a prosecutor.

264
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,376
Do you look in the mirror these days?

265
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,963
Do you get at least
three hours of sleep a day?

266
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,717
It has already been two years.

267
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,969
You still haven't found anything.

268
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,600
Shouldn't you stop
and live your own life now?

269
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,187
I have it under control.

270
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,023
Jihun.

271
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,443
There's somewhere I want to go.

272
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,744
Nice to meet you.

273
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,871
I'm Lee Juyeong.

274
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,624
I'll visit you often from now.

275
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,351
Oh, my.

276
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,186
Hold up your side well.

277
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,938
-You can put all of that there.
-Okay.

278
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,524
-A little bit more.
-Why do you have so many?

279
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,401
Here, have a drink.

280
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,570
My goodness. You're trying to impress her.

281
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,115
-That's right. He's trying hard.
-He's being nice to her.

282
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,700
That's right.

283
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,916
Oh.

284
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,896
<i>Whoever wants to go get fish
with me, raise your hand.</i>

285
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,449
That one's so cute.

286
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,793
You scared me.

287
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,503
You're here.

288
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:12,881
Look at that one, dear.

289
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,425
That one's so cute.

290
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,513
I'm going to buy 15 of them,
so hurry up and pick some.

291
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,646
Look at that red one.

292
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,360
If you look at that one carefully,

293
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,570
he's dressed in black and all alone.

294
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,323
He's trying to impress the other ones.

295
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:27,247
Actually, I loathed
having to defend Choi Kitae.

296
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,209
That's why I hoped you'd win.

297
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,170
The mad dog of Seocho-dong

298
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,548
who doesn't care about money or power
and catches everyone.

299
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,093
That looked so liberating to me.

300
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:46,516
I left Law Firm Baek
because I wanted to do that too.

301
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,145
I have it all planned out.

302
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,940
I can defend whomever I want
without any concern

303
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,234
for the next ten years or so.

304
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,448
My bank account might suffer
in the meantime,

305
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,534
but I'd be happy, don't you think?

306
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,958
What about you, Jihun?

307
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,175
Are you as free as you want to be?

308
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,678
Or…

309
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,348
are you caught up in the past?

310
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,994
I really like it when you smile.

311
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,999
When you first smiled, I was so surprised.

312
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,297
I realized that you were capable
of smiling so warmly.

313
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,635
I wanted to make you smile

314
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,096
to others as warmly as you do to me.

315
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,559
I should teach you
how to warm up to people first.

316
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,857
You are a warm person.

317
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,085
I'm sorry, Juyeong. I have to go.

318
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,841
Yes, Investigator.

319
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,393
PROSECUTOR, CHEON JIHUN

320
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,074
Jihun, where are you?

321
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,036
Hey, Juyeong. I'm on my way.

322
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,747
Mm. See you there.

323
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,124
Okay.

324
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,282
What's wrong?

325
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,705
Jihun.

326
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,917
Juyeong.

327
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,339
I think you were right. I have been…

328
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,259
caught up in the past too much.

329
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,057
But what if

330
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,727
I can't get over that past?

331
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,942
What point is it
to continue our relationship?

332
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,319
That…

333
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,324
That thought came to my mind.

334
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,664
Jihun.

335
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,212
It's natural to have a hard time
because of your father.

336
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,798
I'm sorry I played it down.

337
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,801
But what can I--

338
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,011
Yes, you…

339
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,933
What can you do for me?

340
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,897
I thought about

341
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,651
what you could do for me, but…

342
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,059
Juyeong, will you marry me?

343
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,298
Here's your business
registration certificate.

344
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,383
Congratulations.

345
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,384
Thank you.

346
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,655
I'm sorry.

347
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,200
I apologize.

348
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:33,649
Ms. Lee, thank you so much
for your hard work.

349
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,236
I learned a lot from you, Mr. Baek.

350
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,404
No, no.

351
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,782
Let us know anytime if you need our help.

352
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,242
You're still family.

353
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,288
Yes. Thank you, sir.

354
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,875
We'll arrange to have a meal soon,
so you must come.

355
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,545
Mr. Baek arranged it, especially for you.

356
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,964
I'll be waiting, sir.

357
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,799
All right.

358
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:04,680
I know that you'll do well
wherever you go,

359
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,349
so I'm not too worried.

360
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,852
But if you do change your mind,

361
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,480
you can come back anytime.

362
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,568
Yes. Please, head back in.

363
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,127
Goodbye!

364
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,722
Here. Check for yourself.

365
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,521
What is this?

Excuse me.

371
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,969
Is this the lawyer's office?

372
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,306
Ah. Yes, but we aren't open yet.

So…

377
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,828
how much is the legal fee here?

378
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,457
Um...

379
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,587
It's… cheap.

380
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,422
Pardon?

381
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,259

so you don't have to worry.

I got my first client.

the business registration certificate…

-Oh, my gosh.
-Was she stabbed?

Juyeong…

447

Ms. Lee Juyeong passed away at 23:38.

448
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,200
<i>Last night, during a random
assault that happened on the subway,</i>

449
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:21,036
<i>a woman in her thirties that
worked for a large Seoul law firm</i>

450
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,872
<i>was stabbed and moved to a hospital,
but did not make it.</i>

451
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,124
<i>The suspect, Mr. Cho, turned himself in</i>

452
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,835
<i>at a nearby police station
after the crime.</i>

453
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,754
<i>It has been announced that the police</i>

<i>will bring in a profiler
to make a psychological assessment.</i>

Jihun.

456
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,896
Yejin, I'm going to take on this case.

457
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,815
Please tell Chief for me.

458
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,653
I know how you feel,
but you can't take this case.

459
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,905
The higher-ups will never allow that.

460
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:58,865
And I also agree.

461
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,705
When everybody…

462
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,793
turned their backs on me,

463
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,340
she was the only one who drew close to me.

464
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,175
I'm a prosecutor,

465
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,761
but I can't do anything for her?

466
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,766
I'm going to take this case.

467
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,435
I don't need anyone's permission.

You've never seen me before.

471
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,454

Anyone there?

476
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:54,364
I asked the lady lawyer
to take on my case before,

477
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,783
but I never heard back from her.

478
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,914
By the way, is the legal fee
really 1,000 won?

479
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:13,675
Yes.

480
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,427
That's right. It's 1,000 won.

481

Hey, what's going on?

01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,696
Used cars? Don't you think it's a scam?

<i>There are a lot of fake
deals these days.</i>

486

This one has no issues and it's clean.

487
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,702
<i>If you buy this,
you're definitely getting a deal.</i>

488
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,037
<i>Mr. Sa, think about it.</i>

489
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,331
Where on earth is there
a cheap car that's good?

490
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,957
If it were so great, they'd be driving it.
