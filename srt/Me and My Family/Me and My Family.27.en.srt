00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,019
Why are you here

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
I miss you

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,359
You have to make an appointment if you want to see it .

7
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,440
Welcome at any time

8
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,119
Hot pot tastes fine .

9
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,320
The more you drink hot pot , the more you get wine .

10
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,280
Why don 't you say you 're amazing ?

11
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,239
Stuck meal

12
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,919

13
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,239
Wu Limei

14
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,720
Xiaoyan is back

15
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Guess what

16
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,239
Brought your ex - husband here

17
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,040
Surprised or not

18
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:11,919
Who

19
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:12,480
Old

20
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,500
Uncle Gu is here

21
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:15,739
It smells so good , Lao Gu

22
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,320
Nobita is here uninvited .

23
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,959
Yes , you came early or late .

24
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,239
I went to open the wine .

25
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,919
My dad brought two bottles of red wine .

26
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,480
Sit down , sit down

27
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,139
That 's fine

28
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:24,839
I 'll take my glass

29
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:25,760
How can you come empty - handed ?

30
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,419
Take a wine glass

31
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:28,660
Lai Lai

32
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,760
Let me bring a drink . Let me bring a drink first .

33
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,320
You you say you say you say you say

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,000
You you you say you say you say you say

35
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,260
Talk about my daughter

36
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,700
Congratulations on misfortune

37
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:39,679
Let me tell you

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,839
I told you

39
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,839
You 're not at the point

40
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,079
What are you saying ?

41
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,880
You 're no different from me .

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,500
Why don 't you tell me about yourself

43
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay , okay , isn 't this your house ?

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,660
You said

45
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,500
No , no , no , no

46
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,280
After all , you are the real father .

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,119
Susu 's biological father

48
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,399
We have a first - come , first - served approach .

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,600
I just want to say something .

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,359
We have to celebrate my good daughter

51
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,160
Be famous in one battle

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,399
An instant hit

53
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,480
Red black

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,560
Black and red are also red

55
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,079
Yes No

56
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,880
To celebrate

57
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,839
To be honest , it is said that you should be famous early

58
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:10,119
I didn 't expect my age

59
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:10,440
Already

60
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,579
This scale is hot

61
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:12,720
I think it 's a good thing

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,280
Right

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,019
Yes

64
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:14,940
Good things

65
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,119
That 's what I meant .

66
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,000
This is a blessing in disguise

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,359
That 's right

68
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:18,780
Look

69
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,160
Susu this time

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,320
Tribulations Experienced

71
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,540
It must be in the future

72
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,360
Good omen of great wealth and excellence

73
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,760
This veteran cadre

74
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,800
I don 't talk so much .

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,599
A few words

76
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,279
Just these people

77
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,920
It 's all your home front

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,039
Don 't panic or be afraid when something happens

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,659
Everyone gives you the bottom line .

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,839
That 's it

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Everything is in the wine

82
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,560
Well said

83
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,800
I just learned to drink to look like you

84
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,360
It 's my turn

85
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,719
Below

86
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:51,320
Let me just say a few words .

87
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,519
I keep thinking lately that I just lost my job

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,019
Then fall out of love

89
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,599
When there is no place to go

90
00:04:58,719 --> 00:04:59,279
At that time

91
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,700
I feel like the sky is collapsing

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What was I like then

93
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:03,279
You 've all seen it

94
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,320
The result did not collapse

95
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,920
Because of my mom

96
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:09,260
And this home

97
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,620
And all of you

98
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,920
You caught me

99
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,880
This time is the same

100
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,560
I used to

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,339
I definitely think

102
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,839
This time , the world fell .

103
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,200
It 's over and I can 't live .

104
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,519
But I swear

105
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,300
In my heart

106
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,519
It doesn 't feel much .

107
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,320
I think it will definitely pass

108
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,560
Why can 't I get through ?

109
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,940
At first , I thought

110
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,120
I 'm stronger .

111
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,760
But now I know

112
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:31,779
Because

113
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:33,579
You

114
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,539
Because I believe

115
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:37,479
No matter what happened to me

116
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:38,479
What did you meet

117
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,360
You will still be the same

118
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,320
Catch me firmly

119
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,399
What about me

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,440
Mom

121
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:53,279
Let me toast you first

122
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,839
I especially thank you

123
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,360
Really , I seldom say thank you

124
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,839
But I especially thank you

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,519
Half my life .

126
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,519
A lot of trouble

127
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,560
I have fallen many times

128
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,399
But every time I fall

129
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,659
Every time you

130
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,839
You can catch me .

131
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,120
Pick me up

132
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,159
I was still thinking

133
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,959
You have a new home

134
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,440
You have a new baby again

135
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,300
My old kid

136
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,219
If you fall again , you may have to

137
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:22,399
Pat the dust on your body

138
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,360
I got up by myself

139
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,860
But actually until today

140
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,519
You are still

141
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,019
Use all your strength

142
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:31,880
Support Me

143
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,959
Protect Me

144
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,000
Again and Again

145
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,880
OK OK

146
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,519
Come

147
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,800
Use tea instead of wine

148
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,760
Come , Come , Come , Come , Come , Respect

149
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,659
Makes you numb

150
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,360
Can 't Catch

151
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,760
Production is going smoothly

152
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,180
Uncle Li

153
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Second toast to you

154
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,620
Why are you still standing up ?

155
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,560
I want to solemnly

156
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,000
To express my thanks to you

157
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:58,240
This

158
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,719
Look , you took her

159
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,920
What are you spoiled to ?

160
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,240
Spoiled

161
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,760
She is now

162
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,279
Becomes a child

163
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,360
But it 's very good

164
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,219
I can feel my mom

165
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,920
Especially happy

166
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,519
It 's because of you

167
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,380
My mom doesn 't use it anymore

168
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,399
As before

169
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,099
Such a hard person

170
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,320
Supports an entire home

171
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,339
Because you will

172
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:30,740
Hold her gently and protect her

173
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,200
Love her

174
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:38,620
You see

175
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,620
Nobita is moved , you see

176
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,539
Thank you for your hard work .

177
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,200
You 're excited .

178
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,639
None

179
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,159
None

180
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,880
Su Su 's speech is really

181
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,120
I 'm distracted

182
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,060
Sit

183
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,200
Xiao Li Yan

184
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,240
Although you 're not very talkative

185
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Every time at dinner table

186
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,060
Just keep burying myself in food

187
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,019
It really eats our family

188
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:06,000
A lot of food

189
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,000
But I know it very well

190
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,959
You already think of me as

191
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,760
Your sister

192
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,560
Thank you

Last Cup

196
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,040
To all of us

197
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,200
Thank you for all the vicissitudes of life

198
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,259
Traveling Thousands of Miles

00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:52,359
Became a family

200
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,920
Cheers

201
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,079
That 's a good word .

202
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,400
Cheers

203
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:02,900
This last cup

204
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,359
I thought it was for me

205
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
It turns out that I am the vicissitudes of life of the big guy

206
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,479
The days ahead

207
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,560
Think about it carefully

208
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,959
You have to think about it

209
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:12,999
This is a big deal

210
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,280
It 's a serious business

211
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,239
Isn 't that right ? My mom 's right

212
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,320
Dad , are you still going to

213
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,959
I 'll really be a lone wolf for the rest of my life

214
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,320
Alone Wolf

215
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,440
What are you looking for ?

216
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,060
Don 't be afraid to stumble yourself

217
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,800
There is a wolf without companion

218
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,219
See another wolf

219
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:27,280
It 's over .

220
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,400
Come on , that 's me .

221
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,859
A toast to myself

222
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,800
Dad , I support you

223
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,520
Even for the rest of your life

224
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,859
Bohemian Love Free

225
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:38,560
So what

226
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,440
Just be happy

227
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,540
You have to be happy

228
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,040
Don 't care about anyone else

229
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,499
People should follow

230
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:47,079
Live the way you like

231
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,719
Right

232
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,359
Then give me a toast

233
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,200
Come to Honor Freedom

234
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,239
Come on

235
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:53,200
Nothing wrong

236
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,200
Zhang Han said in his statement

237
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,140
Never

238
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,339
Contacted this project

239
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:08,579
Not considered acting

240
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:10,379
Any role that doesn 't suit you

241
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,440
Although he has never met the author

242
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,040
I don 't know the novel either

243
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,180
What happened

244
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,780
But I believe everyone

245
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,259
They are all people who cherish feathers

246
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:19,999
Zhang Han also expressed

247
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,459
I will be in the near future

248
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:22,719
Change Brokerage Team

249
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,640
Yes , this young man

250
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,680
But I 'm telling you .

251
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,800
If such a handsome kid

252
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,920
Play my son

253
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,759
I think I can still do it

254
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,259
Be careful I tell Susu

255
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,800
Give me some hush money .

256
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,320
You don 't want to

257
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,879
Playing a sycophant

258
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,859
All right , let 's relax .

259
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,119
OK , thank you , doctor

260
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,079
Bye bye bye bye bye

261
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,719
Why are you here

262
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,839
I sent you a message but you didn 't reply

263
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,040
I guess you 're busy

264
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,999
I can 't wait to say

265
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,759
Then I 'll just stop you from getting off work .

266
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,680
Statement that I read

267
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:55,700
Especially responsible

268
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:57,560
I 'm already a fan of him

269
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,839
I didn 't think

270
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,119
It went pretty well this time .

271
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,520
Netizens support us in particular

272
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,920
That 's over at Instant Pictures

273
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,040
Any feedback

274
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:05,959
Qin Yuxuan called me

275
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:08,560
He returned the novel to me

276
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,680
And apologized to me

277
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:11,999
What about Instant Pictures

278
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,680
I guess it 's the same .

279
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,999
Unable to withstand the pressure of public opinion

280
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,160
Anyway , I gave up simply

281
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,579
Would you

282
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,040
It was banned by the whole industry

283
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,859
No.

284
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,079
I have another good news

285
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:22,959
To tell you

286
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,499
Zhou Zimeng called me

287
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,239
Say Wanhua

288
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,680
Want to restart my project

289
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,520
And

290
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,040
She promised me

291
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,280
The first signature is my name

292
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,560
And rejects magic modification

293
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,280
Then you can hold it back .

294
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,099
Now

295
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:35,400
Not

296
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,680
I just found out about this .

297
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,479
I 'm just running over

298
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,440
Did I tell you ?

299
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,739
Then this time I let my

300
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,520
Lawyer friends get involved early

301
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:41,879
OK

302
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,400
This Contract

303
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
We can 't take the loss from last time .

304
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,839
You must read the contract carefully this time

305
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,400
She asked me for a while

306
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,719
Go to their company to meet and chat

307
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,280
You 're off work

308
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:51,320
I 'll accompany you after work

309
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,320
Easy to go

310
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:55,040
Changing clothes

311
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:55,660
Go

312
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,060
Let 's go

313
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,560
Go round and round

314
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,459
Escape

315
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,300
It 's still our Wanhua Film .

316
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:19,879
I didn 't expect it either

317
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,040
We 're at this juncture

318
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,359
Are you willing to take over

319
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,239
Zhang Hanna 's statement

320
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,400
It 's equivalent to free advertising

321
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,759
The company is self - righteous

322
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,160
A group message was sent first

323
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,160
Did you get slapped in the face ?

324
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Not taking advantage of it

325
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,599
It has to be us

326
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,759
Seized a business opportunity

327
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:37,800
Yes Yes Yes

328
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:39,280
I thought

329
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,719
I 'm attracted by my talent

330
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,040
What you said

331
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,060
That must be your talent .

332
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,479
Nothing else matters

333
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,979
You see

334
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,879
The final name of our project

335
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,440
But according to

336
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,359
You are in Shichi literature city

337
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,940
Drafted with the modified name

338
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Restart

339
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,680
What a moral

340
00:12:58,959 --> 00:12:59,959
Also more relevant

341
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,540
Does it count

342
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,920
Affirmation of your talent

343
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,040
Thank you Sister

344
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,540
But this contract can I

345
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,160
Go home and study it again

346
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,859
That definitely

347
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:12,560
But there 's one thing .

348
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,959
Cycle cannot be changed

349
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,440
That 's why it 's trouble

350
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,920
You 're working overtime .

351
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:17,839
No problem

352
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,400
I have  behind me

353
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,640
Extra powerful backup team

354
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,359
Yes

355
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,900
How is it going ?

356
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,959
It went well

357
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,579
Congratulations

358
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:32,180
It 's going to fall

359
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,839
Let 's go for a walk

360
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:35,640
Yes .

361
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,239
Walk

362
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:04,900
Walk

363
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,040
You 're very happy .

364
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:12,079
That 's right

365
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:12,800
I feel  right now

366
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,959
Clear all worries with one click

367
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,520
Because I got it

368
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,920
Screenwriter contract

369
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:19,680
That 's right

370
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,560
I feel like myself right now

371
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,359
Not at home

372
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,920
The most useless person .

373
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,599
Nobody ever thinks of you that way , right ?

374
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,280
But I 'm thinking so .

375
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,040
In fact

376
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,879
For a long time I

377
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,800
My life is one

378
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,759
Shaky state

379
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,200
I worry about a lot every day

380
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,320
There are more concerns .

381
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,160
But honestly

382
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:44,680
I enjoyed my two days at your house

383
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,200
It never occurred to me

384
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,320
With someone

385
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,200
So relaxed

386
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,999
It seems like we all

387
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,879
No running - in period is required

388
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,400
Me too

389
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,599
Really

390
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,759
But

391
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,520
To be honest about myself

392
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,800
Life is still a mess .

393
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,200
I 'm not ready yet

394
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,999
To enter another life

395
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,320
So I ran away

396
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,400
I don 't want to put pressure on you

397
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:39,839
So we don 't have to rush

398
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,820
I 'll be with you

399
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,739
Straighten out your life

400
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,940
I 'll give you the password

401
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,060
I want to express it to you

402
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:46,540
My World

403
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,959
Is always open to you

404
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,820
When you are tired

405
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,079
Or when you are unhappy

406
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:53,900
You can always come to my place

407
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,499
Come to my place and run wild

408
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,640
I want my world

409
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:02,940
It 's your other West Lake

410
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:19,879
Thank you

411
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,259
Thank you too

412
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,540
Why do you fall in love

413
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,200
There 's a telephone .

414
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,700
Who do I look at

415
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:38,200
Brother - in - law came to pick up

416
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,119
What 's wrong ?

417
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:43,239
Where to eat

418
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:44,780
Don 't eat

419
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,599
Don 't eat

420
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,440
My sister picked me up today

421
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,459
Li Yan

422
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:57,859
Let 's go

423
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,280
You call me

424
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,920
I came all the way here

425
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,040
Let 's go now

426
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,200
It rains and I can 't go home by myself

427
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,759
I just want someone

428
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,400
You can pick me up once

429
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,999
Let 's go home

430
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:25,719
Let 's go

431
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,239
What do you want to eat at night

432
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,120
You won 't do it even if you say it

433
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:33,840
No , you can say it .

434
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:34,700
I can 't do it

435
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,259
I can order takeout , right ?

436
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Tomahawk Steak

437
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,600
You 're really welcome

438
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,719
two copies

439
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,620
I 'll finish hanging the painting in a moment

440
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,600
Come and help me .

441
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,400
OK

442
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:55,940
Gu Yunsu

443
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,180
I need to talk to you about this

444
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,059
Last time

445
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:00,279
Talking about this episode

446
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:01,979
I took a look

447
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,739
This second game is problematic

448
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,059
I think this feels a bit suspended

449
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,340
No matter what , it has to be landed .

450
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:10,940
I think you

451
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:13,580
The actors like it very much

452
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,979
This is called dramatic tension

453
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,900
People will want to look back

454
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,979
Let me tell you .

455
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,680
This art is above life

456
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,259
But it can 't be separated from life

457
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:22,459
What if it 's out of life

458
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,180
Logically

459
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,340
It can 't be pushed through

460
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,739
Did you know

461
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:25,959
OK , I 'll seriously consider it

462
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,180
That 's enough .

463
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,979
You

464
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,380
This is a dumpling wrap .

465
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:32,900
I have another process here .

466
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:38,259
See

467
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,660
You spiritual

468
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,100
Is there anything I can do to help

469
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,080
To Susu

470
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:48,640
Go and see that one seems cooked .

471
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,100
OK

472
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,600
Let Mei Mei try it first

473
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:51,739
Taste salty

474
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,700
Li Jianxiong

475
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,059
Look at this second scene

476
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:56,880
This

477
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,420
Today is Chinese New Year

478
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,100
You

479
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,979
Put this and this aside for a while

480
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:02,340
This is the finale .

481
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,700
This

482
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:03,340
At that time

483
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,559
Ratings are very important

484
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,239
Did you know

485
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,039
It 's a little hot

486
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,580
Just eat a small bite

487
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,019
How about

488
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,640
Too salty

489
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,400
Salty

490
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,519
It 's too bland

491
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,360
I 'm not very happy anyway

492
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,999
I think it should taste good

493
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:19,259
Come

494
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,160
I tasted it just now

495
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,239
It should be just right

496
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:21,999
Looking for trouble now

497
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:22,380
Come , come , come , come

498
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,799
Read this script .

499
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:24,880
I have worked so hard

500
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,799
What are you doing ?

501
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,880
Do you think I rolled it round ?

502
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,440
Take a look

503
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,719
You pressed it with a cup

504
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,459
Yeah , it 's a little ungrounded

505
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:32,360
How thick is this side ?

506
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,940
Circle

507
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,539
You have to do this after you press it

508
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:35,840
You have to turn this edge

509
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,880
You have to roll it thinner

510
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,999
You see

511
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,759
You see

512
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,440
What are you doing ?

513
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,880
You 're not as good as others

514
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
It 's better than me .

515
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,559
Not as good as Li Yan

516
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,380
That is

517
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,400
Li Yan , you decorated it beautifully .

518
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:10,580
OK

519
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:12,080
It 's so nice

520
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,479
Sit , sit , sit

521
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,160
Susu

522
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:17,239
Why hasn 't Dr. Xu come yet ?

523
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:18,799
He stopped , he stopped

524
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,779
He will come in later

525
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:20,640
You have to tell him .

526
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,600
Help me quickly

527
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,120
You have to tell him .

528
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,059
Today is the Spring Festival Gala

529
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:25,640
Got it

530
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,059
I have to prepare the program later .

531
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,219
We 're not important today

532
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:31,559
The fun is ahead

533
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,400
Do I also have a show ?

534
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,279
You can perform

535
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:37,719
But don 't overwhelm the host .

536
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,700
Line

537
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,120
Go , go , go , come , come , come

538
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:46,920
Can you sit outside ?

539
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,600
Yes Yes No problem

540
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,200
Dr. Xiao Xu

541
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,600
Auntie , I 'm sorry I 'm late

542
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,719
Happy New Year

543
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,360
I just went to my dad 's place

544
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:55,519
Happy New Year

545
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,279
Be careful , be careful

546
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,120
Happy New Year

547
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:00,880
I have to prepare the program today .

548
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:03,279
Coming

549
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,200
OMG

550
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,920
So cool and handsome

551
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,999
Uncle Li , aren 't you cold

552
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,319
OK

553
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,559
How

554
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,559
Don 't be shy , Uncle Li

555
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,200
Li Yan

556
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:27,580
Yes Yes Yes

557
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,319
Forget Forget

558
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,259
So excited

559
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,180
That little hand

560
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:57,440
I 'm so proud .

561
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,039
This head is raised

562
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,160
OK OK

563
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,719
One more I didn 't see enough

564
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,239
Come on again , come on again

565
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,819
Come back and jump in the second half

566
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,200
Can you take me to the hospital first ?

567
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,920
What 's wrong with you

568
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,080
The amniotic water broke

569
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:31,719
Amniotic fluid

570
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,880
You want you to start

571
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,279
Should I call 120 ?

572
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:34,999
We 'll drive there by ourselves

573
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:35,799
How are you feeling ?

574
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,360
That Uncle Li , give me your ID

575
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,600
The maternity bags are still packed

576
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,920
You pack the New Year 's Eve dinner

577
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,340
Do you still have New Year 's Eve dinner at this time ?

578
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,940
Meimei

579
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,160
Then I must eat it

580
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,340
How can I be born if I don 't eat ?

581
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,319
Have a baby

582
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,880
Breathe Breathe Breathe

583
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,160
Where is the maternity package ?

584
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,660
Go , go , go , go , go , go , go

585
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,580
Go Out Go Out

586
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:52,239
Walk , walk , walk

587
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,039
Don 't worry Don 't worry

588
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Li Yan left

589
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,880
It 's coming , it 's coming

590
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,880
Wait a minute , fanfanfan

591
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,580
Walk , walk , walk

592
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,219
Here Here Here

593
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:13,660
Be careful with that

594
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,380
Whose car is this

595
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,160
Whose car is this

596
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,120
My My My

597
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,719
Drive away quickly

598
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:17,380
You can 't park here

599
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,660
Uncle , go first , go first

600
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,319
I 'll call you later

601
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,279
All right , all right , go first

602
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,219
I - I - I - I - I - I - I - I - Go

603
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,180
How do you feel now

604
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,440
It 's okay . It 's here . It 's here .

605
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,620
We 're in the delivery room . We 're in the delivery room .

606
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,120
You relax you relax you relax

607
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:28,860
I

608
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:29,959
Come , come , come , come

609
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,920
My

610
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:33,140
Don 't worry first

611
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,999
That mom is fine .

612
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,640
Uncle will be here to accompany you soon .

613
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,799
Uncle Uncle

614
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,440
We are at the door of the delivery room .

615
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,360
Right , right , hurry up .

616
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,200
Family members can enter one

617
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,799
Door Open

618
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,519
It went well

619
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,440
Two fingers have been opened

620
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
The anesthesiologist will be here shortly

621
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,640
It can be painless .

622
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,700
I think

623
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,840
Can you go in and see her ?

624
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,519
But only one family member can enter

625
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,799
Where is Uncle Li parking ?

626
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,080
He can 't get up for a long time

627
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,559
I 'm afraid of my mom

628
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,519
I 'll go in and deliver a meal

629
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,959
Can I be out in a minute ?

630
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,680
OK , I 'll communicate with you

631
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,840
OK OK

632
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,640
Get your things

633
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,499
Give me everything .

634
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,739
Thank you

635
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,180
I went in

636
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:49,360
Please bear with it .

637
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,319
The anesthesiologist will come in a moment

638
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,640
We 'll be painless .

639
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:52,759
Eat the New Year 's Eve dinner first

640
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,600
Come , come , please have a meal

641
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,080
Alright , step down

642
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,380
How does it feel now

643
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,559
It 's okay so far

644
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,940
When you said you gave birth to me

645
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,180
Heart - wrenching pain

646
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,640
You don 't know

647
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,920
At that time , there was no pain .

648
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,400
And you 're very fat , you know

649
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,920
That 's not how much you eat

650
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,719
I decided now

651
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,519
I don 't think it 's painless .

652
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,239
Because when I gave birth to you

653
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,400
I didn 't get painless

654
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,680
Then if I have no pain now

655
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,799
I give birth to the little treasure

656
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,519
I think I

657
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:30,380
It 's like this mom

658
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,559
It 's too easy

659
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,360
What do you think ?

660
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:33,380
No No No No

661
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:36,200
I sat in the electric chair , do you remember ?

662
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,959
From two fingers

663
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,360
Process to Open Fingers

664
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,319
Life is better than death

665
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,680
You will actually produce at that time

666
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,039
It will only hurt more than that

667
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:44,400
You have to fight without pain .

668
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,920
Actually , this pain

669
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,840
It 's between mother and baby

670
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,239
A special memory

671
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,959
You don 't understand

672
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,999
Today is a big day

673
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,180
Listen to me , I 'll eat more first

674
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:00,680
Dad , aren 't you cold ?

675
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,180
This

676
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,600
Sweating all the time

677
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:14,559
Li Yan , you 're going to be your brother .

678
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,360
I know

679
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,660
Your dad and my first time

680
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,739
When I was a father , was it

681
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,160
Unsatisfactory

682
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,499
Good

683
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,039
In fact

684
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,219
This half year

685
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:45,920
I , I 've been thinking

686
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,539
If

687
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,559
If you follow me

688
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:50,660
Will we

689
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,120
Just like you Aunt Mei Mei

690
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,479
Like Sister Susu

691
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
More intimate

692
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,160
What 's wrong

693
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,479
Do you know that you are crazy

694
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,120
Painless without beating

695
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,880
How can I stand it if I don 't fight ?

696
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,999
Yeah , then I talked for a long time

697
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:23,840
What did she tell me

698
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,700
The pain is of pregnant women

699
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,799
A unique life experience

700
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,140
Parturients

701
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,479
Is it so easy to move yourself

702
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:31,959
I can 't figure it out

703
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,100
I can 't persuade her , Uncle

704
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:33,940
I 'll advise you

705
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,959
You go you go you go

706
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,719
I can 't figure it out

707
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,519
Do you know that you are crazy

708
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,920
What is painless

709
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,819
Don 't make her emotional

710
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:42,259
Are you okay

711
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,779
Don 't listen to Gu Yunsu

712
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:44,799
Nonsense

713
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:45,739
Look now

714
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:46,999
Aren 't I fine ?

715
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,239
You Mei Mei

716
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,299
We choose this international department

717
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:52,239
Isn 't it just when I was born ?

718
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,819
Can everything be easier ?

719
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:54,380
Right

720
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,440
Why is it coming to an end ?

721
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,959
You 're still looking for trouble yourself

722
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,019
What do you mean ?

723
00:27:58,019 --> 00:27:59,299
I 'm asking for trouble

724
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,400
Not

725
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,440
I don 't want to see you suffer .

726
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:04,019
Then don 't look at it .

727
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,539
I gave birth to my own

728
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,620
Mei Mei

729
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,019
I understand you .

730
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,340
What do you understand ?

731
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,440
You are the only one who has finished giving birth

732
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,559
You can understand

733
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,059
Don 't say anything .

734
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:15,840
I 'll tell you

735
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,700
And I 'll let you out .

736
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,539
You know that

737
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,059
Look , look , look , look

738
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:27,299
Painless Painless Painless

00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,380
Painless Painless Painless

740
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,580
Doctor Doctor

741
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,259
Hurry , hurry , hurry

00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:30,900
It 's okay . It 's okay .

00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,319
What is painless and painless

746
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,180
Your family

747
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,920
That we are

748
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,459
Only one family can accompany the childbirth

749
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:37,620
Let 's see who enters

750
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,819
Let 's discuss it .

751
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,580
You , please give her no pain .

752
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,860
Fight well

753
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,360
Relax Relax Relax

754
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,459
It 's still painless .

755
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:48,860
You 're out

756
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,539
I can 't persuade you

757
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:50,360
Is it difficult to persuade

758
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:52,979
Entered delivery room

759
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,180
Why did you come out ?

760
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,019
The doctor said that only one family member could accompany him

761
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,180
You go .

762
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,739
Susu , why don 't you go ?

763
00:28:58,739 --> 00:28:59,539
What are you saying ?

764
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:00,600
You are the father of the child

765
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,700
You must be going .

766
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,100
Susu , you should stay with your mom

767
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,940
You should go .

768
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,559
You go

769
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,180
Why don 't you two guess ?

770
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,259
Don 't think about it . Go .

771
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:08,900
When

772
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,420
Don 't be humble

773
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,580
Listen to my Uncle Li , you go

774
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,140
Go to Li Yan to undress your father

775
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,940
Walk , walk , walk

776
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,660
Lai Li Yan Lai Tie

777
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:14,979
This

I gave you birth

972
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,180
is the bravest thing I have ever done

973
00:35:45,299 --> 00:35:46,359
Until now

974
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:49,140
I never regret it

975
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,060
Then get better quickly

976
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,960
After all , you are a mother

977
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,799
I use the stars in the sky

978
00:35:58,259 --> 00:35:59,140
Exchanged

979
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,100
I love you my child

980
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:09,180
I love you

981
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,899
But I love you

982
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,500
My child

983
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,060
I love you

984
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,239
That 's all

985
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:27,439
Mom

986
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,799
Mom , I love you

987
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,100
I love you Susu

988
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:36,620
Thank you

989
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:51,879
Let 's take a look

990
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:53,759
Be careful

991
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:54,980
Come to see Mom

992
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,980
Help me with my head

993
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,120
Please help me

994
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,759
OK OK

995
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,180
Great

996
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:48,160
How about it ?

997
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,339
How is it going ?

998
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:50,759
My mother is very nice

999
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,580
Where 's the child

1000
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,680
Sister

1001
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:55,140
Great , great

1002
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:56,239
Put on your clothes quickly

1003
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,319
Put on your clothes and don 't catch cold

1004
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:58,480
Do you know what I

1005
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,160
I even cut her umbilical cord

1006
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,799
How does it feel

1007
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,660
When I started

1008
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,759
I 'm a little nervous

1009
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:04,879
My hands are shaking a little

1010
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:05,239
But I

1011
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,640
When you cut it off

1012
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,819
It 's kind of like cutting a ribbon

1013
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,100
Ribbon cutting

1014
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,640
And that feeling

1015
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,719
It 's not quite what I thought .

1016
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:12,319
What it feels like

1017
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:14,219
It 's tough , you know ?

1018
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:15,359
It 's tough like a beef tendon

1019
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,160
Beef tendons are cut rubber bands

1020
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:19,680
When she was born

1021
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,680
I couldn 't even look at her

1022
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,600
Because many people don 't say it

1023
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,879
When the baby is born

1024
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,980
Isn 't it that nice ?

1025
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:24,839
But

1026
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,120
When I saw her

1027
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,799
My sister is really beautiful

1028
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,759
Did you know

1029
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:32,520
Her face is white

1030
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,060
And then she is

1031
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:36,160
Beautiful , beautiful , beautiful

1032
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,680
I 'm so excited

1033
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,580
Not excited Not excited Not excited

1034
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,939
She , she , she is still like this

1035
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,439
Put my hand with my mom

1036
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:44,319
Hold it like this

1037
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:45,399
I I

1038
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,000
Isn 't it amazing

1039
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,060
No wait a minute

1040
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,560
Why am I the only one who is happy here ?

1041
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,439
Where are he , he , he , they ?

1042
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,520
Where do you see ?

1043
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,680
Extremely nervous

1044
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,640
Li Yan Li Yan

1045
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,520
Don 't worry , it 's fine .

1046
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,759
Very good

1047
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,759
Where 's your father

1048
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,319
I don 't know .

1049
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:06,359
You have a sister

1050
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,279
OMG

1051
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,540
Where is Uncle Li ?

1052
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,919
You see how nervous he is

1053
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,239
Uncle Li

1054
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,219
Li Shukuai

1055
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:20,879
Come and see your wife and children

1056
00:39:20,879 --> 00:39:21,680
Hurry , hurry , hurry

1057
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:23,580
Please slow down , slow down

00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,080
Slow down

Yes daughter Yes daughter

1060
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,600
Daughter

1061
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,040
Slow down

1062
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:32,439
Thank you for your hard work , Mei Mei Mei

1063
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,680
Mei Mei , you 're the best .

1064
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,120
Mei Mei

1065
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,020
It 's a sister

1066
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:36,120
Are you not happy , Mei Mei

1067
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:36,799
Alright

1068
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:38,259
Make up some sugar or you

1069
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:39,319
Just pretend to be you

1070
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:40,779
I 'm so sleepy

1071
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,580
Then you have a rest

1072
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,640
Li Jianxiong

1073
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,439
Your clothes are so shiny

1074
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,100
Yes

1075
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,160
Where is the ward

1076
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,719
Here , Here , Good , Good Walk

1077
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,580
Go

1078
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,600
What are you laughing at , Li Yan

1079
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,339
Eyes are a bit like Aunt Wu

1080
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,960
This mouth is a bit like you

1081
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,560
Have a good rest quickly

1082
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,359
You 're awesome .

1083
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,839
I once asked myself

1084
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:17,680
Everyone is at home

1085
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,819
Burdened with hard work

1086
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,359
Still working hard

1087
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:21,739
Why ?

1088
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:24,500
I seem to know a bit now

1089
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,259
Probably because more than disappointment

1090
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,819
Hope for more

1091
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,719
Compared to disgust

1092
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,359
Like more

1093
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,839
Compared with sacrifice and compromise

1094
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,560
More gains

1095
00:40:38,899 --> 00:40:40,040
In this home

1096
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,379
I felt it for the first time

1097
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:42,680
Hard work is good

1098
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,000
It 's also good to be sad

1099
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,080
Here 's your comfort

1100
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:48,020
Elsewhere in the world

1101
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,460
Unable to give

1102
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:52,080
And my mom and I

1103
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,779
It 's no longer just me and my mom

1104
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:58,899
Grandma

1105
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,100
Mom gives birth

1106
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,040
It 's a sister

1107
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,980
Mother and daughter are safe

1108
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,520
My sister is soft

1109
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,279
Pink

1110
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:05,219
So small , so small

1111
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,460
I 'm afraid to touch her

1112
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,080
If you were here

1113
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,799
The corner of your mouth must reach your temples

1114
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:11,719
Please rest assured , Grandma

1115
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,120
We 're all fine

1116
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,160
Just

1117
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,279
I really miss you

1118
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,439
Holding your clothes

1119
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,799
I can still smell you

1120
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,020
It feels like you haven 't gone far

1121
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,719
Grandma , I miss you so much

1122
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,239
There 's only one minute left

1123
00:41:57,419 --> 00:41:58,500
Almost one minute left

1124
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,359
Just one minute left

1125
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,899
Come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come

1126

Come , come , come , come , come , come

1129
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:06,879
Are you here ?

1130
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,379
Mom

1131
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,879
I seem to hear Nian Nian cry

1132
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:09,839
Do you want to go in and have a look ?

1133
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,060
Uncle seems to cry every year

1134
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,680
Gu Yunsu

1135
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,739
Are you a little nervous right now

1136
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,080
Let me interview you

1137
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,339
Are you particularly nervous

1138
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,819
What 's so nervous about

1139
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:18,600
Tell us about it

1140
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,439
Don 't talk about her

1141
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:21,020
I 'm a little nervous

1142
00:42:21,419 --> 00:42:22,500
No , I actually cried .

1143
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,520
Didn 't you hear crying ?

1144
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,219
No No

1145
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:25,939
You don 't want this

1146
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,500
Uncle Kaikai Start

1147
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,239

This is my first time

On this screen

1153
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:38,319
Seeing people I know

1154
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,439
All right , all right , all right

1155
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:40,839
Since it is

1156
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:41,560
See my name

1157
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,439
Let 's eat

1158
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:43,580
Gu Yunsu , listen to me

1159

I want to speak

1160
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,480
I want to speak

1161
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,700
I think so

1162
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:48,700
There is no perfect work

1163
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,899
Is that so ?

1164
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:51,460
What if there are shortcomings ?

1165
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,180
You should allow everyone to spray it

1166
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,660
Yes No

1167
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:54,080
Of course

1168
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,560
If you write it well

1169
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,259
We will

1170
00:42:56,259 --> 00:42:57,500
Without stingy praise

1171
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,120
I think

1172
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,359
If this play has merit

1173
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,739
That 's all your credit

1174
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,460
There are no shortcomings at all

1175
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:02,879
Right

1176
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:05,279
Dr. Xu is so good at talking

1177
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:06,799
All right

1178
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:07,960
We can eat now

1179
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,799
Okay , I won 't read it for now

1180
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:09,419
Come

1181
00:43:10,899 --> 00:43:11,660
How is that possible ?

1182
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,640
We need it now

1183
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,719
This is the most important thing

1184
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:14,299
Aunt Wu Aunt Wu

1185
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:15,080
Is that you

1186
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:16,560
This actor is pretty good

1187
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:19,000
It 's a little worse than me

1188
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,120
Don 't talk nonsense

1189
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:20,899
This actor is very

1190
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:21,919
It 's hard to invite

1191
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:22,319
This actor

1192
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,000
Wait a minute , wait a minute

1193
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,660
Wait a minute

1194
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:25,759
Is this me

1195
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:27,759
This is you

1196
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,339
You , you , see clearly

1197
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:30,279
She did this

1198
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:30,739
She

1199
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:31,419
Don 't you think

1200
00:43:31,419 --> 00:43:32,480
Is she a little exaggerated ?

1201
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,839
I can 't control other actors .

1202
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:34,879
How to play it

1203
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,020
My script looks like

1204
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,799
I think it 's fine

1205
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:38,040
Why is she so deformed ?

1206
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,799
No No

1207
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,719
Is she going to demonize me

1208
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,759
It 's not what she meant

1209
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:43,000
No , no , no , listen to me .

1210
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,560
It looks like this

1211
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,799
This drama

1212
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:45,839
Although from life

1213
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:46,560
But above life

1214
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,439
You know that

1215
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,520
This is called character color .

1216
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,279
Don 't question it .

1217
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:50,660
Let me tell you

1218
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,560
This actor is amazing

1219
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,319
Let me tell you .

1220
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,759
Five episodes of I I Endure

1221
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:55,520
If she 's still like this after five episodes

1222
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,299
What do you want ?

1223
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:57,120
I smashed the TV

1224
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,799
You smashed the TV

1225
00:43:57,799 --> 00:43:58,799
Row Row Row

1226
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:00,279
Uncle Li , you are better than this

1227
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:01,480
Li Jianxiong is an actor .

1228
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,520
A little more man

1229
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,399
He has a strange accent

1230
00:44:04,399 --> 00:44:05,279
What 's so so

1231
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:06,319
That 's weird

1232
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,000
It really is

1233
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,060
Did you train him ?

1234
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,879
Why is he just like you ?

1235
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:12,379
Where is it

1236
00:44:12,379 --> 00:44:12,799
Li Yan

1237
00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:14,000
So what should we do ?

1238
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,319
I 'm sorry .

1239
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,239
For many reasons

1240
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,359
I can only write you

1241
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,640
That means you like me

1242
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,100
But I know

1243
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,299
You didn 't mean that to me

1244
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:21,319
But I 'll find you this

1245
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:22,439
This little guy is not bad .

1246
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:24,040
Na Na Na

1247
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:24,640
Good specification

1248
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,759
That 's it

1249
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:26,879
A little too pretentious

1250
00:44:26,879 --> 00:44:29,520
He 's a little too pretentious .

1251
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,120
Xiaoyan

1252
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,600
Xiaoyan is a little nervous when she talks

1253
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,859
This is what you usually do

1254
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:36,060
You pretend more than him

1255
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,080
You pretend more than him

1256
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,140
This woman also gave me Gu Yunsu

1257
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,500
Do I have this at ordinary times

1258
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,819
You are indeed like this

1259
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:43,399
It wasn 't her acting

1260
00:44:43,399 --> 00:44:44,540
Like a psycho

1261
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:48,299
Don 't

1262
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:51,980
Then she turned back

1263
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,120
Then then either or

1264
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,859
You said you were with that

1265
00:44:54,919 --> 00:44:56,239
Different from that actor

1266
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:38,140
Please relax

1267
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,739
It 's okay . We 're normal .

1268
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:41,060
It 's already recorded , right ?

1269
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,299
It 's okay , it 's okay

1270
00:47:42,299 --> 00:47:42,899
Hello everyone

1271
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:45,219
My name is Wu Limei

1272
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:46,319
Li Yan and our audience

1273
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,180
Say hello

1274
00:47:48,779 --> 00:47:49,299
Hello

1275
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,439
Thank you Susu

1276
00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:52,219
Write about our family

1277
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:53,219
So well written

1278
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,540
But some places are still slightly

1279
00:47:55,779 --> 00:47:57,439
A little bit

1280
00:47:57,739 --> 00:47:59,339
It 's a little exaggerated .

1281
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:01,219
The audience is very interested

1282
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:02,739
Wu Limei and Gu Kangqi

1283
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:03,660
and Li Jianxiong

1284
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,259
The three of you

1285
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:05,180
The emotional story between them

1286
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,259
What is it like ?

1287
00:48:08,739 --> 00:48:10,100
This is a bit puzzling

1288
00:48:10,379 --> 00:48:11,219
Creating something out of nothing

1289
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:12,100
It looks like this

1290
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,859
This art .

1291
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:15,180
It comes from life

1292
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,660
But higher than life

1293
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:18,299
What about this plot

1294
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:20,060
It basically belongs to the high section

1295
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,239
In the hospital , Gu Kangqi and I

1296
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:23,600
It 's not that ugly .

1297
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,899
We are very decent people .

1298
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,219
Yes Yes Yes

1299
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:29,120
They are all decent people decent people

1300
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,299
What else do you have ?

1301
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:31,859
Do you want to tell the audience ?

1302
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,120
I wanted to ask you .

1303
00:48:33,259 --> 00:48:34,540
Our

1304
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:36,700
I took that cooking

1305
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,080
Community Gold Award

1306
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,580
Is there any more broadcast now ?

1307
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,960
This has not been broadcast yet

1308
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,480
It 's not broadcast yet

1309
00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:45,759
I play chess

1310
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:46,960
Won the Little Expert Championship

1311
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,600
Has it been broadcast

1312
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:48,960
This is not yet

1313
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,299
Not broadcast yet

1314
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:51,859
I hit

1315
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:54,779
Has the Tai Chi Tournament been broadcast ?

1316
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,839
You also know martial arts

1317
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,660
Didn 't see this either

1318
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,140
Spoiler

1319
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:02,120
What do you think about this this

1320
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,640
The actor who plays Li Yan

1321
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,520
How did he play ?

1322
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,040
Does it look like the real you

1323
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:06,919
Not so good

1324
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:08,439
Unlike

1325
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:09,319
First

1326
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,480
I think he 's too pretentious

1327
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:13,339
second

1328
00:49:14,279 --> 00:49:16,060
I won 't call Gu Yunsu Sister

1329
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:17,339
Impossible

1330
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:18,379
The third

1331
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:21,660
I couldn 't see it at all

1332
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:23,319
Men 's Boxing Match

1333
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:24,960
Never
