1
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,380
Who is it ?

2
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,001
Who is it ?

3
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,321
Who is doing what ?

4
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:26,400
Li Yan

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,681
What is Li Yan ?

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,080
I am Li Jianxiong 's son

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,900
Wu Limei 's stepson

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,141
Gu Yunsu 's legal younger brother

9
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:31,941
Li Yan

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,641
Then what are you doing with me ?

11
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:36,420
Gu Yunsu said

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,560
You can stay here for one night

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,020
What

14
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:39,360
Spend one night

15
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:40,220
She sent a message

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,921
Take a look

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,001
Su Su ah

18
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:44,440
This is a strange thing .

19
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:46,800
For no reason

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,601
I didn 't see it .

21
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:50,480
What exactly is that

22
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:01,300
What is the situation

23
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,360
Nothing will happen , right ?

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,840
I don 't know .

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,781
Maybe Aunt Wu has recently

26
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:08,120
I 'm in a bad mood .

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,201
What happened to her

28
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:10,760
There 's a gap with my father

29
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:11,681
With your father

30
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:13,840
Who is this ?

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,980
Who is it ?

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,980
The current son of his ex - wife

33
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,521
Li Yan

34
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:25,681
Accurate

35
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:26,961
So complicated

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,661
Is this complicated

37
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:30,000
That 's all .

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,840
What 's wrong with him

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,540
He

40
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,640
I 'll stay here tonight

41
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,441
You may be disturbing

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,640
I 'm sorry

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,441
You have a lot of relatives .

44
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:40,900
Territory of our relatives

45
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,760
It 's really big

46
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,920
What do you want to do ?

47
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:46,321
Why don 't we forget it tonight ?

48
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:47,961
What if I say it doesn 't ?

49
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:48,980
Yes

50
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:50,681
There must be a first - come , first - served approach .

51
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:51,601
Why don 't you make a scene ?

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,161
Crying , making trouble and hanging himself

53
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:54,280
Let 's see if we can get this guy .

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,161
Scared away

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,760
Is it appropriate for me to make trouble with one child ?

56
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,601
What should I do ?

57
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:59,081
Give him money to stay in a hotel

58
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,120
Did you hear that

59
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,480
I can 't open a room without my ID card

60
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,181
And

61
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:02,721
Aunt

62
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:03,920
First come , first served

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,321
But I 'm related to him

64
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:06,120
I 'm sorry

65
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,241
What is your family ?

66
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:12,400
What happened

67
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,961
No one told me the details .

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,361
It 's not you , a Shinto .

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,201
I haven 't checked your ID yet

70
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:20,961
I 'm leaving .

71
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:22,081
Good

72
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,120
Slow down

73
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,141
Don 't chase .

74
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:26,521
Is it useful

75
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:27,761
I don 't feel it anymore

76
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,681
My father chased me anyway

77
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,280
I know I 'm not like your father

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,241
My dad said the same thing

79
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:33,641
What did your father say ?

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,081
Say he 's different from you

81
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,600
Why is it different

82
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,481
What did he say ?

83
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,241
Let me listen

84
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,141
He said

85
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,961
He loves Aunt Wu more

86
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:42,840
He said this

87
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:44,461
Or

88
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,720
Usually your father and Aunt Wu

89
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,320
How do they get along with each other ?

90
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,201
Don 't we quarrel ?

91
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,681
What is Susu 's condition in your house

92
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,041
Does your father treat Susu well

93
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:52,620
Aunt Wu

94
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,120
Do you torture your father ?

95
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,440
Want to hear it

96
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,880
Of course I want to hear it

97
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:57,761
You know my dad

98
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,720
What did you tell me ?

99
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,880
What am I asking ?

100
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,961
Other people 's affairs

101
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,100
Inquire less

102
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:04,521
He

103
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,060
Let me tell you something too

104
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:16,481
There is one person rowing a boat

105
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:18,021
The paddle broke while paddling

106
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,840
Don 't you want to know why

107
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,361
Finished

108
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,481
Are you all hungry

109
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,200
I 'll give it to you

110
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,741
Get something to eat in kitchen

111
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:09,421
I 'm not hungry , thank you , Uncle

112
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:15,580
Mei Mei

113
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:17,580
Dinner

114
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,401
Mei Mei

115
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:44,641
I never have a mother anymore

116
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,480
Mom

117
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:54,600
Mom , listen to me

118
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:56,720
You give it to Grandma

119
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,220
Every message sent

120
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,080
She heard it all

121
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,220
Really

122
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,340
She heard every one of them

123
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,480
She has forgiven you

124
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,001
She 's not angry .

125
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:12,381
Do you know

126
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:10,381
Aunt Wu

127
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,161
In our first trimester

128
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:13,740
Blood pressure has been stably controlled

129
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,720
But due to the recent situation

130
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,940
Large mood swings

131
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:17,281
Now

132
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,501
Blood pressure values are unstable

133
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,740
Combined with your age

134
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,200
And the detection data just now

135
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,881
Assist in judgment

136
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,600
As your attending physician

137
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:26,001
For your body

138
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,021
I hope you will be careful

139
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:28,161
Think about it

140
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:29,240
Fetuses

141
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,080
We

142
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,220
We can cooperate again

143
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,021
That 's right

144
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,440
There 's no problem between the two of us

145
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,681
When I was doing ultrasound just now

146
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:44,960
That fetal heart rate is very good

147
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:47,060
Xiao Xu

148
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:48,881
Can you be more specific

149
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:49,781
Tell us about it

150
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,840
On possible problems

151
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,960
What about during pregnancy

152
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,001
For various reasons

153
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,720
Pregnant women without hypertension

154
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,641
Also during the first trimester of pregnancy

155
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:58,840
Occurs with a small probability

156
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,161
Pregnancy - Induced Hypertension

157
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,480
What about you like Aunt Wu

158
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,100
Yes

159
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,541
Chronic hypertension

160
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:04,541
High probability in the later stage

161
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:06,200
Blood pressure increases further

162
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:07,761
This can cause proteinuria

163
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,541
Jaundice

164
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:09,740
Hepatic impairment

165
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:11,041
Even convulsions

166
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:12,840
We call it eclampsia

167
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,661
or

168
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:15,320
Dr. Xu is sorry

169
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,460
Let me interrupt you

170
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,881
Is it understood as

171
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:19,681
If my mom insists now

172
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,600
She insisted on giving birth to this baby

173
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:26,041
It 's just risking your own life

174
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,060
What 's the result ?

175
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:31,921
No one can guarantee

176
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:32,921
Right

177
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,661
This can be understood

178
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,360
Mei Mei

179
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:55,421
What do you think

180
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:02,041
Let 's go Uncle Gu

181
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,820
Line

182
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:03,720
Thank you .

183
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,881
Don 't come if you have nothing to do .

184
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,360
Susu

185
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:41,781
Susu , listen to me .

186
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,281
That

187
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:44,700
I know about your grandmother

188
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,021
I 'm sorry .

189
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,940
Is your mother okay ?

190
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,860
How could it be fine ?

191
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:52,301
I

192
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:53,661
I won 't tell you anymore

193
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,200
I accompanied my mother for surgery

194
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,781
Hung up

195
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,940
What surgery is it ?

196
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,720
People flow

197
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:04,980
People flow

198
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:07,960
Hello

199
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,460
Now prepare for anesthetic

200
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,060
I 'll feel a little dizzy later

201
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,480
If you feel dizzy

202
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,740
Just sleep for a while .

203
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:14,641
Aunt Wu

204
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,261
Don 't worry .

205
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,860
Then let 's begin

206
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:15,901
I want to be born

207
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:17,001
Aunt Wu

208
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,600
It 's now back

209
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,621
The situation just now

210
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,121
Pregnancy and childbirth

211
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:23,240
For a woman

212
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,860
It 's not one thing

213
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,121
Something particularly simple

214
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:26,401
Especially your age

215
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,281
Subsequent fetal development

216
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,440
This will bring many problems

217
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,720
I 'm worried about your health

218
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,560
Dr. Xiao Xu

219
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,421
Is this a probability ?

220
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,100
It 's not 100 % .

221
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:36,480
I 've figured it out .

222
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,921
I still want to try again

223
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:38,761
What are you trying

224
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,080
What are you trying ?

225
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,200
The one in your belly

226
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,041
Embryo 's life is life

227
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,121
Your life is not your life .

228
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:45,240
I just lost someone

229
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,401
I don 't want to lose another one

230
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,041
I just lost a loved one too

231
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,560
I don 't want to lose you again .

232
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,041
Understand

233
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,560
Dr. Xiao Xu

234
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,840
I figured it out . Really

235
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,100
Can you help me again

236
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:04,360
Think of something

237
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:06,041
I want to try again

238
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:10,360
Aunt Wu

239
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,600
If you are sure to protect your fetus

240
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,901
Then Aunt Wu , first you have to

241
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,121
Control your emotions

242
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:17,621
OK

243
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,121
Be more careful than before

244
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:20,521
Treat your body carefully

245
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:21,021
OK

246
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,281
Closely monitor blood pressure

247
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,121
Timely Adjustment

248
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,240
Medications for controlling blood pressure

249
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,080
To be on the safe side , we have to have one

250
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,261
Having basic medical knowledge

251
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,080
Professional Caregiver

252
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,600
24 - hour personal escort

253
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,681
We have some at home

254
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,041
Who is it ?

255
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:32,621
You

256
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,320
Su Su is thoughtful

257
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:36,801
What did I just say

258
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:38,121
Gives you this illusion

259
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:38,960
I cover food and accommodation

260
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:39,940
Can I pay you a little more ?

261
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,041
This includes food and accommodation

262
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,440
Is this a salary issue ?

263
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,320
Wu Limei , please find out

264
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
I don 't want you to have this baby

265
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,440
I want to accompany you now

266
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,181
Do you want to risk yourself ?

267
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,761
Please explain it clearly

268
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:49,600
What 's going on

269
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,661
Let you stop me

270
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,681
Don 't call me .

271
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:54,641
No , no , Sususususu

272
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,001
How was Susu 's surgery ?

273
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,301
Is your mother okay , Aunt Wu

274
00:15:57,301 --> 00:15:58,021
Aunt Wu , don 't get excited

275
00:15:58,021 --> 00:15:59,720
Don 't worry about her health .

276
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,980
Wu Limei has lived enough .

277
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,840
Her own life

278
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,761
She doesn 't want it anymore

279
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,960
What are you talking about ?

280
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,121
Mei Mei , calm down too .

281
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:06,021
Calm down . What calm down ?

282
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:06,881
Compare your heart with your heart

283
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,041
Can I calm down

284
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,840
How

285
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,161
Calm down and show me .

286
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,480
You all do this to me

287
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,881
Is there a way to live this life ?

288
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:13,580
Aunt Wu chatting slowly

289
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,480
The conversation started slowly .

290
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:15,781
Why doesn 't Nobita know ?

291
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:16,641
Go ahead of you

292
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,801
Your mom just had surgery

293
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,281
No , that kid just didn 't

294
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,560
Can your mother stand this ?

295
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,401
It has to be raised

296
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,980
My own body

297
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:24,860
My own body

298
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,041
Isn 't it okay if I decide ?

299
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:26,881
Then you give birth

300
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,161
Why did you want me to be your nurse ?

301
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:28,881
You give birth

302
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,281
I can 't do it now .

303
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,320
I need someone to help me .

304
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:33,060
because of myself

305
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,560
Can 't take care of yourself

306
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,641
You are my daughter

307
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:37,121
Can 't I beg you now ?

308
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,360
I hope this time

309
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,521
My family is nice to me

310
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,320
Can 't it ?

311
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:41,840
Mei Mei , we are all by your side .

312
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:43,641
Gu Yunsu , just tell the truth

313
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:44,860
Do you do it or not

314
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:48,960
We

315
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,641
Let 's not get so excited

316
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:52,661
We are calm

317
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:53,521
Have a good chat

318
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:54,141
Is it good ?

319
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:55,240
Yes , yes , don 't get excited

320
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,340
Fetal gas , fetal gas

321
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:04,720
I really can 't figure it out

322
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:05,921
What are you pregnant with

323
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:07,560
What a ruthless character .

324
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:08,521
Is he worth it

325
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:10,001
You just risked your life .

326
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:11,460
Do you have to give birth to him ?

327
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,260
OK

328
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:13,760
Let 's not talk about this for now

329
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,800
How old are you this year

330
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,440
You give birth to him at your age

331
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,641
Do you have the energy to take care of him

332
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:19,800
Can you play with him every day

333
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,040
Is he happy to be born by you

334
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,440
Is he happy to be born by you

335
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,020
Just tell me if you want to help me

336
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,821
I won 't help

337
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:26,520
I said I wouldn 't help .

338
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,401
Gu Yunsu

339
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,260
When you have nowhere to go

340
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,901
Did you come home

341
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:31,500
I 'll take care of you

342
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,000
It doesn 't matter if you live or drink it .

343
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Stop talking

344
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,280
You

345
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,621
Why are you talking about this ?

346
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:37,581
What are you doing at home

347
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:38,321
Now I need

348
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,381
Someone helps me

349
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:40,421
You are my own daughter

350
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:41,740
And you won 't help me

351
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,381
Did you say you were busy at home

352
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:44,980
You 're busy and I 'll forget it .

353
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,300
You don 't do anything

354
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,700
Can you help me ?

355
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,240
If you don 't do anything

356
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,661
OK

357
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:50,700
Then you go .

358
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,581
Don 't stay at home

359
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:52,540
Then I 'll get out of here

360
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,421
Love to Roll

361
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,740
Sister Susu

362
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:29,800
That day my mother and I

363
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,240
I picked up a lot at the seaside

364
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,500
Pretty little shell

365
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:34,361
Waiting for a sunset

366
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:36,081
Orange Sun

367
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,181
Sprinkled on the sea

368
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:39,980
Flickering in the waves

369
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,960
Those who surf

370
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,681
It 's like in

371
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:44,040
Surfing in the bright sea of stars

372
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:46,561
I 'm so envious .

373
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,440
I really want to stay longer

374
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,940
I don 't know what heaven is like

375
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,161
I don 't know where it is

376
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,480
Will I meet my grandmother

377
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,000
If that is the case , it will be fine

378
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,361
Sister Susu

379
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:12,780
We 'll meet again in the future

380
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:14,081
Right

381
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,141
Sister

382
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,240
Last time

383
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Directions discussed at the meeting

384
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,500
I can accept it

385
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,621
Excuse me

386
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:29,300
When can I sign the contract as soon as possible

387
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,220
At the last meeting

388
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:33,700
I think you 're interested in changing direction

389
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,421
There is a big conflict .

390
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,540
Last time I did

391
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,760
Meaning of Yin and Yang Weird Qi

392
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:40,921
But I got home

393
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:42,460
I seriously reflected

394
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:43,300
Look at me

395
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,740
A newbie with no name or surname .

396
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,220
I can get your appreciation

397
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:47,141
This itself

398
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:48,581
I should be grateful .

399
00:19:48,581 --> 00:19:49,881
And in terms of content

400
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:50,940
And directionally

401
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:51,720
The Company

402
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,061
It must be more experienced than me

403
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,700
I should learn

404
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,361
Susu

405
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,061
between us

406
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:57,940
This is not the case

407
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,740
Is it metaphysically false ?

408
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:02,861
I

409
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,020
My home has a little bit of it

410
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:06,460
Question

411
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,061
I want to move out

412
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,061
Therefore , a sum of money is urgently needed

413
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,240
But we can only follow

414
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,381
Directions given by the Company

415
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,341
Modify outline

416
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,341
All I can do is make it soon

417
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,661
But in my experience

418
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:22,421
High probability of passing

419
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:23,361
As long as you sign up

420
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,040
Pay down payment immediately

421
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:26,460
Can I take the liberty of asking

422
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,101
This signing fee and down payment

423
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,141
About what number it is

424
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,601
This

425
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:54,040
I can stay

426
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,061
Do you want to make a souvenir ?

427
00:20:57,901 --> 00:20:58,540
Su Su ah

428
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,901
Everything I just said

429
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,581
It 's not a certain deal

430
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:02,940
Are you okay

431
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,661
I understand I understand

432
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,980
I 'm a prudent person

433
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,780
I understand

434
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:06,881
All Promises

435
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:08,421
It can 't be completely calculated

436
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:09,540
Understand

437
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,181
Don 't worry , sister

438
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,101
I just like it

439
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:12,581
A person who risks death and lives afterward

440
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,621
Just this number

441
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,901
Just this number

442
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:16,980
It 's enough for me for this time

443
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,940
Maintain a  for the future

444
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,020
Positive fantasy

445
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,300
Susu is back

446
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,740
Come and wash your hands and eat .

447
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:30,901
Uncle did

448
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:32,500
Your favorite roast pork with bamboo shoots

449
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,220
Uncle

450
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,181
Thank you .

451
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:35,300
I 'm not hungry

452
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,061
You eat

453
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,181
This is still angry

454
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,341
What are you looking for ?

455
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,260
ID card

456
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,421
Why are you looking for ID cards ?

457
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:56,421
I made an appointment with Luo Jingjing to see the house

458
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:57,260
ID card is required

459
00:21:57,821 --> 00:21:59,460
Less than a few thousand dollars

460
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,421
Live under the pier

461
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,321
No ID card is required

462
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,321
I have five thousand dollars

463
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,381
Enough to rent for two months

464
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:05,540
What about the third month ?

465
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,121
Third Month

466
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:07,540
I will sign a contract with Wanhua Pictures

467
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,661
I 'll get the signing fee when the time comes

468
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,200
Move in a

469
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,381
In a more spacious house

470
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:10,980
Don 't worry about it

471
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,381
Didn 't you say you and Zhou Zimeng

472
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:14,061
Are creative ideas inconsistent ?

473
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:15,940
She and I have different ideas

474
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,581
You and I have different ideas of life

475
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,821
Think I owe you this time .

476
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:21,901
Spending money to redeem yourself

477
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:22,661
Buy a clean one

478
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:23,421
Hard Air

479
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,401
Then put the

480
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:26,460
Food and rent

481
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,141
There are also water , electricity and coal

482
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:28,220
Let 's go after settling the settlement

483
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:31,901
I owe it first

484
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,780
Want to write a bad check

485
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:35,681
Don 't think

486
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,901
You don 't settle for a day

487
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:37,700
Don 't leave for a day

488
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,740
Where are you doing ?

489
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,661
You don 't want me to go .

490
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:42,940
I want you to pay for your labor

491
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,081
I 'll write you an IOU

492
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:44,780
Is it ok

493
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:47,480
What about the rent

494
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,161
At market price

495
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,460
The second bedroom of the same apartment type

496
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:52,240
Water , electricity , coal , food , drink , and sparkle

497
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,381
We all share it

498
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:54,300
Time from

499
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,700
From last month

500
00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:08,581
Susu , you 're going out ?

501
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:11,621
Uncle

502
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:12,940
I

503
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:16,220
I went out looking for a house to live

504
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:17,661
Recent

505
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,581
I 'll stay at Luo Jingjing 's house for now

506
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:21,641
Later dinner

507
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:22,940
You don 't have to prepare mine either

508
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,800
Bye Bye Uncle

509
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:26,101
Not Susu

510
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:26,901
You You

511
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:37,940
Just

512
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:39,440
Just let her go .

513
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:42,980
Would you like to walk or not

514
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:44,700
Come , come , come , come

515
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:46,020
Be careful , be careful

516
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,581
This set has a very good location .

517
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:50,720
City Centre

518
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,020
This Household

519
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,621
Most of them are local

520
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,901
Safe and worry - free

521
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,101
Come , come , come , come

522
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:56,740
Go inside and take a look

523
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,341
Come , come , come , come

524
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,181
Look at this space

525
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:02,940
The top number of the row

526
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,581
Eating , drinking and having fun are all around

527
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:05,421
We don 't worry about it either

528
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:06,520
Usually bored

529
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,101
Right

530
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:10,361
This house is old

531
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,581
Isn 't it a little old ?

532
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,980
It 's only more than ten years since it 's not old .

533
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,661
Impossible for more than ten years

534
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:17,240
Let me see that wall blank outside

535
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:18,540
It crackling and falling down

536
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,081
All Start

537
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:20,101
Either that or that

538
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:20,661
How about

539
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:22,220
What do you think about this ?

540
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,901
It 's too broken

541
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,581
Or these two days

542
00:24:24,581 --> 00:24:25,821
Show us a few more

543
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,780
This set of this color

544
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,181
That 's really nothing to say .

545
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,601
The only problem is

546
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,321
Commuting is not convenient

547
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,381
Take the subway to the city center for three shifts

548
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:36,841
About an hour

549
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,841
If you catch a taxi during rush hour

550
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:39,841
Then I 'm not sure

551
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:41,101
Burning money and time

552
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,561
This house is pretty good

553
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,740
That 's really good

554
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,681
It 's quite new here

555
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:49,661
But press Care Miss

556
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:51,240
According to the characteristics of this profession

557
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:52,601
Relatively free time

558
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:52,881
Yes

559
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,321
You don 't need to commute every day either

560
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,000
So this house

561
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,401
No matter in terms of cost performance

562
00:24:57,401 --> 00:24:58,800
Facility Conditions

563
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,181
It 's perfect for you

564
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:01,740
Reflect on yourself

565
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,720
I don 't want to tell you anymore

566
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,720
Goodbye

567
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,401
Jingjing

568
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,601
I decided

569
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:07,141
Just this room

570
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:07,800
Too Far

571
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,740
No

572
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:09,841
No

573
00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:11,700
Not far away

574
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:13,520
I 'll discuss it with her alone .

575
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,260
You discuss

576
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,200
I think this house is pretty good

577
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,121
How great is this

578
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:22,240
I 'm not a millionaire

579
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,480
I have no choice .

580
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:25,081
I dare to choose this

581
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:26,401
Didn 't I see through it yet

582
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:27,581
You don 't want to move out at all

583
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:28,520
Your mother 's home

584
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:29,641
Inspection of Rental House

585
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,081
It 's nothing more than pretending

586
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,861
Don 't think I don 't know .

587
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,040
You just want to run away from home

588
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,540
to compete for

589
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,401
The dominance between mother and daughter

590
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:39,520
What about this time

591
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,440
It 's really different

592
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,200
Play for real

593
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:42,240
My mom said that

594
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:43,681
Let me go .

595
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,121
Is bullying too much ?

596
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,061
Handsome Guy

597
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:49,960
Come in , sister

598
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,161
Please recommend a little more about that

599
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,280
Give us other houses

600
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,561
We just talked about it

601
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:57,421
Changed standard

602
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,161
I remember it all

603
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:00,780
Don 't break too far

604
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,881
Too many people

605
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,000
We need to break further

606
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,960
More mixed

607
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:06,280
The cheaper the better

608
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:08,621
Make your mother feel guilty

609
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:11,361
What about this set

610
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,841
Although there are many people and traffic is inconvenient

611
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:14,881
The house is still broken

612
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,101
But the advantages are still obvious

613
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,341
It is not far from the city center

614
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,181
And the rent is cheap

615
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,480
If you rent it in good faith

616
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,081
I can help you cut it again

617
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,700
Houses like this in the same community

618
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,641
Several more

619
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:30,480
But this set

620
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:31,460
It 's in the dwarf pile

621
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,621
The most excellent one

622
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,421
Line

623
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:38,280
I think I can live even if I clean up

624
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,000
Here it is

625
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,260
Please help me ask

626
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,800
Can it be cheaper ?

627
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,800
Leave it to me

628
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,960
I 'll ask you now

629
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:44,960
Thank you .

630
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:45,540
You You

631
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,480
Continue reading Continue reading

632
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,020
You can

633
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,760
You can live here

634
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:51,681
Alright

635
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:52,500
My mom and I used to

636
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,081
It 's no better place than here

637
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,361
OMG

638
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:56,821
Here

639
00:26:57,381 --> 00:26:59,081
It 's like a dangerous building

640
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:03,220
My mother asked me

641
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,361
How does the house look ?

642
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:06,681
She asked if you had enough trouble .

643
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,440
It 's almost settled

644
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:13,321
Su Su ah

645
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,940
Then it seems that Su Su

646
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,081
It 's determined

647
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,540
This is too dirty

648
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,760
I sent it again and again

649
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,520
You can translate it for the translator

650
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:27,520
To see if I can scare you .

651
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,401
Let me tell you .

652
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:35,440
It can 't be like this

653
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:36,740
This

654
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:38,561
I 'll tell you if you push it any longer .

655
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,540
That rabbit bites when it hurries .

656
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:43,561
A little gambling chip with you

657
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:47,601
Hair

658
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,341
You see

659
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:49,960
How cold and cold .

660
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,760
Susu doesn 't accept your feelings at all

661
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,141
Late concern is lower than grass

662
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,260
Picking

663
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:03,921
What 's wrong with your house

664
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,740
Send again

665
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:06,800
Some

666
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,321
Gives you experience descending the steps

667
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,361
The translation is accurate

668
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:12,161
Take her picture

669
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,581
Posting that kind of bad place

670
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,240
A little broken

671
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,681
This is this corner

672
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:18,520
Here

673
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:27,821
The House

674
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,401
Susu definitely can afford it .

675
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:32,101
I don 't think you can keep her this time

676
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:42,421
Look , look , look

677
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:44,621
I 'm anxious

678
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:45,700
Panic

679
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,821
She panicked . She panicked .

680
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:50,220
We just want to be stable

681
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,280
Steady Steady

682
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,800
Let me figure out what I can say

683
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,081
It will not be

684
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,520
You want to keep me

685
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,480
You see

686
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,581
Susu already saw that you were panicked

687
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,520
You really

688
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,800
Why should you

689
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,561
This is how to speak

690
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:07,121
Can 't you talk ?

691
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,841
Between Mother and Daughter

692
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:09,141
Is there anything to be angry about

693
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:10,821
Actually , Susu is just like you

694
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,601
Don 't look at her showing her teeth and claws

695
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,040
Her heart is very soft

696
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,200
You , please tell her properly .

697
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,101
Did you reply ?

698
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,440
I guess at this moment

699
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,101
Aunt is swearing

700
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:31,940
Then please help me translate

701
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,061
How do I express it

702
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:34,200
To make my mom feel it

703
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,720
Don 't I still follow you ?

704
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,921
Give birth to one and ask for trouble

705
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:40,040
Giving birth to two children can 't eat and walk around

706
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,381
How to send

707
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,401
Just say

708
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:47,280
I 'll sign up and pay in two days .

709
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,800
Are you tired after walking for so long ?

710
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,641
Not tired or tired

711
00:30:07,881 --> 00:30:09,000
Then I suggest you .

712
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,181
Order a cup of coffee at the entrance cafe

713
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:10,960
Take a break

714
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:11,740
My little stuff

715
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,780
Buy it quickly

716
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,901
It 's fine

717
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,040
I want to walk

718
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,641
Buy yourself something delicious

719
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:20,081
You are now

720
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:21,240
Appetite is the most important thing

721
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:25,101
You can eat that mooncake , right ?

722
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:26,921
You should be able to eat it

723
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,960
Not the key Not

724
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,720
See if you want to eat it yourself .

725
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,260
What flavor do you like

726
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,260
It 's okay , Cantonese style . This is

727
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:34,161
Lotus Paste

728
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,720
Two boxes

729
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,200
Yes

730
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,681
You see what I mean

731
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:40,601
It 's a holiday .

732
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:42,081
We are at home

733
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,960
Have a reunion dinner

734
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:45,780
Call Susu back

735
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:46,641
Right

736
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,280
You 're just right

737
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,000
Take this opportunity

738
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,321
Those words that hurt her

739
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,240
It 's all round .

740
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,081
Right

741
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,561
Reunion

742
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,000
What did I hurt her ?

743
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:58,601
Tell me something .

744
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:00,000
What you said the other day

745
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,280
It 's really a bit

746
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,121
If I hurt her that day

747
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:04,440
Why don 't you stop it ?

748
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,740
You mother and daughter

749
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,800
Full firepower

750
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,760
Who dares to rush up ?

751
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:13,720
Meimei , do you know

752
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,800
Whatever you are

753
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,161
Just a little too hard .

754
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,681
Especially for Susu

755
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,040
That mouth is harder

756
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:21,881
I think you 're a little softer

757
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:23,401
Just explain it to her .

758
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:24,800
You said you were angry too

759
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,200
The words go there

760
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,700
Right

761
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,581
Then she 's not a knot .

762
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:28,561
Is it solved ?

763
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:30,841
Then why am I submitting ?

764
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,601
Why can 't she be soft ?

765
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,681
Look how many days she 's been out

766
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,300
Did she send it to me

767
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,121
A SMS

768
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:39,240
Ask me if I 'm okay now

769
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,081
This is how I am

770
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,561
I still have to worry about her all day .

771
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,760
I 'm human too

772
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,240
Yes Yes Yes

773
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,000
It 's not an iron wall

774
00:31:46,081 --> 00:31:46,760
You you you

775
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,881
It 's not the other way around .

776
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:49,000
Then she 's angry

777
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,921
She 's not a big deal either

778
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:51,040
Can be very thoughtful

779
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,500
Right

780
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,720
You are mother and daughter

781
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,300
This is the world

782
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,280
Closest Relationship

783
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,361
Why is it like this ?

784
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:58,081
Injuring eight hundred people and losing one thousand to yourself

785
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:00,020
I think you as a mom

786
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,601
You just apologize to her

787
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:03,020
The mother apologizes to her daughter

788
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,740
That 's not shameful .

789
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,720
My mother doesn 't care about me anymore

790
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:07,240
She 's gone .

791
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:09,000
Now this bastard Gu Yunsu

792
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,040
She doesn 't want to bother me either

793
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,800
She 's leaving too

794
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,841
Li Jianxiong , tell me

795
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:13,240
If you don 't want to bother me

796
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,480
Tell me in advance

797
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:16,000
Say hello to me in advance

798
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,980
Have I failed in my life ?

799
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,161
Be a daughter Be a daughter

800
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:28,121
My daughter didn 't act well

801
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:30,240
Being a mother is not a good mother .

802
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:31,861
None

803
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,161
I 've lived for decades

804
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:33,960
I realized that

805
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,841
Actually , you all dislike me

806
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,000
Who dislikes you ?

807
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,901
What do I do

808
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:44,720
None of you have a good word .

809
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:47,200
I never did it before

810
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,621
A Right Thing

811
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,780
There is hard work without credit

812
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,240
I 'll use water instead of wine

813
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,681
Happy Mid - Autumn Festival to all of you

814
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:56,681
Lai Xiaoyan

815
00:33:57,141 --> 00:33:58,700
This is a family reunion .

816
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:04,341
Osmanthus Wine Brewing

817
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:05,121
Delicious

818
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,321
Happy happy

819
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,740
Susu is the happiest when she comes back

820
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,321
Right

821
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:10,661
Susu , you don 't know

822
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:12,280
The past few days when you were away

823
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,480
Mom , every day

824
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,321
I 'm thinking about you

825
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,240
Uncle Thank You , I 'm afraid you 'll have a bad time .

826
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:18,860
You come back

827
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:20,780
Look , this is the only way you can relax .

828
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,240
Right

829
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,800
No matter how stubborn this mother is

830
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,081
You can 't be as stubborn as your daughter , right ?

831
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:41,641
Xiaoyan , eat more .

832
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,181
Uncle Li

833
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,021
Mom

834
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,300
I 'm back today

835
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,380
Actually , it is mainly

836
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,061
Have this reunion dinner with you guys

837
00:34:52,461 --> 00:34:53,740
I 've already looked at the house

838
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:55,461
I moved out this evening

839
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,641
Biesusu

840
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,220
Today is the Mid - Autumn Festival

841
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,820
You finally came back .

842
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:02,380
Shuna 's intermediary

843
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,820
Appointment has been made

844
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,061
It 's just today

845
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:05,860
Yes

846
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,601
I 've already talked to the agent .

847
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:09,220
It 's not easy to let people go

848
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,021
If you really have to leave

849
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,581
Then I won 't stop .

850
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,001
Then Uncle Li is just right

851
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:17,380
Take advantage of this holiday

852
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,141
Cook a large table of dishes

853
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:21,981
It 's just a farewell party for you .

854
00:35:23,461 --> 00:35:23,860
Come

855
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,101
I wish my daughter every success in her career

856
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,340
Ride the Wind All the Way

857
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:28,360
It 's round and full

858
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:36,941
Uncle Li

859
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,681
Come

860
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:38,581
Let me toast you

861
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,101
OK

862
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,441
Thank you for this time

863
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:41,581
You took care of me

864
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:44,920
Later

865
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:47,700
My mother is sorry for troubling you .

866
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,441
That 's my wife .

867
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,021
Hi

868
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,760
Happy Mid - Autumn Festival , Teacher Wu

869
00:36:19,181 --> 00:36:21,001
Happy Mid - Autumn Festival , Zimeng

870
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:22,920
Signing the Contract

871
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,641
Thanks to you for persuading Susu

872
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,161
What did I advise ?

873
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,501
Originally Susu

874
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:30,621
Our Adaptation

875
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:31,661
is very contradictory

876
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,820
But a few days ago

877
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,860
All of a sudden comes to me

878
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:34,720
Said I figured it out

879
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:36,200
We are willing to cooperate

880
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:37,521
I thought

881
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:38,400
That must be Teacher Wu

882
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,581
You convinced her

883
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,800
No No No No

884
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,181
She never followed me

885
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:44,001
Talked about this before

886
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,240
He didn 't communicate with me either

887
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,320
What is this

888
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:48,061
Is there a big change

889
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,880
To her novel

890
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,300
That 's a little bit

891
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:54,280
Zi Meng

892
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:55,681
What if

893
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:57,121
You are disobeying her

894
00:36:57,121 --> 00:36:58,280
Adaptation of the original intention

895
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,400
Then even if she agrees to this matter

896
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,400
I can 't agree either

897
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:03,181
That thing

898
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:04,441
We have to respect each other

899
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:05,461
Do you think it 's true ?

900
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:06,380
Teacher Wu

901
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:08,260
You may not understand

902
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:09,581
Current film and television industry

903
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:10,501
It 's really hard

904
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:12,101
It 's not easy to make some money , is it ?

905
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,380
Zi Meng , listen to me

906
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,101
Let me introduce Susu to you

907
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:16,840
I hope you can help her

908
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,280
She 's not short of money

909
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:19,700
She is missing a

910
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,720
Appreciate her opportunity

911
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,360
Is that true ?

912
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,541
You do anything

913
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:24,240
You , you have your position

914
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,380
I understand .

915
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:26,581
But this collaboration

916
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:27,961
Both of two people

917
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,081
It is a win - win situation for each other

918
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,280
My daughter agrees

919
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,400
I don 't agree .

920
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,561
Can you think about it carefully

921
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:36,360
All right , Teacher Wu

922
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
We 'll think again

923
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,681
OK OK

924
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:39,320
That line

925
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,360
Happy Mid - Autumn Festival , Zimeng

926
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,601
Goodbye Goodbye

927
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:43,920
Think about it carefully

928
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:45,121
Good bye

929
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:50,220
Susu , I think that 's it .

930
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,700
Neither of us should force anyone

931
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:53,420
We will cooperate again when there is an opportunity in the future

932
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,481
Is there still room for chat ?

933
00:37:55,661 --> 00:37:56,800
I I can go there now

934
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,541
Looking for you

935
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,280
Susu , I have a meeting here .

936
00:37:59,300 --> 00:37:59,961
Hi

937
00:38:09,681 --> 00:38:10,280
That

938
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,260
This this this

939
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,380
This contract

940
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,621
Let 's not sign today .

941
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:17,121
Miss Gu , don 't be kidding .

942
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,001
How suitable is this house for you

943
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,981
This

944
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,121
Rent is not available

945
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:24,121
That 's why I can 't rent for that long

946
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,681
No No

947
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:25,981
That rent thing

948
00:38:25,981 --> 00:38:27,181
We can discuss it again

949
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:28,681
This house

950
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,880
There 's still a lot of this and I don 't have any money

951
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:31,141
No

952
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,380
I 'm sorry

953
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:33,280
Think again

954
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,441
I 'll see you next time

955
00:38:34,441 --> 00:38:35,641
I 'll have money next time

956
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:36,760
I will definitely come to you

957
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,001
Let 's thank you for the money .

958
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:39,200
I 'm sorry

959
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,021
I 'm sorry

960
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:41,521
Think again

961
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:42,880
Consider

962
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:06,541
Hello Luo Jingjing

963
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:07,260
Hi

964
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:09,380
Why is it so noisy ?

965
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,300
Where are you ?

966
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,780
I 'm playing . Are you coming ?

967
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:13,061
I 'm not going

968
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,860
What did you say

969
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,220
I 'm not going

970
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,681
You can play

971
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:17,200
All right , all right

977
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:38,941
This is a typing error

978
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:41,340
Correct

979
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:43,240

I am alone in Shanghai

988
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,860
I 'm working overtime at the company at the moment

989
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,200

00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,121

I 'll call you

994
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,240
Not looking for an ex

997
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:11,561

00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,541
Su Su ah

1007
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:50,800
Don 't worry about the box , don 't worry about the box

1008
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,961
There are the fast - forward slippers

1009
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,041
Hurry , hurry , hurry

1010
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,121
Back

1011
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:05,561
Don 't worry about it , don 't worry about it

1012
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:09,320
That

1013
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,041
I

1014
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,360
I probably

1015
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,720
I have to stay at your house for a while .

1016
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,521
I 'm sorry for your trouble .

1017
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,621
What do you mean by borrowing ?

1018
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:22,760
What do you call going home

1019
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:23,760
Come home

1020
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,001
Stay as long as you want

1021
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:25,760
When will love come back

1022
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,481
When will you come back

00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:28,320
Just come back

1024
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:30,420
I really didn 't expect it

1025
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,121
You came back so soon

1026
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:36,961
I 'm really worthless .

1027
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,441
Spend hours outside

1028
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:40,920
It 's already my limit

1029
00:41:41,641 --> 00:41:43,340
Would you like to give it

1030
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,880
Susu , cook something to eat

1031
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,420
What do you want to eat to Susu

1032
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,240
Uncle Li will do it for you right away

1033
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,800
Soon

1034
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,240
It 's not necessary

1035
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,400
I 'm a little tired too

1036
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,681
I went in to pack up and go to bed

1037
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:51,961
You guys should rest early too

1038
00:41:52,661 --> 00:41:53,720
I can do it myself

1039
00:41:56,021 --> 00:41:56,840
It 's okay , it 's okay

1040
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:04,161
You know

1041
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,720
Susu wants to come back

1042
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,700
I don 't know

1043
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:08,641
But she 's my daughter

1044
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,880
She 's not coming back here

1045
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,840
Where is she going ?

1046
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,900
Hello , the one with the urine test

1047
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:27,820
Thank you

1048
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:44,981
Give you some water

1049
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:45,601
OK

1050
00:42:51,121 --> 00:42:52,441
This nurse is ideal .

1051
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Buyer Seller

1052
00:42:55,081 --> 00:42:56,280
Catch the duck on the shelf

1053
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,601
It is important to be sincere to you

1054
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,400
Aunt Wu

1055
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,200
During this time

1056
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,320
You have your daughter to take care of it

1057
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,400
It couldn 't be better .

1058
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:04,880
Some things happen

1059
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,840
Let me tell her .

1060
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,320
Please go out for a rest first

1061
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,981
During this time

1062
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:09,001
You must relax

1063
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:09,720
How to treasure yourself

1064
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,681
It 's not an exaggeration

1065
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:12,521
Is there a problem with Dr. Xu ?

1066
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,001
The situation is very stable now

1067
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:14,800
Don 't worry

1068
00:43:16,121 --> 00:43:16,641
OK

1069
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,081
Dr. Xu

1070
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:28,461
My mom is now

1071
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:29,880
What 's going on ?

1072
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,121
Now Aunt Wu

1073
00:43:31,121 --> 00:43:32,041
What about the indicators

1074
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,260
It 's all normal

1075
00:43:33,461 --> 00:43:34,360
Especially blood pressure

1076
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:36,280
But we can 't let our guard down

1077
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,021
It is also necessary to strictly follow the medical advice

1078
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:39,260
As a carer

1079
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:40,561
You need to pay more attention

1080
00:43:46,181 --> 00:43:46,521
OK

1081
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:52,661
I changed my recipe today

1082
00:43:53,081 --> 00:43:54,081
Enough is enough

1083
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,441
Try it

1084
00:43:55,441 --> 00:43:56,800
Drink more yourself

1085
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,360
Xiaoyan , eat more .

1086
00:43:58,641 --> 00:43:59,641
Isn 't this chicken leg delicious ?

1087
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:02,400
Delicious

1088
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:04,041
It 's really different from before

1089
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,481
Chicken legs are popular

1090
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:13,280
Qin Yuxuan

1091
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:16,101
Still in touch

1092
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:17,920
Not

1093
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,820
Talking about business

1094
00:44:22,441 --> 00:44:23,041
Hi

1095
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:24,481
Hello it 's me

1096
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:26,720
Future Screenwriter

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,161
Don 't be sarcastic

1098
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:29,001
Say something when you have something to say

1099
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:29,840
Not sarcastic

1100
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:30,961
I read the outline

1101
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:33,001
Where 's the big producer in your mouth

1102
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:34,081
Want to win this project

1103
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:35,820
Make you a real screenwriter

1104
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,521
True or false

1105
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:38,700
Because

1106
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,240
Like this thing about me

1107
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:41,700
Not because of my relationship with you

1108
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,161
Right

1109
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,720
What is our relationship ?

1110
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,280
Please make it clear

1111
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:49,121
Don 't play word games with me .

1112
00:44:49,461 --> 00:44:49,740
You and I

1113
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,920
It doesn 't even matter about half a cent

1114
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,041
It 's over then

1115
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,720
An internal project meeting was held in the morning

1116
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,041
Passed by a large vote

1117
00:44:58,501 --> 00:44:59,581
At Wanhua Pictures

1118
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:00,681
I also found out for you .

1119
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,441
It was your mother who rejected her .

1120
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:08,681
I understand

1121
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,280
OK , thank you .

1122
00:45:16,101 --> 00:45:17,200
Susu , come and eat quickly

1123
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,001
Come

1124
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,581
Try this braised pork as well

1125
00:45:27,581 --> 00:45:28,161
Is it good ?

1126
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,681
You try a piece

1127
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,121
Stewed for two hours

1128
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,900
Pretty waxy

1129
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,501
This braised pork is for

1130
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:37,101
It tastes delicious when cooked for a long time

1131
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,161
It 's so fat but not greasy .

1132
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:52,820
Mom

1133
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,760
You know it

1134
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:02,161
I 'm not really against it

1135
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:03,621
You took the risk of having this baby

1136
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,300
It 's like I 'm not really against it .

1137
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:07,240
Your resignation is the same

1138
00:46:09,101 --> 00:46:10,181
But every time you

1139
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,380
It seems to be all

1140
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,441
misinterpret my concern for you as

1141
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,941
My rebellion against you

1142
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:17,720
Disobedience

1143
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:18,941
I accept it too

1144
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,121
Which family doesn 't have this misunderstanding ?

1145
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:21,700
Right

1146
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,061
Although it 's sad

1147
00:46:25,061 --> 00:46:25,820
But

1148
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,900
Grumbling and dispersing grievances

1149
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,001
It 's over .

1150
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,400
Don 't say anymore

1151
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,300
Let 's eat

1152
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,021
Yes Yes Yes

1153
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,320
Family

1154
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,280
Didn 't they all go home ?

1155
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,240
You 're doing well

1156
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,621
Why are you talking about this ?

1157
00:46:43,621 --> 00:46:44,461
Where is it ?

1158
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,621
Maybe you passed this .

1159
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:47,941
But I didn 't get past it .

1160
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:49,860
You 're still messing with me .

1161
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,061
Every time it seems

1162
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,061
What do I do

1163
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,340
Something that doesn 't go to your heart

1164
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,240
You just do it casually

1165
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,420
You can expel me from your house

1166
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,300
Because this is your home

1167
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,700
You said all the malicious words .

1168
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,300
Then you regret it and relent .

1169
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:01,700
A phone call

1170
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:02,700
Anything is fine

1171
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,820
It cut off my retreat .

1172
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,061
I have to be depressed again

1173
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,820
Carrying a box

1174
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,941
Come back to you

1175
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,820
I used to think

1176
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:10,101
No matter what I do

1177
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,601
I always have one

1178
00:47:11,601 --> 00:47:12,581
The Back Way Home

1179
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,820
But I see it now

1180
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,101
I 'm a

1181
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,860
The giant baby under the fence

1182
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:20,581
I don 't deserve your respect .

1183
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:22,501
I don 't deserve to be treated well .

1184
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,981
You will always have some authority

1185
00:47:23,981 --> 00:47:25,041
You can always

1186
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:26,220
ignoring my feelings

1187
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,220
Then easily

1188
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,501
It decided my life

1189
00:47:28,501 --> 00:47:29,860
You 're talking about Zhou Zimeng

1190
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,581
Yes No

1191
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:31,661
I just want you

1192
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:32,700
Respected

1193
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,681
I don 't want you to do it for money

1194
00:47:34,681 --> 00:47:35,900
compromise your work

1195
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,981
I 'm not wrong

1196
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:38,621
I did this for your own good

1197
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:39,280
Don 't say anything more

1198
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,481
It 's good for me .

1199
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:41,740
You 're my mother .

1200
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:43,021
But you can 't because

1201
00:47:43,021 --> 00:47:43,900
You don 't like it

1202
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,661
You don 't want it

1203
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:45,461
Just do whatever you want

1204
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:46,300
Decides my life

1205
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,340
Because that 's my life

1206
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,181
Not yours

1207
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,061
You have no right to interfere with my choices

1208
00:47:50,181 --> 00:47:51,260
You as adults

1209
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,141
Can you stop

1210
00:47:52,141 --> 00:47:53,461
Morality kidnapped its own child

1211
00:47:53,461 --> 00:47:55,061
What did I kidnap you ?

1212
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:55,920
I grew up

1213
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,860
To do this for you

1214
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,661
To do that for you

1215
00:47:57,661 --> 00:47:58,501
I 'm busy until now

1216
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,780
How did I kidnap you ?

1217
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,661
Without you

1218
00:48:00,661 --> 00:48:01,420
My life is impossible

1219
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,780
How hard it is now

1220
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:14,561
You admitted it

1221
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,820
You finally said it

1222
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:20,820
But Wu Limei

1223
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,860
This is funny

1224
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,001
You never asked me either

1225
00:48:27,981 --> 00:48:29,981
Asked me if I wanted to be your daughter
