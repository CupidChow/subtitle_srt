1
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,760
Why is this toilet blocked like this ?

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,740
What did you eat

3
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:30,920
The toilet is blocked

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,600
Your mouth is stuck too

5
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:33,341
You

6
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:34,481
It 's really interesting .

7
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:35,900
You said we both live on the same roof

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,080
It 's been a long time

9
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,361
Don 't talk if you can

10
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:40,721
I 'm quite convinced .

11
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:42,121
The toilet is blocked

12
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,481
Your mouth is stuck too

13
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:44,280
All blocked

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,041
You have such a bad temper

15
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,240
No one hates you .

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,960
You have such a bad personality

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,081
Does no one hate you ?

18
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:56,880
I 'm right

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,960
Someone really hates you

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,981
You were isolated at school

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,621
I can 't talk about it

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,320
Does anyone usually talk to you ?

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,201
That 's because I ignored others .

24
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:13,160
That is isolated

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,080
I can 't talk about it .

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,360
Yes , you can isolate others

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,241
If at school

28
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:20,681
A group of people are bullying you

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,621
Don 't be afraid

30
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,800
Find the one who takes the lead .

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,981
You found him right . You

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,280
Just fuck him

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,481
You 've gotten him all over .

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,961
As long as he takes it .

35
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:31,360
Everyone will be convinced from now on

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,241
Especially useful

37
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:32,920
You 're uncomfortable

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,520
You have to tell them I 'm upset

39
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:36,420
Don 't be timid , don 't be afraid

40
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:37,841
I have experience

41
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:39,580
What I tried worked

42
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,201
Picking soft persimmons

43
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,821
Are you okay

44
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:46,080
Picking soft persimmons

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
Pinch pinch

46
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,061
Uncle

47
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,381
You have something to tell me

48
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:35,981
Today 's prenatal check - up

49
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,020
It 's very important

50
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,340
OK ? Routine prenatal examination

51
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:40,701
That 's also after discharge

52
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:41,960
This is the first time to see Dr. Xiao Xu

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,501
Right

54
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:55,800
Not

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,261
For Why

56
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:57,960
All the way

57
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,221
Always peeking at me

58
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,101
Is there any

59
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,860
Yes

60
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,381
No

61
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,261
No

62
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,061
Yes .

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,501
Don 't be too sensitive

64
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:06,221
Is it good ?

65
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:08,101
This is not normal .

66
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,221
Look at me again

67
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:12,821
How about you

68
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:14,061
Sit back and see me

69
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:16,721
Dr. Xiao Xu

70
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,080
I haven 't seen you for more than a week

71
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,920
How is Aunt Wu feeling recently

72
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:21,541
It 's been fine lately

73
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:22,821
Feeling nothing

74
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,381
If you don 't feel anything special

75
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:24,801
Then I will

76
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,100
Checked the normal order opening

77
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,941
Susu , how do you feel ?

78
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,100
How can I feel

79
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,381
I 'm not pregnant

80
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,400
Aunt Wu

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,540
Let 's check first

82
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,720
After the test results are available

83
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,660
Let 's talk more about it

84
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:37,520
We need to talk about it .

85
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,121
This

86
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,381
Give me this

87
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,501
Let 's go .

88
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,580
Why are you avoiding me ?

89
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,561
There are many more behind me

90
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:07,321
Registered Patients

91
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:08,040
Waiting for me

92
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:23,941
Mom

93
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:25,261
Today

94
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,301
You go back

95
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,701
I have Uncle Li

96
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,600
Friends from other places are foreign .

97
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,460
I 've seen adidas

98
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,501
I 've never seen it before

99
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,701
This pair of our student Li Yan 's feet

100
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:52,501
Adadis

101
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:54,061
Adadis

102
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:55,921
Have you seen Wu You before

103
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:56,741
Never seen it

104
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:57,580
Have you seen Wu Lu before

105
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,741
I 'm sure I haven 't seen it before

106
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,600
Come and open my eyes

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,561
Pass it to me Pass it to me

108
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,321
Pass it to me

109
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,480
Don 't look at Adadis yourself

110
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,540
Li Yan , where did you pick up these shoes ?

111
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,480
My 18 Years

112
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,861
You can see the world .

113
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:11,621
I feel like I

114
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,660
It 's a native dog

115
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:13,801
Send it to me

116
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,381
You sit down

117
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:18,621
The results came out

118
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,220
Yes , I have it

119
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,020
Wait a minute , wait a minute

120
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:23,361
Dr. Xu

121
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,381
I have a copy of the results here as well

122
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:26,701
Take a look first

123
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:33,340
Our family is Susu .

124
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,201
Actually

125
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:35,960
I still like Xiao Qin quite a bit

126
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:42,421
I see

127
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:45,160
No , you don 't understand

128
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,321
I think so

129
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,261
Our family members are sick

130
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,421
You have to treat it .

131
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,900
Please show me

132
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,801
What 's more ? All of these are .

133
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:22,561
I think

134
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,421
Our family has this problem

135
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,261
Not big

136
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,941
See Xiao Xu 's expression

137
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:29,181
It will be easy to cure

138
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,980
Otherwise

139
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:32,441
Tonight

140
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,741
Dr. Xiao Xu comes to my house

141
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,660
Re - visit the family members

142
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,501
Uncle Li serves a table of good meals and dishes

143
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,100
Otherwise , it 's settled .

144
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,040
That 's it .

145
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:43,561
It 's settled

146
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:44,780
Let 's see

147
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,020
It 's our turn .

148
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,261
Look at our Meimei

149
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:48,421
This is mine

150
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,840
OK

151
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,660
Li Yan is going to the men 's room

152
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,201
It doesn 't make you feel fresh , right ?

153
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,401
He was at

154
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,580
He won 't be frightened by me

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,401
From then on , a psychological shadow fell

156
00:08:58,401 --> 00:08:59,281
Infertility

157
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,120
The Li Family won 't stop , right ?

158
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,480
Will Uncle Li blame me ?

159
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,980
Why is he watching boxing ?

160
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,661
Let me out .

161
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,380
You You

162
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,500
You 're done

163
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,701
What are you doing ?

164
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,580
I 'm in a panic

165
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:23,021
Be a guilty conscience

166
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,380
No , no , no , no

167
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:25,600
That

168
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,500
Give it to me

169
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,740
They 're back

170
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,720
Would you like to sit for a while

171
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,340
No No

172
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,181
I 'll clean up

173
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:32,760
OK

174
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,000
This is going out

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How to explain it

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,401
Explain I 'm in your room

177
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,821
Just tell the truth

178
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:41,901
I

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,860
I told them you were in the house

180
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,021
Do that

181
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:48,360
Tell the truth

182
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,281
You came to me

183
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,580
Because of the toilet

184
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,641
That 's true

185
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,980
You said you

186
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,740
You can 't go to the good men 's room

187
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,720
You have to do harm

188
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,880
Why do we do in the women 's room

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,061
The men 's toilet is blocked

190
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:00,500
You have to be right , right ?

191
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,201
Not a drop left of you

192
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,421
You have to pee in that toilet .

193
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:05,041
You

194
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,000
Why don 't you have to wipe it clean ?

195
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,661
Right

196
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:08,781
That 's not the point

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,740
I know

198
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,561
That 's it .

199
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:11,880
I understand

200
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,021
I understand

201
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,620
First , I 'm doing

202
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,260
What all men do

203
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,980
I understand

204
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,541
second

205
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,720
I was absent from school

206
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,701
It 's because I 'm upset

207
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:25,401
Not here specifically to do that .

208
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:26,380
The third

209
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,801
You just came in without knocking

210
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,021
You 're disturbing me

211
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:30,260
This is your fault

212
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,281
I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry

213
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:33,100
Fourth

214
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,641
I have a high probability

215
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,980
There will be psychological shadows

216
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:37,260
Fifth

217
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:38,421
because of this

218
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,021
If I am infertile

219
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:41,181
The Li Family is dead

220
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,840
Then you have the primary responsibility

221
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,760
Row Row Row

222
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,781
That 's right

223
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,340
Sorry

224
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,161
That 's right

225
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:51,021
It 's a little too serious .

226
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:53,080
I 'm not so guilty of death , right ?

227
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,281
Talk about you

228
00:10:58,941 --> 00:10:59,860
You have to make it up to me

229
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,181
How can I compensate you ?

230
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,380
Pick me a pair of shoes

231
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,080
But I have no money

232
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,380
Choose or not

233
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,041
That line

234
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,161
When I have time ,

235
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:10,821
I 'll take you there .

236
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:11,941
Not now

237
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:13,641
I 'm really busy today

238
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:14,460
Budget 1000

239
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:15,421
I 'll give you change

240
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:16,240
Line

241
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:17,620
No matter what , I will do it for you

242
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,620
Take some time

243
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,600
Why did you come out of Li Yan 's room

244
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,541
That 's right

245
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,801
I just

246
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,821
What are we discussing ?

247
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:50,500
You two

248
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:53,760
Aunt Wu

249
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,301
She discussed with me just now

250
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:56,260
Applying for Volunteer Exam

251
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:58,941
It 's about applying for volunteers , right ?

252
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:01,781
Sister , help him well .

253
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:03,840
Search this on Baidu

254
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,220
or something

255
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,281
Look at this school

256
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:06,720
What is the concept ?

257
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:08,380
You have to ask carefully

258
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,161
Let me tell you that

259
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,561
Went to clean the toilet

260
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:11,460
This is a big deal

261
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,061
We can 't break up because of something .

262
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,620
I had to bring my brother here

263
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:20,960
You don 't mind

264
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,580
Don 't mind

265
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,781
An extra set of tableware

266
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,360
You two just think of me

267
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,960
You can 't hear anything .

268
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,880
When it first opened

269
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,620
I promised you

270
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,080
Come together

271
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,980
Can 't we wait to break up

272
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,500
Before

273
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:49,821
I 've been busy with my work .

274
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,000
But anyway

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,141
Although it 's late , we will arrive

276
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:54,840
You want to play the nostalgia card , right ?

277
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:56,281
Then you didn 't choose this place well

278
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,561
Maybe

279
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:59,021
It 's not my emotion that inspires me

280
00:12:59,021 --> 00:12:59,720
but

281
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:01,980
A resentment

282
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,301
It was my negligence before

283
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,120
Reparations

284
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,740
But since there is still this

285
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,281
The resentment of not getting what you want

286
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:18,561
Then after all , you 're still

287
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,340
Can 't let me go

288
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,100
So I still have a chance

289
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:24,281
Why are you until today

290
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,821
You 're still so self - righteous .

291
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:27,100
Is there a possibility that

292
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,600
You simply

293
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,781
You don 't know yourself

294
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:30,720
That doctor ?

295
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:33,141
He 's your band patch

296
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:34,521
Is it possible

297
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:36,181
You don 't know me at all .

298
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,460
Let me tell you the truth

299
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,840
I 'm serious about Xu Wenbin

300
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,061
And I 'm right now

301
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:42,141
Very , very , very

302
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:42,840
Above

303
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,120
Is it right ?

304
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,401
That 's impulsive .

305
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:47,980
That 's all fake , right ?

306
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:49,161
Susu

307
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,181
I know it 's all because

308
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:51,980
I was

309
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,460
Not because you stayed .

310
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,580
You 're so sad

311
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,460
So sad

312
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:57,701
I 'm confused

313
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,041
That doctor .

314
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,480
He 's like a giraffe

315
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,281
He 's so tall

316
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:03,421
A long strip of white flowers

317
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:04,340
What do you like about him ?

318
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:05,880
You are

319
00:14:07,021 --> 00:14:07,760
Listen to it as well

320
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:09,061
You tell us about it

321
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,681
Tell me about it

322
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:11,340
Tell me what you like about him

323
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,100
What do I like about him

324
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,220
Why should I tell you ?

325
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,240
Can 't tell , right ?

326
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,000
Really like someone

327
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,080
I can 't say it .

328
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,000
You know what I mean

329
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,620
Yes

330
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,620
Susu

331
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,260
I 'm back now

332
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,701
We can get back together

333
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,641
I will do my best

334
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:32,760
It should belong to you

335
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,880
I 'll give you it all back

336
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,521
What the hell are you talking about

337
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,960
I 'll use all my contacts

338
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,681
and resources

339
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,201
Make your project

340
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:42,301
Cheers

341
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,740
Qin Yuxuan

342
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,681
Are you simply

343
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:48,360
I didn 't understand and drank it first

344
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,600
Otherwise , wait until you drink .

345
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,781
Let me tell you the truth

346
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,620
The company has taken a fancy

347
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,561
Escape from this project

348
00:14:58,561 --> 00:14:59,301
But I 'm not at ease

349
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:00,401
Newcomer screenwriter

350
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,380
Simply put

351
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:02,960
I only want to buy your copyright

352
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,701
I don 't want to use you

353
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,161
What if I don 't want to

354
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,600
The company is not short of your project

355
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:07,740
I can write a novel

356
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,681
Online Serial

357
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,580
Take a lot of effort

358
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,220
Not to mention that the time period is greatly extended

359
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,600
And probably by the end

360
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,000
Don 't achieve the click - through rate you want

361
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,960
If the splash is not big

362
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,401
The top management of the company may question

363
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:17,681
Feasibility of this project

364
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:18,661
It means now

365
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:19,760
Just my outline

366
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,720
I 'm sure

367
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:21,960
How much can you help me

368
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,080
You are a screenwriter

369
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,401
First Order

370
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:45,480
Reconciliation is impossible

371
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:47,240
No rush

372
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:51,441
Isn 't this a hidden rule ?

373
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:53,960
I can hear you

374
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:55,960
I can 't hear you

375
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,161
Xiao Xu is hungry

376
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,161
Not hungry Not hungry

377
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:01,380
It 's not on the road .

378
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:02,740
It should be here

379
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,141
Take a look right away

380
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:05,000
It 's coming , it 's coming

381
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:06,201
Back

382
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,141
Xiaoyan

383
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:16,441
Why are you here

384
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,801
Uncle and auntie warmly invited

385
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,240
I guess so

386
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,801
How did you come back together

387
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:24,541
What a coincidence .

388
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:25,321
We went just now

389
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:27,021
We just went shopping for sneakers

390
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:28,641
I took my brother to pick a pair of shoes

391
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:29,281
Sit down and eat

392
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,201
Sit quickly , sit quickly

393
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,080
The dish is going cold

394
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,620
That 's right

395
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,821
Didn 't you starve ?

396
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:34,781
Sit down , sit down

397
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:35,561
Sit , sit , sit

398
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:37,281
Xiao Xu , sit down quickly

399
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,041
We

400
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,781
Everyone is finally here .

401
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,120
Then let 's start

402
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,120
Look at the young man sitting together

403
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:45,360
This man is talented and beautiful

404
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:46,401
It looks eye - catching

405
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:48,041
Refreshing

406
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,641
Beautiful and delicious

407
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:54,600
Li Yan , you grow your body

408
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,521
Eat more .

409
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,321
Look how careful your sister is .

410
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
We 've only lived together for a few months

411
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,760
Already known your taste

412
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Don 't look at her usual

413
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,921
Careless

414
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,561
She actually has a very delicate heart

415
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:05,441
particularly sensitive

416
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,240
Such a nice girl

417
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:08,061
Mei Mei You

418
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,401
How did you educate ?

419
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,960
This Jianxiong

420
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:12,841
I don 't think she usually

421
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:14,320
Not gentle enough or delicate enough

422
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,280
This is no longer the case

423
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,320
Like Xiao Xu and the others

424
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,161
Young man

425
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:19,401
Everyone likes Susu 's model

426
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,921
But it is .

427
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:22,720
Actually , people are different

428
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,861
Anyway , everyone 's eyes .

429
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
As long as it is in tune

430
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,881
That looks pleasing to the eye

431
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:29,161
Is it Dr. Xu ?

432
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:31,361
Yes

433
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,621
But like Dr. Xu

434
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:34,560
A Talent

435
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,101
Where will it go ?

436
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,681
Many people like them , right ?

437
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,460
Who can pick ?

438
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,161
What about Xiao Xu 's shortcomings

439
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:41,201
Anyway , I 'm an old cop

440
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:42,000
Can 't pick it out

441
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,020
I 've always felt like I

442
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,841
Pretty boring

443
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,480
That 's just complementary .

444
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,760
That 's right .

445
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,960
Gu Yunsu has many shortcomings

446
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,060
But she has a

447
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,560
Outstanding Benefits

448
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,560
She is a

449
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,401
Interesting people

450
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:56,960
The interest of informed and informed

451
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,121
Fun and interesting

452
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,841
There is also a wide range of interests

453
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,720
All in all , it is in tune

454
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,760
A match made in heaven

455
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,881
Hehe and Meimei

456
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:06,921
Life is Beautiful

457
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:07,921
It 's okay , it 's okay

458
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:08,921
You Two Idioms Solitaire

459
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,280
It will be received tomorrow morning

460
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:12,361
Dr. Xiao Xu

461
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:14,181
It seems that I have to be more attentive to you

462
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,641
Otherwise , we can 't keep their mouths shut .

463
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,320
Where are they ?

464
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,921
These words are for you .

465
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,901
Various ways

466
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:20,921
Trying to sell me here

467
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,121
Thank you

468
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,621
I see it

469
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:25,661
They invited me to come

470
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:26,601
That 's the purpose

471
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:27,861
Then you still come

472
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:33,921
I want to see you

473
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,121
You love it

474
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,720
You can 't slow down .

475
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,161
I didn 't rob it with you .

476
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:02,280
Many people during the day

477
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,421
Rowing here

478
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:07,341
Have you crossed here

479
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:08,621
Swipe over

480
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,800
Also

481
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,260
When I was a kid , I used the kind of pedal .

482
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,161
My mom and I crossed here too

483
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,641
Have you ever taken photos here

484
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,300
Of course

485
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,361
I 'm in every corner

486
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:19,421
Photos taken

487
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,941
Comfortable

488
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,921
It 's been a long time to say this .

489
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:26,121
I didn 't come to West Lake for a walk .

490
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:27,601
I often come here

491
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,161
Happy or not

492
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,520
I will always come to West Lake

493
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:31,960
Time takes everything away

494
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,020
Can 't take the West Lake away

495
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:34,141
It 's always here

496
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,341
Greeting us

497
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:36,881
You know crystals

498
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,960
It 's after people wear it for a long time .

499
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,520
It absorbs too much energy

500
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,800
The magnetic field will be turbulent

501
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:42,480
At this time

502
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,240
You have to put it in a

503
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,040
Degaussing inside the crystal cave

504
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:46,540
West Lake is one

505
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,280
Giant Crystal Cave

506
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:49,401
I 'm not happy

507
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:50,960
Let 's take a walk here

508
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,161
Look at the sunset

509
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:53,361
My heart will be puzzled

510
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:54,480
It became calm

511
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,681
Asked you to restart

512
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:57,720
Yes restarted

513
00:19:57,921 --> 00:19:59,280
Contains everything about me

514
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,401
It seems that I misjudged you

515
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:08,720
I always thought you were one of those

516
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:10,560
Like Change

517
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,601
Yearning for the Unknown

518
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:13,201
I 'm so nostalgic

519
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:14,921
That 's what I made

520
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,000
In fact

521
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,141
I 'm pretty timid in front of outsiders

522
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:20,520
Only in front of acquaintances

523
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,161
What about the couple ?

524
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,881
Do you want to ask Qin Yuxuan ?

525
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,220
I actually think you 're right

526
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,760
When there is resentment , there will be entanglements

527
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,760
It will be unclear .

528
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:46,240
I told him now

529
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I understand .

530
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,381
Although

531
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,841
Before I saw you today

532
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,560
I also met Qin Yuxuan

533
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:52,560
But it 's really just

534
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,760
Work Contacts

535
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,040
I also brought Li Yan

536
00:20:57,361 --> 00:20:58,921
I read what you wrote

537
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,401
The two lists

538
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:02,720
My mom showed it to you

539
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,960
When did you watch it

540
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:05,460
Either that or

541
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,661
That is

542
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,701
On his list

543
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,500
Advantages and Weaknesses Adjectives

544
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,941
It 's all written .

545
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,300
How to get my share

546
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,960
Only the name is left

547
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,220
Because when I wrote about him

548
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,141
Easy

549
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,401
What are the pros and cons

550
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:21,381
In my opinion

551
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,300
It is the result of weighing the pros and cons

552
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,020
But when I write about you

553
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:27,520
I can 't think of anything .

554
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:30,040
That

555
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,401
You were there when I wrote about me

556
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,260
What are you thinking ?

557
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:37,780
Thinking about you

558
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:08,901
It 's okay , it 's okay , you answer it

559
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:09,820
Pick it up . No , no , no .

560
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,460
I won 't answer I won 't answer

561
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,181
Why are you crazy ?

562
00:22:15,341 --> 00:22:16,740
Why keep typing

563
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:18,000
It 's okay , please answer it .

564
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:18,740
No

565
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:20,161
What are you doing ?

566
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:21,381
You have something to do

567
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,800
You you can 't send me a message

568
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,701
Message

569
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,780
You keep calling

570
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I have my own business .

571
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,540
Is it good ?

572
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,540
scolded him harshly

573
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,141
Are you cold

574
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,820
I 'm not cold

575
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,520
I

576
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:47,760
I 'll take you back .

577
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,240
You 're cold

578
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:55,060
Let 's send you back

579
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:18,820
What are you doing

580
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,740
You scared me

581
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,861
You scared me

582
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,081
Do you know

583
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,040
You sit here

584
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,300
It will scare people to death

585
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,881
I 've been waiting for a long time .

586
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:26,820
What are you waiting for

587
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:28,300
What time did you come back last night

588
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,861
After twelve o'clock

589
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:34,260
Where did you go

590
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:35,621
Uncle

591
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,621
Uncle Li

592
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,101
Is the meal ready ?

593
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:39,361
You come in and take my mom away

594
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:40,060
She 's hungry

595
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,520
Come , come , say it quickly .

596
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:44,000
Where did you go

597
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,921
Not Where

598
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:46,500
I took a walk by the lake

599
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:47,960
Then Mei Mei was hungry

600
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:48,820
She 's hungry

601
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,000
Take her away

602
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:51,901
Soup is still early

603
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:53,941
Don 't worry to continue chatting

604
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,000
Tell me quickly

605
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,901
And then

606
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,960
No more .

607
00:23:57,881 --> 00:23:58,661
No more .

608
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,740
This atmosphere of yesterday

609
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,581
Already set off

610
00:24:00,581 --> 00:24:01,681
For that reason

611
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,040
This chattering

612
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,060
If this time

613
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,341
I didn 't hold a little hand .

614
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:06,601
Kiss or something

615
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:07,780
The audience can 't stand it .

616
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:11,201
Almost kissed

617
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:11,820
But

618
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:14,000
I told him

619
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:16,421
I also saw Qin Yuxuan

620
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:18,661
And Qin Yuxuan called .

621
00:24:18,661 --> 00:24:20,341
He seemed a little upset when he saw it

622
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:21,000
Gone

623
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:22,320
Gu Yunsu , are you stupid ?

624
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,760
You

625
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,720
Tell him at this time

626
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,921
What is Qin Yuxuan doing

627
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:26,081
I have to say

628
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:27,841
I don 't say that I feel uneasy .

629
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:29,161
You 're so steadfast

630
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:30,040
You say it

631
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,740
If you are steadfast , he will not be steadfast .

632
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:33,020
You , you gotta tell him

633
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,621
He 's your only

634
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,040
You besides him

635
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,921
Everyone else doesn 't matter .

636
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,480
What 's going on with you

637
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,000
You 're pretty good

638
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,280
Of course .

639
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,220
Falling in love

640
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,960
That 's what it has to do

641
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,881
Yes , I want to know

642
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:46,121
Susu

643
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,760
Next time you see Xiao Xu

644
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:50,201
Let me help you make a nutritious meal

645
00:24:50,201 --> 00:24:50,760
You give it to him

646
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,320
Just say you did it yourself

647
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,760
Yes

648
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,601
Are you two stupid ?

649
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,300
He has eaten everything .

650
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,681
He knows you did it

651
00:24:58,681 --> 00:24:59,720
You can taste it

652
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:00,820
Falling in love

653
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,300
It just has to come and go

654
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Do you understand ?

655
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:04,720
You 're the only one who falls in love

656
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,260
All right

657
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,720
He didn 't go even if I came .

658
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,601
OK OK

659
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:09,560
You two don 't come up with any ideas .

660
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,101
Let 's go , let 's go

661
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:11,081
Hurry up to eat

662
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:11,921
How did I give birth to one

663
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,181
Such a heartless girl .

664
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:14,361
Go out

665
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,121
Something is burnt

666
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,000
Taste it

667
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,720
Don 't worry about it this time .

668
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,740
Uncle Li said it was different

669
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,820
That 's different

670
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,141
He 's reliable

671
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:30,401
All right , then I 'll go .

672
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,320
Come on

673
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:36,621
You tell me about it

674
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:37,720
Why is it different ?

675
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,740
This time I put the flavor

676
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,520
Accurately control it at about four points

677
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,681
Why not five points ?

678
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,320
You want to give Xiao Xu a taste

679
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,960
I think Susu did it herself

680
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:49,760
You are very scheming

681
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:51,540
It 's not easy to do it backwards .

682
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,081
Can you develop a

683
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:55,841
It 's a meal that works

684
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:56,681
Have a meal

685
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,040
Eat well and eat well

686
00:25:58,361 --> 00:25:59,601
What else do you need ?

687
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:01,881
It 's like that medicated diet

688
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:02,841
Right

689
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,520
It can be nourishing

690
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:06,641
Warm tonic , great tonic

691
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:09,280
You can study a meal

692
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,081
It can

693
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:11,980
Love

694
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,621
Mei Mei

695
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:15,641
Did I cook or drugged

696
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:28,841
Why are you here

697
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:30,280
I

698
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,201
I made something to eat

699
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:37,280
Thank you , but I 'm not hungry right now

700
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,121
Did the operation not go well ?

701
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,480
I shouldn 't have let her out of the hospital

702
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:53,581
There 's no one else here .

703
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,361
If

704
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,361
If you want to talk , I can

705
00:27:05,901 --> 00:27:06,500
No need

706
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,960
Thank you

707
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,101
I want to be alone for a while

708
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:11,280
Review the operation

709
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:13,720
OK

710
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:30,740
It 's coming , it 's coming

711
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,220
Shoes

712
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,441
Adidis

713
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:51,720
If at school

714
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,020
A group of people are bullying you

715
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,641
Find the one who takes the lead .

716
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:55,760
Just fuck him

717
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,020
You convinced him

718
00:27:57,421 --> 00:27:58,701
Don 't be timid , don 't be afraid

719
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,121
As long as he is convinced

720
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:01,960
From then on , everyone is convinced

721
00:28:18,621 --> 00:28:19,960
Brain scan is normal

722
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
The baby wants to live

723
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:23,040
So he 's trying too

724
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,841
Great

725
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,881
Don 't be unhappy

726
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,661
You are really nice

727
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:36,560
Very cute

728
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,060
You 're the best

729
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:43,701
Always help

730
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:45,181
Always comfort

731
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,000
Dr. Xu

732
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:48,520
Trust yourself

733
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,081
When adults are tired

734
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,260
You can do it once in a while

735
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,141
Children

736
00:29:57,941 --> 00:29:59,220
If you wish

737
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,000
You can be my little friend

738
00:30:05,101 --> 00:30:07,020
Just be a child today

739
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:09,240
I can lend you my shoulder

740
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,401
Who is it ?

741
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:56,320
Li Yan

742
00:30:57,141 --> 00:30:57,941
What is it ?

743
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:00,641
The school wants parents to come .

744
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,701
Can I not go

745
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,520
Cannot

746
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:04,800
Why

747
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,220
If you come

748
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:07,540
The one that started with you

749
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,300
Psychological Shadow

750
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:09,881
Write it off completely

751
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:12,000
OK , you wait .

752
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,401
Hi

753
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,681
Today at 8:00 pm

754
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,641

755
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:21,861
Come here

756
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,980
Can I not go

757
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:23,800
Cannot

758
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:25,320
Why

759
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:26,421
Because tonight

760
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:28,320
I want to take you to the director

761
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,121
See Actors

762
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,581
Meet investors and bosses

763
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:32,320
I want to use this opportunity

764
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,540
Label my escape plan

765
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,901
Stick to your face

766
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:38,320
I 'll see you at eight o'clock when you send the address of the line

767
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:49,181
You 're here

768
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:50,401
Take a look

769
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,101
What is Li Yancheng like ?

770
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:53,701
As a repeater

771
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Learning is so good

772
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:56,641
Don 't focus on learning

773
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,681
Fighting openly in classroom

774
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,601
We are a repeat class

775
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,280
Learning is stressful

776
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,220
If this is the case

777
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,101
I can 't control it .

778
00:32:04,101 --> 00:32:05,081
I 'm sorry , teacher

779
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:05,601
Really

780
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,881
Sorry for your trouble

781
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:07,661
I 'm sorry

782
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,921
But I looked around

783
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:10,861
I didn 't understand .

784
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,220
You said he was the one who did it

785
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,101
These were beaten

786
00:32:13,101 --> 00:32:13,881
But you see

787
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:16,260
He looks like this

788
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,941
It 's more like getting beaten up , right ?

789
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:19,901
So I 'm a parent

790
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,681
I definitely want to

791
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:21,800
The cause and effect of this incident

792
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,681
Understand

793
00:32:22,681 --> 00:32:23,320
If it really is

794
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,460
The problem of our family Li Yan

795
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,621
I 'll let him talk to these kids

796
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:26,341
Apologize

797
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:27,941
And bring it home for strict discipline

798
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:29,020
I also asked

799
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,500
The three of them also said it

800
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,921
It was Li Yan 's first move

801
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:35,520
Did he move first ?

802
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:37,480
He , Li Yan , moved first

803
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:41,081
Why did you do it ?

804
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,740
Who knows what disease he suffers from ?

805
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,921
Give me a punch when you come up .

806
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,441
They painted my shoes

807
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,681
First time

808
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,121
several times

809
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:06,260
Then why didn 't you say it ?

810
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:07,941
You guys apologize to Li Yan

811
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:09,401
Li Yan made a mistake

812
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,201
You guys are not right either

813
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:11,960
Li Yanyou

814
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,280
Apologize to the three of them , too .

815
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:14,401
What happened today

816
00:33:14,401 --> 00:33:15,280
That 's it

817
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:16,361
Go back quickly

818
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:16,960
Teacher

819
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:17,980
Can 't go back

820
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,220
I need to see their parents

821
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:21,960
Let me tell you .

822
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,320
What about the parents of the three of them ?

823
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,300
I 've notified you .

824
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,381
Everything is wrong

825
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:26,280
Another day

826
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,000
No , no , no

827
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,641
It can 't be another day . Just today

828
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,581
How did I get here

829
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:31,280
How will their parents get there ?

830
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:32,280
You didn 't hear Li Yan just now

831
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,121
How to say it

832
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:34,240
This is not the first time

833
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:35,280
Li Yan must be in a hurry

834
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,121
A hand that just moved

835
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:39,101
These are bullying on campus

836
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,381
Parents , you 're talking too hard

837
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,220
The male students are together

838
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,460
Friction is inevitable

839
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:46,500
What about this ?

840
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,760
It has two sides

841
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,201
Should Li Yan also

842
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:49,881
Think about it

843
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:51,500
Are you unsociable ?

844
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,201
Teacher , I respect you very much

845
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:54,560
That 's his teacher .

846
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,480
But what you just said

847
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,320
I can 't accept it

848
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,560
My attitude is clear .

849
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,101
I need to see their parents

850
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,520
Li Yan

851
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:03,960
He is a character

852
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,081
A very introverted child

853
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:06,401
Not good at expressing emotions

854
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,260
Unsociable

855
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:08,320
But this does not mean

856
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,760
You can be bullied by others at will

857
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,881
Let 's do it if today

858
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:13,260
The parents of these children are not coming

859
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,740
I 'll call the Education Bureau

860
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,300
Say about your school

861
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,681
There is a problem of school bullying

862
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:17,900
The state is cracking down hard

863
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,661
This behavior

864
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:19,481
I believe

865
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:20,740
You are his class teacher

866
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,961
Will be taken seriously

867
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:22,840
Right

868
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:28,240
This is our Li Yan

869
00:34:28,561 --> 00:34:29,380
Where are your children ?

870
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,260
Too much bullying

871
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,820
On Li Yan 's physical and mental

872
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,041
Both caused a double whammy

873
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,360
Of course , one code is one code

874
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,320
It was indeed Li Yan 's first move .

875
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:37,481
If your children are on

876
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:38,201
Where it hurts , where it itches

877
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,481
We can go to the hospital now

878
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:40,720
What about the medical expenses ?

879
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,760
I won 't lose a cent

880
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,161
But I just wanted to ask

881
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,641
They bullied Li Yan first

882
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:45,720
How to calculate this matter

883
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:46,920
What do you think

884
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:48,260
Let 's do this

885
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,521
We share equally

886
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:51,320
Buy him a pair of shoes of the same style

887
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,240
Yes , pay as much as you should

888
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
We compensate according to the price

889
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,961
Did Lao Wu hear that

890
00:34:57,581 --> 00:34:58,701
How much will we pay ?

891
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,240
Out

892
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,101
What did you say , Mr. Wu

893
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,340
I 'm not talking about you

894
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:04,061
I really don 't know

895
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,041
Do you usually

896
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:05,621
Anything

897
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:06,481
Everyone thinks it costs a few dollars

898
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:07,280
It can be solved

899
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:08,481
You guys are fooling like this at home

900
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,360
Own children 's

901
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,940
Right

902
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:10,800
But I 'm not a child anymore

903
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,920
You can 't fool me

904
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:12,860
If you don 't realize

905
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,041
The seriousness of this matter

906
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:14,880
I can call the police now

907
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,521
Call 110

908
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:17,121
Let the judicial process identify

909
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:18,461
This injury on Li Yan

910
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:19,661
Or this

911
00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:20,880
We post it online

912
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,501
As a typical school case

913
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:23,121
to handle

914
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:24,641
Everyone is a repeat class student

915
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:26,101
I 've turned 18 this year

916
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:27,481
This is not a juvenile detention center

917
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:28,481
That 's easy

918
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:29,280
The police were actually called

919
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,141
This is a criminal record

920
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,260
Is it so serious

921
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:31,940
Not

922
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,940
Everything is easy to discuss , right

923
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:35,001
We are all children

924
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:36,481
Can you understand it ?

925
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,081
What do you think ?

926
00:35:38,121 --> 00:35:39,641
Then we should do it .

927
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:40,220
Do it

928
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,360
Yes , we listen to you

929
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:43,360
It 's simple

930
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,780
At the flag - raising ceremony next Monday

931
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:46,880
I let the three of them

932
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,360
In front of all teachers and students in the school

933
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,220
Apologize to Li Yan

934
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,061
And guarantee

935
00:35:50,061 --> 00:35:50,961
Henceforth

936
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:51,840
Not in school

937
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,780
Bullying any person

938
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,840
Not outside the school

939
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,121
That 's it .

940
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,041
Flag Raising Ceremony

941
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,001
Apologize to Li Yan

942
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:02,300
That 's all for today

943
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,161
Go back

944
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,340
Let 's pack up when we go back .

945
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,521
I 'm really sorry

946
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:07,481
Sorry

947
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:13,581
Li Yan , you sister

948
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,440
Disagree

949
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,701
In a man 's way

950
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,641
One to One

951
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,440
OK

952
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,840
You choose the location

953
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,961
Gu Yunsu

954
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,581
Why

955
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:23,760
Find me a place

956
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,541
Why

957
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:40,320
This place

958
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,360
How is this place

959
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,360
Good

960
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,820
Whoever falls first will be the grandson

961
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,641
I can fall

962
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,641
What do you mean I can fall ?

963
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,161
Why don 't you try it ?

964
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:50,840
Fairness and Justice

965
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Don 't play dirty tricks

966
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,240
You two know how to fight

967
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,440
You 've never been here before , right ?

968
00:36:55,161 --> 00:36:56,061
Who do you look down on ?

969
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:57,340
Who hasn 't come here

970
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,220
Laughing to death when you came before

971
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:00,720
Frequent visitors are okay

972
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:01,720
Don 't brag

973
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:03,840
Qin Yuxuan Qin Yuxuan

974
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:06,240

There 's nothing to do with our actors

1097
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:14,240
At most , it 's green leaves

1098

What Green Leaves

1099
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,740
You can add a drama

1100
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,701
No matter how dramatic it is

1101
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:20,420
The drama is always not on me

1102
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,481
Her novel

1103
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:23,041

00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,320

00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,501
Many big writers

1116
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:39,661
Not at all

1117
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:40,300
I think

1118
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:42,041
If the script is changed from the novel

1119
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,581
Just let her come .

1120
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:44,740

I strive , I work hard

1128
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,641
I wrote a better script

Worthy of Brother Han 's script

1130
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,021
