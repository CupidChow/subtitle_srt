1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,840
What are you doing ?

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,239
Peeling

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,439
What kind of peel ?

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,559
Don 't we have a bowl ?

5
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,320
Na Na

6
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,000
What about your mother doing so much ?

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,399
Throw it away

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,300
Li Jianxiong

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,879
Starting today

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,439
We use a bowl for throwing peels

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,099
Received

12
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:41,559
I think this guy

13
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,359
He looks too much like you

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,200
I 'm better than him

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,720
It 's time

16
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:49,999
Your mother told me .

17
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:51,520
We 're going to bed at ten o'clock

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,340
My mother has taken the bus now

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,720
Are you home ?

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,400
Where is my mom ? My mom

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
From now on

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,919
Li Jianxiong , remember this home

23
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,120
We 're the bosses .

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,120
You want to rebel ?

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,639
Do you want to

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,760
Manufacture Manufacture

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,559
Let 's see for a while . Really

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,919
How big is it to watch TV for a while

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,840
Come Boss

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,980
Li Jianxiong

31
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:18,540
This thing

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,960
Why is it still here ?

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,840
Throw it away

34
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,680
What a pity

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:22,799
Place in kitchen

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,359
Isn 't it over tomorrow ?

37
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,400
Take it quickly

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,719
What about your stomach today

39
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,700
I won 't wipe it today

40
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,600
I think my calf is here

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,359
Is it so extraordinarily inflated

42
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,100
Come on , calf on calf .

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,359
Mom

44
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,219
The WeChat message I sent you

45
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,400
Have you received it ?

46
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,639
I don 't think you 'll give me a reply .

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,719
Are you home yet ?

48
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,359
You 're Home

49
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,040
You have to tell me .

50
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,639
How worried I am

51
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,299
Early

52
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,700
Su Su ah

53
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,780
Uncle bought it for you today

54
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,919
Your favorite meat buns

55
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,619
Uncle , I won 't eat it .

56
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,780
I made an appointment to talk about work

57
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,540
It 's too late

58
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:38,519
Xiaoyan , eat breakfast quickly

59
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:39,899
I 'll be late

60
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:41,239
You don 't eat it either

61
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,000
When the body grows

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,060
You can 't eat it if you don 't .

63
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:45,619
It 's okay to be late

64
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,299
Susu , let me tell you something .

65
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,820
You

66
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,820
Skipping breakfast is very bad for your stomach

67
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,780
Especially you girls

68
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,179
You must protect your stomach

69
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,440
You today

70
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,799
You 're not going to see Zhou Zimeng ?

71
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,119
Don 't be embarrassed if you fight for it .

72
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,380
Don 't worry about this

73
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,739
Our Su Su is talented

74
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,100
Otherwise , it wouldn 't be so smooth .

75
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,100
Is it right to hit with one hit ?

76
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,899
Thank you Uncle Li

77
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,100
What about the mobile phone

78
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:08,820
What about Li Yan ?

79
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,440
You should learn more from your sister

80
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,500
I am third in grade

81
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:14,260
Take a look

82
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,540
My younger brother is much better than my sister

83
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,519
Don 't be long - winded .

84
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,299
You are third in the West Lake High School Examination

85
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,459
Then your grades are very good

86
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,519
Why did you want to repeat it ?

87
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,040
Two days of the college entrance examination last year

88
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,079
Unfortunately , I have a high fever

89
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,260
The college entrance examination

90
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,860
Sometimes it depends on life

91
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,659
That will definitely be the gold list this year

92
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:28,680
Better than better

93
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,360
Refuel

94
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,000
You put on makeup

95
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,200
It doesn 't look good

96
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:37,420
Gone

97
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,880
OK

98
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,620
I looked at the map

99
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,380
Where I 'm Going

100
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,380
Right next to your school

101
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,219
How do you get there ?

102
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:43,959
Bus

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,899
Then I 'll be with you

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,620
You take me

105
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,779
Susu , are you coming back at noon ?

106
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:48,979
Uncle Li will prepare food for you .

107
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,039
No need , Uncle

108
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,000
Gone

109
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,099
Do it for nothing

110
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:55,820
No one will eat it

111
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,639
Li Yan

112
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,620
Doesn 't my makeup look good today ?

113
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,740
It doesn 't look good

114
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,139
No , take a closer look

115
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,560
It doesn 't look good

116
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,959
This This

117
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,560
Little kids have no aesthetic feelings

118
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,639
You know my makeup today

119
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,599
How much did it cost ?

120
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:05,519
Isolate two blocks

121
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,399
Five foundation pieces

122
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,440
Look at my eyebrow

123
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,560
My eyeliner

124
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,639
My mascara

125
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,639
And my mouth

126
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,920
Add a piece to my face

127
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,639
It 's enough to eat a McDonald 's , understand

128
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,620
What I sprayed today

129
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,420
It 's very cold .

130
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,300
Dislodged Spruce White Musk

131
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,519
Two pumps at least twenty-five

132
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,399
Just a spray

133
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,360
The whole person has a

134
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:30,360
The fragile feeling of loneliness

135
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,139
Is there any

136
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,200
Do you think I am

137
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
It looks good when worn alone

138
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,219
I still took off my coat

139
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,779
Arbitrary

140
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,920
Should I wear glasses

141
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,479
It appears more professional

142
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,260
Here we go , here we go

143
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,599
Excuse me , thank you

144
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,500
Li Jianxiong

145
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,159
You said I would give

146
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,360
I sent so many WeChat messages to my mother

147
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,399
She hasn 't answered a message until now

148
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,839
Do you think she is

149
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,279
Angry at me

150
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,000
Mei Mei

151
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,760
Didn 't Su Su say that ?

152
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,000
Mom is caring for you

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,860
I guess .

154
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:14,279
She should be holding your piece now

155
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,639
Long pronunciation composition

156
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,899
Watch and listen

157
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,920
Smiling from ear to ear

158
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,920
You know her better than I do

159
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
Don 't worry if you wait any longer

160
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,579
Line and wait

161
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,139
She won 't send it to me until noon

162
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,320
I 'll call her .

163
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,360
Come on , everyone

164
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,719
My Escape Plan Author

165
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,440
Gu Yunsu Susu

166
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,880
Let 's give a round of applause .

167
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,599
Come , come , sit

168
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,479
You are very young , beautiful and talented

169
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,120
President Zhang likes you very much

170
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,719
Thank you

171
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,079
What about last week

172
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,920
What about our company

173
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,079
For this project

174
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,920
There is a preliminary consensus

175
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,959
That 's why I found you this time

176
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,240
Actually , I just want to

177
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:00,339
For what we have now

178
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:02,200
The problem of temporary storage in the outline

179
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,719
We 'll discuss it

180
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,019
Today

181
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,779
If we both agree

182
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,099
Then let 's put this outline

183
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:11,360
Modify it later

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,760
It didn 't pass the last meeting , right ?

185
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,079
Now the company

186
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,639
Just very cautious

187
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,159
This phenomenon of multiple meetings

188
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,740
It 's common , right , Mr. Zhang

189
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,399
Yes

190
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,560
So don 't worry

191
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,719
We are all particularly optimistic

192
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:25,479
This item

193
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,680
Just make minor modifications

194
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,800
Later will not be a problem

195
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,740
This is our project

196
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,399
The details are very interesting

197
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,279
The plot is very special

198
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,979
But it 's still too everyday

199
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,180
Indeed , this is definitely not like

200
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,060
That strong plot

201
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,259
So fascinating

202
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:42,619
Yes Yes

203
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:43,540
But I think

204
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,719
It happens to be its daily triviality

205
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,700
To make the audience empathize

206
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,099
What can we empathize with ?

207
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,579
Empathy

208
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,320
I don 't know everyone

209
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,579
Is there a time like that

210
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:57,180
That is

211
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,999
I want to find myself again

212
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:00,979
A period of chaos

213
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,599
The Escape Plan says

214
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,800
No matter what you are today

215
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,060
twenty-eight or fifty-eight

216
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,859
Neither matters

217
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,540
If you don 't want to live that again

218
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,339
Mainstream Life

219
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:10,780
If you don 't want to repeat it

220
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,599
Yesterday and the day before yesterday

221
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,800
The day before yesterday

222
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,560
Yes

223
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:14,979
You can stop

224
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:16,180
If this story

225
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,979
Can make the audience feel

226
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:20,040
Understanding and Compassion

227
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,839
Of course , it 's best to feel it

228
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,540
Hope

229
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:23,979
That would be fine

230
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
This is me

231
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,900
The kind of empathy I 'm talking about

232
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:33,719
I think you said it very well .

233
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,300
But you 're missing a point

234
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
That 's the data

235
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,440
Our company does projects

236
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
It 's not for the sake of helping the world

237
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:42,640
A very important point

238
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,560
is for data

239
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:44,879
Let me put it bluntly

240
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,920
Our project

241
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,820
What 's the gimmick

242
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,040
This allows our company

243
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,119
How about getting the data

244
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:52,239
For example

245
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,859
Mr. Wang told me a question that day

246
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:56,440
Tell me about the current project

247
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,420
We have to fall in love

248
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,820
The audience loves to watch it

249
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,579
And the one on the platform some time ago

250
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:01,900
A single person was gone as soon as he came up .

251
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,180
It strong plot

252
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,900
That female heroine

253
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,239
She lived a long time

254
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,900
She 's been in a relationship

255
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,940
Talk one by one

256
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,579
This is the data

257
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:10,579
I understand

258
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,140
Do you think this will work ?

259
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,060
No matter what the first episode comes up

260
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,940
Let 's go first

261
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:16,339
Whether it 's jumping from a bridge or a sea

262
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:17,119
He 's gone anyway

263
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,979
It 's time to start sprinkling sugar

264
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,180
Sprinkling one will definitely not work

265
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,020
Let 's sprinkle it

266
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,800
All men

267
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,780
Everyone likes this heroine

268
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,259
But we don 't love anyone .

269
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:24,839
Because of our female heroine

270
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:25,879
Independent , sober and intelligent

271
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,420
It 's about her growth

272
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:27,940
Right

273
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,379
Otherwise , how could she be the heroine ?

274
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:29,780
That is

275
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,660
Strong plot

276
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,020
It came at this time

277
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,619
You just said that impact

278
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:35,040
She wore it

279
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,379
She wore it into the book

280
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,239
She turns into a lotus flower

281
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:39,219
At the same time

282
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:40,700
We have paved the way for 50 episodes earlier

283
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,660
That suspense line comes to the bottom

284
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,479
The man who jumped off the bridge is fine

285
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,060
Why

286
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,140
Because he can fly

287
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,219
And what about the heroine ?

288
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:48,660
From a lotus to a human

289
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,359
Came together with this flying one

290
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:51,999
When the audience thinks

291
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,379
When they want to achieve positive results

292
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:54,420
And guess what

293
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,900
The heroine turns into a lotus flower again

294
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,259
Is it strong enough ?

295
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:58,459
Is this the direction

296
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,719
Does that mean ?

297
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:04,200
Since you

298
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,800
If you want something like this

299
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,420
Why do you want me ?

300
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,619
Because in your work

301
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,739
Has a very strong personal style

302
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:17,619
That 's why

303
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,940
Why do I have to

304
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,280
Giving up your core

305
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,140
Because it 's on the market now

306
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:23,320
Strong plot

307
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,660
The data runs particularly well

308
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,680
Traffic King

309
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,339
Back , Mei Mei

310
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,400
Li Jianxiong , let me tell you

311
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:40,640
I think you 're afternoon

312
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,140
You really don 't have to come back

313
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:43,599
I 'll eat whatever I want .

314
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,900
No problem at all

315
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:47,259
I think you should rest

316
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,579
Let you do it yourself

317
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:50,180
There are only two results

318
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,780
Or you 're lazy and starving yourself

319
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,339
Or just eat whatever you want .

320
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:55,900
There is no nutrition .

321
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,379
It 's not good for your health .

322
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:01,859
Mom hasn 't answered you yet

323
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,900
When Mom comes next time

324
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,879
In case I 'm a little indifferent

325
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,619
Can you remind me ?

326
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,420
Come , come , give me your phone

327
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:12,959
Why

328
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,359
I 'll send a message to Mom

329
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,900
Mom will be back soon

330
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,680
Mom

331
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,499
Waiting for holiday

332
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,540
Me and Mei Mei

333
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,060
Let 's go to see you together

334
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,119
All right

335
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,579
Countdown is waiting

336
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:28,940
Take a look

337
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:30,540
Wu Liju 's

338
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:35,200
Hi

339
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,900
What happened to Wu Liju

340
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,800
It depends on what you eat

341
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,820
Like a little cat

342
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:49,839
Sorry for troubling you

343
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,479
Take time out of your busy schedule to come here

344
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,079
I really can 't help it either

345
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,920
My mom wants to see you

346
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,959
My health isn 't fine recently .

347
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,940
I never told her

348
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,820
The Divorce

349
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,479
Can you help me later ?

350
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,599
Don 't miss it .

351
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,680
I know , I know

352
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,599
You too , Gu Yunsu

353
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,879
Don 't talk nonsense for a while

354
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,379
All right

355
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,719
Li Mei

356
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,300
Mom is here

357
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:12,979
Sister

358
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,180
Big Sister

359
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:17,099
Hurry up , hurry up , sit down , sit down

360
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:18,599
Mom , sit here , Susu

361
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,280
Grandma

362
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,859
You still remember me

363
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,739
It 's getting bigger and bigger

364
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:23,739
Who is this ?

365
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:24,619
Aunt

366
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:26,259
Really good

367
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,180
Do you miss Grandma

368
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,119
How is it recently

369
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:28,780
Lost weight

370
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:29,660
You lost weight too

371
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,839
That

372
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,780
Hospital

373
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:35,239
My sister is here this time

374
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,660
Hospitals are arranged

375
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,099
Everything is arranged . Don 't worry .

376
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,079
Mom

377
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,780
What 's wrong with you ?

378
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:43,180
Nothing

379
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,920
It 's just a little bit like this sometimes

380
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:46,979
Chest tightness

381
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,499
Then a little gasping

382
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,060
Li Ju takes it seriously

383
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,940
You have to drag me to Hangzhou

384
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:54,560
Talk about this big city

385
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,219
Better medical conditions

386
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:56,660
That is

387
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,440
Do a thorough inspection

388
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,940
She can feel at ease

389
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,619
Yes

390
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,099
My daughter is filial

391
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,099
It 's my blessing .

392
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:07,300
Li Mei

393
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,700
Look , I have to talk about you

394
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,359
Mom wants to come to Hangzhou for medical treatment

395
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,660
You didn 't tell me a word .

396
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,619
I have to trouble Big Sister

397
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:13,800
Arranging the hospital all the way

398
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,560
This is not for me

399
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,780
Isn 't it just a word ?

400
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,379
Yes No

401
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:18,640
I 'm sorry for troubling you .

402
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:20,339
Why are you polite to me ?

403
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,719
Mom isn 't your mom alone

404
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,060
You also have Susu

405
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,780
Her sympathy will be available in the future

406
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,660
There 's a daughter here .

407
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:30,759
Yes , good

408
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,459
My parents ' little cotton - padded jacket

409
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,540
Come , take it down

410
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,099
It 's not just a cotton - padded jacket

411
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,739
It is also a big tree

412
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,259
Yes

413
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,900
Li Ju was promoted just now

414
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,420
Although he is not a big official

415
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:46,940
But in our place

416
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,379
The words are pretty useful

417
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,599
Her father and I are really going to meet

418
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,940
If anything happens

419
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,219
Tell her

420
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,060
She can still take care of it

421
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Congratulations , Big Sister

422
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,800
Thank you

423
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,660
My sister has always been better than me

424
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,339
In my mother 's eyes

425
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,459
My sister is the best daughter .

426
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,300
What you said

427
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,400
It seems like I 'm biased

428
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,060
Say something

429
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,499
When your sister was young

430
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,040
Reading is not as good as you

431
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,780
If it weren 't for your own willfulness

432
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,379
I didn 't finish college

433
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,040
You said you left a

434
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,660
High School Diploma

435
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,359
You are now

436
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,119
Don 't you just stay at home ?

437
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,320
Mom , you don 't know this

438
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:29,459
Limei has been recently

439
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,579
I found a job

440
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:31,859
Job found

441
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,180
What kind of work is it ?

442
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,219
Is it good ?

443
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:36,560
No , if you want anything

444
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,780
Tell your sister

445
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,660
You can ask her to help you

446
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,300
It 's just an ordinary factory

447
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,180
I can 't trouble my sister

448
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,660
A normal factory is a normal factory

449
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,020
You don 't have a college degree

450
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,839
A High School Graduate Wen

451
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,900
Take it down

452
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,339
You 're not in charge of her

453
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,180
She 's willing to play

454
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,479
Just let her play .

455
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,820
Then this is not home

456
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,520
Susu

457
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:04,619
You can 't eat a big fat man in one bite

458
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:06,259
You can 't say anything

459
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,099
Compared with your sister

460
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:08,999
Mom

461
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,339
Our two sisters

462
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:11,700
What 's the comparison ?

463
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,499
Li Mei has been in charge of the family for so many years

464
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:14,599
Then reintegrate into society

465
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,540
It also takes time to get used to it .

466
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:18,219
Let her take her time

467
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:19,259
That 's true

468
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:22,300
She mainly takes care of the family

469
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,780
Kangqi is the main outside

470
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:26,259
When I was young

471
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,619
You have to spell it well

472
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,020
Yes

473
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,339
What about you now

474
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:31,900
Still doing clothing business

475
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:33,300
Yes , Mom

476
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,099
I 'm trying hard too

477
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,520
This is a good outfit lately

478
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,379
This feeds the family

479
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,940
OK OK OK

480
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,540
It 's OK

481
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,440
This is how a family should be

482
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,680
Cooperation with each other

483
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,060
If you have money , you will pay

484
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,359
Powerful contribution

485
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,259
The key is

486
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,680
I think we should cherish it

487
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,839
The person in front of us

488
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,499
Mom , you 're so right

489
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:54,359
Always

490
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,379
You can 't have your cake and eat it too

491
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,099
We still have to cherish this

492
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,660
The person in front of you is right

493
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:01,660
Not what I mean

494
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,219
You 've been working too hard lately .

495
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:04,020
I won 't eat this

496
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:04,879
You can 't

497
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,300
You two were at the beginning

498
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,359
Make up your mind

499
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,420
To be together

500
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,400
So I think the days

501
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,180
You have to live beautifully

502
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:13,799
To those

503
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,660
People who didn 't like you at first

504
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,259
A powerful counterattack

505
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,019
Otherwise , I feel quite embarrassed .

506
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:19,440
Yes

507
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,459
Who says it 's not

508
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,920
What 's to be ashamed of ?

509
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,620
Live life for yourself

510
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,180
It 's not like I 've shown it to others

511
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,620
Kang Qi I

512
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,259
Is this what I 'm talking about ?

513
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:29,580
Yes Yes

514
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,920
Who wants this

515
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,259
Slap yourself in the face

516
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,640
If I had done this myself

517
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,059
This decision and choice

518
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,860
Even if it hits the south wall

519
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,219
We have to hit the south wall .

520
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:39,120
You have a good life yourself

521
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,259
I 'm getting comfortable

522
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,499
Others can 't laugh even if they want to .

523
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:43,499
Who laughs at me ?

524
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:45,620
I think you are the only one who laughs at me

525
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,620
Then look at your sister

526
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,620
Don 't talk , Ma

527
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,739
The food is cold

528
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,059
Eating Mom

529
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,519
Eat , eat , eat

530
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:57,319
How 's it going ?

531
00:17:58,779 --> 00:17:59,700
Everything 's OK

532
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:01,819
Su Su ah

533
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,860
Who do you sleep with at night ?

534
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,819
Sleeping with Mom and Dad

535
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,700
I still sleep alone

536
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,620
Sleep by myself

537
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:09,120
Really

538
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:12,360
Then you can sleep with Grandma today

539
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,319
Mom

540
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,160
Mom

541
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,739
Tonight

542
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:18,959
Can I sleep with Grandma

543
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:20,140
Of course you can

544
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,900
I usually listen to Li Mei

545
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,059
Is it enough to eat

546
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:26,999
Enough to eat

547
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:31,979
Susu

548
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,100
Run over here

549
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:37,400
Come in

550
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,459
Gu Yunsu

551
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,979
Obedient

552
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,319
This

553
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,319
Susu is still young , isn 't she

554
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,420
We are experienced

555
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,660
Let 's say a few words

556
00:18:58,979 --> 00:18:59,979
Give me some experience

557
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,640
She should be more open , right ?

558
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
Mr. Li , what do you think ?

559
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,539
I think what about our project

560
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:08,660
It 's pretty good

561
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,539
You know someone else about this

562
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,920
We can talk a little more .

563
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,459
Susu

564
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,660
I smile very well in this picture

565
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,940
If I leave in the future

566
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,719
Use it

567
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,380
Use this photo as a portrait

568
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,059
I don 't want to lie down

569
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,059
That cold

570
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:21,999
Inside the funeral home

571
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:23,499
I don 't want it

572
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,420
It 's pretty good at home .

573
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,219
Don 't do any funeral

574
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,440
Please invite everyone when the time comes

575
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,259
Come and get together in our house

576
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Remember when the time comes

577
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,959
Brush my hair better

578
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,459
Clothes too

579
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:40,920
That dark color

580
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,999
What I don 't like

581
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,160
It 's the one Mei Mei bought

582
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,360
I really like it

583
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:57,979
You said before

584
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,259
Mom has never taken anyone 's soft .

585
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,680
You 're not right

586
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,039
I know Mom this time

587
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,180
It 's at your place again

588
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,319
I 'm cowardly

589
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,019
Actually , since she packed her bags

590
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,039
Rushing over

591
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,239
Planning to take care of you start

592
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,499
I persuaded her

593
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,880
Don 't do that

594
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,400
Thankless things

595
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,239
But she wouldn 't listen

596
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:25,319
She feels sorry for you

597
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,880
This is how our family is

598
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,920
Mom feels sorry for you

599
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,200
I feel sorry for my mother

600
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,400
I 've packed all my fucking things .

601
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,259
Cash Passbook

602
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:09,519
Valuable Jewelry

603
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,080
And these are the memorials

604
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,620
Take a look

605
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,620
See if you want to keep anything

606
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,739
You slept soundly today

607
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,979
I woke up

608
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,219
Your father is very worried

609
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,080
I coaxed you for a long time

610
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,420
I made you a pair of little shoes

611
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,499
I guess you 'll like it

612
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:56,640
Coming

613
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Mom , why are you here ?

614
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,559
What are you eating ?

615
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,840
I 'll give your grandmother something .

616
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,799
I just saw you walking wrong .

617
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:08,979
Is that your little shoe ?

618
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:09,759
Grinding your feet

619
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,759
Bought you a pair of sneakers

620
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,900
Are you wearing these two days ?

621
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,860
What are you doing with this wasted money ?

622
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,660
Sneakers in my house

623
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,519
A lot of them .

624
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,360
Take it and return it .

625
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,400
What about the two bands ?

626
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,999
What shoes are you buying ?

627
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,239
It 's blistered and still talking hard .

628
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,799
Do you have any wound patches ?

629
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:35,440
I have a channel

630
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,799
It 's not expensive

631
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,600
Yes Yes Yes

632
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,400
You have money

633
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,279
There 's a lot of money to burn .

634
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:44,739
Some of the burned bags are really

635
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,299
Then just think I can 't stand it .

636
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,080
Alright

637
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,039
My sister spends hundreds of dollars

638
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,559
I want you to stay in the hotel for the night

639
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,080
You live at ease

640
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,019
I spend tens of dollars

641
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:56,319
Buy you a pair of sneakers

642
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:56,880
You satirize me

643
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,120
Said I was burning too much money

644
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,880
Do you feel sorry for my money ?

645
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,580
Still look down on me

646
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,080
I can only give you this little money

647
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:06,880
Don 't forget it

648
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,120
Eat less .

649
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,380
I 'm robbing the rich and helping the poor .

650
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,799
I just want her to save some money .

651
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,160
What did I say wrong ?

652
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:34,779
Li Ju

653
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,360
Li Ju

654
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:48,319
Susu

655
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:50,120
Mom and Dad are now

656
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,640
Is the relationship good ?

657
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,120
OK

658
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,200
What 's wrong

659
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,580
Then I recently gave it to your mother

660
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,840
When calling

661
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,680
Just ask your father

662
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,600
Immediately faltered with me

663
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,380
Look at lunch today

664
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,519
There seems to be something in the words

665
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,640
That 's not because of you

666
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,600
I always compare her to my aunt

667
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,920
Did I compare ?

668
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,019
Compared

669
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,400
Better than losing

670
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:22,380
I can 't hold my face .

671
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,539
Passed down from generation to generation

672
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,759
Unaware of conditioned reflex

673
00:25:28,739 --> 00:25:30,120
You adults are all like this

674
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,580
I like to compare my children

675
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,160
I guess I can 't escape .

676
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,559
What is it like to be a family

677
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,640
Aunt

678
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,120
It 's okay

679
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,479
You 're the one who wins .

680
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,660
What did you win ?

681
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Compare

682
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,279
In your grandmother 's heart

683
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,759
Your mother is the most important

684
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,959
The lunch

685
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,160
You 're praising me when you 're a grandma

686
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,180
She 's trying to shock your father .

687
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
I 'm worried about your parents ' feelings at odds

688
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:00,180
I 'm afraid your mother will be wronged

689
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,799
So

690
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,019
Carry me out in secret

691
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,920
It means

692
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,219
There is someone in our family

693
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:08,479
Can support Li Mei

694
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:11,840
Your grandmother

695
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,100
I 'm most partial to your mother

696
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,039
Praise you

697
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,200
Of course I praise you .

698
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,600
I killed two birds with one stone

699
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,640
Grandma , your arrow

700
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,239
Not only did my aunt not appreciate it

701
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,239
And offended my mother

702
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,719
Aunt doesn 't appreciate it .

703
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,880
I don 't appreciate it .

704
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,519
And offended your mother

705
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,640
Sleeping

706
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,400
Good night

707
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,039
Grandma is two daughters

708
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,440
Two cotton jackets

709
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,360
Dress thick

710
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,519
We 're going out .

711
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,600
I haven 't packed it yet

712
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:01,080
Mom was churning all night yesterday

713
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:02,479
I haven 't had a good rest either

714
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:05,680
Gu Yunsu

715
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,299
Schoolbag

716
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:09,559
Li Mei

717
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,279
Mom needs to draw blood later

718
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:13,100
Go downstairs and buy some snacks

719
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,440
Cushioning my mother 's belly

720
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:16,499
Packed with steamed buns

721
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,279
And corn , fruit and so on

722
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,160
Enough to eat

723
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,799
The physical examination will take all morning .

724
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,840
Bring two more bottles of water

725
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,440
Thermos contains brown sugar water

726
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,319
Replenish Qi and Blood

727
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:25,279
Do you want to

728
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,880
No more

729
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,200
Hospital air - conditioning is fully turned on

730
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,719
Take that coat with you , Ma

731
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,959
Lai Gu Yunsu

732
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:34,759
OK

733
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,959
That 's all .

734
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:38,600
Let 's go , let 's go

735
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,680
Are those sneakers still there ?

736
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,559
I want to try it

737
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:48,279

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,999
I 'll do it

740
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:58,440
Remember the thirty-seven size correctly

741
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,259
Grandma 's new shoes

742
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:04,200
Does it look good ?

743
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,840
You step on it

744
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,080
Does it fit ?

745
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,200
Appropriate

746
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,959
Sneakers are more comfortable

747
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,959
Is it appropriate ?

748
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:18,559

You have to wear small leather shoes with heels

755
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:36,739
It 's not like we 're going to a beauty pageant

756
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:15,259
Susu , your mother is bleeding

757

Early pregnancy bleeding

778
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:17,160
It is considered normal

779
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,600
Don 't worry too much

780
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,100
Told Aunt Wu for the past two days

781
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,979
Take medication on time

782
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,440
As soon as I return to Hangzhou

783
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,860
Come to the hospital for an examination

784
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,200
OK

785
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,420
Thank you , Dr. Xu

786
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:00,959
I didn 't expect today

787
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,580
You came here specifically

788
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,620
I should have come to give you a ride

789
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,219
Be careful on the road

790
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:11,340
OK

791
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:12,499
Take care of yourself

792
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,420
Any questions

793
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,400
Send me WeChat at any time

794
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:17,999
Sorry for troubling you

795
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:19,940
Gone

796
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,059
Gone

797
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,360
Are you okay

798
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,160
I 'm not fine

799
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,680
Susu

800
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,680
Your mother is pregnant

801
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,700
Weak

802
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,440
Don 't go to the funeral .

803
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:46,380
Stay with her at home

804
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:50,279
Then please tell my grandmother .

805
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,259
Mom , I 'll call you

806
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:53,340
Why didn 't you answer ?

807
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,059
I told you a hundred times .

808
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:57,620
From time to time

809
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,219
Take a look at the phone

810
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:00,860
What if you have something important ?

811
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,559
Right

812
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,200
It 's a communication device

813
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,479
It 's not just a decoration

814
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:09,799
You 're mad at me

815
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,799
All right , all right

816
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:14,180
You don 't want to talk to me

817
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,799
I 'll leave you alone , okay

818
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:18,540
Mom , why don 't you give it to me ?

819
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,680
Call me back

820
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,600
Don 't be angry .

821
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,960
I 'll apologize to you , okay

822
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,259
If you 're really angry

823
00:34:27,259 --> 00:34:28,560
Just scold me .

824
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,919
I promise you to come next time

825
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,000
I 'm sure it won 't be like this .

826
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,759
All right

827
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,919
I apologized to you .

828
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,080
Have you received it ?

829
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,719
Have you received my apology ?

830
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:44,500
Mom

831
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:46,879
I still want to talk to you

832
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,719
These days

833
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,480
I know it 's actually the two of us

834
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,839
It 's not easy .

835
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,719
I remember when I was a child

836
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,000
You always help me

837
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,480
I love beauty

838
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:00,580
Secretly

839
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,879
Pin Wu Liju 's hairpin

840
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:02,719
Bow

841
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:04,319
Wear it to school

842
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:05,879
You always protect me

843
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:08,200
Then I coax Wu Liju when I go back .

844
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
It 's my first time to perm my hair

845
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,399
You took me there too .

846
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:12,799
Let me show you

847
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:14,080
This is a university

848
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,640
This acceptance letter

849
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:18,339
Look at the Chinese Department

850
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:19,879
The Chinese Department is amazing

851
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,460
That 's right

852
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:21,520
My first time drinking

853
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,759
You took me there too .

854
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:25,839
Did you say you would drink ?

855
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,560
It doesn 't matter if you like it or not

856
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,839
But know how much you drink

857
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:31,960
How many pounds and taels is it

858
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:33,439
This is very important

859
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:34,939
Of course

860
00:35:34,939 --> 00:35:36,879
Your capacity for alcohol is actually not very good .

861
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,899
I was thinking about that

862
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,439
After reading it

863
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:43,000
If I had money

864
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:44,839
Let 's read again

865
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:46,700
To Shanghai

866
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,160
Shanghai is good .

867
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:50,480
Then I will go to Shanghai

868
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,120
The two of us are close

869
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,080
Is it too far ?

870
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,399
You can 't pick me up

871
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,680
This wine is really boring

872
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,879
That proprietress

873
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,879
Can you give me a white bottle ?

874
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:00,839
You 're dying .

875
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,080
This doesn 't feel at all

876
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,060
I used to think

877
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,799
We can always do this

878
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,960
Mom and friend

879
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,980
Don 't drink it

880
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,120
Until I married Gu Kangqi

881
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,640
Are you right

882
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,219
Wedding Day

883
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:18,680
A lot of things happened

884
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,080
What you said

885
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,600
I remember it now

886
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:24,060
Unmarried pregnancy

887
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,560
Is it a glorious thing

888
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,839
It 's worth doing this

889
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,960
You can still laugh happily

890
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,719
How shameless

891
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,919
To tell the truth

892
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,160
I have a grudge

893
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:38,120
And still remember it

894
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,080
From that day

895
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,020
Between us

896
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:46,460
It seems like a thorn is stuck

897
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,899
Both you and my dad think

898
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:50,399
I lost your people , right ?

899
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,960
You

900
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,359
Why come here ?

901
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:55,399
You 're not happy when you come .

902
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,359
I feel uncomfortable , too .

903
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,600
The two of us

904
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,560
He began to be polite

905
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,879
Stranger

906
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:06,520
This is really a wasted trip .

907
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,439
What are you saying ?

908
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,359
Help me to install it

909
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,379
No problem detected

910
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:11,480
That 's good .

911
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:13,080
This way we can all feel at ease

912
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:14,700
It costs money

913
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,960
Damn it

914
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,819
If you get motion sick on the road

915
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,040
Let my sister do it for you .

916
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:21,879
Take good care of yourself

917
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:23,200
I have something to tell my family

918
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,759
OK

919
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:25,719
Shaoxing 's gone . Let 's go .

920
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,779
Then I 'll go .

921
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,279
Tell me in advance when I come back next time

922
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,200
I can arrange it

923
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,140
I feel so relieved

924
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,939
Go for it

925
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,960
Mom

926
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,600
You go

927
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:47,960
I 'm divorced

928
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,000
What are you talking about

929
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,279
Me and Gu Kangqi

930
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:52,640
It 's been more than half a year .

931
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:53,799
I said you are a woman

932
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,600
Master

933
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,080
The master stops the car

934
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,299
Master , let 's go

935
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:58,299
Let 's go , let 's go

936
00:37:58,299 --> 00:37:59,120
Walk , walk , walk

937
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,239
I said you child

938
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,040
Why don 't you make people worry ?

939
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,319
Have a safe journey

940
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,660
Now

941
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,560
I 've said everything I wanted to say .

942
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:08,000
I 'm relaxed

943
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,600
If anything happens during this time

944
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,719
Unhappy places

945
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:13,339
Don 't take it personally .

946
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:13,960
Is it good ?

947
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:15,839
Wait for next time

948
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:17,819
When we meet again

949
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:19,419
We don 't even mention this .

950
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:20,080
All right , Mom

951
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,060
In fact , we are

952
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,919
Life has gone well

953
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,759
As long as everyone is in good health

954
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:28,799
It 's safe , right ?

955
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:30,480
Everything else is small

956
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,120
Are you right

957
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,299
What I said today

958
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:36,919
Because you 're my mom , right ?

959
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:37,899
I always have to

960
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,359
I 'm telling you the truth .

961
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:52,020
What are you doing ? Lost it

962
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,520
You are on Wu Liju 's side

963
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,919
Take good care of yourself

964
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:02,120
Is there anything we need ?

965
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:04,660
Just call me

966
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,759
Anyway now

967
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:07,160
Transportation is also very convenient .

968
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:09,160
Come to your side

969
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,759
It 's only about two hours

970
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:11,600
