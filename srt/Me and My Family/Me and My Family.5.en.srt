1
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,119
Get up , get up

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,559
Gu Yunsu

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,440
Get up .

4
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:25,879
Did you hear it

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,300
Stepped on

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,800
If you don 't get up again

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,020
I lifted your quilt .

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,160
What are you doing ?

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,680
I thought

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,520
I am eight years old again

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,640
I 'm bored

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,279
Listen to me .

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,980
You finished breakfast today

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,120
Make up well

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,559
Dress yourself better

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,919
I want you to meet someone

17
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,639
You let me go on a blind date

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,239
Anyway

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,919
If you don 't go

20
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:48,879
You 'll regret it

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,879
Hurry

22
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:52,179
I 'm a scumbag

23
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,279
I have to slow down , too .

24
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:55,800
I just broke up

25
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:04,720
Sorry

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,480
I thought I was here for a blind date

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,440
I never thought it

28
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,319
I 'm here to talk about re - employment

29
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:14,400
Understand dressing up

30
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,260
Primary one

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,079
The counterproductive blind date effect

32
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,639
Your spirit resonates with me

33
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,079
It looks like this

34
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,680
Men are temporary

35
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,120
Workstation is a forever home

36
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,740
Actually , I may be better than you think

37
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,760
Get to know you better

38
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,600
Teacher Wu said

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,519
You are currently creating a

40
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,079
Autobiographical story novels

41
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,279
Although it 's all trivial daily routine

42
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:36,639
But the subject matter is very novel

43
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,159
Very interesting overall

44
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,900
Our project team evaluated

45
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,439
Can be video - transformed

46
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:44,400
Sorry

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,799
I just wanted to find out

48
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,180
How did my mom talk to you

49
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,600
Paraphrasing my story

50
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,180
Because you know that

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,419
My mom is

52
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:52,639
Literary Editor of Publishing House

53
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:54,320
That 's why she 's so eloquent

54
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,559
And I 'm her daughter

55
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,079
She 'll take that little thing I wrote

56
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,320
Fantastic praise

57
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,100
As a result , when you arrive

58
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,639
Received

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,240
That 's what I wrote

60
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
You will be disappointed

61
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,620
Then I

62
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,559
My side will also be disappointed

63
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,240
I will

64
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,880
I will be happy for nothing

65
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,960
And then you know I 've been

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,380
I actually  recently

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,400
Understand

68
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,980
Too many blows

69
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,320
I 'm afraid I won 't be able to handle it , right ?

70
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,959
I 'm looking at entities

71
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:36,700
This

72
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,679
My mother arranged this

73
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,519
Teacher Wu actually understands you very well

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,480
She doesn 't understand me , right ?

75
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,320
She just wants to understand me

76
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:33,920
Teacher Wu

77
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,000
Director Hao called me

78
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:37,899
Director Hao

79
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,219
Teacher Wu is here

80
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,180
Please sit down , please sit down

81
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:40,959
OK

82
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,060
Teacher Wu

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,300
I heard from a colleague

84
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,659
Pregnant

85
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,719
Yes

86
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,459
Congratulations

87
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:52,899
Thank you thank you

88
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,860
I really want to give birth .

89
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,579
This is a big deal

90
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,959
It 's a big deal

91
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,680
Director Hao

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,920
I just wanted to discuss with you

93
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,779
This after this

94
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,659
The kind of work that often requires business trips

95
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,479
Can it be temporarily

96
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,700
Don 't think about me first

97
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,560
Teacher Wu

98
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,019
We are so familiar

99
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,099
I 'll just cut to the point .

100
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:16,779
You and the club

101
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:18,360
This contract is signed

102
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,139
It 's due soon

103
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,500
I 'm conveying the leader 's intention .

104
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,899
I won 't continue later .

105
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:28,979
What does that mean ?

106
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,099
Look

107
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,260
You have been with us for more than ten years

108
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,700
Qualification Old Reputation

109
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,579
He has also published many

110
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:37,620
Winning Works

111
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:39,139
It 's really good

112
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,060
But after all , it 's not like us

113
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,339
It is only a three - year contract system

114
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,779
This time

115
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:47,459
Let 's get together and break away

116
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,899
because I 'm pregnant

117
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:55,120
All these years

118
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,380
I 've never become a full - time employer

119
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,940
Actually , I didn 't care .

120
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,219
This monthly salary

121
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:01,860
It 's two or three thousand less than you .

122
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:03,060
I 've never complained

123
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,700
Yes No

124
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,800
That emerging publishing house a few years ago

125
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,459
Digging me for that

126
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,380
You know , right ?

127
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:07,880
That salary

128
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,180
It 's higher than our place .

129
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,000
I wasn 't there because

130
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,139
I miss the old president

131
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,639
Eleven years

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,639
This

133
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,180
You have to be emotional .

134
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,940
Teacher Wu

135
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,060
Look

136
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,260
You are forty-eight years old this year

137
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,899
Breastfeeding after confinement

138
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,860
Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .

139
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,740
Which doesn 't take time ?

140
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,139
Especially like you

141
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,060
Super - aged parturient

142
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,979
Energy and physical strength are not reached

143
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,360
Resign immediately

144
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,979
Those who go home to rest their lives

145
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,260
There are a lot of people here

146
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,940
If this is the case

147
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,820
Our club is waiting and waiting

148
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:48,459
Isn 't that a bamboo basket to draw water ?

149
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,320
Director Hao

150
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,979
If you don 't work until the last day

151
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,579
I 'm definitely not leaving

152
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:53,860
Teacher Wu

153
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,320
Even if you don 't resign

154
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,579
Back to the club

155
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,300
You are officially retired

156
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,779
There 's not much time left .

157
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,539
Say something unpleasant

158
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,979
Three Years of Pregnancy

159
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,779
Especially for us

160
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,500
Position engaged in cultural communication

161
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,620
Pregnancy stupidity makes a joke

162
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,539
Then according to your logic

163
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:16,680
This infertile person

164
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,500
I 'm eligible to work here

165
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,579
If you follow this logic

166
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:20,019
Under the Sun

167
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,579
Once this woman is pregnant

168
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,219
She 's not eligible to work .

169
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:24,279
This is from our publishing house

170
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,060
Corporate culture

171
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,139
No final decision is made .

172
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,820
What about the club 's decision ?

173
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,940
Also depends

174
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,979
Your final attitude

175
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:35,420
We don 't want to lose .

176
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,779
A good editor like you

177
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:38,839
Many things

178
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,620
You need to seriously consider it .

179
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,219
What you just said

180
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,500
No final decision

181
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Is it just a choice of two ?

182
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,740
Then you

183
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,979
Does this count as killing a donkey ?

184
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,339
Teacher Wu is off work

185
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:09,019
So early today

186
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,019
So early today

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,820
Kangqi

188
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:46,540
Come in

189
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,579
Why didn 't you come to class ?

190
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,040
Sit

191
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,540
I have something to discuss with you .

192
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:56,520
What is it ?

193
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:57,979
Come

194
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:04,440
What 's wrong with you

195
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,979
What is this ?

196
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,339
I 'm pregnant

197
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,619
This

198
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:24,900
Is this report accurate

199
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,660
Checked by the school hospital

200
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:30,900
I 'm not at ease

201
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,579
I went to the city hospital for re - examination .

202
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,079
In short , the results of the inspection

203
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:34,719
That is

204
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,660
I 'm pregnant

205
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,180
Is this ?

206
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,660
I 've never been allowed .

207
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,219
So I didn 't take it too seriously .

208
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,180
I didn 't expect it to be so big

209
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:49,859
Nine weeks and three days

210
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,940
It 's so big

211
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,219
Then you say

212
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:58,459
You you say you say

213
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,400
I , I , I

214
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,300
What should I do ?

215
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,920
Now

216
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:02,239
I have no experience

217
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,739
You You Me Me

218
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,780
You want to be this father

219
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,499
Of course I want to be one .

220
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:08,859
I never thought I was so early

221
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:09,619
Will be a father

222
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:10,660
You said I 'm

223
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,200
Are you young and promising now ?

224
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:16,619
And I thought about it more than once

225
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:17,640
I think I am Gu Kangqi

226
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,780
If you have children in this life

227
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,280
Must be

228
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,499
You Wu Limei 's child

229
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,099
Don 't be so happy

230
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,959
One more thing is

231
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,079
What if you have to live ?

232
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,239
Then we have to expel

233
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,320
Say that I 'm damaging the school spirit and discipline .

234
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,999
What if I don 't give birth

235
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,400
It can be handled confidentially

236
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,200
It 's not your stupid school

237
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,359
Also let people choose between the two

238
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,040
So what do you think ?

239
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,400
This is our baby

240
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,719
I 'm reluctant to give birth

241
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,680
Then we will give birth

242
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,440
Then we have to give birth to him

243
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,400
Your stupid school

244
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,359
It 's OK if you don 't go

245
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:56,200
Didn 't you say that too

246
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,979
After graduation

247
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:58,839
Do we want to go to Hangzhou

248
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,160
Limei , we won 't wait anymore

249
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,879
We 'll go right away

250
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,040
You go back to school

251
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:03,839
Re - exams

252
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,119
I 'm going there to do business

253
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:07,160
We 'll have a baby there

254
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,959
Start a family there

255
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,959
It 's just what you said

256
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,119
A brand new life , okay

257
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,579
A New Life

258
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,479
Brand new

259
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,060
Line

260
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,040
I 'm going to be a father

261
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,780
Come , come , hot water

262
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,099
Or

263
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,219
I

264
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,320
I 'm out to do some errands

265
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,479
I 'll be right back

266
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,219
Then you lie down when you want

267
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:54,099
Sit whenever you want

268
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:55,119
I 'll be back when I 'm done .

269
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,140
You 're in such a hurry

270
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,499
Particularly urgent

271
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,239
Go back quickly

272
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,619
I 'll be back when I 'm done .

273
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,079
A New Life

274
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:22,379
Mei Mei

275
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,940
What you just said

276
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,140
What about the symptoms of early pregnancy

277
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,579
I wrote it down

278
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,219
The meeting will be over later

279
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:29,499
I 'll do it one by one

280
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,020
Implement response measures

281
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:34,619
For example , stay away from meat and greasy

282
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,700
Uncle Li , what 's wrong with you

283
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,459
No , no , no , it 's not fresh , it 's not fresh

284
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,900
He has been doing this a lot lately

285
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,339
I throw up and he throws up

286
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:44,940
I 'm sleepy and he 's sleepy

287
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,400
Anyway , what kind of pregnancy am I ?

288
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,339
He will do it as it is

289
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,700
Sometimes it 's worse than me

290
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,599
Hurry , hurry , hurry

291
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,920
Disappear Disappear

292
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,440
Let it go away and he 's just like that

293
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,739
Then put it here

294
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,339
Put it away , put it away

295
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:00,820
Please move further away

296
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,219
This smell is too strong

297
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,359
Further , Further

298
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,979
No , this smell

299
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,900
Xiao Xu said

300
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,020
It 's called in medicine

301
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,739
Pregnancy Associated Syndrome

302
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,859
Between Couples with Good Relationship

303
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,180
This happens

304
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:16,339
Then am I

305
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:17,540
I have to throw up .

306
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,940
Otherwise

307
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,280
It shows my relationship with my mother

308
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,339
Without you two

309
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,780
You said we were under the same roof

310
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,420
Uncle , this is a bit too involved

311
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,640
Susu I am

312
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,780
Uncle didn 't mean that

313
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,459
You you you

314
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,499
Okay , let 's get back to business

315
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:36,180
For Mei Mei and me

316
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,619
All of us

317
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:38,859
Together

318
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,140
Let 's overcome the difficulties together

319
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,619
I have an idea

320
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,839
I would like to ask for your consent

321
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:44,700
Say

322
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,540
I 'll write it down when you tell me

323
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,020
I want to resign

324
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:56,060
That 's what I thought

325
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Pregnancy

326
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,060
It 's a painful thing

327
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:00,359
Pregnant at this age

328
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:01,859
That 's a crime on top of a crime

329
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,940
So I think if

330
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,020
He doesn 't even care about this job .

331
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,259
Health is not good either

332
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,379
It 's better to hold on to one end .

333
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
What do you think ?

334
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:18,700
It 's hard for Mei Mei to get pregnant

335
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,619
We all know

336
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,979
But I also checked this

337
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:24,499
Usually the hardest time

338
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,579
That 's the first three months

339
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,079
Yes

340
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,520
It 's hard for us

341
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,479
We have to get through it .

342
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:30,379
You choose to resign at this time

343
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,660
Wouldn 't it be a pity ?

344
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,540
I agree that Uncle Li is right

345
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,780
What do you think of Xiaoyan

346
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:36,540
Say

347
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,300
Ask me

348
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
Are you a family member ?

349
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,579
Please comment

350
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,780
Don 't be stressed

351
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,280
Anything is fine

352
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,719
See

353
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,660
Xiaoyan thinks it 's fine

354
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:48,700
Yes No

355
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,459
That young man is transparent

356
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,339
Still clear

357
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,359
Xiaoyan

358
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,800
Do you mean yes ?

359
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,959
Line

360
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,820
You see

361
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,959
Li Yan means that benevolence has different opinions

362
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,020
Wise people see wisdom

363
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,219
Do you see benevolence or wisdom ?

364
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,719
I 'm Jianxiong

365
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,579
You know me

366
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,540
As long as you decide something good

367
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,060
I am 100 % supportive

368
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,700
What about you , Gu Yunsu

369
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,300
Play Me

370
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:19,820
You

371
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,479
You are so interesting , you

372
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,700
Are you addicted to drama ?

373
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:24,780
Uncle , don 't you think this scene

374
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,700
Familiar with it

375
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,739
Same conversation

376
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:29,099
I was sitting there that day

377
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:30,420
I told you I was quitting my job

378
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,800
She learns from me

379
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,420
Imitation of poor imitation

380
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,820
Tell me about you

381
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,379
Do you want to

382
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:36,180
Hear Us

383
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:37,420

We love you

385
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,700
We 'll be happy to raise you

386
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,200
You 're so boring , you 're a person

387
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:45,940
I 'll just say it

388
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:47,079
Your mother then

389
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:47,940
A stronger person

390
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,759
How is it possible

391
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,660
That 's right

392
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,259
Li Yan

393
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:51,640
Look at your Aunt Wu 's humor .

394
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:52,700
Should I say it or not

395
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,099
Just did a good job

396
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,420
Particularly realistic

397
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:56,859
I 'm not kidding

398
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,619
I 'm just tired

399
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,219
I want to quit my job and rest at home

400
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,400
True or false

401
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,280
Do you really want to resign

402
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,520
Wu Limei , who are you

403
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,540
Healed the scar

404
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,800
Forget the pain of the past , right ?

405
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,940
Don 't make any trouble

406
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:15,280
Refreshing the past

407
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,160
Why are you going ?

408
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
The meeting has not ended yet

409
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,320
I 'm afraid I 'm here

410
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,140
Stay a little longer

411
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:23,400
I will say nothing .

412
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,800
You have to take blood pressure drugs then

413
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,440
I 'll go calm down

414
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,839
Mei Mei

415
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,680
You tell me the truth

416
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,119
Your current physical condition

417
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,560
Is it true that

418
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,440
When you really can 't stand it

419
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,239
I 'll just say it

420
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,479
You don 't have to

421
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,160
You wouldn 't make such a decision

422
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,099
I still know you

423
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:49,520
OK

424
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,599
Then I 'll make a statement .

425
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,820
As long as you are healthy and happy

426
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,320
We will resign when we resign

427
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,660
Li Yan

428
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,420
No , this is getting cold soon

429
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:59,020
You have the same attitude as your father

430
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,660
We are father and son with one heart .

431
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,520
Same Same

432
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:01,979
That 's fine

433
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,239
So it 's decided

434
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:06,420
Meeting discontinued

435
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:34,799

Taste it sweet

463
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,700

480
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,440

Keep your voice down

497
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,219

Are you forgetting yourself

541
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:47,299
Been a full - time housewife

542
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:49,340
Raw once and ripe twice

543
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,140
Did you forget

544
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,459
Why are you out of touch with society

545
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,239
How to talk to my father

546
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,120
There 's nothing to say

547
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,140
There was no Internet at that time

548
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
Did you forget

549
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,140
You were with my dad

550
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,979
When you need living expenses

551
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:59,380
How careful you are

552
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,239
I forgot my life

553
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,160
Attached to Others

554
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,739
What an unreliable thing

555
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:04,299
It 's not what it used to be

556
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,700
I am a man with savings now

557
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,860
Did you forget

558
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,340
Your Years

559
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,860
Trapped in that home

560
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,140
When you want to return to society

561
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,979
How difficult , how difficult it is

562
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
It 's time for me to retire .

563
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:21,499
Wu Limei You

564
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,600
You are possessed

565
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,880
I was still tricked .

566
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,539
I can 't figure it out .

567
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,680
You had a good hand

568
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,380
Beat it to pieces

569
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,799
Just because you 're getting married and having me

570
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:30,039
Well , now your life

571
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,019
Back on track

572
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,979
You have to

573
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,580
Have to jump into that dead end

574
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,019
Why

575
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,459
Your dad is your dad

576
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:36,979
Uncle Li is Uncle Li

577
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,340
Are they comparable

578
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,279
Forgot

579
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,400
I was with my dad

580
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,140
Love to death

581
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,019
Earth - shaking

582
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,860
How did he swear ?

583
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,840
What happened to him

584
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,819
Disappointing you

585
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:51,779
Let me tell you .

586
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,200
Boyfriend Husband Dad

587
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,640
These are three

588
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,620
A completely different identity

589
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,700
He can do a good

590
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,059
It may not be possible to do everything

591
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,420
As an experienced person

592
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,340
You as a person who has been wounded

593
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,140
How do you

594
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,360
How can you still be like this

595
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,120
I believe in men without hesitation

596
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,420
And you keep saying it

597
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,739
The literature you love so much

598
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,660
No more

599
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,819
Improper editing and quitting

600
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:12,700
No regrets

601
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,819
I don 't regret it

602
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,200
What do I regret ?

603
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:18,499
The editor is not your writer

604
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,539
I actually

605
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,660
I came in to tell you

606
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,380
I 've already talked to the publisher

607
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,900
And it 's almost settled .

608
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,340
You 're so funny

609
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:35,019
You 've decided .

610
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:37,100
What are you talking to me about ?

611
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,979
Do you want a consultant ?

612
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,100
I gave you advice and you didn 't listen

613
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,580
Let me give you four words , Wu Limei

614
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,660
Ask for trouble

615
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,299
To be or not to be

616
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,259
Please help yourself

617
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,219
Look , you 're so excited .

618
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,219
Where are you going

619
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,340
I didn 't say you sit

620
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:54,140
Sit down and talk again

621
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,299
I 've had a good chat with you .

622
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:58,019
How dare you go out of this door

623
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,840
I 'll never be with you again

624
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,719
Have a good chat

625
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,799
This kind of heart - driving link

626
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,580
Never again

627
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,900
Do you like to chat ?

628
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:05,900
You

629
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,700
Come

630
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,580
Signed

631
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:11,979
I don 't do it

632
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:13,940
I want to wait a little longer

633
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,420
You can 't wait .

634
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:17,739
You can still abort

635
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,920
You have a few more days

636
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,059
It can 't flow .

637
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
Induction of labor

638
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,620
Do you know what induced labor is

639
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,019
Just give you some medicine .

640
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:28,539
Then let your uterus contract

641
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,900
Take the child out

642
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,539
Isn 't it just like being born ?

643
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,100
What do you want to suffer ?

644
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,580
You have to do it today

645
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,299
Mom

646
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:40,900
I just wanted to wait a little longer

647
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,140
Have you waited yet

648
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:44,039
If he is real

649
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,420
If I 'm responsible for you

650
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,279
He 's gonna do this

651
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:49,700
to sign

652
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,700
Why do you decide for me ?

653
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,739
I 'm your mother

654
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,860
Then I 'm a mother now .

655
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,340
Even if I can 't wait today

656
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,059
I want to give birth to him too .

657
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,180
Can you keep your voice down ?

658
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,219
You 're just an adult , did you know that

659
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,380
You know how hard life is

660
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,299
If you are really for Gu Kangqi

661
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,459
Giving birth to a child

662
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,799
I dropped this course

663
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,219
You have a good hand

664
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:15,380
Just cracked it up

665
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,120
If he is real , you say

666
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,620
If you need to be responsible

667
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,840
Then we can discuss it .

668
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:23,920
Know how many days you are pregnant

669
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:26,819
What about people

670
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,680
Why didn 't you show up ?

671
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:32,080
You have to say for this kind of person

672
00:26:32,979 --> 00:26:33,739
If you want to pay

673
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:34,340
Do you

674
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,739
You 're not worthy , you

675
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:40,819
You sign it off

676
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,219
Come

677
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,380
Do you sign it or not

678
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:48,539
You won 't sign , right ?

679
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,580
I 'll sign it for you

680
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,340
I 'll sign it for you

681
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,860
If you want to pursue me in the future

682
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,479
Yes

683
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,019
You can take me to court

684
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,140
Send me to prison and I accept it .

685
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,739
Get up and do it

686
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,319
I won 't do it

687
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,620
I don 't do it

688
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,219
Get Up

689
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:05,979
Li Mei

690
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:07,519
Li Mei

691
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:08,739
Li Mei

692
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,880
Li Mei

693
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,479
Li Mei

694
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,499
Who is this ?

695
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,539
Aunt

696
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:17,719
I

697
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,219
I 'll go to your house to find you

698
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:19,779
Big Sister said

699
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:21,299
You came to the hospital for surgery

700
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,180
Yes , just finished

701
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,180
You don 't have to step on it .

702
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:27,539
Come over and act as a good person

703
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,860
From now on

704
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:29,920
Our Limei

705
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,340
It has nothing to do with you

706
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:33,900
Just

707
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,219
Where have you been

708
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,499
When I went out that day , I was thinking

709
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:38,860
Sold my motorcycle

710
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,180
Then sell the store as well

711
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,499
This will make some money

712
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,539
Exactly what they said

713
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:43,340
There is a small house in Hangzhou

714
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,340
I 'll hurry over and have a look .

715
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,400
I think it 's not bad

716
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,819
I rented it .

717
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:48,059
And then cleaned it up there

718
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:48,580
I was thinking

719
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,660
Come back with you

720
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,940
We 're going to Hangzhou

721
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,840
You

722
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,860
Then I 'll call you on the pager

723
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,140
Why don 't you reply to me ?

724
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,759
This pager is as soon as I get on the train

725
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,340
The thief stole it .

726
00:27:58,739 --> 00:27:59,979
I only have your dormitory number

727
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,299
I can 't find you .

728
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,120
This

729
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:07,620
The child is gone

730
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,739
I 've thought about his name .

731
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,180
I 'm fine

732
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,779
The two of us

733
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:22,059
Is it still a long time ?

734
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,140
You see

735
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,940
This money

736
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:30,819
Car seller

737
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,440
And the money for renting out the store

738
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:33,959
It 's all here

739
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,019
I 've figured it out

740
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,259
This half is used for marriage

741
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:39,860
The other half is living in Hangzhou

742
00:28:40,459 --> 00:28:41,620
Get there and start over

743
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,420
I 'm sure I won 't hurt you

744
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:52,580
Are you right

745
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,779
You 're done .

746
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:10,660
You still want to marry me

747
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,539
Of course I did .

748
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:14,739
Of course I want to marry you

749
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:15,580
You

750
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,940
Do you want to marry me

751
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:18,940
You want to marry your child even after you lose it

752
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,319
It 's you I want to marry

753
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,239
That

754
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,259
Let 's talk about the child later

755
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,779
You want to marry me

756
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:35,140
Then you don 't even have a ring

757
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,940
Yes Yes

758
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,180
I haven 't bought the box yet

759
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,920
Originally

760
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,459
How about buying a ring

761
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:42,900
More money

762
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,019
Kneel down

763
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,580
How can anyone kneel like this ?

764
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,180
What about that

765
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:02,819
You

766
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,160
Willing to Marry

767
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,979
I do

768
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,279
These

769
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,920
Leave it with you

770
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:11,959
All yours

771
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,059
You just said

772
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,420
Your child 's name has been figured out

773
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:18,299
What is it called

774
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,180
On the way back

775
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:24,779
The clouds in the sky are beautiful

776
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,319
I just want to be

777
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,940
If it 's a boy , it 's called

778
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:32,539
Gu Yunqi

779
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,860
Monkey King 's Qi

780
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,120
If it 's a girl

781
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:39,580
Gu Yunsu

782
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,259
Su where everything recovers

783
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,700
But

784
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,140
It hurts

785
00:30:58,819 --> 00:30:59,940
You ask him

786
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,900
You said your name was Gu Yunqi

787
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,420
Still Gu Yunsu

788
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,299
You lied to me

789
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,779
You You and

790
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,219
Susu rises

791
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:46,700
Hurry up , sit down and have breakfast

792
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,100
Li Yan

793
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,979
Where do you put sanitary napkins

794
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,860
You asked me

795
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,239
Where

796
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,999
Where

797
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,120
It 's Li Yan , not me .

798
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,039
Mei Mei

799
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:18,959
Our sanitary napkin

800
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,200
Where did you put it ?

801
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,479
Why are you asking this ?

802
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,719
Li Yan urgently needs it

803
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,080
The white cabinet at the entrance of the guest bathroom

804
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,440
Third drawer from top

805
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,019
The white cabinet at the entrance of the guest bathroom

806
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:33,239
Third drawer from top

807
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,600
Here

808
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,519
Thank you

809
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,319
I said you two

810
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,440
What are you doing again

811
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:57,819
Declaration of war

812
00:32:57,819 --> 00:32:58,680
What war is declared

813
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,479
Cold War

814
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:05,979
Just sign it .

815
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,759
That way you go

816
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:07,319
Hello

817
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,160
I want to hang a

818
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,559
Dr. Xu Wenbin 's number

819
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:10,600
OK

820
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,680
Registration fee 300

821
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,580
Three hundred

822
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,279
I remember it wasn 't that expensive .

823
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,239
It 's not wrong

824
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:18,160
This is the International Department

825
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,400
Uniform Charging Standards

826
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:21,319
I 'm a follow - up visit

827
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,799
Follow - up visits are not cheap

828
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,319
Because I 'm an old customer

829
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:24,840
Right

830
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
This is not available

831
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,880
Can I inquire

832
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,600
What time does Dr. Xu usually leave work ?

833
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,880
It 's not convenient to tell you this

834
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,739
Sorry

835
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,080
There are regulations

836
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,340
Understand

837
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:47,900
Dr. Xu

838
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:48,999
Dr. Xu

839
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:49,999
It 's me

840
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,120
Do you remember me

841
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,600
Remember Hangzhou Dancing Goddess

842
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,519
Then don 't remember it .

843
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,200
Is there anything to do with me ?

844
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,100
Let 's talk as we go

845
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,880
Because I have something urgent .

846
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,719
Let me say something straight .

847
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,180
Where 's my mother ? Now she 's trying to get a baby ?

848
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:58,860
Want to resign

849
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,600
I just wanted to ask

850
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:00,600
Her physical condition

851
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,479
Can you withstand it ?

852
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:02,400
She had a second child

853
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,039
You don 't want her to have a baby

854
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,120
I still don 't want her to resign

855
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:05,920
I don 't want her

856
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,200
Resignation in order to have children

857
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,959
But if she really goes her own way

858
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,940
I don 't want to see her either

859
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,959
I didn 't hold anywhere .

860
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:12,479
Aunt Wu does belong

861
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,420
Super elderly parturient

862
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,759
But until twenty-five

863
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:15,759
She has a childbearing history

864
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:16,739
So far

865
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:17,960
Physical condition is OK

866
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:19,259
The elderly mother

867
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,919
What risks are prone to ?

868
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:22,500
Pregnancy - Induced Hypertension

869
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,799
Increased glycemic index

870
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:25,839
Increased glycemic index

871
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,879
There 's more

872
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,960
That 's sorry

873
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,960
How about that ?

874
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,560
You can register tomorrow

875
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,379
Bring Aunt Wu with you

876
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:32,319
Let me make it clear to you .

877
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:32,960
I really have something to do

878
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,700
I have to go first

879
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,239
It 's too expensive to see you once

880
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,080
Wait a minute , Dr. Xu

881
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,299
I brought you some delicious food

882
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:38,600
Try this

883
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,759
This beef jerky is delicious

884
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:40,960
You can taste steak

885
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,759
No No

886
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:42,439
Really , Really Not Used

887
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:43,120
Taste it

888
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,919
Thank you thank you

889

Pregnancy - Induced Hypertension

895
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,080
My mother 's blood sugar was high

896
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,460
I guess it 's hard to avoid this time .

897
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:58,899
Dr. Xu

898
00:34:58,939 --> 00:34:59,879
Dr. Chui Dr. Chui

899
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,640
You see

900
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,080
Look at me today

901
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,879
What did I bring you ?

902
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,279
Have you never seen such a big squid before ?

903
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,080
Add another item

904
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,680
Postpartum amniotic fluid embolism

905
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,359
It is also higher than that of ordinary pregnant women

906
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,299
Fatality rate 85 %

907
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,879
Is there anything else to add

908
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:13,439
Sorry

909
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,239
I 'm almost late

910
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,200
Postpartum Hemorrhage

911
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,359
This is scary .

912
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,200
Mei Mei was already anemic

913
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:26,919
It 's terrible .

914
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:27,839
It 's terrible .

915
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,160
Pregnancy - Induced Hypertension

916
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,120
Gestational Diabetes

917
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,879
Intrahepatic cholestasis

918
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,160
It may cause stillbirth

919
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:33,419
That 's right

920
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,600
What should I do ?

921
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Baidu Encyclopedia

922
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,319
I can provide you with a

923
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:38,020
More authoritative

924

Maternity Knowledge Website

925
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:39,839
You said

926
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,080
Let me borrow your mobile phone

927
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,919
Let me help you lose

928
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,879
My medical skills are good

929
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:49,719
Pretty reliable

930
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,359
I didn 't mean that

931
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,000
But people are not reliable

932
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,200
I 'll go first

933
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,759
Intrahepatic cholestasis

934
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:57,719
I 'm familiar with this

935
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:59,460
A few years ago , my subordinate

936
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:00,799
It is cholestasis

937
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:02,060
Caused cirrhosis

938
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,439
You haven 't seen it before

939
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,120
Such a strong young man

940
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:08,140
Being tossed at the end

941
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,500
There are no human shapes .

942
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:11,200
Don 't say Mei Mei 's age

943
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,319
She 's pregnant again

944
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,439
Very comprehensive

945
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,640
These are my mom 's possibilities

946
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,960
Risks , right

947
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,960
But what about these risks

948
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,839
All are extreme cases

949
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:21,600
Only theoretically

950
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,680
It may happen

951
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,299
Aunt Wu 's physical fitness

952
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:25,719
Overall , it 's good

953
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,439
Pay more attention during pregnancy

954
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:28,640
Plus regular prenatal check - up

955
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,040
It should be possible to avoid a large part

956
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:34,719
Any more questions

957
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:38,960
I understand you have something to do

958
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,399
Yes , I 'm still in a hurry

959
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:41,339
Bye bye bye

960
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:45,160
What about these

961
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,960
All are clinically summarized

962
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,319
It may be

963
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:49,560
Some things happening

964
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,560
But Dr. Xu also said that

965
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:51,960
He said

966
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,719
Although my mother is running fifty

967
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,520
But still strong as a bull

968
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,100
These

969
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,640
She doesn 't necessarily be able to make it .

970
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,680
Susu

971
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,200
Your Year

972
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,719
Less time to come back

973
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,899
You don 't know

974
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,100
Mei Mei 's body is already

975
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,560
Not as robust as it used to be

976
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:10,680
She 's going around every once in a while

977
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,100
There will be some headaches and brain fever

978
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,839
These problems

979
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:13,399
Let me tell you

980
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,219
Her current body

981
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:15,319
There is something wrong with eight achievements

982
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,399
But she doesn 't say it

983
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,839
Otherwise , she would be so

984
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,879
A strong personality

985
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:19,899
How suddenly

986
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:21,680
Put forward the idea of leaving my job

987
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,700
Right

988
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,520
She 's afraid we 're worried .

989
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,439
She doesn 't talk about it

990
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,319
She must be unable to handle it .

991
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,040
All said

992
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
When a woman gives birth to a child , she peels off her skin

993
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,399
Mei Mei 's age is there again

994
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:41,779
In the end , it 's still my fault

995
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,200
Uncle Li

996
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,259
How can you

997
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:45,759
Blame yourself

998
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:46,879
I 'll tell you

999
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:48,799
This is a good shot .

1000
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,239
You are blessed

1001
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:50,859
Really

1002
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,279
I talked so much to you

1003
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:53,520
Not to blame you .

1004
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,200
I mainly think that my mother

1005
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,439
Really resigned

1006
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,600
In case this happens

1007
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,839
What kind of disease will you get ?

1008
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,799
What problems will be encountered in production

1009
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,040
Then this is not a complete way out

1010
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,919
Is there no way out ?

1011
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,700
So I 'm still

1012
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,239
I hope you can persuade her

1013
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,520
Let my mom slow down a little longer

1014
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,799
Watch again , what do you think ?

1015
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,279
No , no , no

1016
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,580
This is already

1017
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,040
It 's urgent .

1018
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,020
There is no backward way

1019
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,520
That 's not the main contradiction anymore

1020
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,560
The main contradiction is

1021
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,279
Giving birth at advanced age is too dangerous

1022
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,120
I only have one Mei Mei

1023
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,919
I can 't let her take that risk

1024
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,680
What do you mean ?

1025
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,160
Or

1026
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:42,759
This child

1027
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,799
No more

1028
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:47,120
I didn 't say what you said

1029
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,160
I said it

1030
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,839
What you said

1031
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,719
I said

1032
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,600
I didn 't say

1033
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:52,640
That 's what I said

1034
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:56,719
That 's okay , that uncle you

1035
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,520
I don 't care what way you use

1036
00:38:58,739 --> 00:38:59,560
To persuade my mother

1037
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:01,439
But can you promise me

1038
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:02,839
When you persuade her

1039
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,359
Never mention it

1040
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:05,600
What I told you

1041
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:07,080
Don 't worry about this

1042
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,520
Uncle Li knows a few things

1043
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,000
Have another bowl

1044
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,700
We have an empty stomach before dinner

1045
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,719
Replenish Qi and Blood

1046
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,080
Come

1047
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,000
Less

1048
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,140
Mei Mei

1049
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,000
You see since

1050
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,680
After you have this baby

1051
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,319
We 're all happy .

1052
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:51,460
That is

1053
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,620
We weren 't seriously

1054
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:54,640
Considered

1055
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,319
Possibility of this accident

1056
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:00,359
So I was trying to

1057
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,580
We should be rational

1058
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,960
to discuss and discuss

1059
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:03,899
After all , we are

1060
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:04,919
This age

1061
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,919
To give birth to this child

1062
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,839
It takes a lot of risk

1063
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,279
This value is not worth when

1064
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:15,799
Gu Yunsu looked for you .

1065
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:16,560
No No

1066
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,439
Absolutely not

1067
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,259
It 's not your pregnancy reaction

1068
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:21,160
I want to read a book

1069
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,879
This is new knowledge that has been popularized

1070
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:24,040
Don 't let you say anything yet

1071
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,919
What

1072
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,700
We also have a lot of them

1073
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,560
Female colleagues who are married and have children

1074
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,160
We are discussing and communicating

1075
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,239
Results returned

1076
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:32,480
Which female colleague with

1077
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,000
The communication is so profound .

1078
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,839
Many

1079
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:36,680
How many are there ?

1080
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:37,540
Who is it ?

1081
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:39,439
Let me hear it

1082
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,640
Don 't think wildly .

1083
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,239
I also want to learn from many aspects

1084
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,200
Listen to Hundreds of Schools

1085
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,719
After listening to Baijia Yan

1086
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,719
Then you decide

1087
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,040
I don 't want this child anymore

1088
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:54,680
No.

1089
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,319
Li Jianxiong , tell me the truth

1090
00:40:59,319 --> 00:40:59,960
Do you

1091
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,359
Don 't want this baby

1092
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,879
Of course I want this baby

1093
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,540
But

1094
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,759
But you hesitated

1095
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:06,359
Yes

1096
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:18,480
What did you tell me before ?

1097
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:20,640
You said you wanted the two of us

1098
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,919
There is a crystallization of love

1099
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:22,439
Yes No

1100
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:24,640
This crystal is now complete

1101
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,200
You said you didn 't want it

1102
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,759
You don 't love me anymore

1103
00:41:27,879 --> 00:41:29,319
You don 't want this child anymore

1104
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:31,319
How could I  not be me

1105
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,839
How could I not love you

1106
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,359
It 's because I love you .

1107
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:35,480
If you love me

1108
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,319
You shouldn 't be in

1109
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,299
In front of the crystal of love

1110
00:41:37,299 --> 00:41:38,000
So hesitant

1111
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,960
I hesitate because

1112
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,739
Dr. Ren Xiao Xu

1113
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:40,600
From a professional perspective

1114
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,399
Potential Risks

1115
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,520
I chatted with Susu

1116
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,319
Expands

1117
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,040
You understand what I said

1118
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,939
It 's Gu Yunsu 's fault .

1119
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,719
Yes No

1120
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,660
All right

1121
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:56,480
You are amazing

1122
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,399
I 'm afraid of you

1123
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,859
I have a headache

1124
00:41:58,859 --> 00:41:59,919
I 'm going to get some sleep

1125
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,839
Don 't follow me .

1126
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,580
What do you ask in this memory

1127
00:42:43,379 --> 00:42:44,839
You 're not in a hurry to go today

1128
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,040
Two operations were performed in the morning

1129
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,480
I spent another afternoon in the clinic

1130
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,739
I 'm too tired to ask for leave

1131
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,399
Plenty of time

1132
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:56,120
I have nothing more to ask .

1133
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,379
Come today

1134
00:42:57,379 --> 00:43:00,000
Mainly to thank you

1135
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,439
Eat whatever you want

1136
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,439
Graduated

1137
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:12,520
Actually , I 'm quite willing

1138
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,000
To see a family like you

1139
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,919
Me

1140
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:20,680
Learn theoretical knowledge hard

1141
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,919
Go home and threaten pregnant women

1142
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:23,120
That kind of family ?

1143
00:43:23,939 --> 00:43:25,560
I know you 're worried about Aunt Wu

1144
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:30,080
But to be like you

1145
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,520
I 'm blocked for half a month without landing once .

1146
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,319
I have to find out

1147
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,279
What are the risks of elderly mothers

1148
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,560
Few children can do it

1149
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:48,000
I told my mother how

1150
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,560
I have to have another one .

1151
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,719
It turns out that the root of the disaster lies with me

1152
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,759
That 's excellent .

1153
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:00,640
Dr. Xu

1154
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:02,120
Thank you

1155
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,439
I thank you

1156
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:14,500
Back

1157
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,660
Li Jianxiong , go tell me

1158
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:19,399
A little more fierce

1159
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,799
Susu

1160
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,439
What 's wrong

1161
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,799
Your mother asked me to deliver a message

1162
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,480
You said

1163
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,279
Tell me

1164
00:44:54,279 --> 00:44:55,120
Gu Yunsu

1165
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,000
Why do you always stop me

1166
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,540
Don 't let me Wu Limei

1167
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,399
Have this baby

1168
00:44:58,839 --> 00:44:59,299
Didn 't you mean

1169
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:00,779
Don 't mind my business anymore

1170
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:04,700
Uncle Li

1171
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,520
Then I 'm sorry to trouble you

1172
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,259
I also have a quote

1173
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:08,520
I want you to tell my mom

1174
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,379
Wu Limei

1175
00:45:09,379 --> 00:45:10,219
When will I , Gu Yunsu

1176
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:10,759
I 'm stopping you

1177
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:11,759
You 're such a joke

1178
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:13,520
Ask Li Jianxiong yourself

1179
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,480
Figure it out

1180
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,960
What did I tell him ?

1181
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,000
Mei Mei , let me explain to you

1182
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:21,879
Gu Yunsu

1183
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,399
If I , Wu Limei , don 't understand it

1184
00:45:23,399 --> 00:45:23,919
You and Li Jianxiong

1185
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:25,080
What exactly is it ?

1186
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,960
He Li Jianxiong

1187
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,819
I wouldn 't

1188
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:27,680
Standing here

1189
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,379
You added fuel and jealousy to Uncle Li

1190
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,700
Talked about this disease and that disease

1191
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:32,219
Didn 't you just pinch Uncle Li right ?

1192
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:33,239
Are you careful ?

1193
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,719
It 's me who adds fuel and vinegar .

1194
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:39,399
Mei Mei Na is not Susu

1195
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:40,480
Gu Yunsu

1196
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:41,879
Li Jianxiong has been looking forward to most of his life

1197
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:42,839
He just wants to talk to Wu Limei

1198
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,080
There 's a child

1199
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,379
The dream is finally coming true

1200
00:45:45,379 --> 00:45:46,060
You are at this time

1201
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:46,960
Made him back out

1202
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,040
Are you satisfied now ?

1203
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,799
What do I , Gu Yunsu , have

1204
00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:51,980
What are you satisfied with ?

1205
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:53,439
Are you giving birth to Wu Li Mei or not

1206
00:45:53,439 --> 00:45:54,839
What does it have to do with me , Gu Yunsu

1207
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:55,819
Is there anything worth me Gu Yunsu

1208
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:56,919
Satisfactory

1209
00:45:56,919 --> 00:45:58,319
This is going to be old .

1210
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,359
This abacus bead

1211
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,879
It jumped on my face

1212
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,480
Yes Yes Yes

1213
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,259
You 're right

1214
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,580
Give this child a way to live

1215
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,020
It 's broken

1216
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,160
I , Gu Yunsu 's Wealth Path

1217
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:07,560
I stopped you from giving birth

1218
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,739
I stopped you from resigning

1219
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,040
Because I don 't have a job at the moment

1220
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:10,680
No revenue

1221
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,279
I 'm afraid of a four - legged gold - devouring beast .

1222
00:46:12,399 --> 00:46:13,799
Take half of my mom 's money

1223
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:14,439
You 're telling the truth , right ?

1224
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,719
That 's not what Susu meant

1225
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:16,600
I 've wanted to say it for a long time

1226
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,259
Gu Yunsu , give it to me

1227
00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:18,120
Pack up and leave

1228
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,040
I 'll leave now

1229
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:21,100
Susu , you can 't go .

1230
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,359
Susu

1231
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:23,359
She really meant well .

1232
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,960
I made a mess .

1233
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,120
You Susu

1234
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,200
Susu , you can 't go

1235
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:29,100
You 're leaving

1236
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,319
What did I become ?

1237
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,279
Me Me Me Green Tea Man

1238
00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:27,399
Susu

1239
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,819
Susu , please stay for a while

1240
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,259
Uncle Li promises you

1241
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,180
Definitely explain it to your mom

1242
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:32,759
Is it good ?

1243
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:35,859
Mei Mei , please say something

1244
00:47:36,439 --> 00:47:37,200
Susu You

1245
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,379
Grandma

1246
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:46,839
Mom

1247
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,419
What 's wrong ?
