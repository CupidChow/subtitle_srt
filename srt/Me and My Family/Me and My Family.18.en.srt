00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:13,340
Why should I give you a baby ?

146
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,600
Then you can be considered

147
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,980
One of two boats with feet

148
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:23,640
You 're enjoying it

149
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,540
Gu Kangqi 's pursuit of you again

150
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,340

Yes

153
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,741
My flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers

154
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,061
He Gu Kangqi is here

155
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:33,121
What to order at the restaurant

156
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:34,020
Croissant Sandwich

157
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:34,761
Than I was at home

158
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:35,861
The soup I worked so hard to make for you

159
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:36,660
Is it okay

160
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,701

161
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:39,861
I was wrong I was wrong

162
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,941
I was wrong

163
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,821
I was wrong because I didn 't stop him

164
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,840
But I want to be honest with you

165
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,501
Is it good ?

166
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,681
I 'm actually doing

167
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:50,861
Retaliation

168
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,340
Really

169
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,821
Susu can testify

170
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,220
This is true

171
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,321
My mother treated him

172
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,381
The slightest bit of warmth is gone

173
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:02,340
Why don 't you take revenge ?

174
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,301
You write so many good points about him

175
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,020
I was nineteen years old at that time

176
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,080
In the eyes of that nineteen year old

177
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,181
Look at those things

178
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:10,701
Isn 't that all about it ?

179
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:11,421
Now

180
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,061
That 's not the case anymore

181
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,020
Then look

182
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,381
I wrote about you

183
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:16,501
Did you see it

184
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,960
That piece of paper tells the truth

185
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,181
I can 't even finish it .

186
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:20,480
What I wrote about you

187
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,061
Just the tip of the iceberg

188
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:23,261
Li Jianxiong

189
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:24,941
And I told you

190
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:25,980
How good you are to me

191
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,801
It 's a lantern

192
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:27,921
The one that I can 't find .

193
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:28,741
Yes No

194
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,261
Really

195
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:34,621

You are very good at everything

198
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:44,840
But there is one thing

199
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
You almost mean

200
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
You said I would change it

201
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,421
You don 't trust your wife

202
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,780
Mei Mei , I don 't believe you

203
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,061
I was really angry just now

204
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:55,160
Then I 'm not

205
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,140
Like you

00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,801
Isn 't it just for you

207
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,220
Love me more

208
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,741
You 're angry

209
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:01,400
Don 't listen to such a villain either .

210
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,441
Sowing discord

211
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:03,980
You have to believe me

212
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,061
You 're okay , Mei Mei

Then I 'll help you in and rest .

216
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,140
All right

217
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:10,100
You also

218
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:11,460
Fetal gas

219
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,821
What kind of gas is this tire ?

220
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:14,241
I 'm so angry .

221
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,821
Don 't be angry , don 't be angry

222
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,520
You 're not finished , are you

223
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,261

I hate it to death

227
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:27,941
Can I write this in ?

228
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:29,020
Write your head .

229
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:30,941
Write Write Write

230
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,701
Don 't let me see you again tomorrow

231
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,901
You 're here to check your breast

232
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:42,901
Why don 't you wear one

233
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,220
Clothes that are easy to put on and take off

234
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,061
Go over there and take off your clothes .

235
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
It 's okay . Relax .

236
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,340
You will have a breast examination later

237
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,161
Don 't post this again

238
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:05,301
Disposable breast patch

239
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,921
This is not taken off

240
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:08,801
I won 't stick it back in a while .

241
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,120
Does it hurt

242
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:12,701
No pain

243
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,801
Here

244
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,980
No pain

245
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:16,960
It doesn 't hurt

246
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,281
That 's fine , it seems

247
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,661
I 'm old enough

248
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,521
I wanted to check it out

249
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,541
Anxin

250
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,401
You have a strong health consciousness

251
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,380
What about here

252
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,720
Do I feel anything when I press it ?

253
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,120
Awkward

254
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,120
I mean physical feelings

255
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:41,521
What about this way ?

256
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,041
Shy

257
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:45,760
Here

258
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:47,000
A little itchy

259
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:47,821
Here

260
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:49,821
Describe what it feels like

261
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,921
I feel

262
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,080
I feel like both of us now

263
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,441
A little too intimate

264
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,401
Put on your clothes

265
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,321
There 's nothing wrong with your breast

266
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:11,840
It 's just a little droopy .

267
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,240
You should always wear a bra

268
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,760
That 's impossible . My chest is so flat

269
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,080
There is still room to droop

270
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:17,980
This

271
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:19,960
Still possible

272
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,921
Any more questions

273
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:47,460
Mom

274
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,240
I 'll give you a breast surgery department

275
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,321
Go and have a look .

276
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:51,080
What

277
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,561
Mei Mei

278
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:54,000
You are not feeling well

279
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:54,840
No

280
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,760
Good

281
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,441
Why do you want breast surgery ?

282
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,120
You don 't think your breasts

283
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,401
Is it unnaturally big ?

284
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,480
Let me show you .

285
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,441
Don 't do anything wrong

286
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:05,821
I think you should hang one

287
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,401
Neurology Department

288
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,980
Look at your brain

289
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:10,120
Neuropathy

290
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,860
Su Su ah

291
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,360
What about when a woman is pregnant

292
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,041
With estrogen

293
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,441
and rise in progestin

294
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:18,120
That breast

295
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,500
Attending Physician of Breast Surgery

296
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,840
She is Xu Wenbin 's ex - wife

297
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,561
Really

298
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:36,441
How do you know ?

299
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:39,000
Then I 'm going to hang one

300
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:40,701
I 'll check it out tomorrow

301
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,460
Dr. Xu was actually divorced

302
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,061
The main purpose of today 's visit

303
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:50,960
Just look

304
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:52,041
Don 't cause trouble

305
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,041
Don 't worry

306
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,681
Female competition is unacceptable

307
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,080
And we 're not

308
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,201
To be a referee

309
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,681
What are you doing ?

310
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:01,921
Isn 't this melon fragrant ?

311
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,141
I still don 't figure it out

312
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:07,500
What are you two doing here ?

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,901
I 'll accompany Mei Mei

314
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,401
Don 't want to leave me .

315
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,281
That 's right

316
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:14,681
Line

317
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,301
This is the first time in our family

318
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:17,321
Collectively fought

319
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:19,960
That means we are righteous

320
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,281
You should cherish it

321
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,921
Wu Limei

322
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,161
I see you 're pregnant

323
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:25,980
How many weeks ?

324
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,760
Twenty-two weeks

325
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:28,620
What about you recently

326
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,880
Is there anything uncomfortable

327
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,880
Recently , I am

328
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,340
I feel like sometimes

329
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,641
A little swollen

330
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:37,781
This should be related to pregnancy

331
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,600
It has a lot to do with it

332
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:39,521
Right

333
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,701
Dr. Yang

334
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:47,681
You are so beautiful

335
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:49,480
Thank you

336
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,161
How old are you ?

337
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,500
I am thirty-four

338
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,701
Really

339
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,401
You look so young .

340
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,840
Can 't tell at all

341
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,500
Come on , let 's go this way

342
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,181
Check it out

343
00:12:59,181 --> 00:12:59,801
OK

344
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:07,781
Thirty-four

345
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,441
Then I should be married .

346
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,021
Departed

347
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:13,480
Departed

348
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,760
Do you feel anything here

349
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:17,681
Fortunately it 's nothing .

350
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,521
Do you usually have galactorrhea

351
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,041
None

352
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,161
This divorce

353
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:25,521
If you have children

354
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,641
That 's hard .

355
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:28,521
Do you have any children

356
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,541
I don 't

357
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,720
Let 's take a look here

358
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,641
OK OK

359
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:33,360
It 's better to have no kids

360
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,161
I 'm telling you that I 've been there .

361
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,880
But he 's your ex - husband .

362
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,921
Don 't mess with you

363
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,600
Otherwise

364
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,921
It 's a lot of trouble

365
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,421
Big Sister

366
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,960
Are you here to see a doctor ?

367
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:45,600
Yes Yes Yes

368
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,120
What do you think of me

369
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,080
Is it okay ?

370
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,080
Nothing wrong

371
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,301
The good news is

372
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,561
No children

373
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:56,641
This

374
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:57,521
What about divorce ?

375
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:58,880
It 's because two people work

376
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,480
Too busy

377
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,720
Too little communication

378
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,921
This is good .

379
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:03,401
We are leisurely .

380
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:05,120
We will never repeat the same mistake

381
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,401
There is a negative one

382
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,041
Pretty good looking

383
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,821
This one is wearing a mask

384
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:12,921
You can see it .

385
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:14,021
At least the eyes

386
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,521
A little higher than ours

387
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:18,120
No. 7 Li Jianxiong

388
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,740
Go to Clinic No. 12

389
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,720
Then I 'll go .

390
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,000
Ask more clearly .

391
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,941
Ask more clearly .

392
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:23,641
I 'll go too

393
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:25,401
Hold it for me

394
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,681
Li Jianxiong

395
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,941
Sit

396
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:39,521
This

397
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,281
Men come to examine the breast

398
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:45,720
It 's rare .

399
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:48,120
Don 't be embarrassed

400
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,840
There are still many male patients

401
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,201
Then you are breasts

402
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:53,240
Do you feel uncomfortable ?

403
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,000
There 's nothing uncomfortable either .

404
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:01,120
That 's about three years .

405
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,580
Less than three years or two years .

406
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,500
This location below is

407
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,580
You Wash

408
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,260
Sometimes in the shower

409
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,441
I felt another

410
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,161
Even I can 't tell you well .

411
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:12,781
But but

412
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:14,441
But there 's nothing uncomfortable .

413
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:18,080
Let 's do it

414
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,100
You lift up your clothes

415
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:20,240
Let 's check

416
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:23,840
See

417
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:26,521
Does it look as good as my mom said ?

418
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,561
Looking better than me

419
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,441
It 's not that you look closely

420
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:31,701
If I put the lower half of my face

421
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:32,480
Cover it

422
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:34,480
I think you

423
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:35,720
Does it look good ?

424
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,041
Not as good as her

425
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,401
Dr. Yang

426
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:52,600
Which school did you graduate from

427
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:53,641
Huaan Medical College

428
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,181
After graduation

429
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,801
I came to this hospital

430
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:59,340
Yes

431
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:02,041
Then work as a doctor in a hospital

432
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,641
This is compiled , right ?

433
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,161
Yes

434
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,801
Look

435
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:09,681
And social status

436
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,401
The income is still stable

437
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,720
It 's good to be a doctor

438
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,681
But it 's hard to get into medical school .

439
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,561
None

440
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:17,821
That 's my son

441
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:19,801
He actually wants to go to medical school

442
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:20,821
I 'll help him ask .

443
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:22,480
OK

444
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:28,041
Yes Yes Yes

445
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:29,701
It 's here

446
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,401
Poke out , poke out .

447
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,661
Come , come , come , come

448
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,201
The conditions are indeed unusual

449
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:40,061
Right

450
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:41,321
Graduated from a prestigious school

451
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:42,600
Experienced

452
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,000
And the monthly income is very high

453
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,880
The key is that they have a compilation

454
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,840
Li Yan , I think

455
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,000
Your way to study medicine is reliable

456
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,480
No one looks at the compilation now

457
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:54,960
How can you talk nonsense without reading the compilation ?

458
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,801
If there is no establishment , it is called a small business vendor

459
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:57,781
Susu

460
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,120
You screenwriter industry

461
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,641
It 's compiled , right ?

462
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,401
Then you have to work hard .

463
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:07,801
I understood .

464
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,000
One by one

465
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,960
Everyone thinks I 'm inferior to her

466
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,880
No No

467
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,480
That 's not the case either

468
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,201
You also have your strengths .

469
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,240
Then tell me about it .

470
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,480
I don 't think it 's all your fault .

471
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:23,601
It may be

472
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,601
We lost at the starting line

473
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,040
It 's my responsibility

474
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,000
No , no , no

475
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,601
I think it 's mainly .

476
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:31,421
Susu , we may be

477
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:32,381
Wrong line

478
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,201
Why did you crush your head ?

479
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:34,901
to enter a

480
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,201
What about industries with no compilation ?

481
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,401
No one really looks at the compilation

482
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:38,361
As long as you have money

483
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,881
What is it about you ?

484
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:41,040
Of course , compilation is important

485
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,081
Li Jianxiong You You

486
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:43,941
Did you fall on

487
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:45,601
The compilation is in the eye , right ?

488
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:46,661
You 're at the three of us

489
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:48,000
Do you think the preparation is appropriate ?

490
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,401
You are the only one who has the establishment .

491
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,300
This is not at all

492
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,960
Issue of compilation or not compilation

493
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,000
The car is over there

494
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,121
Wu Limei

495
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Wu Limei

496
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:12,401
OMG

497
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,601
You don 't remember Hu Yunxi

498
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,800
Hu Yunxi

499
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,000
That 's right

500
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:19,320
My God

501
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,000
OMG

502
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,720
My God

503
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,601
Why don 't I recognize you ?

504
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,040
You 've changed a lot

505
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,081
I couldn 't recognize it for half a day .

506
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:28,441
How many years have passed after all

507
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,661
If I hadn 't seen Susu

508
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:31,681
I may not even recognize you .

509
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,701
Yunxi , what 's wrong with you

510
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:36,220
Why are you hospitalized ?

511
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,500
It 's fine

512
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,141
Advanced breast cancer

513
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:42,421
All in the lymph

514
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,901
It 's fine

515
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:57,320
You

516
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,941
What are you doing ?

517
00:18:58,941 --> 00:19:00,460
The kid is still here

518
00:19:02,181 --> 00:19:02,720
This

519
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:05,101
Susu , your mother is really old .

520
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:06,060
When I was young

521
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,480
It 's called a tear that doesn 't flick lightly

522
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:08,581
Strengthening

523
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,800
This is old

524
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:11,401
You are fragile in middle age

525
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,381
OK

526
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,661
I can 't see this

527
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:18,300
What 's wrong with you

528
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,060
Eat too much

529
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,181
I 'm full

530
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:21,621
I still get fat in middle age

531
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,181
You 've just eaten full .

532
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,161
I have it

533
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:28,861
Comrade Wu Limei

534
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,460
It must be you . You can do it .

535
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:34,581
The old tree sprouts

536
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,020
It 's spring again for dead trees

537
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,661
The salted fish turned over again

538
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:40,980
Susu must be your mother .

539
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,081
Everything happens

540
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,300
At the forefront of the era

541
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:45,980
Should I congratulate you ?

542
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:48,220
Yunxi

543
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,361
You 've changed

544
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:52,381
The change is quite big

545
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:53,240
Changed

546
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,820
Why is it different

547
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,460
I 'm sorry , Li Mei

548
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:01,441
Susu put it with me today

549
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:02,341
Not convenient

550
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,280
Lao Ji drank too much

551
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:05,800
It 's fine

552
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:07,161
Then take care of him .

553
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:09,540
Su Su goodbye to Aunt Yunxi

554
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,941
Bye bye bye bye susu

555
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,901
What are you doing ?

556
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:18,161
bleeding

557
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,101
I don 't know how

558
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:22,201
I touched it .

559
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:23,740
How could you not know ?

560
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,820
Hu Yunxi

561
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,960
What are you doing so slowly

562
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:30,000
Old Season

563
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:31,101
It 's me

564
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,220
Li Mei

565
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,881
It 's fine

566
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:35,280
Limei

567
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,421
Limei is here

568
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,201
Susu is also here

569
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,240
Susu , come in and play .

570
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:42,480
Why are you calling people in ?

571
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:44,401
Old Season

572
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,060
We 're just on our way

573
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,040
I brought you some fruit .

574
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,040
We 're leaving soon

575
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,861
Line

576
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,201
Thank you .

577
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,520
Let 's talk for a while .

578
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,441
OK OK

579
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:58,341
I 'll sleep a little longer . I 'm drinking too much .

580
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,161
Excuse me .

581
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:04,881
Li Mei

582
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,081
I often come to play when I have nothing to do .

583
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:07,921
Required

584
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:15,960
You come out

585
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,220
You close the door

586
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,820
You come out

587
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,040
What happened

588
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:29,300
It hurts here too .

589
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,020
Why is it like this ?

590
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,841
Yunxi , tell me the truth

591
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,841
This This

592
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:38,760
And that from last time

593
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:40,040
That big piece

594
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,520
Is it all done by Lao Ji

595
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:42,601
Yes No

596
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:44,260
Did Lao Ji do it ?

597
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:45,421
Don 't worry about Li Mei

598
00:21:45,421 --> 00:21:46,121
Yes Susu

599
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:46,921
Let 's go home with Mom first

600
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:48,260
Yunxi , tell me

601
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,520
Did he do it ?

602
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,060
He did it

603
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,921
I 'll help you figure it out

604
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:51,800
What do you want to do

605
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,500
You tell me , Limei

606
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,681
Anything is fine

607
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:55,020
I can help you find a way .

608
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,000
It 's none of your business , Li Mei

609
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,681
Yunxi , I can help you

610
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:06,661
Aunt Yunxi

611
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,361
Why is her injury so bad ?

612
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:10,401
I don 't know

613
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:12,760
Didn 't you listen to her

614
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,000
Leave me alone

615
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,121
She didn 't let me handle

616
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:17,480
So what can I do ?

617
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:20,081
Was she beaten by Uncle Ji ?

618
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:20,980
Who knows

619
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:22,081
Can 't control

620
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,841
Then I 'll go

621
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:25,500
What are you going to ?

622
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:26,841
You are a child you

623
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,720
She didn 't let me walk home

624
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,320
We don 't care about it

625
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,581
We don 't care about her

626
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:32,300
Go

627
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:34,401
Take a walk and have a look

628
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:36,101
Nice dress

629
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,121
Don 't miss it when you pass by

630
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:40,800
All right , let 's rest for a while

631
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:42,760
Mom , how many pieces have you sold ?

632
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:43,681
Two items

633
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:46,101
It 's also the price of the goods .

634
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,161
Sold

635
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,161
Doesn 't that suffer a loss ?

636
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:50,280
I can get my money back now

637
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,361
All thank God

638
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,000
Is it good ?

639
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,020
You said this

640
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,720
Very strange , very strange

641
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,240
Your mother

642
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,560
I dress so nicely every day

643
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,720
There will be people walking on the road

644
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,361
Ask me

645
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:00,441
Where did you buy this dress ?

646
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:01,081
Where did you buy it

647
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:02,661
I 'm here today

648
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:04,201
I have to support my family with this .

649
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,800
I can 't sell any of them .

650
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,201
Everyone in the ballroom knows it

651
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:08,201
You 're divorced

652
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:09,401
Women think you are

653
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:10,240
Single is a public nuisance

654
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,681
How can I let you get this bargain ?

655
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,661
Yun Happy

656
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:14,040
I think you 're in good condition .

657
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,280
Sunglasses are very nice

658
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,520
What 's wrong

659
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,361
Who is it ?

660
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,020
It 's Li Mei

661
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,421
Are you happy ?

662
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,820
Yun Happy

663
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:10,661
What 's wrong with you

664
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,060
Come in Come in

665
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:23,220
First in

666
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,621
Yun Happy

667
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,820
How long do you want to stay here

668
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,861
Stay for as long as you want

669
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:42,621
It 's just that the home is a little small and a little shabby

670
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:43,941
I 'm wronged to you

671
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,260
This sofa is susu

672
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,300
You little guy , you sleep on the sofa

673
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,681
We 'll stay in the bedroom .

674
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:51,540
Is it good ?

675
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,101
Don 't let your child sleep on the sofa

676
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:54,020
That 's what you want

677
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,300
I 'm not with you anymore

678
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,720
Be stubborn , you

679
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,841
Yunxi , you came to me

680
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,320
Does Lao Ji know

681
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,520
Asleep

682
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,460
I sneaked out

683
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,941
Just run out .

684
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,421
We ran out

685
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:17,820
But I won 't go back .

686
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:20,300
Make up your mind

687
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:21,740
This marriage must be divorced

688
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:26,780
Yunxi

689
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,800
This is all clean

690
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,641
Change of clothes

691
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:31,040
You 'll take a shower later

692
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:32,780
A big thing

693
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,960
You can think about it tomorrow

694
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,701
But I still

695
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:40,861
A little worried

696
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:43,921
I still want to take you to the hospital

697
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:44,800
Because of your injury

698
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,381
It looks too serious .

699
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:47,240
And oh

700
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,661
Limei , you 're going to get divorced in the future

701
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:50,260
You know this injury assessment

702
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,141
Important

703
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,060
That 's evidence is the key

704
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,540
Do you understand what I mean ?

705
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:00,101
I 'm so tired

706
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:03,720
I just want to take a shower

707
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,980
Get a good sleep

708
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,881
Good

709
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:08,040
I won 't say anymore

710
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,341
Do you want to wash it now

711
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,500
Then I 'll accompany you

712
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,581
No Limei

713
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,381
Then I 'll help you over .

714
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:17,500
I 'll help you over there

715
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:26,760
Do you really want me to accompany you ?

716
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,421
No need

717
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:30,280
What do you need from me ?

718
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,581
Just call me

719
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,381
I 'm in the living room

720
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:34,020
I can hear you when you shout

721
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,260
Mom

722
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,780
Why is Aunt Yunxi

723
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,661
Still not to divorce

724
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,101
Everyone needs a little time

725
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,941
Give Aunt Yunxi a moment

726
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,260
I think

727
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,500
Aunt Yunxi lives at our house

728
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,661
Good

729
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:55,740
That 's right

730
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,861
But our family is too small

731
00:27:57,861 --> 00:27:58,701
It 's too broken

732
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:00,581
It 's a little broken

733
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,101
But it 's safe

734
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:05,220
It 's safe

735
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,800
I 'm gonna let you go later .

736
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Aunt Yunxi

737
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,740
Snacks Together

738
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,661
Watching TV

739
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,260
This will make her happier

740
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,121
Don 't think I don 't know

741
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:17,540
What are you doing ?

742
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,740
What time is it in Gu Yunsu

743
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,020
Go in and sleep .

744
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:21,381
Hurry

745
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:22,000
You Aunt Yunxi

746
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,260
I don 't want you to sleep on the sofa

747
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,740
Hurry

748
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:33,941
It hurts

749
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,060
Li Mei

750
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,760
After Divorce

751
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:44,701
Isn 't life quite hard ?

752
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,101
Pretty bitter

753
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,701
You saw it too

754
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,500
The house is rented

755
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,260
Daily expenses

756
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:54,701
Daily items

757
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:56,381
Everything can be saved

758
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,460
Spend the least money

759
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,181
But even so

760
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:03,760
Still worried

761
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,460
This is the last meal , but the next meal is lost

762
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,220
But it 's okay

763
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,181
My heart is not bitter

764
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,701
Leave a small light for you

765
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,581
OK

766
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:41,861
Tell me if you have something .

767
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,540
You think I want to drink so much ?

768
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:49,300
You think I want to

769
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,500
Go drink with those guys

770
00:29:50,641 --> 00:29:51,941
I 'm not here for you yet

771
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:53,000
For this home

772
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,500
Is it good ?

773
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,161
Do I deserve this

774
00:29:58,161 --> 00:29:59,300
Can I commit it

775
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,960
Is it good ?

776
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:07,421
Li Mei

777
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,820
I 'm coming

778
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:12,800
What 's wrong

779
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,421
Do you have any sleeping pills here

780
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,921
When I close my eyes

781
00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:18,300
It 's all like Lao Ji beats me

782
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,901
I really can 't sleep

783
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
I 'll buy it tomorrow

784
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,460
What should I do today ?

785
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,040
In fact

786
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,040
I couldn 't sleep when I just went in .

787
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,601
I 'm still thinking .

788
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:36,500
If we were on the couch

789
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:38,240
Watching TV all night

790
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,960
Chatting All Night

791
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,941
How nice would that be

792
00:30:40,141 --> 00:30:40,921
OK

793
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,401
Why are you here ?

794
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,240
Gu Yunsu

795
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:46,581
Were you pretending to be asleep ?

796
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:47,841
I want to watch TV too

797
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:50,000
I 'll give it to you two

798
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,101
Get some food

799
00:30:58,601 --> 00:30:59,060
Yes Yes Yes

800
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,020
Here it is

801
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,101
Particularly inflated

802
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,320
Stiff calf

803
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,641
In the future we

804
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,020
Pinch at least once a day

805
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:10,181
Li Jianxiong

806
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,861
Are you very nice to me ?

807
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,780
If I 'm not good to you , who am I good to ?

808
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:20,841
I think someone should get married

809
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:23,421
She has to find someone who treats her well .

810
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:25,701
If you can 't find it

811
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:27,280
Just forget it

812
00:31:27,841 --> 00:31:28,861
What do you mean ?

813
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,901
I 'm the good one

814
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:31,861
You are the one

815
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:32,681
With a lantern

816
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:34,581
I can 't find the good one either

817
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,881
After your words

818
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:38,101
Tell me once a day .

819
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,381
I 'll tell you ten times a day

820
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:39,841
All right

821
00:31:40,101 --> 00:31:40,980
Ten times in the morning

822
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,220
Ten times at night

823
00:31:42,661 --> 00:31:43,861
You can also come ten times at noon

824
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:44,460
No , no , no

825
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,780
Enough , enough , too much

826
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:51,280
The one we met today

827
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:52,421
Hu Yunxi

828
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:56,500
Advanced breast cancer

829
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,381
So I 'm going to

830
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:01,341
I 'll see her tomorrow

831
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,861
OK , I 'll go with you

832
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,980
Actually

833
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:08,740
You should know her too

834
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:10,740
Really

835
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:13,320
So happy

836
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,040
I earned so much today

837
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
I 'm going crazy

838
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,000
So happy

839
00:32:21,081 --> 00:32:21,701
Li Mei

840
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,581
Wife

841
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,460
Wife , I finally found you

842
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,520
Wife

843
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,901
What are you doing here

844
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,960
Wife , you know

845
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:34,121
How hard did I find you ?

846
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:35,220
You come home with me

847
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,881
What are you doing with me ?

848
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:37,841
Don 't touch her

849
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:39,181
Why does she not go home

850
00:32:39,181 --> 00:32:40,280
Don 't you know ?

851
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:42,441
We had a few quarrels that day

852
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,441
A quarrel between husband and wife

853
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:44,921
Isn 't that normal ?

854
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,560
I didn 't control my emotions .

855
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,401
I hurt her

856
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
I regret it too .

857
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,480
I love her so much

858
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,081
How could I think

859
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:53,280
It really hurts her

860
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:54,841
Wife , come home this time

861
00:32:55,201 --> 00:32:56,320
I 'll definitely change my ways

862
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,560
I quit drinking completely

863
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,760
I will never do it again

864
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:01,240
Wife , will you come home with me ?

865
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:02,901
I 'll treat you well .

866
00:33:03,421 --> 00:33:05,681
I can 't live without your wife

867
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,240
Let me go or not

868
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,820
You go

869
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:14,240
Don 't pretend here

870
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,181
Wife , I was wrong

871
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:16,341
Wife , I was wrong

872
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:17,621
I was wrong I was wrong

873
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,820
Wife , I was wrong

874
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,641
I 'm wrong I 'm wrong I 'm wrong

875
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:22,401
Ji Qingdong , you 're enough

876
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:23,300
You let him fight

877
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
It 's best to kill yourself

878
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:25,960
What do you pretend to be ?

879
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,560
What kind of affectionate play is there ?

880
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:29,480
Yunxi

881
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,421
Don 't fall into his way

882
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:32,020
Let me tell you

883
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,240
What he is doing now is

884
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,581
To coax you back

885
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:36,141
He won 't change after he goes back .

886
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:37,181
He 's exactly the same as before

887
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:37,980
What is his virtue ?

888
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,941
You know that , right ?

889
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:39,820
Wu Limei

890
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,780
I usually treat you well , right ?

891
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:43,161
You take Susu to our house

892
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:44,060
Let Yunxi take care of it

893
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,540
Did I say anything

894
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,401
You divorced yourself

895
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,060
You still have to pull her to accompany you

896
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,941
I would rather demolish ten temples

897
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:50,941
Don 't ruin a marriage

898
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:51,581
Can you

899
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:52,661
I hope your friend will be good .

900
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,220
Ji Qingdong

901
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,201
Can you please stop

902
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:55,820
So many people ?

903
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,621
You 're not ashamed

904
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:57,581
I 'm embarrassed .

905
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,941
Wife , I was wrong

906
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:01,300
Would you come home with me ?

907
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,701
Go ahead of this .

908
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:03,861
She won 't come with you

909
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:05,000
Don 't park your car here

910
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,401
All right

911
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:06,820
It is very obstructive to others ' business .

912
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,381
Li Mei

913
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:10,141
I 'll go back with him first

914
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,800
I 'll go back and explain it to him .

915
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:15,460
Yunxi , please figure it out

916
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,820
This guy is a psycho

917
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,860
This guy is crazy .

918
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,240
You go with him and you 're done .

919
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,681
Li Mei , I don 't want to trouble you anymore

920
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,701

You can 't go back with him

00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,521
I told you to go back with him

930
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:33,581
You 'll regret it .

931
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:33,840
Walk away

1043
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:51,201
Yunxi does not divorce

00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,641
Yunxi does not divorce or divorce

What 's going on ?

1087
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,220
Why is domestic violence

1088
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:26,181
This is our own family matter

1089
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:28,181
What does it have to do with you police

1090
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:31,001
Scum

1091
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,220
You said this happened

1092
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,701
You didn 't call me in advance

1093
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,380
Why did you go in by yourself

1094
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:38,661
What to do about injury

1095
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:41,900
Take the evidence

1096
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,280

1100
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,581
Miss Nurse

1101
00:40:28,581 --> 00:40:29,780
I would like to ask

1102
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,360
Patients in this ward

1103
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,940
Where did you go

1104
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,860
Did you go out ?

1105
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:34,380
Aunt Hu

1106
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,501
She herself insisted on leaving the hospital

1107
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,300
He still wants to stay at home

1108
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,260
I just left in the morning

1109
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,461
Gone

1110
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,081
Let 's go

1111
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:56,061
This Hu Yunxi

1112
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,780
Send her so many WeChat messages

1113
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,701
She doesn 't reply either

1114
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,340
I don 't know what 's going on now .

1115
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,181
Not

1116
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:03,141
Many people have cancer

1117
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:04,501
Are they all angry ?

1118
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,280
I guess

1119
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,860
She was subjected to domestic violence .

1120
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:10,820
I suffered a lot of grievances

1121
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,001
Hold it in my body all the time

1122
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:12,981
Can 't express it

1123
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:13,860
Uncle

1124
00:41:14,481 --> 00:41:16,021
You also know about Aunt Yunxi

1125
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,860
Uncle Li was a policeman back then

1126
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,220
I handled this case

1127
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:21,141
That Night

1128
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:22,380
You also went to the police station

1129
00:41:24,141 --> 00:41:25,621
You knew each other since then

1130
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,161
Exposed

1131
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:36,521
We were not familiar with at that time

1132
00:41:43,141 --> 00:41:44,581
Say Cao Cao , Cao Cao will come

1133
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,641
Yun Happy

1134
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,840
In fact , over the years

1135
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,581
I 've been worried about you

1136
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:05,521
How are you doing ?

1137
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,340
I 'm afraid you 'll blame me

1138
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:13,900
It 's a good life

1139
00:42:15,121 --> 00:42:16,300
No , take a look .

1140
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,621

A separate toilet in a single room

1142
00:42:21,181 --> 00:42:22,220
That separate balcony

1143
00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:24,461
There are flowers every day

1144
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:26,101
Nutritious Meals

1145
00:42:26,561 --> 00:42:27,621
What else do I want ?

1146
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:28,961
What else can I do ?

1147
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,800
Good

1148
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,021
Limei , actually

1149
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,061
I always wanted to thank you .

1150
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:39,081
You just said I 've changed a lot

1151
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:40,121
I actually think

1152
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:41,720
I just found myself

1153
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,320
Really

1154
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,581
I know what I want

1155
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,641
I haven 't remarried for so many years .

1156
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:48,121
Not a son and a half daughter .

1157
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,621
There is that one too

1158
00:42:49,621 --> 00:42:51,121
When I am lonely

1159
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,601
But I really feel like my whole life

1160
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:57,940
I think I 'm awesome , really
