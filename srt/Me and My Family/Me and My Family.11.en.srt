1
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,181
OK , this is your bed

2
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:22,181
This railing

3
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:23,380
It can be put down

4
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:24,740
Ring the bell if necessary

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,360
That

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,101
Family follow me later

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:27,981
Thank you

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:29,860
This

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,420
Line

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,641
You are pregnant

11
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:48,300
Your daughter

12
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:50,160
Eldest daughter

13
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:53,021
Then you 're really tired .

14
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,101
This is all over

15
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:55,260
The age at which to be a grandmother

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,201
I have to suffer it again

17
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:57,540
The young man 's suffering

18
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:59,381
It 's not easy

19
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:02,181
I 'm glad it 's okay

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,461
I 'll tell you

21
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:13,920
I decided on your father .

22
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:15,040
Let him come

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,700
I still have reservations

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,681
I don 't care

25
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:19,760
Accompanying family members

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,540
We 'll be at logistics in a moment

27
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,780
Remove the folding bed

28
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,280
You ask for it .

29
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:58,320
You said the pregnant woman in the bed next to us

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,560
My heart is really high

31
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,120
You really live until you are old .

32
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,701
Then after she

33
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,780
Hold a parent - teacher meeting for children

34
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,000
How to introduce yourself

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,701
The mother of the child

36
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:06,880
Still the child 's grandmother

37
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:08,961
If you say so

38
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:10,141
I really want them .

39
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:11,160
In a school

40
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,440
You two love to worry about other people 's leisure .

41
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,301
I 've heard that love 's life is bitter .

42
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,400
Nosy Yi Lao

43
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,720
It 's ugly to chew a tongue

44
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:25,521
Why do you speak so ugly ?

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,361
between our sisters

46
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:28,521
Just chatting day

47
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,660
Whispering

48
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,340
Who knows anyone

49
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,581
Eavesdropping behind the back

50
00:03:32,361 --> 00:03:33,921
Co - authoring is not in front of others

51
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:34,500
You can discuss it

52
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,320
Someone else 's wrong

53
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,641
Okay , I learned it

54
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,921
If there is such a rule , I should have told you earlier

55
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:39,681
I played

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,280
You cover his ears

57
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:44,641
I just wanted to ask

58
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,880
Long rope knots

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,320
Why can 't your tongue ?

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
But my mom said it

61
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,641
Don 't be like animals

62
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:51,400
To be a man , you have to walk forward with great strides

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,041
Never mind the dogs behind you

64
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,041
But the dogs are pretty friendly

65
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,100
You only have poison

66
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:56,801
Recently

67
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,181
Don 't supplement any vitamins .

68
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,880
You should eat more cosmetics

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,440
Add to your inner beauty

70
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,641
The next time

71
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:03,220
With me and my mom

72
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,280
Living under one roof

73
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,041
I 'm wronged to you .

74
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:05,981
I 'm really unpleasant to my eyes

75
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:06,620
There 's nothing we can do

76
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,320
I had to put my eyes

77
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,041
Poke blind

78
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,320
Do you like oranges

79
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,120
Stay where you are

80
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,620
I 'll give you two one .

81
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,541
Buy an orange

82
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:19,801
Dr. Xu

83
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,481
It doesn 't affect your performance , right ?

84
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,721
When did you come ?

85
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:25,760
Just arrived

86
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,161
That 's fine

87
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,620
Dr. Xu

88
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,120
I 'm going back with my mom

89
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:35,960
I know

90
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,000
You 're taking it out on your mom

91
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,000
But I 'm pregnant after all

92
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,560
Mood should not fluctuate too much

93
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,241
Take care of

94
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:44,440
I understand

95
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,221
Note next time

96
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,101
No next time .

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
It was indeed their first move .

98
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,541
Baby

99
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,181
Come to eat , eat , eat

100
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,101
McDonald 's for you

101
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,781
I have a baby now

102
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,460
You have to ask him about eating .

103
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,861
Why don 't you have some soup ?

104
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,460
This soup is still hot .

105
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:23,020
I have no appetite .

106
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,460
When she was admitted

107
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:32,421
Obviously I have a good appetite

108
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,200
I heard a lot of pregnant women

109
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,861
When pregnant

110
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,060
Appetite will change greatly

111
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,060
Su Su ah

112
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:42,060
You tell your uncle the truth

113
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,541
Did your mother secretly

114
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,101
Eat food made by others

115
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,020
Uncle Li , what are you saying ?

116
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,200
My mom is that kind of

117
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,080
There is no moral bottom line

118
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,620
That scumbag ?

119
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,401
No , this kid

120
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:54,341
This is related to the moral bottom line

121
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,221
What does it matter ?

122
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,380
I 'm afraid of your mother

123
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,861
Order food quietly

124
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:58,781
That 's not healthy

125
00:05:58,901 --> 00:05:59,721
Unsanitary

126
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,161
You you you

127
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,140
Keep an eye on it .

128
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,181
Don 't worry

129
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:07,500
I 'll do it now

130
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,380
I don 't seem to be very hungry

131
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,401
What time is it ?

132
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:13,601
You try , you try

133
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:16,020
You try it , you try it

134
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,880
You must eat on time

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,421
Try

136
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,401
This this this gives

137
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:29,361
I , I , I

138
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,661
I am mainly now

139
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,601
This seems a bit

140
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,221
I can 't eat this .

141
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:36,940
It may be

142
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:39,181
The previous meal was too close

143
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:39,820
I 'm kind of

144
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,601
No you you you

145
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,060
Have you eaten ?

146
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,101
I feel my stomach

147
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,901
Nobita gave it

148
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,060
I 've never counted him .

149
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,781
Discussion of this dish

150
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,000
He can 't match me .

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,841
Why did you eat his

152
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:55,940
Don 't eat mine

153
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,481
Not me , me , me

154
00:06:58,481 --> 00:06:59,620
My carefully prepared

155
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,500
You you eat his

156
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,421
What do you do at least

157
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,781
You eat mine too

158
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,861
I

159
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:04,841
Where am I

160
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,060
How am I inferior to him ?

161
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,541
It 's not you two , is it ?

162
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:09,541
Not comparable

163
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:10,640
Of course I know

164
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,841
He is no longer comparable to me

165
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:12,380
Right

166
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,781
Of course I can 't blame you .

167
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:14,440
Someone sent it .

168
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,700
You still have to eat

169
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,620
The competition is fierce .

170
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,500
Or did I deliver it late

171
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,541
It 's still my problem

172
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,221
You said Li Jianxiong

173
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:22,580
Why is he so shameless ?

174
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,341
You can 't be soft - hearted

175
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:25,661
You treat him like you used to

176
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:26,901
So determined to me

177
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,421
I 'll let him go first

178
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:29,380
I 'll come back tomorrow

179
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
I 'll make you a hot pot

180
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,500
I 'll make you a roast of whole lamb

181
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,140
This is the child 's father

182
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:46,401
What about the last one

183
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,181
He is also the child 's father

184
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:52,940
Gu Yunsu , you can get up now

185
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:57,100
Why are you still sleeping ?

186
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,901
Hurry up

187
00:08:58,261 --> 00:08:59,060
Did you hear that

188
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:00,820
Dr. Xiao Xu

189
00:09:01,301 --> 00:09:01,901
Aunt Wu

190
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:04,021
How are you doing today

191
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:07,261
Others are OK

192
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,681
But I just feel my stomach

193
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,021
It seems a little uncomfortable

194
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:10,740
Do you think I

195
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,021
Need to check

196
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:13,220
What did you eat yesterday

197
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:15,141
Does the family have any records ?

198
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,281
Family members are asking you ?

199
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,840
Black Truffle Spaghetti

200
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,220
Pan - Fried Chicken Steak

201
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:24,021
Fried shrimp with snow peas

202
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,421
Multigrain Rice

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,580
Stir - fried Chinese cabbage

204
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,700
Scrambled Egg with Tomato

205
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,901
Steamed Seabass

206
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,261
Tofu and lotus root slices

207
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,440
A little too much

208
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,820
Combination of Chinese and Western Culture

209
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,060
I 'm afraid it 's a little overnutrition

210
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:35,801
Aunt Wu

211
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:36,860
It 's different from before

212
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,940
Pay attention to balanced nutrition

213
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,141
Be sure to control weight

214
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,181
OK OK

215
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:41,541
Family members should pay more attention

216
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:42,641
Family

217
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:44,021
Pay attention

218
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,340
What 's wrong with her

219
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,261
The doctor is talking to you

220
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:47,940
What 's going on

221
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,940
You 're a little polite

222
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,661
Can it work ?

223
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,181
Gu Yunsu

224
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,781
The bed is hard

225
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,220
Snoring and sounding

226
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,541
I didn 't sleep all night

227
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,580
I was just about to sleep

228
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,781
Let me sleep

229
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,240
Dr. Xiao Xu

230
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,980
A little hard

231
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,781
Dr. Xiao Xu

232
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,840
I just wanted to tell you something .

233
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,740
Dr. Xu

234
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:07,781
Pinpoint the time of your ward round

235
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:09,261
Hot coffee specially bought for you

236
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,600
It 's easy to get sleepy early in the morning

237
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,740
Gu Yunsu got up

238
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,301
Sorry

239
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:13,901
There are regulations in our hospital that we cannot accept it

240
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:15,580
Just a cup of hot coffee

241
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,021
I 'll tell you when you get up

242
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,521
You can 't get up you

243
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,200
Up

244
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:21,521
I drink

245
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:27,141
I 'll transfer money to you later

246
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,301
We can 't do without coffee .

247
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:30,421
I 've lost my life

248
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,820
This will do without waste .

249
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:39,940
Remember to transfer money to others later

250
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,080
Thank you

251
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,460
Gu Yunsu hurriedly got up

252
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,340
Hurry

253
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,521
Thank you

254
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,480
Hurry

255
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:07,720
Gu Yunsu

256
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:12,761
Come here

257
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:17,340
Let me tell you .

258
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:19,860
I saw it all just now

259
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,121
The one on the rush

260
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,840
Everyone rushed to Dr. Xu

261
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,740
It 's gone to me

262
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,580
Don 't people just want to get close ?

263
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,421
Character is not very good

264
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,080
Vision is good

265
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,161
I just found out now

266
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:36,301
This little Dr. Xu

267
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,541
He is our chosen son - in - law

268
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:40,761
Really

269
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,901
Good person and good character

270
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:46,100
He looks good and is tall

271
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,501
And you 've chosen a good job .

272
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,121
Anyway

273
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:50,901
Let 's do it well

274
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,141
He has a relationship with him

275
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,181
It 's better to develop

276
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,541
One step

277
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,301
How about

278
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,621
Living up to God 's arrangement

279
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,181
Do you

280
00:11:59,181 --> 00:12:00,580
I got angry in the next bed

281
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,281
Pointing at me and raising his eyebrows with pride

282
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,301
Retaliation

283
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,261
Don 't you kill two birds with one stone ?

284
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:11,541
I think anyway

285
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:14,340
He is better than Qin Yuxuan

286
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,181
A better man than Qin Yuxuan

287
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:16,860
Too much .

288
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,761
I want to see someone and love someone

289
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:19,661
What did I become ?

290
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:20,681
Everyone can do everything .

291
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,320
In ancient times , it was necessary to soak pig cages

292
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:24,340
Conditions are equivalent

293
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,901
Get along well

294
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:28,021
In this range

295
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,621
I think it can be considered

296
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,021
Are the conditions equal

297
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,740
Come on , let me tell you something

298
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,401
People

299
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:40,460
Top obstetrics and gynecology department in the city

300
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,301
Tap

301
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:42,501
Attending physician

302
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,181
What the hell am I

303
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:46,261
Unpaid Caregiver

304
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:47,541
I didn 't sleep either

305
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,141
Is it equivalent ?

306
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,641
Give me a good job

307
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:53,901
Be more clear

308
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,980
Can you be more confident ?

309
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,240
Look at her

310
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,421
Just a firewood girl

311
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,860
I still feel like I

312
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,220
It 's like a fairy

313
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,541
Look yourself in the mirror

314
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,340
Be good - looking

315
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,820
Be talented and talented

316
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,301
Internal and external features

317
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:09,960
What 's the difference

318
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:11,141
All right , all right

319
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:13,181
Although it 's true that you say it

320
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:13,940
I acknowledge

321
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:15,661
But inside your head

322
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:16,521
Not every day

323
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,580
These feelings love love

324
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,860
Men 's and Women 's Things

325
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,621
What do you say

326
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:21,141
He is also a Kochi

327
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,761
It 's impossible for me to be with that Xu Wenbin

328
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,541
The doctors have told you all about it .

329
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,541
Don 't think alone

330
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,580
Eat two meals

331
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,340
What 's wrong with me eating two meals

332
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:33,501
It shows that I am popular

333
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
I 'm charming

334
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,840
Of course

335
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:40,460
It 's a bit too much

336
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,220
I think

337
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,340
Put the extra

338
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,261
To Dr. Xiao Xu

339
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:47,621
How about you eating together

340
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,521
OK , we can eat meals together

341
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:51,541
But

342
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,541
Don 't think about matching .

343
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,641
Xu Wenbin and I

344
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:57,661
A little promising , okay ?

345
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:58,661
Give up .

346
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:00,060
Think of something serious

347
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,541
I 'll sweep you

348
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,340
Please enter

349
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,381
Dr. Xu

350
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,340
This

351
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:21,860
The parturient has no appetite

352
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,141
I 'm afraid that my accompanying family members are too fat

353
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:25,621
Can Dr. Xu help ?

354
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,220
Let 's try this love meal

355
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:30,041
I thought anyway

356
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,621
I still owe you a few meals

357
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:36,681
OK

358
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:45,021
It looks like two dads

359
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,621
Real effort was put into it

360
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,220
An unbearable burden of life

361
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,381
Which do you stand for ?

362
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:51,580
You want to hear gossip

363
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:58,100
Their styles are opposite

364
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,340
It 's just like this daily dish

365
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:01,080
Where 's Uncle Li ?

366
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,940
Take the Chinese - style home - cooked route

367
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,181
Look at this dish

368
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:05,501
It looks plain

369
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,940
But the entrance is good

370
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,781
Isn 't it delicious ?

371
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,141
Yes

372
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,820
My dad

373
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:10,181
Western Style Road

374
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:12,100
Focus on a sense of ritual

375
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,820
Foreign style and beautiful

376
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,901
Don 't look at my mother like this

377
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,781
When she was young

378
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,141
She is a young artistic woman

379
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,761
Pursue that

380
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,381
Something very romantic and unrealistic

381
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,460
This

382
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,480
Something that 's not useful

383
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,181
I was fooled

384
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:28,240
So you 're worried

385
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,340
Western - style biological father kills the carbine

386
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,860
This low - key Chinese Uncle Li

387
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:34,021
Still

388
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:35,021
Aunt Wu 's Right Fate

389
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,421
You know a lot about women .

390
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,001
After all , my patient

391
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:40,980
They are all women

392
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:44,261
Dr. Xu

393
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,820
I 'm always curious

394
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,421
You said there are so many departments

395
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,320
Why would you choose

396
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,220
What about Obstetrics and Gynecology

397
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,521
Because of obstetrics and gynecology

398
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:53,641
is the only one who can meet

399
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:54,820
New Life 's Department

400
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,661
It brings hope

401
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:01,700
delivering a baby

402
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,021
What feeling is it ?

403
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,541
How to say it

404
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:08,381
That 's the moment when you feel

405
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,261
I have special strength

406
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:13,320
Especially every time I hear a baby

407
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,261
Delivered from uterus

408
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:15,220
First Cry

409
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,060
My heart will be knocked down

410
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:18,940
Then I couldn 't help but sigh

411
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:21,100
This little life in my hands

412
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:22,801
From small cells

413
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,220
Split into embryo body

414
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,980
Then in the womb

415
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,661
Savage Growth

416
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:27,541
It 's so big

417
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,801
Isn 't this just one time ?

418
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:29,761
The Big Bang

419
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,440
How many crises does he have to go through

420
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,181
That was why he was born

421
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,340
If that 's the case

422
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:38,080
Each of us

423
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,281
Coming into this world

424
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,501
Heroes

425
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:41,681
Yes

426
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,840
The Coming of Every Life

427
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,320
It 's all a miracle

428
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,580
Of course

429
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,141
After becoming an obstetrician and gynecologist

430
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:53,700
Occasionally depressed

431
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:56,281
Because sometimes

432
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,980
You don 't just have to welcome a new life

433
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,141
We still have a lot to send away

434
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:00,940
Innocent lives

435
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:02,700
Dystocia

436
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,100
And abortion

437
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,960
To the patient itself

438
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:10,820
Can also cause irreversible effects

439
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,220
So

440
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,381
Be careful with your body

441
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:15,980
Treat life with caution

442
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,220
Yes and this kind of thing

443
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,421
Only we women are careful

444
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:20,181
Not useful either

445
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,980
This man has to take responsibility .

446
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,500
Two people , right

447
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,681
Everyone needs new life

448
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:26,101
Treat with caution

449
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:26,901
Yes

450
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,780
And

451
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,500
Also be cautious

452
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,780
Our own bodies

453
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:32,121
As you just said

454
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:33,361
We are almost the same as

455
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:34,861
Like Big Bang

456
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,240
It has gone through many hardships

457
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,540
I just came to this world

458
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,141
Of course we should cherish ourselves

459
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:40,381
Yeah

460
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,341
So

461
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,780
It must be taken seriously

462
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:45,240
We eat

463
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,581
There 's no need to be so serious

464
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:51,621
Let me try a Western style .

465
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,740
Finished

466
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:56,720
My mom got into a quarrel .

467
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,700
I just want to go up two or three degrees

468
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,621
Why can 't it work ?

469
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:02,641
No

470
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:03,361
Why

471
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:04,821
Because you 're comfortable alone

472
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:05,540
And then all of us

473
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,841
It 's going to be hot .

474
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,421
That doesn 't make sense

475
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,181
Please accommodate you

476
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,940
My mother is a super old woman

477
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,341
Qi and blood really can 't keep up

478
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:15,220
Extremely afraid of cold

479
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:17,700
Why don 't you raise the air conditioner by two degrees first

480
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,740
Keep her warm

481
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,341
It doesn 't work

482
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:19,780
I 'll give it to you

483
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,980
Each person buys a small fan

484
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,540
How about

485
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,020
This is not about buying a fan

486
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,500
We 're not short of that money

487
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:26,841
This ward

488
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:28,500
It was originally a multi - person ward

489
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:29,561
It should be

490
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:31,061
The minority subordinates the majority

491
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:31,780
This is related to age

492
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,020
It doesn 't matter .

493
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,740
If you want to feel comfortable

494
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,321
Then use the fan money

495
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,101
Transfer to a single ward

496
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:39,020
How comfortable that is

497
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,861
Understand

498
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,641
Respect

499
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:43,300
When I just said that in vain

500
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,260
Mom , let 's do this

501
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,760
Afternoon

502
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,901
I 'll buy you a heater

503
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:46,661
Put it there for you

504
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:48,401
That

505
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,800
Buying a heater

506
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,740
I can 't control it

507
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:51,980
But there is one thing

508
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,260
I 'm really afraid of heat

509
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:55,321
Please don 't

510
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:56,901
That wind is blowing me .

511
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,341
Let me accommodate again

512
00:18:58,621 --> 00:18:59,381
Completely understand

513
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,661
You have a delicate body

514
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:11,181
They are also reasonable .

515
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,700
Attendant

516
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,700
Is there a more powerful one

517
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,500
This is too small

518
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,540
Some are in it

519
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,861
Reasonable is Reasonable

520
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,341
But let 's discuss it privately

521
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:21,181
Isn 't it somewhat

522
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,000
Upgrade Upgrade

523
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,220
Deliberately making things difficult

524
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,780
Then there 's nothing you can do about it .

525
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:27,780
Collective Life

526
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,861
That 's what it looks like .

527
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,181
Why are there birds when the forest is big ?

528
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:31,861
You can 't do everything

529
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:33,260
It 's all in line with my own heart .

530
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:35,101
The minority follows the majority

531
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:36,581
This is the most basic principle

532
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:37,101
Why don 't you ?

533
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:38,260
Society is going to be chaotic

534
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,020
Let 's take a step back .

535
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:42,460
Attendant

536
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:43,700
That 's what I 'm doing .

537
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,421
Come on with this big one

538
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:45,300
Alright Susu

539
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,101
Why don 't you wait ?

540
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,141
Give this to Mei Mei and take it back

541
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:48,061
Blow it first

542
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:49,101
We 'll do it later

543
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,141
Susu

544
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,821
This is fine

545
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:56,460
Not bad

546
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,260
You bought it

547
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,540
Really good

548
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:00,240
Is it warm ?

549
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,440
I am your little sun

550
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:04,421
Wind

551
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:06,341
Blowing on me

552
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,841
OK

553
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,460
Really

554
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,740
Yes

555
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,381
Everything goes well

556
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:14,460
It 's not you . It 's not

557
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,161
Does it block my sunlight ?

558
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:17,921
OK , OK , ignore her

559
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:18,641
Come on , ignore her

560
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,421
Right

561
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:20,760
Co - authored half

562
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,621
Not a single room

563
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:22,901
Understand each other

564
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:25,141
I 'm afraid of the trouble to move a single room by myself

565
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,661
If you ignore her , she will be special .

566
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,061
Take care of your mother 's meals

567
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:31,821
You try this

568
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,901
What 's your father doing ?

569
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:37,601
This is not obvious

570
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:38,901
Did I arrange for you ?

571
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,000
You don 't want to see this

572
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,141
Is this the result ?

573
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:42,740
Let him work more for you

574
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:45,601
Thank you .

575
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:51,061
I want to go tonight

576
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:52,300
Only tonight

577
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:53,641
I want to go tomorrow morning

578
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:54,780
Tomorrow morning

579
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:55,401
Where are we going ?

580
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,040
Single room

581
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,601
Great

582
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,300
I won 't go to a single room

583
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,581
Why not go to a single room

584
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:02,260
That 's right

585
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,381
Living alone in single room

586
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:04,061
How convenient it is

587
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:04,881
It 's a mess here

588
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,381
It 's not suitable for your health .

589
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:07,101
Arrived at the single room

590
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:09,020
I can  day and night

591
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,260
By Your Side

592
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,220
I can tell you jokes

593
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,421
Storytelling to put you to sleep

594
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,000
I support my father in this

595
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,700
I agree

596
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,540
What a great single room , isn 't it ?

597
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,341
How many degrees do you want to turn on the air conditioner

598
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:20,901
Right

599
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,280
And no one will fight you for TV .

600
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,780
Which channel do you want to watch and which channel

601
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,260
It 's mainly me as a bed companion

602
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,161
You let me live there too

603
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,220
A little more comfortable

604
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,421
I feel very humbled here every day

605
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,341
I still have to grab the toilet

606
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:30,540
You want to go , you go and I won 't go

607
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:31,800
Dad

608
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,901
The price for living in a single room

609
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,780
Pay for it

610
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,280
What are you saying ?

611
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:38,061
Of course I did it .

612
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:38,960
Take a look

613
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,661
He owes you so much

614
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:42,500
Where is it ?

615
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,621
You ask him to give a little more

616
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:44,821
I love living here

617
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:45,980
I like the excitement

618
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
I won 't go to a single room

619
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,940
I 'm not going

620
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,101
You eat first

621
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,020
Let 's talk after dinner

622
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,401
I 'm also involved .

623
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,780
Love also catches up with you You

624
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,661
Why did you do this to me ?

625
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:01,921
What am I doing wrong

626
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:02,621
You tell me

627
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,500
Tell me directly

628
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,581
It 's not Gu Kangqi , please take a moment

629
00:22:04,581 --> 00:22:06,020
You didn 't ask me either

630
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,780
Is it you

631
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,661
You have to ask me

632
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:08,700
Do you want to go to a single room ?

633
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,081
I didn 't tell you either

634
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:11,101
I 'm going to the private room

635
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:13,181
This is not a single room or a single room .

636
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,361
It 's you who are hot and cold .

637
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:14,780
I don 't know you

638
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,901
Dad , you 're a little excited .

639
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,641
I couldn 't figure it out .

640
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:18,841
I didn 't say I was going to a single room

641
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:19,401
Don 't get too excited .

642
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:20,940
Why are you blindly contacting me ?

643
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,141
What are you two doing ?

644
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,200
You 're testing me , right ?

645
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:29,020
This tests me

646
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:30,861
This is definitely a test for me .

647
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,181
See if I can handle it .

648
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:32,821
Let me tell you .

649
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:33,480
I 'm sixty

650
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,700
I 'm going to run a marathon

651
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,841
There is plenty of endurance .

652
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:36,980
Test it .

653
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,341
It 's okay to test casually

654
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:43,500
Can you go ?

655
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,181
Just think I 'm spending money on cleanliness

656
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:46,881
I 'm not going

657
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:48,321
You want to be clean

658
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:50,260
I won 't sell it if I want to buy it

659
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:56,460
Mom , this wave is really

660
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,821
I stand for my real father

661
00:22:58,081 --> 00:22:59,460
I think he

662
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,901
It 's really reliable

663
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,020
Very reliable

664
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:02,700
Tap

665
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:06,061
Uncle Li is really

666
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:07,220
He 's fine though

667
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,220
But he 's too calm .

668
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,780
Right

669
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,220
You said it was just this

670
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,821
What does that do ?

671
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:14,720
Should this be cold or cold ?

672
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,641
Why don 't you go

673
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:16,621
What about the single room ?

674
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,661
How can I get there ?

675
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,381
I 'm done

676
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:19,940
How can I tell Uncle Li ?

677
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,581
Didn 't Uncle Li ask ?

678
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:23,321
What are you doing ?

679
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:24,621
Have to recruit your ex - husband

680
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:26,141
Don 't I regret it now ?

681
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:27,101
I regret it now

682
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:28,540
My intestines are green with regret

683
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,821
Green tea is not easy

684
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:31,740
How did I know he was so excited

685
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,101
I often regret myself

686
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:38,561
It shouldn 't be

687
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,621
I often regret that I don 't

688
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:50,220
Dr. Xiao Xu

689
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,181
I 've been working hard recently

690
00:23:52,621 --> 00:23:53,421
OK

691
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,300
Is it convenient to add WeChat ?

692
00:23:56,821 --> 00:23:58,381
I mainly want to know about it

693
00:23:58,381 --> 00:23:59,821
My sister 's health condition

694
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,341
I don 't have my phone with me at the moment

695
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:02,161
Later

696
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,280
Dr. Na Xu

697
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,460
Are you free after work ?

698
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,081
I saw a movie recently

699
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,061
It 's pretty good .

700
00:24:10,061 --> 00:24:11,740
It 's inconvenient if you don 't know it

701
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,681
Dr. Xu

702
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,861
I want to ask you something .

703
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,601
OK

704
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:16,700
Sorry

705
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,240
Add WeChat later

706
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:21,780
Dr. Xiao Xu

707
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,081
This is our Susu

708
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:25,740
Five Red Soup for You

709
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,181
Don 't look at this material very simple

710
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,621
Her labor is very expensive

711
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,460
Stay on the edge for two hours

712
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,901
Then simmer on low heat

713
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,780
Nothing is added in this

714
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,101
People like you stay up late and work overtime

715
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,621
Special for replenishing qi and blood

716
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:41,460
Susu made it for me

717
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,460
Why didn 't I listen to her ?

718
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,661
She 's embarrassed .

719
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:46,760
Take it

720
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:47,780
No No

721
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,581
Drink it yourself

722
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,020
Don 't be polite .

723
00:24:50,141 --> 00:24:51,901
Mom took out that urine cup

724
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:53,020
Do you have urine now

725
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,821
Go pee one

726
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:54,641
Susu

727
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:55,960
I happened to

728
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,020
The five red soup you made

729
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,601
For Dr. Xu

730
00:25:04,661 --> 00:25:05,460
Five Red Soup

731
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,181
It took uncle Li a long time .

732
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:08,101
Did you make it ?

733
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:09,061
You don 't want to drink it

734
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:10,861
How sad Uncle Li would be if he knew it .

735
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:11,661
You 're wrong

736
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:15,361
Auntie is made by Uncle Li

737
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:16,300
You can drink it yourself

738
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,700
Isn 't my appetite very bad recently ?

739
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,421
Drink more soup

740
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:19,800
Yes , yes , drink more soup

741
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,341
Diuresis

742
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:21,141
Purinate tightly

743
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:22,520
Send it back before 12 o'clock

744
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,240
Dr. Xu

745
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:24,641
Something happened to bed 18

746
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:25,321
Go and have a look

747
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,341
I said you were sick .

748
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:33,020
Why is it so confused ?

749
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:35,621
What are you thinking ?

750
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
I said half a day

751
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:38,841
Fuck you , go pee quickly

752
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:39,681
Excuse me

753
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:40,641
Be careful , be careful , be quick

754
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:41,200
Excuse me

755
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:42,300
Hang in there

756
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,641
It seems very serious .

757
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,121
Give me a moment , give me a moment

758
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:45,980
and so on

759
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,800
Give me a moment

760
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,341
Excuse me

761
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,121
Hang in there , hang in there

762
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:48,720
Excuse me

763
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:51,200
Give me a moment

764
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,520
Hang in there , hang in there

765
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:54,000
and so on

766
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:55,561
Hurry up and give way

767
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:57,121
Elevator

768
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:57,760
Come to the elevator

769
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,561
Give me a moment

770
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:00,020
Let people go first and let them come down .

771
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:37,980
I 'm sorry we tried our best

772
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,601
Sit here

773
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,181
OK

774
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,460
Has Dr. Xu always been so indifferent ?

775
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:50,661
He is not cold but calm

776
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:52,460
No , he didn 't .

777
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,661
That patient dies

778
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:55,161
Is it something he can 't stand ?

779
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:58,460
I 've never seen him sad .

780
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,341
I 've never seen him happy .

781
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,341
I don 't know at that time .

782
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:04,821
When I rotated my surgical practice

783
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:05,581
Why is your brain so hot

784
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:06,661
I chose Obstetrics and Gynecology

785
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,540
What if you think he 's indifferent

786
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:09,661
It 's understandable .

787
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,220
But he is a person

788
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:12,861
It is really especially suitable for being a doctor

789
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:14,260
No why

790
00:28:19,821 --> 00:28:20,800
Excuse me , everyone

791
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,540
Late

792
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,121
Dr. Chui Dr. Chui

793
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,681
Twelve hours of operation

794
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:25,780
Thank you for your hard work .

795
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:28,020
I 'll add some more dishes

796
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:30,480
Give me the menu

797
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:32,401
Cup

798
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:34,540
How about everyone

799
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,040
Patient dies

800
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,061
I know everyone

801
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:44,601
My heart is a little heavy

802
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,460
But we health care workers

803
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,321
Isn 't that what it is ?

804
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,561
Meeting life and death

805
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:49,980
Since this is ours

806
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,861
Normal life

807
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,760
We have to take it and eat it

808
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:56,020
Thank you

809
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,341
You in particular

810
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,020
Today is your first

811
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,821
Witness my own patient 's death

812
00:29:08,421 --> 00:29:10,881
It 's inevitable to be sad and gaffes

813
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,540
Including that I must let you go

814
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,621
Explanation to family members

815
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,500
I know this is hard for you

816
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,621
But this step has to be taken

817
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,500
See a lot later

818
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,300
Getting numb

819
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:26,601
For healthcare workers

820
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:27,401
It 's a good thing

821
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:28,401
Let 's not feel guilty

822
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:29,381
Own numbness

823
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:30,780
If you still can 't do it

824
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,601
Not sad

825
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:33,520
Then we will use external force to resolve it

826
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:34,381
Drinking

827
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,861
Singing

828
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,980
Dancing

829
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,980
Falling in love

830
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,000
Right

831
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,740
They all know

832
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:45,240
Let 's go again

833
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:47,440
Everything has two sides

834
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,260
We just

835
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,641
experienced a tragedy

836
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,561
But he 's also our new doctor

837
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:58,980
A time to face a difficult situation

838
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,121
Are you sad now

839
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:01,161
Are you sad

840
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,760
Very good

841
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,101
Accept it

842
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:06,641
Remember it

843
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:09,341
Transform it into your power

844
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,661
This is all of our health care workers

845
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,621
The power of rescuing the wounded and dying

846
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:21,260
Dr. Xu , let 's have a drink

847
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:22,561
That 's right

848
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,980
Come and do it

849
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,720
Cheers Cheers

850
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:27,760
Refuel

851
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,561
What 's the matter ? I 'll take you a taxi

852
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,321
No No

853
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,240
My house is right over there

854
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,081
I 'll walk back by myself

855
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:58,460
That line

856
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,800
Come on

857
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,841
Thank you , Dr. Xu

858
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:02,561
Come on , come on

859
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:03,881
Let 's go

860
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:04,960
Let 's go

861
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,581
Bye bye bye bye bye

862
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,940
See you tomorrow

863
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,881
Bye bye

864
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,841
Two Two Three Four

865
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:53,881
Three two three four

866
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,821
Four Two Three Four

867
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:08,960
Gu Yunsu

868
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,361
Are you okay

869
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:11,561
I 'm fine

870
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,740
You sit

871
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:15,681
I have something to talk to you .

872
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,000
I want to say I 'm sorry

873
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:23,681
I can 't take care of Aunt Wu .

874
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:24,821
What happened to my mom

875
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:26,321
Your mother is fine

876
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,280
It 's me

877
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:30,641
I am quitting my job

878
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:32,700
Why

879
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,181
I simply

880
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:39,700
Not able to be a doctor

881
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,700
I don 't deserve to be a doctor at all

882
00:32:46,061 --> 00:32:46,681
Drunk

883
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,101
Do I look drunk

884
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:50,901
I 'm telling you I 'm

885
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:54,161
Calm and wise

886
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,341
I installed it

887
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:57,000
I have been a doctor for ten years

888
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,181
I still can 't learn it .

889
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:03,141
I 'm still feeling very bad

890
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,200
Why are you so nice ?

891
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,681
Why are you so nice ?

892
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:15,480
If I could be faster today

893
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,381
Faster

894
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:18,561
I can 't save her either

895
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,681
I don 't know what to do

896
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
I don 't know what to do

897
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,960
I 'm really not suitable for being a doctor .

898
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,720
I said you should get used to it

899
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,401
Looking down on life and death

900
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:35,101
You should be numb

901
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:37,381
I can 't learn it myself

902
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:40,240
I can 't cry

903
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,081
I am a sunny and cheerful boy

904
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:44,401
I can 't cry

905
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:47,401
I 'm going to travel around the world

906
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,000
Except for medicine

907
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,300
I can 't do anything , I

908
00:33:58,861 --> 00:34:00,141
Let me share it with you

909
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:01,681
Is my travel plan good ?

910
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:02,480
OK

911
00:34:04,061 --> 00:34:06,940
335833

912
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,960
I didn 't hear

913
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:12,000
Help me keep this secret

914
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,960
I 'll show you .

915
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,081
This is my first time

916
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,021
Where you want to go after resigning

917
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,041
This is me

918
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,681
Where you want to go for the second time

919
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,260
This is my third time

920
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:23,360
Actually every time

921
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,740
You can only go to one place

922
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,641
But too many times I

923
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,181
I can only choose to travel around the world

924
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,061
Our dean for one quarter

925
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:37,481
I can only resign once

926
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,840
You can only apply once a quarter

927
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,161
I ran out

928
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,481
What should I do ?

929
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:47,840
Come home

930
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:49,141
Go home and sleep

931
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,420
Wake up and everything will be fine

932
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:53,521
I won 't go home until I go home

933
00:34:55,121 --> 00:34:56,240
I 'm not going home

934
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,161
Don 't leave me alone

935
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,041
Don 't leave me alone

936
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,581
Is it good ?

937
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:03,661
I don 't want to be alone

938
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:14,101
You know Dr. Xu

939
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:15,061
That dance was good yesterday

940
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:19,141
He doesn 't usually do this

941
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:19,740
That 's right

942
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,601
Dr. Xu

943
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:23,601
Early

944
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,661
Dr. Xu

945
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,101
That

946
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:32,581
What 's the problem ?

947
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:33,661
This

948
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,101
Know Know

949
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:36,181
Change this

950
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:37,061
This is moved here

951
00:35:37,581 --> 00:35:38,101
OK

952
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,360
Dr. Xu

953
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,461
Did you rest well last night

954
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:46,641
OK

955
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:49,740
Let 's have some water

956
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,181
Don 't be too stressed

957
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:53,740
Is that throat okay ?

958
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:55,700
It 's okay , it 's okay

959
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,501
That waist waist waist

960
00:35:58,501 --> 00:35:59,340
My waist is fine .

961
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:02,260
It 's okay

962
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,661
Dr. Xu , I 'm busy .

963
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:09,061
Hey , where are you ?

964
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:11,320
I 'll send you an address

965
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,641
Will you come over now

966
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,961
You are here

967
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,900
Come on

968
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,981
Come on sisters

969
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:23,300
Can we dance together ?

970
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:24,260

Really

995
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:23,541
The common reason is

00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:42,380
Fetal movement or something

I I didn 't understand

1008
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,740

Don 't worry too much

1016
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,780
It will grow back later

Dr. Xiao Xu

00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:21,461
Not big enough

1028
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,300

Look at him

1037
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:40,961
He looks at you

1038
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:41,661
In this look

1039
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:42,820
There seems to be content

1040
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,920
Your eyes are not very good

1041
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,840
What about this content

1042
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,200
It can be to see a lover

1043
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,920
You can also look at your enemy

1044
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:51,800
One is drawing .

00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,420

We have become enemies in just two days .

1047
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:59,481
It looks like it 's going quite fast .

1048
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:02,121
I caught his pigtails

1049
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:03,400

1050
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:05,220
Tell me about it

1051
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:09,461
Is he chasing you or you chasing him

1052
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:13,561
Tell me about it .

1053
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,581

00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:37,340
I 'm sorry

1057
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,041
I thought you meant please come in

1058
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,360
I don 't see you

1059
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
Sorry

1060
00:39:48,141 --> 00:39:48,840
Indeed not

1061
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:51,441
Don 't worry .

1062
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:52,641
I 'll hold it for you here

1063
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,521
Why did you come to see me ?

1064
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,561
I didn 't see you in the cafeteria .

1065
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:58,081
I have surgery

1066
00:39:58,441 --> 00:39:59,720
Did your operation go well

1067
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:00,800
Good

1068
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,461
That 's fine

1069
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:04,240
Or you 'll have to dance again

1070
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,541
Originally

1071
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:15,820
The last thing I want is you

1072
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,681
See my side

1073
00:40:19,081 --> 00:40:19,880
Why

1074
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,481
Very naive

1075
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:22,561
I 'm not asking you

1076
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:24,521
Why do you want me to see the last ?

1077
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:34,720
Because you are my patient 's family

1078
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:39,200
When I first touched you

1079
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,320
I think you are calm and restrained

1080
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:42,280
This person

1081
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,800
There seems to be no flaws

1082
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:45,441
But now

1083
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:46,681
I feel like you

1084
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:49,521
A little within reach

1085
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,161
Can I trouble you with something

1086
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:53,720
Don 't make fun of me again

1087
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,920
Really childish

1088
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:55,981
No way

1089
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:58,200
Which one of us is more naive ?

1090
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,240
You 're really annoying

1091
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:03,920
You 're really like

1092
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,601
In that class

1093
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:05,720
The most annoying boy

1094
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,001
Holding on to the girl 's braid

1095
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:08,720
Hate
