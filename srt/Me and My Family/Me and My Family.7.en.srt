00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,480
Hi

2
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:30,480
Mei Mei

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,259
You still have more than two months left

4
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,259
It 's about to give birth

5
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,300
I want to come and see you .

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,039
Mom

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,259
I 'm fine

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,579
I 'm fine

9
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,700
You don 't need to come .

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,319
I wanted me to come over

11
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,340
I can help you with that

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,620
I can do your laundry

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,300
Then cook

14
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:49,599
When you finish giving birth

15
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:50,739
Confinement is out

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,499
I 'll be back

17
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:53,440
Mom

18
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:54,720
I

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,459
I 'm fine .

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,660
You don 't use

21
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,319
I know

22
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,900
I 'm pregnant with this baby

23
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,700
You feel very uncomfortable .

24
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:04,919
Both you and my dad think

25
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:05,959
I lost your people

26
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,419
Right

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,220
Why are you here ?

28
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,419
You 're not happy when you come .

29
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:13,859
In my heart

30
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:15,380
Very uncomfortable as well

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,320
We don 't have to force it

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,900
Right

33
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:21,639
All right

34
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,779
Let 's just leave it like that

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,139
I 'm fine

36
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,999
2706712

37
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,139
Message

38
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Born or not

39
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,880
When available

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,180
Call me back quickly

41
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,380
Please call more times

42
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,180
Thank you

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,100
Mom 's okay

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,019
Alright

45
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,460
Don 't fight .

46
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,519
The opposite side must be busy .

47
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,219
I 'm free

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,460
Kangqi will call back

49
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,579
That 's right

50
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:17,940
Don 't worry too much

51
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,139
It must be fine .

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,060
You haven 't had a baby and you don 't understand

53
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:25,639
Having a child

54
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,760
The dangerous person is in the delivery room

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,260
The panicked person is outside the delivery room

56
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,899
How dangerous is it

57
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,540
Only Time

58
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,760
I can 't persuade or stop

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,160
I watched

60
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,139
I can only look at her

61
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:40,339
Go into the dangerous area

62
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,700
If I could

63
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,299
Just stay with her .

64
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:50,899
All right , all right

65
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,899
Don 't think so much .

66
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,899
She would rather face it herself

67
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,739
You don 't want me to accompany you either

68
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,060
How much do you think she hates me

69
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,380
I 'll do it

70
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:15,339
Hi

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,620
Mei Mei

72
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:44,579
Susu

73
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:48,519
Lai Xiaoyan

74
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,139
Eat a poached egg

75
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,380
And your father

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,440
Grandma 's own

77
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,920
Xiaoyan

78
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,800
Give this soup bowl to Grandma

79
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,200
Grandma serves you soup

80
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,079
Jianxiong

81
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,159
Mom , I 'll do it myself

82
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:06,479
I 'm fine , fine

83
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,860
OK

84
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,079
Mei Mei , give me the bowl

85
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,680
This is so rich .

86
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Mom is going to the market today

87
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,000
Buy a lot of things

88
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,680
Fortunately , we went to meet us .

89
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,599
Otherwise , it cannot be carried

90
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,760
Thank you for your hard work , Ma

91
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,639
No hard work

92
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,700
Take care of your own daughter

93
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,079
What 's the hard work ?

94
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:32,479
Xiaoyan that

95
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,599
Take grandma 's fish soup .

96
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:36,519
Drink it

97
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,200
Grandma is old

98
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,920
Gastrointestinal digestion is not moving

99
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:40,860
Thank you , Grandma

100
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,899
You 're welcome

101
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,979
Eat

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,360
Mom

103
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,639
This is more than just

104
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,920
Take care of Mei Mei

105
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,479
You took care of us

106
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,079
A family of all sizes

107
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,120
Do you want to eat the meat ?

108
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,440
I 'm eating .

109
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,399
That 's right

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,579
Mom

111
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,800
I have to give you the grocery money

112
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,079
Why is this family talking about money ?

113
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,719
This is a bit outsider

114
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:05,560
This is not

115
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,979
I have retirement pay

116
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:09,360
You cannot contribute money and effort at the same time

117
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,760
Mom , please accept it

118
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,479
I feel at ease after accepting him .

119
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,440
Transferred it to you

120
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,200
Eat Eat

121
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,300
Let Li Jianxiong eat quickly

122
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,339
Then I 'll accept it

123
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,920
More refund and less replenish

124
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
I got it for you .

125
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:21,760
This Susu

126
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,639
Mom

127
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,479
I brought you a red bean soup

128
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,159
I 'm afraid you won 't have enough .

129
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:29,940
I 'm full I

130
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,219
The old man

131
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,700
How much appetite can you have ?

132
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,440
I 'll put it here first .

133
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,000
Eat when I 'm hungry later

134
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:42,680
What are you doing ?

135
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:43,880
Bookkeeping

136
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,760
Mom

137
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:51,560
Let me discuss something with you .

138
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,440
We will unify the specifications in the future

139
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,760
They all eat the same food

140
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,200
Differential treatment is not good

141
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,339
Jianxiong snitched .

142
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,719
None

143
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,260
You

144
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:06,860
Eggs in the fridge

145
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,959
It 's different

146
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,079
You make two pots of fish soup as well

147
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,639
Who doesn 't think much about it ?

148
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,240
Then I 'm also for

149
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,800
Consider this family

150
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,079
Xiaoyan

151
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,060
That half - big boy will eat me to death

152
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:24,779
Right

153
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:25,740
The one on the table

154
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,399
The energy of eating

155
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,639
It 's pretty scary .

156
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,320
Like fleeing

157
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,339
You are now

158
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,320
There was no job just now , right ?

159
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,420
Susu Ma Now

160
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,760
There is no source of income for the time being

161
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,440
That 's not open source

162
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,279
Then I will calculate horizontally and vertically

163
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,120
I just thought about it

164
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,519
Then only throttling is possible

165
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,060
Mom

166
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,620
We 're not at home

167
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,000
Is the situation special

168
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,399
You just have a bowl of water .

169
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,959
Are you fair or not

170
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,719
Everyone is very sensitive

171
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,880
Li Jianxiong is not already

172
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,060
Did I give you living expenses ?

173
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,839
Anyway , we will

174
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,880
Just treat everyone equally

175
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,300
Wu Limei

176
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,760
What do you mean by that ?

177
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,440
Do you think

178
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,000
I feel sorry for my money

179
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,599
Then I skimmed them both

180
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,159
No No No

181
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,279
That 's not what I meant

182
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,539
What do you mean ?

183
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:10,979
I

184
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,279
I 'll say

185
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,639
You are always selfish

186
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,560
You said you eat eggs , right ?

187
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,500
That between Li Yan and Su Su

188
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,019
The food is different

189
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,279
Li Jianxiong and I eat

190
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,380
It 's not the same .

191
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,500
Then what if someone sees it ?

192
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:25,719
What do you think ?

193
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,039
People will be chilling .

194
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,719
This matter can 't stand thinking .

195
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,060
Then why do you think about it ?

196
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,659
You said

197
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,680
Still chilling

198
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,760
What you say is so unconscious .

199
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,620
That Susu is your daughter

200
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,680
Then I feel distressed

201
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,639
I feel sorry for Susu

202
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,019
Isn 't it just sorry for you ?

203
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,640
Is Xiaoyan not enough to eat

204
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:40,920
Yes No

205
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,239
From inside my mouth

206
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,759
Save food for him

207
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,599
I didn 't say

208
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,959
From his father 's mouth

209
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,280
Save it for him .

210
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:48,160
That 's right

211
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,219
My bowl of water is not even .

212
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,739
But if I 'm missing

213
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:54,119
I 'll make up for it .

214
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,599
You wouldn 't do it

215
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,640
What are you doing here

216
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,719
Raising a teacher to ask for crimes

217
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,339
Not

218
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,440
I 'm not fine

219
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,800
Talking to you

220
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,920
The problem is that you didn 't say nice things

221
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:03,599
Right

222
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,219
You said that

223
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,719
We can 't talk , okay ?

224
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,320
Then let 's not talk about it .

225
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,579
I was wrong

226
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,839
You two stop fighting here

227
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,780
Your blood pressure for a while

228
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,619
Up again

229
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,339
Don 't I serve you red bean paste ?

230
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:29,040
Eat or not

231
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,420
You try it

232
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,119
I don 't eat it

233
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,119
It 's delicious

234
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,339
Why are you wronged ?

235
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,239
Let me see

236
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:48,160
I don 't I don 't

237
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,959
Come on , let me see , let me see

238
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,119
I 'm so wronged

239
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,160
I 'm so wronged

240
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,940
I 'm so wronged

241
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,820
Don 't , don 't move .

242
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,800
It 's beautiful with pear blossoms and rain

243
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,259
Let me see

244
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,780
Whose old lady brings rain with pear blossoms

245
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,839
It 's so beautiful .

246
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,140
What are you doing ?

247
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,759
All right , all right , all right

248
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,499
Don 't be angry with her anymore .

249
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:28,040
I 'm not angry with her

250
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,140
She is pregnant

251
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,640
What 's there to worry about

252
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,640
Are you wronged ?

253
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,200
None

254
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,759
I keep accounts

255
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:52,099
Mom

256
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,680
You wander around

257
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
I can 't pee

258
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:56,579
You are melodramatic

259
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,079
Don 't lock the door

260
00:10:58,339 --> 00:10:59,599
In case anything happens

261
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:00,959
I can break in

262
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:02,719
Don 't break into the door .

263
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,040
All right

264
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,180
You 're not that good .

265
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:05,040
In case you

266
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,560
You sit on the toilet

267
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,940
You suddenly stand up

268
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,640
My eyes are dark and I faint

269
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,859
If your feet are numb

270
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:12,479
You slipped on your feet

271
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,160
I can 't

272
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,020
Did you rush in with a stride

273
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,879
Don 't curse me , okay ?

274
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,479
Then at least I 'm out there .

275
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:18,259
I can give it to you

276
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,619
Delivery paper or something .

277
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,400
Row Row Row

278
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,479
Hurry up and hand me a piece of paper

279
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,200
OK

280
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,099
I 'll take it

281
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:24,680
I take

282
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,660
Mei Mei , you 're a shit

283
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,759
Still urinating

284
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:31,119
Mom

285
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,160
Is it big or small

286
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:35,560
Mom

287
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,420
This This

288
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,239
I 've gone all the big and small .

289
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,280
If you didn 't

290
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,400
What are you doing in there ?

291
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,619
Then this this

292
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:45,759
What are you doing here ?

293
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,400
You can 't drink water here .

294
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,680
Let 's go to the toilet now

295
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,079
Not

296
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,020
You need to be careful

297
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,800
What I told my mother

298
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,479
Mom can be a

299
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,680
Reasonable calculation

300
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,479
We can prevent it in case

301
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,920
So are you big or young ?

302
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:56,979
Before going

303
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:58,560
It 's not born .

304
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,879
Is it big or small

305
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,680
You 've been talking for a long time

306
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,160
You still didn 't tell me

307
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:05,239
Is it big or small ?

308
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,599
Are you thirsty ?

309
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,640
I just made a pot of tea

310
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,339
Mom

311
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:11,560
At this time

312
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,479
I usually don 't drink anything .

313
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,180
Tea at the door of this toilet

314
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,520
What 's this ?

315
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:18,999
Delicious

316
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:19,379
Delicious

317
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,400
Delicious , delicious , delicious

318
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,859
Exciting

319
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,499
Mei Mei

320
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,359
You turned off the air conditioner

321
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:31,479
I didn 't turn it off

322
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:32,800
You closed it

323
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,839
I didn 't turn it off

324
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,040
Is it my mother ?

325
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:37,800
Impossible

326
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,040
The remote control is

327
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,999
I 'm here

328
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:41,780
The air conditioner in that house

329
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,540
Is a brand

330
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,479
The remote controller can be universal

331
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:46,839
Impossible

332
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:47,920
You think too much

333
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,359
Sleep , sleep

334
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,180
Mei Mei

335
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,479
You are

00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,540

00:12:59,379 --> 00:12:59,999
I understand

338
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,759
Within 20 minutes

339
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,800
All is OK

340
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,359
Don 't work hard .

341
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:07,280
I 'm very gentle . Don 't worry

342
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,339
Mom , bring me a roll paper

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,280
OK , I 'll do it right away

345
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:20,959
How about

346
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,160
Shit

347
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,599
What is the form

348
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,920
Describe it to me

349
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,879
Very good Very good

350
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,400
It 's normal

351
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,800
The color is also normal

352
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,259
Come here for you

353
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:35,400
I have one thing to do now

354
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,119
It 's painful

355
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:36,719
You know that

356
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,400
Now I go to the bathroom every time

357
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,959
I have to look at the shit

358
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,619
It 's just me , I won 't go to see it

359
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:43,739
I can 't report it to you either

360
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,680
This is related to you

361
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,520
What about your physical condition ?

362
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,079
You have to take a look

363
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,680
If you are constipated

364
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,900
Then I 'll have to give you some more .

365
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,800
This green bean

366
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,859
If it is not formed

367
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:55,200
I 'm going to add red beans to you .

368
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,320
I don 't want to see it

369
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,119
You 're looking at your own

370
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,759
It doesn 't depend on anyone else .

371
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,239
Something to watch

372
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,759
What 's wrong

373
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,280
Turn on the air conditioner

374
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,079
Sleep

375
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,820
Wait , I 'm anxious

376
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,280
What are you doing

377
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,920
Mom made you do this

378
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,640
Jianxiong

379
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,680
You 're back

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:53,759
This This

381
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,680
Is she severely infertile ?

382
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Vomiting and dizzy

383
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,479
I searched on the Internet

384
00:14:58,839 --> 00:14:59,759
A folk remedy

385
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,739
Multi - pronged approach

386
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,520
Try

387
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,320
What is the effect of Mei Mei

388
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,520
Stop vomiting

389
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,599
This is pretty good .

390
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,560
What do you mean it 's ten o'clock ?

391
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,379
Ten o'clock

392
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,719
Turn off the lights and the book says you 're happy

393
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:13,640
Children are happy when TV is turned off

394
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,879
Turn off the TV

395
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,140
Don 't mention pregnant women in the book

396
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,520
Go to bed early and wake up late to take care of your health

397
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,859
Okay , okay , Jianxiong

398
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:20,999
You should learn to cooperate

399
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:21,479
OK OK

400
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:22,099
Fit

401
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:23,060
Yes , yes , yes , help her .

402
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,020
Okay , come on , slow down

403
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:24,879
Get Up

404
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,800
Go to bed quickly

405
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,420
OK

406
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,599
I drink black chicken and lotus seed soup today

407
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:35,280
What are you laughing at ?

408
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,719
I heard it

409
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,280
Someone has been angry recently

410
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,999
No wonder this anger is not good .

411
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,320
Mom , I 'll bring this over .

412
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,119
No need to wait

413
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,040
Mom

414
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,180
Didn 't I say everything ?

415
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:49,119
This is not the same as this

416
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,879
Can we all eat the same food ?

417
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,040
I worked hard

418
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
What are you doing for ?

419
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,119
And you picked it

420
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:55,879
Do you like to eat or not

421
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,339
Grandma , stop eating .

422
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,499
Okay , eat it

423
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:02,440
That

424
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,839
Poached Egg

425
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,200
Eat Eat

426
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:07,339
Mei Mei Ya

427
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,440
This is yours

428
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:10,079
Xiao Yan Lai

429
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:11,359
Let 's do it ourselves

430
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,440
OK OK

431
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,060
That Susu

432
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,119
You eat this of me

433
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,800
I can 't eat such an expensive egg

434
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,219
Come

435
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,900
Susu helps me serve soup

436
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,440
This is for your mother

437
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,859
OK

438
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:28,079
Mei Mei

439
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,320
This bowl is yours

440
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:31,020
Your

441
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:32,239
Let me serve it

442
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,879
Li Jianxiong , please drink my bowl

443
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,160
Not

444
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,400
Jianxiong 's bowl is here

445
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,119
I 'm in Sheng

446
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:36,640
All right , Mom

447
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:37,900
Yes Yes Yes

448
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,599
Let him drink this from me

449
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,040
I 'll just drink this .

450
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,719
This is yours

451
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:45,280
Jianxiong Lai

452
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,479
Xiaoyan

453
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,020
Did you give it to Xiaoyan ?

454
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,119
Let 's eat .

455
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:51,060
I I

456
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,420
I 'll go to serve my meal first . I 'm hungry .

457
00:16:59,079 --> 00:16:59,759
I won 't eat it

458
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,839
Troubling everyone

459
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,739
Why ? No , no

460
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:03,800
What are you doing ?

461
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,239
I don 't want to eat it

462
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,920
That 's your real mother

463
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,079
Can you talk nicely

464
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,820
What attitude

465
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,339
I 'm still your mother .

466
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,319
Wu Limei , what are you doing ?

467
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:17,959
What kind of young lady temper are you doing

468
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:18,799
Then my grandma

469
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,299
The soup I worked so hard to cook for you

470
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,100
You didn 't eat a bite of the meal you cooked .

471
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,999
It really is

472
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,479
What kind of young lady temper do you have ?

473
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,200
I said I didn 't eat or didn 't eat .

474
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,299
OK OK OK

475
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:27,420
You come out and drink the soup

476
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:27,759
Line

477
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,479
It 's annoying

478
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,259
OK , sit down and eat first

479
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,100
You 're used to it

480
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,499
Eat a chicken leg

481
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,459
Grandma

482
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,920
Don 't take it too seriously .

483
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,380
You said you two

484
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,959
It 's been decades

485
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,499
This day of swords and swords

486
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:14,680
At this time

487
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,059
There 's no way to reverse it

488
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:17,999
Isn 't it the same with my mother ?

489
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:18,680
Between me and her

490
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,259
There are still many unsolved problems

491
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,580
She doesn 't appreciate it and I receive it

492
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:23,499
She doesn 't understand you

493
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:24,479
I understand you .

494
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,819
You and I are on the same side

495
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,459
Sweet mouth

496
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,420
But that 's how she talks

497
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:33,979
Not sounding good

498
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,259
I guess it 's also genetic

499
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,600
I still love you in my heart

500
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,380
Why don 't we talk about intergenerational relatives

501
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,860
I 'll kiss you

502
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,979
We 're good .

503
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:42,539
Ignore her

504
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:47,620
That

505
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,299
I 'll go in

506
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,819
I 'll bring you a thick dress .

507
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,180
Mom

508
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:06,940
I 'm fine

509
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,900
Go your business

510
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:13,559
Today

511
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,219
Mei Mei

512
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:18,860
Ever since she was pregnant

513
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,979
She 's quite picky .

514
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Probably today

515
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,559
The chicken soup is a little too oily

516
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,219
That 's why she lost a little temper

517
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:28,660
It 's not a matter of oil or not

518
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:32,660
You saw it anyway

519
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,100
My little thoughts

520
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,259
I don 't want to hide it from you either

521
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,340
She thinks I treat you hard .

522
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,940
She feels sorry for you

523
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:44,259
That

524
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,380
There 's no harsh treatment ?

525
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,779
You are biased towards Susu

526
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:49,739
Slant to Meimei

527
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:50,440
That 's not

528
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,140
A matter of course

529
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,160
I 'm good to Susu

530
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,979
It 's also sincere .

531
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:56,400
No matter how good

532
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:59,180
Then more or less in my heart

533
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,319
That still has to be calculated for Li Yan

534
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,259
More

535
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,979
They 're all parents .

536
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,519
Na Na

537
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,959
Be partial to your own children

538
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,900
Isn 't that normal ?

539
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,819
Jianxiong I actually am

540
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,539
I really like you

541
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:13,779
I treat you like my own family

542
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:14,739
But Mei Mei

543
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:16,219
She is on me after all

544
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:17,620
A piece of meat that fell down

545
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:18,900
Mei Mei 's

546
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,180
I 'm sure I want the best for her

547
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,019
Of course I understand this

548
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:25,019
You understand that she may not understand

549
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,100
She also understands

550
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:32,440
Look at us all

551
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,999
Living in the same house

552
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,660
It 's difficult for her to be caught in the middle .

553
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:38,819
But she knew

554
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:39,580
How is she

555
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,380
You don 't really get angry with her

556
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,539
Really competing with her

557
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,360
Are you giving me a high hat ?

558
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,319
Then she is always

559
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,779
Trouble caused by progestogen

560
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,080
After Mom

561
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,519
Please be more bearable .

562
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,779
His own daughter

563
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:53,299
I can handle whatever I want

564
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:55,759
It 's you

565
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:58,360
You 're going to live with her for the rest of your life

566
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,519
You have to be more bearable

567
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,019
Then I should .

568
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,840
Lai Ma

569
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:04,680
Coming Branch

570
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,519
I , I , I

571
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,100
I don 't smoke anymore

572
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,019
You should smoke less too

573
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,620
This is the only one

574
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,759
The last one

575
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:17,719
I quit tomorrow

576
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:21,580
This second - hand smoke

577
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,080
You want to dye this hair inside

578
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,340
I smell all over my body

579
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:28,900
It 's not good to bring it in

580
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,120
Your room is quite warm

581
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,200
Did you go to our ladies ' room

582
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,019
Yes No

583
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,019
Yes , yes , that 's the expression

584
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,279
I just saw our ladies ' room

585
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,140
When you spoil me

586
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,160
This is my expression

587
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,459
One men 's toilet and one women 's toilet

588
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:00,360
It is agreed that the well water will not violate the river water

589
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Why do you just

590
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,459
You have to waste it

591
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:03,400
Where 's our ladies ' room

592
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:04,200
Are you a dog

593
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:05,860
Did you learn the territory from a dog ?

594
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,620
Sorry

595
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,940
I just spoke

596
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,219
A little too much , isn 't it ?

597
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,880
I 'll go clean the toilet

598
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,200
OK

599
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,360
That won 't happen again .

600
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,680
I couldn 't fix that men 's room .

601
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,259
I 'll just say it

602
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:22,759
I 'll accompany you .

603
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,479
Leave it to me

604
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,759
The first time was a little uncomfortable

605
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,080
Just let me get used to it .

606
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,340
Is it OK

607
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,420
Can you do it

608
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,739
Can 't get in

609
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,340
Let 's not care about the toilet today

610
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:09,900
All right

611
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,519
Find someone to report repair tomorrow

612
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,259
I will pay the money

613
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,200
Leave it alone

614
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,160
I can 't stand it anymore

615
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,999
Grandma

616
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,360
Are you cold ?

617
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,160
My room is a little cold

618
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,059
Grandma

619
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,799
I want to pat

620
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,700
How old are you

621
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,799
You still need to pat

622
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:48,620
I want to pat

623
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,559
You 're not sleeping

624
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,840
Why are you ignoring me

625
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,299
You should go to bed early in the future

626
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,299
Do you know

627
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:20,039
Grandma , I want to pat it

628
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:25,759
Pat , pat , pat , pat .

629
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,120
It 's our Susu Hao

630
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,440
Susu Guai

631
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:58,900
What 's wrong

632
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:02,380
I think I heard something .

633
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:04,140
There is no movement .

634
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,380
Mei Mei

635
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:11,219
Meimei , what 's wrong with you

636
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:12,819
Mei Mei

637
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,100
What 's wrong with you

638
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:17,759
This supper today is really

639
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,580
There 's nothing wrong with it

640
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
I 'm so uncomfortable

641
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,059
No

642
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,180
Everyone eats the same thing

643
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,340
We 're all fine

644
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:26,779
This is a pregnancy reaction , right ?

645
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,380
Is everything okay ?

646
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:29,299
It 's fine

647
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:31,059
You can only endure it slowly .

648
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:33,420
Here

649
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,340
Let me look over your side

650
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,860
And

651
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:37,580
Mom

652
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,580
Are you smoking ?

653
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,100
I didn 't .

654
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:45,999
On your head

655
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,340
It smells like cigarettes .

656
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:50,479
Mom

657
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,860
Do you know this second - hand smoke

658
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,940
To me and Xiaobao

659
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,739
How harmful is it ?

660
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,819
That means you are my mother .

661
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,299
If it is Li Jianxiong

662
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,700
I wouldn 't let him into the room .

663
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,860
I 'll go wash my hair

664
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,440
Mom

665
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,380
Come , come , come , come

666
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,100
Let me tell you

667
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,420
Mom

668
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,180
I 'm not here to settle old scores with you .

669
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,739
I 'll do it for a while .

670
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,459
I think

671
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:14,739
You took good care of me

672
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,180
Right

673
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,200
I reach out to my clothes

674
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,100
Open your mouth when you come with food

675
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:19,059
Have a good time

676
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,380
But don 't you feel it

677
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,580
Living habits of the two of us

678
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,140
It 's different

679
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,200
This person and his habits

680
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,739
is very important

681
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,380
Every day , you say

682
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:36,979
The more I 'm afraid of

683
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,219
The more you get

684
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,019
The more I care about

685
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,200
The less you do

686
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,180
I 'm worried every day

687
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,940
You know that

688
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,860
There isn 't a day that I 'm not afraid .

689
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:48,539
There isn 't a day that I don 't get nervous

690
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,219
I don 't have a day at ease

691
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:50,660
Mom

692
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,259
I just wanted to ask this

693
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,979
Why are you here

694
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:57,299
Take care of me .

695
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:58,539
Without you to take care of

696
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:00,219
Actually , I 'm doing fine

697
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:00,959
I can put myself

698
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,340
Very well taken care of

699
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:03,499
Why are you

700
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,840
You have to take care of me

701
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,299
Mom

702
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,299
It 's my fault

703
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:21,979
I didn 't mean to

704
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,219
Go in

705
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,900
I 'm holding you and watching the steps

706
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,299
Then you should go to bed early .

707
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:22,620
Mom

708
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:25,299
You fixed the toilet

709
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,779
Small Questions

710
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,239
Look at the bathroom

711
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,180
It 's so neat

712
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,459
I 'm sorry , this is

713
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,779
Then leave it

714
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:33,580
I 'll come , I 'll come

715
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:38,999
Mei Mei

716
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,140
Breakfast is ready

717
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:42,779
Rise and eat

718
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,999
Hungry will cause hypoglycemia

719
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,319
You can 't afford it

720
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,459
Su Su ah

721
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:52,959
Why

722
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,219
Grandma wrestled later

723
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,719
Grandma told you

724
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:58,100
Take up your time

725
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,239
I want to see you today

726
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,900
Your mother 's attending doctor

727
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,900
Dr. Xu

728
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,700
That 's right

729
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,900
I have to catch up with the draft today

730
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,900
In two days

731
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,580
I 'll take you there in two days .

732
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:10,979
In two days

733
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:14,380
No , it must be today

734
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,479
Tell you about Grandma

735
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,140
Delay Today Tomorrow

736
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,219
Tomorrow will be delayed

737
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:20,660
I have to go today

738
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,819
Did you hear it

739
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,759
I 'm going to get in there .

740
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,420
I 'm going to get in .

741
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,779
I did this myself

742
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Replenishing Qi and Nourishing Body

743
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,479
I think you doctors

744
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:36,499
Stay up late

745
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:37,499
Suitable

746
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,340
Thank you , Grandma

747
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,719
But our hospital has rules

748
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:40,759
I can 't accept it

749
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:42,340
I 'm not

750
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,580
I don 't mean anything else

751
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,459
Dr. Xiao Xu

752
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,380
My daughter is older

753
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,940
I 'm worried about her pregnancy

754
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,840
I hope you can

755
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,940
Please take care of me

756
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:50,819
Grandma

757
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,299
The hospital does not allow admission

758
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:53,160
I gave him that last time

759
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,180
Extra delicious beef jerky

760
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,979
He didn 't want it .

761
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:55,900
Let 's do this

762
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:57,660
After all , it was made by my elders .

763
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,140
Why don 't you try some pieces

764
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:00,259
Is it a thought

765
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,180
Okay , then I 'll take a few .

766
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:03,940
Thank you , Grandma

767
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,459
I will do my best

768
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,180
How are you ?

769
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:10,459
Did your relationship with your mother ease ?

770
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:12,739
That 's what my mom and I do

771
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:13,779
Live your life

772
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,660
I was in front of Aunt Wu last time

773
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,380
I praise you

774
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,259
Which time ?

775
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:20,779
That time when you opened your five fingers to go to confinement

776
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:32,019
No wonder

777
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,559
You , mother and daughter

778
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,700
A lot of ease

779
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,779
It 's Dr. Xu .

780
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:39,700
You 're so understanding

781
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,299
None

782
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,499
Do you have a girlfriend

783
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,479
I don 't have a girlfriend

784
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,380
You see , I 'm really old and confused

785
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:46,799
You 're so good

786
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,200
It should be that

787
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,380
Married , right ?

788
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:50,580
Grandma

789
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:51,739
Let 's go now

790
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:53,360
Dr. Xu still has a job .

791
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,799
Not you

792
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,739
Add a WeChat message , you two

793
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:00,259
It wasn 't me , I wanted to

794
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:00,840
In case you say

795
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,360
There is an emergency at home

796
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,900
I I don 't know what to do

797
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,100
I 'm afraid of being blind

798
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:06,479
Is it convenient

799
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:07,620
Convenient

800
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:08,739
If it is convenient , then add

801
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,400
Add

802
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,660
Add WeChat

803
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,180
Let me scan you

804
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:15,979
OK

805
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,059
Dr. Xiao Xu

806
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:26,940
Did you get your friend application ?

807
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,779
You two know very well

808
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,319
It 's hard to talk about familiarity .

809
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,779
Isn 't it just about my mother ?

810
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,779
Can be familiar

811
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:41,739
Okay , I know .

812
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:43,319
I 'll make a good relationship

813
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,620
For your Mei Mei

814
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:45,819
I mean

815
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:47,819
Familiarity in all directions

816
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,039
Ms. Zhao

817
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:53,680
What are you doing

818
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,580
You red line

819
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,259
He came to me

820
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,459
You 're still worried about me

821
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,900
Please leave me alone

822
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,519
I 'm telling you I

823
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,900
We just broke up , right ?

824
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,840
This ex boyfriend

825
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,420
It 's not cool in my heart yet

826
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,259
From time to time

827
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,059
I can still remember

828
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,299
His voice and smile

829
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,200
Very sad

830
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,940
Don 't worry about it .

831
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:16,779
Be prepared

832
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,959
Whose is it ? Is it yours

833
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,180
Take a look

834
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:23,380
Yes , Dr. Xu

835
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,100
I don 't want to see it

836
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,580
Well , if you don 't look at me , I 'll help you

837
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,180
OK , OK

838
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,140
I see I see

839
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,380
Yes No

840
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,299
You 're so gossip . Let me take a look .

841
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:32,400
Yes

842
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,940
Good return

843
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,180
How to return properly

844
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,299
Grandma asked me to keep you on hand

845
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,779
It 's not early or late .

846
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:43,819
Lunch is just right

847
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:44,519
Come

848
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,739
That

849
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:46,840
Ma Su Su

850
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,759
Wash your hands

851
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,219
We 're serving

852
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,979
Jianxiong

853
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,580
You 're really good at crafting

854
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,059
I 'm relieved to have you taking care of Mei Mei

855
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:57,979
I 'll do it

856
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,279
Mei Mei

857
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:00,580
It 's time to eat

858
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:05,200
Rub it

859
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:06,100
I know

860
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:06,900
Mom

861
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:08,360
That is

862
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,380
This pig foot you braised today

863
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,860
I secretly tasted it .

864
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:12,779
Absolutely

865
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:14,620
She doesn 't like cooking

866
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,920
You have to pass this recipe to me

867
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,059
I 'll inherit it .

868
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,299
OK , I 'll give it a while .

869
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:22,799
I 'll write it down and send it to you

870
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:23,799
OK OK

871
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:25,860
Mom

872
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,279
What are you thinking today

873
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,459
I need to go to the hospital

874
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,900
It 's not like I didn 't see it last time

875
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,259
Doctor Xu

876
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,219
Then I guess I 'm going .

877
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,940
I have to meet someone else .

878
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,940
Visiting

879
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,200
Who is leaving

880
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:38,160
You 're leaving

881
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,259
Didn 't you say you would stay for a long time ?

882
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:42,180
You don 't take care of her when she is pregnant .

883
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:44,180
There 's something going on at my aunt 's house

884
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,959
She didn 't always want me

885
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,259
Take care of Zai Zai

886
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,420
So I thought I 'd just go over .

887
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,860
Go back and help your aunt

888
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,039
It also saves her from calling me partial

889
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:55,219
That 's also that 's also

890
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:55,799
Mom

891
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,979
Then when do you decide to leave ?

892
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,519
I booked tickets for this afternoon

893
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,900
I left this afternoon

894
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,219
What tickets did you book

895
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,100
Bus

896
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,660
Why do you book a bus ?

897
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,620
We 'll call you online ride - hailing

898
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,420
You refund your ticket

899
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,900
What is it called online car - hailing ?

900
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,459
How expensive is that ?

901
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,140
A few stops

902
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,739
We 'll be there in an hour .

903
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,120
Jianxiong

904
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,600
I 'm going to say a few words .

905
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,460
OK , you say it , you say it

906
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,239
First .

907
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,540
Mei Mei is greedy for coolness

908
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:30,660
You can 't let her blow the air conditioner .

909
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,180
Second , bend down

910
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:33,739
That big move

911
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,899
It 's really dangerous if you can 't do it .

912
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:36,500
Mom , I really can 't

913
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,319
Also go to the toilet and take a shower

914
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:41,339
Keep an eye on it

915
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,660
What if it slides or something ?

916
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,939
Don 't worry

917
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:50,620
Susu

918
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:53,439
If your Uncle Li is busy at work

919
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,980
If you don 't have time to cook

920
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,339
Learn to stew some rice

921
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,239
This pig 's claw

922
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,580
Grandma burned a lot

923
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,200
then you put it in the refrigerator

924
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,620
You can eat it for a long time

925
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:04,540
It 's best to learn how to stir - fry some vegetables

926
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,419
Meat and Vegetable Combination

927
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:07,859
Good

928
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:08,739
Clean

929
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:09,439
Can 't learn

930
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,500
You have to learn .

931
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,700
I really can 't learn

932
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,379
Are you gone ?

933
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:13,339
I 'll give you Mei Mei

934
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:14,419
Cook Instant Noodles Everyday

935
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:16,620
No

936
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:18,460
Instant noodles cannot be eaten

937
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,719
Then give it to her

938
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:20,779
Order takeout three times a day

939
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:21,919
I 'll call her in a different way

940
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,439
No

941
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,339
Then don 't go .

942
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:32,520
I 'm done .

943
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,980
Let 's eat

944
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,560
OK

945
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:37,660
Also

946
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,859
Actually , I 'm afraid you 'll be tired .

947
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:44,660
It 's also angry , right ?

948
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:53,839
Jianxiong

949
00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:55,560
That moment

950
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,180
You 're going to give me a ride

951
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,140
Well , of course .

952
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,200
We must all go

953
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,899
I gave it to you

954
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,899
I won 't send you

955
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:04,080
Eat quickly

956
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,719
Serve some soup for Mom

957
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,060
Real fragrance

958
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,779
Someone will pick you up when you get there .

959
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,560
Your sister will come

960
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,259
All this time here

961
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:21,980
Thank you for your hard work

962
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,939
Go back and rest

963
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:24,779
Let my sister take good care of you

964
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:26,859
Jianxiong

965
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,580
I put that

966
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,819
Use the remaining living expenses

967
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,339
I 'll turn the way you came .

968
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,379
Mom

969
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,460
Keep this for yourself

970
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,899
You have worked hard during this period .

971
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:36,160
Big and small inside and out

972
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,219
You also supplement a lot

973
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:38,040
How can you

974
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,399
Suffering and paying money .

975
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,980
Didn 't we agree ?

976
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,180
Refund more and make up less .

977
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,160
That 's what I 'll say

978
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,200
If you want to worry more

979
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,080
Then I 'll put the others

980
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,200
I transferred it all to you

981
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,219
This

982
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,299
Okay , I won 't be wordy .

983
00:36:51,939 --> 00:36:52,580
I accept it

984
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:55,419
Mom , let me say one more thing .

985
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:58,339
You 're still out of our minds

986
00:36:58,339 --> 00:36:59,060
There 's no way to do that

987
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,500
This is my temper .

988
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:02,939
Be strong and competitive

989
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,140
Want face

990
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,739
Some things I 've done before

991
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:07,980
Some words said

992
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:09,899
A little ruthless and a little absolute

993
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:11,660
Hurt someone 's heart

994
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,540
I don 't know .

995
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:15,899
Now I 'm old

996
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:16,739
No time either

997
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:18,419
To correct and make up for it

998
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,819
Please bear with us

999
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,259
Grandma , what did you say ?

1000
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,259
What are you saying ?

1001
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,060
I think it will take a while .

1002
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,180
Why don 't you stand in line first ?

1003
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,540
I 'll take my grandmother to sit for a while

1004
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:31,879
Okay , okay , go , go .

1005
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,060
Sit with Grandma

1006
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,779
Sit here

1007
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,480
Okay , okay , okay

1008
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,560
Almost done

1009
00:37:41,939 --> 00:37:42,739
Grandma

1010
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:47,060
Do you have a whisper to me

1011
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,140
Your mother has been losing her temper lately

1012
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:52,660
Hormone causes

1013
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:54,339
But in my opinion

1014
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:54,939
The most important

1015
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,700
Or does she have no idea in her heart ?

1016
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,140
I had you last time I was pregnant

1017
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,939
Originally held it in my hands

1018
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:02,700
A good hand

1019
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,859
Beat it up

1020
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,939
Your mother was stubborn since childhood

1021
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:08,540
You don 't like to discuss everything with me

1022
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,100
You said it was hard .

1023
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,379
Regrouping yourself after all the hard work

1024
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,219
I 'm pregnant again

1025
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:19,560
She doesn 't know either

1026
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,980
Waiting for the rest of my life

1027
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,299
What is it ?

1028
00:38:23,939 --> 00:38:24,739
Su Su ah

1029
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:27,319
Be considerate of your mother

1030
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,020
Don 't take everything seriously with her

1031
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:33,739
Line

1032
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,660
A baby with a mother is like a treasure

1033
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,540
She 's amazing

1034
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,060
Don 't worry

1035
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,640
In the future

1036
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:40,180
I 'm looking for your sake

1037
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:42,219
Shall I give her three minutes ?

1038
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:45,660
It 's too hard

1039
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,299
Then it 's my fault .

1040
00:38:51,939 --> 00:38:52,600
I 'm so old

1041
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,500
Small ones are awesome

1042
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:56,180
You go this time

1043
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,339
Can you come back soon

1044
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,819
I will miss you

1045
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:06,020
Grandma misses you too

1046
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,219
But older

1047
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,339
That 's useless

1048
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:16,419
Sometimes in my heart

1049
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:18,020
My heart is good

1050
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,620
But some things I did

1051
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,859
Sometimes it 's just not right

1052
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:21,660
All right , all right

1053
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:25,620
Always under one roof

1054
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,540
You said it was rubbing around

1055
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,540
It is inevitable that people will get annoyed

1056
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:34,100
It 's not enough to listen to her for everything

1057
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:38,620
I 'll tell you this time

1058
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,419
Why do I have to leave

1059
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:41,160
What did Wu Limei say

1060
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,100
No , I 'll ask .

1061
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,939
No , I asked her

1062
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:44,100
No No

1063
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,219
Let me tell you

1064
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:46,120
That 's Grandma

1065
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,939
I feel tired

1066
00:39:47,939 --> 00:39:49,299
I want to go back and rest

1067
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:51,319
If I want real

1068
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:52,379
If you fall down

1069
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:53,319
Nah Nah

1070
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:54,739
You , you 're waiting on me

1071
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:56,219
When I serve you , I 'll serve you .

1072
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:01,560
I told you that

1073
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,540
Even if there is

1074
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:04,899
Don 't blame her anymore

1075
00:40:04,899 --> 00:40:06,219
Don 't you say your mother

1076
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:08,020
Do you rely on being a daughter ?

1077
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,660
She 's used to being arrogant with me .

1078
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,379
Didn 't you just say that ?

1079
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:13,239
You said a baby with a mother is a treasure

1080
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:13,899
Right

1081
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:20,879
Mom

1082
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,640
Mom

1083
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,520
Ticket checked

1084
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,259
Check - in

1085
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,239
Hold things

1086
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,239
Don 't forget things

1087
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:34,980
That 's still a little time .

1088
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,660
Let 's take a picture

1089
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,700
My dress is yours

1090
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,580
Gave it to me two days ago

1091
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,899
Did I look good for the first time ?

1092
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:43,500
You look good in everything

1093
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,259

What 's wrong ?

1109
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:04,379
That paper is there

1110
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,040

Su Su ah

00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,180
You were with Grandma just now

1146
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,080
What are you saying ?

1147
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,399
Talking about stocks

1148
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:55,000
The market rose today

1149
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,339
Grandma

1150
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,859
What can she say ?

1151
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:09,379
Isn 't it just about you ?

1152
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:11,520
What do you mean about me ?

1153
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,299
