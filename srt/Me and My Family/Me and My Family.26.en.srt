00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,039
Is Wu Limei here ?

6
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,320
Who is Wu ?

7
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,199
I , I , I

8
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,300
The big one or the small one

9
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,100
It 's me it 's me it 's me

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,239
I 'm sorry , teacher

11
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:36,739
This is my daughter

12
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,100
Because she hasn 't started school yet

13
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:39,840
I can 't help it .

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,140
You have to be good later

15
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,219
What 's your name , kid ?

16
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,479
Gu Yunsu

17
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,839

18
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:47,420
Then please invite Gu Yunsu

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,339
As a daughter

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,320
On stage to replace my mother

21
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,560
Can you introduce it ?

22
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:53,380
No need for this

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,539
Hello everyone

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,039
My mother , Wu Limei

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,780
She 's not particularly reliable

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,680
She doesn 't think about my feelings

27
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,159
Put my original

28
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,240
A family with a father and a mother

29
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:12,839
Dismantled

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,100
Take me into a

31
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,779
A shabby rental hut

32
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,960
My grandmother said

33
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:18,759
She 's just asking for trouble

34
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:19,740
A woman

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,600
Marry a chicken and follow a chicken , marry a dog and follow a dog

36
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:23,860
My mother insists on being a stubborn ass

37
00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:25,960
And

38
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:27,619
She also asked me to

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,180
Don 't strive for the top

40
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,960
Let me feel the pleasure of learning

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,300
And

42
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,320
What other parents often want

43
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,559
Things of Hope

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,100
For my mom

45
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,259
It 's all indifferent

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,220
Grandma said

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,600
With a daughter like my mother

48
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,139
It 's tiring enough .

49
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,419
I also think

50
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,720
I stand with Wu Limei

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,820
Such a mom

52
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,080
I can only accept my fate .

53
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,360
But

54
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,759
Why do I think I 'm a mom

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,080
You have to look like a mother

56
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,660
Being a daughter

57
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,160
You have to have a daughter

58
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,199
I think it 's fine for my mom to do this

59
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,100
She 's just being herself

60
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,020
She did a great job

61
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,580
And very good at it

62
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,680
I like it when she does it

63
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,960
Teacher is ready

64
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,980
Have you said everything you want to say ?

65
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:25,879
Almost done

66
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,080
Very vivid .

67
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,760
Student Su Su

68
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:33,040
Teacher wants to ask you a question , okay

69
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,279
What 's the problem

70
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,819
What about your mother ?

71
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,999
While raising children

72
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,719
Make a living while working

73
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,439
In this case

74
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,499
She just started from an ordinary woman .

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,040
Admitted to Night University

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,480
You said

77
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:48,559
Is this

78
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,020
It 's particularly not simple .

79
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,200
I think

80
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,260
She should be admitted to Tsinghua

81
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,020
or Peking University

82
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,819
That 's what I think anyway

83
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,960
Wu Limei

84
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,319
Please go on stage and add some information

85
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,200
OK OK

86
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:05,980
Pain

87
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,099
Good teacher , good teacher

88
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,980
Hello Students

89
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,480
I am

90
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,839
Wu Limei , a super senior student

91
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,219
I am very honored

92
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:21,960
Can be with everyone

93
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,559
Become this classmate

94
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,020
Re - examination

95
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,240
I will

96
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,540
This is what I want to do

97
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,219
On the road of literature

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,700
I I want that

99
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,580
Continue to study

100
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,240
I

101
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,899
My

102
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,640
My daughter is right

103
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,200
I 'm a

104
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,760
A very unreliable mom

105
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,240
Simultaneously

106
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,719
I 'm still a

107
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,700
Middle - aged woman with failed marriage

108
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,599
My life is very difficult now

109
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:04,700
It took me a lot of effort

110
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,819
Then I came to this place

111
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:09,200
The reason is very simple

112
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,439
That is

113
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:12,520
I don 't want to accept my fate

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,640
All my life

115
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,680
I don 't want to be anyone 's daughter

116
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,800
Whose wife

117
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,879
Or someone 's mother

118
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,420
I want to be who I am

119
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,759
I really want to

120
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,240
Maybe

121
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,999
I took a few more detours

122
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,360
Maybe I 'm better than all of you

123
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,579
It took a little longer

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,920
Maybe

125
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
I 'm not that young anymore

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,199
What about my memory now

127
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,220
Not particularly good

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,100
The reaction is a bit slow .

129
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,740
But I don 't think it matters .

130
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,319
Because I still have

131
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,199
Many wishes

132
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,220
Want to achieve

133
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,119
And I believe

134
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,100
It will certainly be achieved

135
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,079
So I 'm not afraid

136
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,420
I 'm not afraid at all

137
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:03,699
I think

138
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,459
Just start

139
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,019
Don 't be afraid of being too late

140
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:15,980
That 's all I have to say

141
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,340
Wu Limei

142
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,800
It 's very good .

143
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,939
Please ask No. Zero Two

144
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,319
Wu Gang comes up

145
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,220
Can you introduce yourself ?

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,639
Dare to speak ill of me

147
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,720
You wait

148
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,619
I want to promote and suppress first

149
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,300
Let me tell you something

150
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:33,759
My recent days

151
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,879
How did you live ?

152
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,699
OK

153
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,100
I 'm here

154
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,379
I get up earlier than at home every day

155
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,540
Because in this

156
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:44,900
He has a lot of chickens

157
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,740
Rooster Crows

158
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,400
I woke up when I called it

159
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,199
And then

160
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,259
They 'll take me with them

161
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,939
To this vegetable shed

162
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,459
Inside this greenhouse

163
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,100
Do some picking .

164
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,699
That place is

165
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,319
Strawberry Growing

166
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,079
Jingjing said

167
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,939
The soil here is particularly good

168
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,319
Fruit trees blossomed last month

169
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,059
Results will be available next month

170
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,059
I like it too

171
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:17,059
Then here I am

172
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,980
I work myself

173
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,600
I cook for myself

174
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:22,920
That

175
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,240
I made pizza two days ago

176
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,400
Jingjing said it was delicious

177
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:29,840
I just put a little too much bacon

178
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Slightly salty

179
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,459
Li Jianxiong is sorry

180
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,300
It 's not so suddenly

181
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,119
I know

182
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,859
I have a problem that I can 't fix

183
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:43,880
Just too willful

184
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,479
I don 't want you to ignore me

185
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,479
But I didn 't expect

186
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,140
I ignored you for this reason

187
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,680
What are you saying , Mei Mei ?

188
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,199
I 'm fine , I

189
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I 'm fine

190
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,819
I 'm worried about you

191
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:05,099
We 'll agree after that

192
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,540
No more

193
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,439
Mei Mei

194
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,140
A House

195
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,380
Where it is placed

196
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,120
It 's just a house

197
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,040
But as long as I have you

198
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:20,120

You don 't recognize me

203
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900

What about you

207
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,000

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,020
Came to live nearby

209
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,479
With your daughter .

210
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:41,979
None

211
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,520

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,079
How many years have we not seen each other

215
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:58,760
It should have been ten years .

I 'm not a cop now

220
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,959

Book

00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,239
My home is

237
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:42,500
That neighborhood

238
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,599
Really

239
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,280
I 'm the one in front

240
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,699
Turn left at the traffic light

241
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,160
Then go and sit down when you are free

242
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,000
Do you have anything in the afternoon

243
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,800
Nothing happened in the afternoon

244
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,520

245
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,599

00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:24,640
Do you want to know what it is

248
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,660
I still have a gift

249
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:28,300
Do you want to check it out ?

250
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,459
OK

251
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:32,359
See

252
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,260
This is so shiny

253
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,819
This is what the star wears

254
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,280
You 're a big star .

255
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:45,040
Do you like it very much

256
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,900
Li Jianxiong

257
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,540
Do I know you very well ?

258
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,439
You always make my dreams come true

259
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,140
Li Jianxiong

260
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,500
That dress ?

261
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,900
According to what I did more than ten years ago

262
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,300
That vision bought it

263
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:19,239
Me

264
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,500
I want to make one

265
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,000
Couple 's Dress

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,079
I like everything you pick

269
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,300
Mei Mei

270
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,099
When I was sick

271
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,000
I 've been thinking

272
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,439
Be sure

273
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:39,819
With You

274
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,859
Give a beautiful dance

275
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,120
Round it

276
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,400
The dream of our youth

277
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,599
This is difficult .

278
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,760
You said you were so stupid

279
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,819
And with the same hand and foot

280
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:02,459
Then I have made progress now

281
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,859
Improvement , Improvement , Improvement

282
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,579
I didn 't have a conversation either

283
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:10,900
A partner with such a big belly

284
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,099
We danced together

285
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:14,040
What does it mean

286
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,800
You dislike me

287
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,459
How could it be ?

288
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,140
This is

289
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,300
Our family of three is dancing .

290
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,059
Jianxiong

291
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,400
Thank you for giving me a home

292
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,099
Then tonight

293
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,160
We 'll just pack up our stuff

294
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,000
Let 's go home

295
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,199
No

296
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
I 'm not going back

297
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,000
This is made by

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,180
IP Adapted

299
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,640
Ancient costume suspense plot

300
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,040
A fantasy drama with a big male lead

301
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,020
Its data

302
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,920
Click - through rate or something

303
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,719
All very good

304
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,500
What is the plate we are currently coding

305
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,439
What about Brother Han 's work plan for this year

306
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,520
Yes Transformation

307
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,900
Ancient puppets are not considered for this purpose .

308
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,140
This

309
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,000
This is a youth campus theme

310
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,880
This genius learner

311
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,439
The same is true for Qingpu

312
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,359
Let 's not waste time here

313
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,020
Talk about this

314
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,880
Change the soup but not the medicine .

315
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,219
Sit down , sit down , sit down

316
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,180
Qin

317
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,359
The Company has so many reserve items

318
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:33,760
Yes

319
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,680
Don 't hide it

320
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I managed to get Brother Yang

321
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,540
Find me

322
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:37,400
Show some sincerity

323
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,479
Yes Yes Yes

324
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:39,280
Waiting , waiting , waiting

325
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,880
Wait a minute , wait a minute

326
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:48,920
This doesn 't work

327
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,420
Wait a minute

328
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,680
What was that just now ?

329
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,079
Which

330
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,260
What fled just now

331
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,880
There 's an escape from this

332
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,520
Yes , yes , yes , this doesn 't work

333
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,680
This is not Brother Han

334
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,400
Favorite Type

335
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,319
Not a good fit for him

336
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,199
Xiao Qin

337
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,020
Which one works and which one doesn 't ?

338
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,160
It 's up to you

339
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
Not me , me

340
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,479
Xiao Qin

341
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,120
Tell Brother Yang about this

342
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,400
Good

343
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,140
Today 's matter is finalized .

344
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,479
I am responsible for publishing group news

345
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,100
Equivalent to saying yes

346
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,439
Change Zhang Han 's schedule

347
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:21,680
Advertise

348
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,239
What about you ? Keep an eye on the script

349
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,459
I just talked to Teacher Zhao 's studio

350
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:26,519
Already said hello

351
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,999
She leads her team of writers

352
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:28,620
Probably

353
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,420
three days

354
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,860
You can give an adaptation plan

355
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,600
All right

356
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:36,719
Lai is always like this

357
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,439
Is the original author of this novel

358
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:42,719
From conception to serialization

359
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,180
She spent years

360
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,880
and painstaking efforts

361
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,160
So do you want to

362
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,180
Ask her directly

363
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,519
To be the writer

364
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,279
Who is the author ?

365
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:51,479
One of mine

366
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,939
Friends

367
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,299
Gu Yunsu

368
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
You 've seen it before

369
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:57,439
The one from the last filming banquet

370
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,360
Yes , it 's her , it 's her

371
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,860
Have you written any scripts ?

372
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,019
None

373
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:02,299
But her ability

374
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:03,400
It 's definitely no problem

375
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,320
Cannot be considered

376
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Lai is always like this

377
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,160
I was

378
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,999
When you want this copyright

379
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:14,160
I promised someone

380
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,360
Let her be a screenwriter

381
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,320
Now

382
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,880
You can switch to another team of writers

383
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,439
I really can 't explain .

384
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,660
A newcomer with zero experience

385
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,160
and established teams that have worked with

386
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,039
Who do you think I would choose

387
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,439
Who will the platform choose

388
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,560
Who will the audience choose ?

389
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,340
Then we

390
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,880
We want to make high - quality products , right ?

391
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,739
Then start

392
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:33,239
The quality of the script is considered

393
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:34,080
Should that also be

394
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,279
Let this original author

395
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:35,680
Come

396
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,719
The question now is

397
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:40,140
Zhang Han 's schedule is limited , right ?

398
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:41,699
No Zhang Han

399
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:42,739
We can 't attract investment

400
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:45,080
A project cannot be established without a script

401
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,920
This author is suitable

402
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:48,560
A man gives birth to six hands

403
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,880
Can she finish the rotation ?

404
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,019
You and Me

405
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,820
We have no chance of trial and error

406
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,660
Mr. Lai is not like this

407
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,719
We both take a step back

408
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,840
You let this author

409
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,380
Join this screenwriter team

410
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,979
Two more hands are faster

411
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:10,840
Right

412
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,459
You 're teaching me to do things

413
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,219
No No

414
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,459
I only look at time and results

415
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,219
As for how you negotiate with the author

416
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,380
It 's your business , okay

417
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,600
OK

418
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,180
Mei Mei

419
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,160
Li Jianxiong

420
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,620
What is this for ?

421
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,539
I

422
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:46,400
Come , come , come , come

423
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,100
Why are you here again

424
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,660
You , you sit , you sit , you sit

425
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,680
I 'll tell you slowly

426
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,739
Mei Mei

427
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:55,060
You 're going to be a mother soon .

428
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,340
I know

429
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,699
After I became a mother

430
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:58,939
That is destined

431
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,279
Sacrifice and Give Up

432
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,340
Many Selves

433
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,140
But I

434
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,799
I don 't want you to be that mom

435
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:04,739
The baby is yours

436
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:05,739
It 's mine too

437
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,739
As long as I bear more

438
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,820
You 'll be more comfortable

439
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:10,799
So

440
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,640
How long do you want to stay here

441
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,459
I 'll stay with you for as long as I want .

442
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,499
I did the math

443
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:16,600
From Here to Unit

444
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,660
Than usual

445
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,439
Twenty minutes earlier

446
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,799
Don 't worry about me in the future

447
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:22,920
All right

448
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,380
There 's also a great piece of good news

449
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,039
To tell you

450
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,799
What good news

451
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,939
Take a look at it

452
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:31,920
You see

453
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,660
My Escape Plan

454
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,799
Serial Novel

455
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,840
Production Company

456
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Instant Pictures

457
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,999
A - list male star plays the leading role

458
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,580
You said it was good news

459
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,759
Should I be in Moments

460
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,439
In the circle of colleagues

461
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,799
Forward this and this

462
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:48,680
Please help me think of a

463
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,539
Low - key

464
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,620
A promotional slogan that can be flashed out

465
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,180
Why didn 't I listen

466
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,759
Gu Yunsu told me .

467
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,380
Hi

468
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:14,219
What 's going on ?

469
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:15,560
I just fell asleep

470
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,039
I just got off the night shift and I still haven 't slept .

471
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,279
I 'm here to congratulate you

472
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,420
You have good news

473
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,219
Why didn 't you tell me

474
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,799
What good news

475
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,779
Couldn 't it be my mother who gave birth ?

476
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,759
You don 't know .

477
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,680
Is my mom in the hospital

478
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,320
Tell me

479
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,420
I didn 't send you .

480
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,439
Look at WeChat

481
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,660
What

482
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:49,140
What is this ?

483
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:51,340
Susu , we 're back

484
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,239
Why are you home ?

485
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,580
What 's going on with that group message ?

486
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,680
You see it

487
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:00,439
Gu Yunsu

488
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:02,039
You sold the novel

489
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,140
You saw it too

490
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,779
It seems that Zhang Hanyan

491
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:05,420
I think it can be said

492
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,380
He didn 't mean he

493
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,140
Are you not interested in this

494
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,900
Don 't you know

495
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:12,939
Co - author I am

496
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,080
Last known

497
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,499
This is a little strange

498
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,759
Do you want to ask ?

499
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,320
To me

500
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,299
I have to look for Qin Yuxuan

501
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,420
Give him a call

502
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,920
Hi

503
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,140
What is the situation

504
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,439
Good news

505
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:30,620
I see it

506
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,140
I see it

507
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,340
I saw the good news

508
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,840
So what 's the bad news ?

509
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,140
No bad news

510
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,479
Why are you so pessimistic ?

511
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:37,920
No No

512
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,140
You told me then , right ?

513
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,439
Let me be a screenwriter , right ?

514
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:42,239
Do you remember

515
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,239
Then I am

516
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,820
I saw this message saying

517
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,739
It will be turned on soon

518
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,340
I haven 't written a word yet

519
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:48,680
Then it 's too late

520
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,519
The time you gave me

521
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,340
Not enough .

522
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,739
Don 't you just put the novel

523
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:53,039
Print it into a script and shoot it directly

524
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,080
That 's not

525
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,140
The emergency situation is complicated

526
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,459
I hope we can talk in person

527
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,080
All right

528
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:00,279
OK , then I 'll go there now

529
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:01,979
What 's going on with Zhang Han ?

530
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:03,039
Is Zhang Han going to play ?

531
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,360
Hi

532
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,779
Good News Bad News

533
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:16,219
I don 't think something is right

534
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:18,400
There must be something wrong with Qin Yuxuan

535
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,219
Hide from me

536
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,080
He wouldn 't tell me on the phone

537
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,640
You have to let me go there

538
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,920
Then ask him

539
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:25,060
Go find him

540
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:26,459
We 'll go with you

541
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:27,400
What are you doing ?

542
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,860
Let 's help you ask .

543
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,140
No

544
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,279
That 's what I thought

545
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,420
I 'll find out first

546
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,499
What happened

547
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:34,979
In case you really need an idea

548
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:35,719
I 'll find you again

549
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:36,900
When you really need an idea

550
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,739
It 's still too late

551
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:38,840
It 's all over the place .

552
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,880
I 'm worried about your stomach

553
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,719
I 'm still carrying one

554
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,080
Right

555
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
The road is quite a long way .

556
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
If you feel uncomfortable and motion sick

557
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,719
What should I do

558
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:45,840
I 'm a mother

559
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,180
I need a bowl of water .

560
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,680
I can 't take care of the small and ignore the big .

561
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,640
Go change your clothes quickly

562
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,199
Mei Mei Mei Mei

563
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,299
When it comes to a bowl of water , it 's even .

564
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:52,299
I think

565
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:53,580
You rushed there alone

566
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,320
Definitely

567
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,939
Inappropriate

568
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:57,380
What should we do

569
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,719
Let 's go as a family .

570
00:23:58,719 --> 00:23:59,880
Go to Xiaoyan , too

571
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,239
We will fight collectively

572
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,140
A large number of people is strong

573
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,340
Others are overwhelming

574
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,799
You should go to work now

575
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,519
Li Jianxiong

576
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,439
That 's right

577
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:07,959
That 's right

578
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,580
Our whole family

579
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,019
And pointing at you to earn money

580
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,180
You 've been delayed for so long

581
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,979
You 're not going yet

582
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,039
Hurry

583
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:13,439
Who is it ?

584
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,219
Who is it ? I guess Xu Wenbin

585
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,080
He just sent me a message

586
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,939
Said he would come to me

587
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,019

I have to go to the bathroom first

600
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,340
Something is not right

601
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,580
Please hurry up

602
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,439

That 's right

607
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,299
This is the feeling

608
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,360
We 're going this time

609
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,060
Yes Discover Problem Solve Problem

610
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,699
It 's not to create problems .

611
00:24:57,699 --> 00:24:58,380
Everyone

612
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,299
Do you understand ?

613
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:01,900
Mom

614
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,239
Mom

615
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,239
Mom , what 's wrong with you

616
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:06,860
Where is it uncomfortable

617
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,499
I feel a little motion sick

618
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,499
Do you want to throw up

619
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:10,380
Or what ?

620
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,380
Don 't remind me

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,539
Don 't , don 't say that word

622
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:13,479
And

623
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,299
Five kilometers ahead

624
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:15,219
Then there is a service area

625
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:16,499
Let 's let Aunt rest for a while

626
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:17,759
Let my mom go down No , no , no

627
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:18,620
Moving on

628
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,420
Keep going

629
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,620
You didn 't get out of the car to catch your breath .

630
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,860
Don 't Don 't Don 't

631
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,060
It 's troublesome to catch your breath .

632
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,420
I 'm fine like this

633
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,719
Open the back window a little bit

634
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:28,459
Open up , open up , get some air

635
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:34,799
Slow down Slow down

636
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,939
Aunt Wu Aunt Wu

637
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:36,880
Are you okay

638
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,600
Are you okay

639
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:38,660
OK

640
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,759
I 'll just sit down for a while

641
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,660
I 'm a little like you

642
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,060
I 'm fine when I go up . I 'm fine

643
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,299
Slow down Slow down Slow down Slow down

644
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:46,840
Lie down for a while

645
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,320
Do you still want to vomit ?

646
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,420
What I just did

647
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,439
The reaction force is particularly strong

648
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:58,380
Now I think it will be better

649
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,920
Just sit down and you 'll be fine

650
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:04,259
Let 's discuss it

651
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,499
Let 's do it today

652
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:06,180
Forget it

653
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,320
Let 's see if this works .

654
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,560
Everyone is here

655
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,539
Don 't be cowardly

656
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:11,880
Don 't you have any dysmenorrhea ?

657
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,219
I am physically disabled and strong

658
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,160
I just took that painkiller

659
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,420
This hasn 't worked yet

660
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,219
It will be fine in a moment

661
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,640
Why don 't I accompany you ?

662
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,959
My own business

663
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:20,719
Trust me

664
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,019
I can solve it myself

665
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,160
I have a little quarrel with you every three days

666
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,120
There is a big noise every five days

667
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,120
Can 't suffer a loss

668
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:26,560
I have it .

669
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,219
What are you doing

670
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:33,340
Are you still changing ?

671
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,939
Are you still in this mood ?

672
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,160
You don 't understand

673
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,140
Before this playing

674
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,320
This is called morale

675
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,219
Right and murderous

676
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,219

You must be the screenwriter

701
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,499
But but

702
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:25,400
Now

703

What 's next

712
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,100
First of all

This is

722
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,479
Fleeing screenwriter studio

723
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,479
Unified Contract Template

724
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:32,279
This item is

725
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,759
Zhang Han 's team has taken a fancy

726
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,580
Mr. Lai made the decision directly

727
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
The cycle and screenwriter team are set

728
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,340

733
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:45,400
and to them this

734
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,640
The screenwriter team went inside

735
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:49,279
But you don 't have to do anything

736
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,759
Bai Luo 's signature

737
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,560
I don 't understand

738
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,640
At that time , I put the copyright

739
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,340

740
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,259

I don 't have to do anything yet

745
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,100
Why don 't I have to do anything

746
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:06,999
Because

747
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,160

755
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,680

00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,499
Barriers do exist

761
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:27,279
Even

Still writing a TV series

00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,100
You are new to both areas

769
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:39,660
But this time you

You made it a hit

773
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:46,320
Next time it won 't be like this

774
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,620
The next time you go directly

775
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,019
You can sign the first signature

776
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,519

777
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,340

You can 't decide either

780
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,239
Right

781
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,380
Then who can decide

782
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,180
Who decides

783
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:03,640
Can I see him ?

784
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,080
I was just thinking

785
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,180
Should

786
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:07,080
Let Gu Yunsu

787
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,840
Put on a headphone

788
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,340
In this case

789
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,019
I can

790
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:11,680
Talk to her on WeChat at any time

791
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,120
or something

792
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,479
Give her an idea .

793
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,120
Don 't worry .

794
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,840
Qin Yuxuan is like that

795
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,560
I 'm in a hurry

796
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,779
He should help Susu

797
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,519
Can 't trust him

798
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,019
If this is the case

799
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,820
Nor can Gu Yunsu

800
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,920
So anxious

801
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,100
I think next

802
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
That must be the case

803
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:25,719
They followed her

804
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,840
Pulling and pulling

805
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:27,660
And then

806
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,999
Fooled her in a muddled way

807
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:31,060
The contract was signed

808
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,959
No

809
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:33,340
Susu is a man of his own opinion

810
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,279
It 's not like you don 't know

811
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,840
Her ears are hard , right ?

812
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,779
That 's for me

813
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:38,439
What if he played the emotional card ?

814
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,060
Gu Yunsu must remember her old love

815
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,219
No

816
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,759
Even then

817
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,620
That 's also Gu Yunsu 's

818
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,499
Delaying the Army

819
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,340
We 're all here

820
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,239
We 're all here

821
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,160
Mr. Lai

822
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,880
Teacher Zhao

823
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,420
Hello , please introduce me .

824
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,979
Brother Han 's big manager

825
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,719
Yang Yang

826
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,259
Brother Yang Yang

827
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,160
We just finished working together

828
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:03,519
Teacher Zhao is in charge of this play

829
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,120
Accurate

830
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,779
I 'm flattering .

831
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,759
No problem No problem

832
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,120
We 're all acquaintances .

833
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:07,900
We are all acquaintances .

834
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:08,900
Come

835
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,539
That

836
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:10,900
We begin

837
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:12,080
OK

838
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,439
This original book

839
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,920
It 's the notebook of the big heroine

840
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:17,140
Now

841
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,039
Change to us

842
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,719
Brother Han plays this male lead

843
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:21,519
Main chapters of the original book

844
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,120
It is to accompany

845
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,999
Forty-eight - year - old mother expecting to give birth

846
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,219
Male Protagonist Accompanying Mother

847
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:26,799
This relationship

848
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,880
It may be necessary to sort it out

849
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,999
Therefore , adaptation is very difficult

850
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,299
Everyone brainstorms

851
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:31,999
Wait a minute

852
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:34,060
What 's the big male protagonist or female protagonist

853
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:35,340
What did she say ?

854
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,739
This is the discussion

855
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:37,759
It 's not sure it 's not

856
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,620
What is there to discuss about this ?

857
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,979
Who does Zhang Han play ?

858
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:43,880
You listen first You listen first

859
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,680
I read the original novel

860
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,100
It writes a lot

861
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,499
They are all short of their parents

862
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:50,120
It 's trivial and has no market .

863
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:51,360
and does not meet

864
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,400
Our Brother Han 's Character

865
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:52,939
Cool

866
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,640
Handsome

867
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,600
Smart

868
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:56,279
Zhang Han plays me

869
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,439
Secondly , I think

870
00:31:57,979 --> 00:31:59,239
Not sure

871
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,279
Discussion

872
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,459
You listen first

873
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:02,660
Don 't worry

874
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,140
You already knew that , right ?

875
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,299
Disconnect from his mother

876
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,860
Why didn 't you tell me on the phone ?

877
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,439
Then I think

878
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:10,519
Why don 't you change it to

879
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,600
The hero followed  since childhood.

880
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,699
I grew up with my father

881
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,320
This way between him and his mother

882
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,120
This feeling of alienation

883
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,320
It makes sense .

884
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,620
Right ? That 's reasonable .

885
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,519
Our play

886
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,600
Mainly focused on

887
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,860
On our Brother Han

888
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,060
Right , but

889
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,459
This little brother in his play

890
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:25,439
This character

891
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:27,360
It 's very melodramatic .

892
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,519
It 's just useless

893
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,600
I think I can play a part

894
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,499
Also to Brother Han

895
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,100
I think I can make my parents short

896
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,080
A trivial story

897
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,939
Reduce it a bit

898
00:32:33,939 --> 00:32:34,880
The male protagonist 's career ambition

899
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,699
Bring it up

900
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:36,620
Like this

901
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,759
Experience of new people in the workplace

902
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,739
You can get us

903
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:39,820
Workers ' Resonance

904
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,060
While paying attention to your career

905
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:43,699
Think again

906
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:45,039
The audience has another

907
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:46,340
Psychological Needs

908
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:47,920
Romance

909
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:49,279
Love

910
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,219
Great Screenwriter

911
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:52,340
Knowing Play

912
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,900
The line of love

913
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:54,900
Everyone has written it

914
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,420
Be sure to write properly

915
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,499
Highlights

916
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,320
What do I suggest ?

917
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,499
Add a second female lead

918
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,779
Two women compete for a man

919
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,459
Love Shura Field

920
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:03,900
We can also write a second part

921
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,239
The main line is a love triangle

922
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,259
Trilogy One , Two and Trilogy is popular now

923
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,360
You must continue

924
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:17,340
That

925
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,759
The teachers said it very well

926
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:19,600
Let me introduce it to you

927
00:33:19,939 --> 00:33:21,060
This is us

928
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,259
The author of the original novel

929
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,699
Teacher Gu Yunsu Gu

930
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,979
What 's your advice ?

931
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:29,340
Let 's share it with everyone

932
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,580
Awesome

933
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,660
I think everyone here

934
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,459
The idea

935
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:33,199
They are all first - class

936
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:33,939
No , no , no

937
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,100
All top stream

00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,580
I never dreamed of it

941
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,199
Zhang Han plays me

942
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,140
Brother Han plays you

943
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,840
I am Zhang Han

944
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,779
Zhang Han is me

945
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,100
You guys are so funny

946
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,479
How about this

947
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,640
Don 't adapt it .

948
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:55,560
You re -

949
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,939
Writing a story is awesome

950
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:57,900
Why do you have to

951
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,039
With my story

952
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,880
Why

953
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:07,779
That

954
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:08,759
Just kidding

955
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,560
Continue talking

956
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,100
Continue talking

957
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,459
Excuse me for a moment

958
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:11,900
I 'm sorry

959
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,320
Sorry

960
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,160
Gu Yunsu , can you

961
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,100
Don 't mess with me

962
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:20,640
Are you deaf or blind

963
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,160
Those guys talk nonsense there

964
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,660
You tell me

965
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,739
This is called brainstorming

966
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,899
Do they have brains

967
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:25,660
What kind of sex change ?

968
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,699
Another love triangle

969
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,460
I write about my family

970
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,440
Based on my home

971
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,759
The story of my family

972
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:31,460
You 're really good .

973
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,699
Watching coldly .

974
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:33,600
Just let them

975
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,180
Spoiling my writing there

976
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,140
Gu Yunsu Gu Yunsu

977
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,940
Why ?

978
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,600
Calm down

979
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,259
Let 's leave it alone

980
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:39,140
Whose family story is it

981
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,859
It 's a story

982
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:40,699
Now to be adapted

983
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,540
We have to give it

984
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,359
Adapted Space

985
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,399
Secondary Creation Space

986
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:43,879
Right

987
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:44,879
How else is it called adaptation ?

988
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,399
Yes No

989
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:47,040
There 's nothing you can do now

990
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,660
Right

991
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:48,719
It 's out of control .

992
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,020
You can 't control it .

993
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,859
You can 't control it

994
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:51,379
Then let me ask you

995
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:52,580
Why did you pat your chest ?

996
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,060
Promise me

997
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,160
I 'm the first screenwriter

998
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,180
Why do you brag ?

999
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,480
Because I don 't know

1000
00:34:58,219 --> 00:34:58,859
I don 't know

1001
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,020
Everything has variables

1002
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,359
Everything has variables

1003
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:03,839
You are

1004
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:05,839
You knew it would be like this

1005
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,799
Put my copyright

1006
00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:07,440
Cheat me first

1007
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,020
Then dig a hole and let me jump .

1008
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,120
How can I lie ?

1009
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,819
You just lied to me

1010
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:11,719
How can I be a cheat

1011
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,520
You just lied to me

1012
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:19,919
Gu Yunsu This is a good thing

1013
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,520
I 'm not lying to you

1014
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,060
It became what it is today

1015
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,359
It 's also a good thing

1016
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:25,419
Think carefully

1017
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,799
I move forward with this project

1018
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:27,719
I tried my best

1019
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,560
Advance this project

1020
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,960
My tongue is almost worn

1021
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,520
Can you

1022
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,100
Don 't talk fast for a moment

1023
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,460
Can you think about the future ?

1024
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,060
Think for the long run

1025
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,359
Can I beg you ?

1026
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:44,080
Qin Yuxuan , let me ask you .

1027
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:46,799
The previous power of attorney

1028
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:48,620
I signed it with you , right ?

1029
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,219
Right

1030
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,339
It 's me

1031
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:52,839
I signed it personally with you

1032
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:53,640
Right

1033
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,500
Yes

1034
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:55,620
So

1035
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,120
I don 't do anything with your company

1036
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,680
This Total That Total

1037
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
I 'm not talking to them

1038
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,000
I can 't talk

1039
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,199
I didn 't sign with them

1040
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,180
Qin Yuxuan

1041
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,620
I beg you

1042
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:05,219
Please

1043
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:06,899
Give me back my novel

1044
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:08,500
Is it good ?

1045
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:09,680
I am not qualified

1046
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,480
I can 't get on the table

1047
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,640
I can 't get on , I can 't get on

1048
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,899
What kind of platform is this ?

1049
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:13,899
It doesn 't matter if you don 't recognize me

1050
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:14,899
I 'm not a screenwriter .

1051
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:16,180
Can I stop playing ?

1052
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,399
This novel

1053
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,899
It 's rotten in my hand

1054
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:19,759
I 'm not selling

1055
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:20,940
If you like to shoot it , you can 't make it into TV series

1056
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,919
I don 't care

1057
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:22,819
Who cares ?

1058
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:24,219
Is it okay if I stop playing ?

1059
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,259
I don 't play anymore

1060
00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:26,699
Can you give it back to me ?

1061
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:27,960
Gu Yunsu , you are sick

1062
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,799
You are sick

1063
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,779
Do you understand contract law ?

1064
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,560
I want to follow

1065
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Your power of attorney

1066
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,940
If the contents are executed

1067
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,560
You don 't even have this building

1068
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,399
You can 't even get in

1069
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,719
I risk offending my boss

1070
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,020
I asked Zhang Han 's team

1071
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,540
I got the best team of writers

1072
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,339
Play with you

1073
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,879
But what about you ?

1074
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:44,060
You want to quit

1075
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,180
What do you think ?

1076
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:45,819
I 'll tell you

1077
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:46,440
The World of Adults

1078
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,620
It 's not that easy

1079
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,620
I have been in Shanghai for so long

1080
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,299
I 'm in this big

1081
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:52,199
Office Work

1082
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:52,919
Up to now

1083
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:54,660
A project was not negotiated

1084
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,020
So someone wants this project

1085
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,480
I must take this opportunity

1086
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,120
I tried my best

1087
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,020
Seize this opportunity as well

1088
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,379
And I 'm trying to help you .

1089
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:02,219
Seize this opportunity

1090
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:02,919
This is what I did

1091
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:03,620
What did you do

1092
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,560
You want to quit

1093
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:06,299
You 're gonna rot it in your hands

1094
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:07,140
After rotting in your hands

1095
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,940
Why are you going home ?

1096
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,879
With your mother

1097
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,199
Home

1098
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:12,160
Keep writing about what no one reads .

1099
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,680
Worthless broken words

1100
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,080
You 're twenty-nine

1101
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,699
You 'll be thirty soon

1102
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:21,580
Little Princess , you have grown up

1103
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,940
You should grow up

1104
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,080
There is no room for an adult world

1105
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,719
Your romantic

1106
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,299
It 's really boring

1107
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,239
Boring

1108
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Boring

1109
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:54,940
It 's really boring

1110
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,960
Qin Yuxuan

1111
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,000
You 're right

1112
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,140
I 'm really naive .

1113
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,739
I 'm almost thirty

1114
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:06,540
Actually

1115
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,819
Because someone told me

1116
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:08,739
He is trusted

1117
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,980
I really believe it

1118
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,339
Until you just entered

1119
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:16,480
This office before

1120
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,759
I even had a little luck

1121
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,520
I think you can be trusted

1122
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,480
No wonder

1123
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,640
I 'm old

1124
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:32,980
That 's why it happened

1125
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,919
Nothing is achieved

1126
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,460
I should .

1127
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,160
I don 't understand it

1128
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,359
Everything you say is correct

1129
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:45,460
But I don 't recognize it

1130
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,060
I will never recognize it

1131
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:28,480
Much better

1132
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,500
Nothing happens now

1133
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,440
Dr. Xiao Xu

1134
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,440
Thank you .

1135
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,859
Thanks to you

1136
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,819
Should

1137
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:35,859
What do you mean thank you

1138
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:37,279
Line

1139
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,899
OK

1140
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:43,580
Aunt Wu

1141
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:45,279
My mom just told me .

1142
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:47,120
She finished her job .

1143
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,080
Really

1144
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,680
That 's good .

1145
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,600
Xiaoyan , let me tell you .

1146
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,199
In this unit

1147
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,359
Actually , there are many colleagues

1148
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,199
I have a good relationship with Aunt Wu

1149
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:57,339
Just tell your mother

1150
00:39:57,339 --> 00:39:58,759
If there 's anything I can do for you

1151
00:39:58,759 --> 00:39:59,960
Just tell me

1152
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,460
OK

1153
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:03,899
I still want to thank you Aunt Wu

1154
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:05,199
No thanks , no thanks

1155
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:07,060
Remember Xiaoyan

1156
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,859
Your Business

1157
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,460
Aunt Wu will definitely help .

1158
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,520
But your father is busy

1159
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,000
That 's not necessarily true .

1160
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,580
You have much more face than your father

1161
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,680
Gu Yunsu

1162
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,399
How is it ?

1163
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,859
Mom

1164
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,779
I want to go home

1165
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,080
Go home Go home

1166
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,020
What 's so great ?

1167
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,080
Walk back

1168
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,080
It 's early

1169
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,219
Where are we ? Let 's go

1170
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,680
Mom , I 'm fine

1171
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:10,419
Why

1172
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:11,980
Gu Yunsu

1173
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,879
It 's time to eat

1174
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,419
I 'm not eating I 'm not hungry

1175
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,520
You will get cold if you don 't eat it

1176
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,180
Dear Family

1177
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,100
I don 't know why now

1178
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,120
I am overwhelmed with inspiration

1179
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:21,339
It 's a lot of words

1180
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:22,660
It 's hanging in front of my eyes now

1181
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,600
Just my final chapter

1182
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,180
Not finished yet

1183
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,259
I did it in one go today

1184
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:25,699
I 'm gonna take them

1185
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:26,620
All these dirty things .

1186
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,779
All posted online

1187
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:28,940
Let my readers see it

1188
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:30,319
I 'll also tweet

1189
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:30,980
I now have

1190
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,480
1,683 fans

1191
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,460
Although I don 't have many fans

1192
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,520
But my fans

1193
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,460
They are all my fans

1194
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,520
I 'm short of money right now

1195
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,040
But

1196
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:37,859
I 'm a

1197
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:39,020
People who cherish feathers

1198
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,839
I 'm a

1199
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,879
A good writer who refuses magic reform

1200
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:43,859
I want them all to see

1201
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:45,319
No one will live .

1202
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:47,580
Then don 't eat it

1203
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,319
People will become stupid easily if they eat too much

1204
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:49,980
OK OK

1205
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:52,080
Don 't worry , don 't worry

1206
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,419
Walk , walk , walk

1207
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,680
Then you

1208
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,500
Don 't be too impulsive .

1209
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:03,460
The brown sugar water your mother made for you

1210
00:42:04,419 --> 00:42:06,120
And that wormwood bag

1211
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,719
Put it on your belly

1212
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:14,219
You continue not to disturb you

1213
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:15,060
I 'm out I 'm out

1214
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,859
Wait a minute

1215
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,560
After that

1216
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:18,480
Help me choose a hat

1217
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,460
Put it on .

1218
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,660
Why

1219
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:22,799
My Inspiration Hat

1220
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,359
Is it more powerful ?

1221
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,680
Come on , come on , come on .

1222
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,120
Let me see

1223
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,180
This is fine

1224
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,480
Kill them without leaving a piece of armor behind

1225
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,160
Refuel

1226
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:41,779
All right , get out quickly .

1227
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,580
OK

1228
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:48,319
Do you have any on Weibo

1229
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,020
I have one too

1230
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,660
You have one too

1231
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:51,259
Can you use it ?

1232
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:52,680
Let 's just watch the news

1233
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,879
I guess it 's almost finished

1234
00:42:54,379 --> 00:42:55,339
We need to get ready

1235
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,219
Forward

1236
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,440
We want you to read it when we forward it

1237
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:00,620
She tweeted this

1238
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,739
We have a  below.

1239
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:02,739
Forward this point

1240
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,419
Here

1241
00:43:03,419 --> 00:43:04,000
Right here

1242
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:04,680
OK OK

1243
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,719
He won 't you teach him

1244
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:07,460
We can 't click this quick transfer

1245
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:08,180
Why

1246
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,279
One must forward

1247
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:10,180
Because of its fast rotation

1248
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,080
There is no copywriting at all

1249
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,919
It was sent out

1250
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,899
This won 't work

1251
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,879
Then definitely

1252
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:19,520
This must be the key point .

1253
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,279
You must bring this topic

1254
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,859
How to bring this topic ?

1255
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:23,819
There is a well sign

1256
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:24,879
You want to forward

1257
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:25,680
Look at this

1258
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,120
There 's a pound sign in it

1259
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,580
See

1260
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,180
That topic

1261
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:28,719
I have to put that

1262
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,219
His leading actor is called

1263
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:31,080
Zhang Han

1264
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:32,000
Zhang Han

1265
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,440
Add Zhang Han

1266
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,580
If you add it , there will be heat

1267
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,239
What

1268
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,640
Mr. Lai

1269
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,399
My resignation letter

1270
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:03,419
What does it mean

1271
00:44:03,419 --> 00:44:04,060
What do I mean

1272
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,560
I quit

1273
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,180
I 'm leaving

1274
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:08,419
Shoot with whoever you like

1275
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,620
I took the project with me

1276
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:11,040
It has nothing to do with you .

1277
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,339
Come back

1278
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,100
I 'm back

1279
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:18,859
There is a saying

1280
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,480
I 've been holding back for a long time to tell you .

1281
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,140
That is

1282
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,319
I really look at you all the time

1283
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:25,480
Very unpleasant

1284
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:28,500
What are you ?

1285
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,640
Goodbye
