1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,501
Come and see if this is you

2
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:17,001
Is this you

3
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:19,241
What 's going on ?

4
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:20,220
I 'll say

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,421
Why did my food die ?

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,341
You kicked it , right ?

7
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:25,321
Who the hell is this ?

8
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,200
It 's your child

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,060
Rowing my car

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,080
Which eye did you see ?

11
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:28,501
That 's him

12
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,321
It 's great to have a car at home

13
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:29,900
How do you know ?

14
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,020
I can see very clearly

15
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:33,981
Is this you ?

16
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:34,900
This is your footprint

17
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,601
It 's your footprint .

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,301
It 's a misunderstanding

19
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:39,181
Misunderstanding

20
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:40,781
My food is provoking you .

21
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:44,160
This child just lacks education

22
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,260
Apologize to Uncle

23
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:48,160
Don 't run , you

24
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:50,681
Come back , you bastard

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,741
Susu

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,760
When did you

27
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,961
Artistic Creation

28
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,580
I have my camera with me

29
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,860
You can always hit it

30
00:00:58,701 --> 00:00:59,561
But this photo paper

31
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:00,840
Is it really used up

32
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,840
I really didn 't expect it .

33
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:06,881
I 'll raise you .

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,561
I also need a camera

35
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:56,181
Why do you keep looking at me

36
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,701
Just say whatever you want .

37
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:01,701
Don 't hold it back

38
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:02,900
Can

39
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,981
Don 't avoid me anymore

40
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,021
I didn 't hide from you .

41
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:11,081
You are only allowed to avoid me

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,780
Xu Wenbin

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,340
I drank too much that night

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,521
But what about what I said ?

45
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:23,820
All carefully considered

46
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,081
Take back your love for me

47
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,681
Yes

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,320
Do you like this ?

49
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,280
Is unreasonable

50
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,421
It 's not decided by reason

51
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:40,440
Look , look , here you go again

52
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,840
You know everything

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,681
Understand everything

54
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,000
You like these answers

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
Turn to the table

56
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,900
And then I can 't get off the stage

57
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,761
Embarrassing me

58
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:48,500
Yes

59
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:49,861
I really haven 't taken it back yet

60
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:50,701
I like you

61
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:51,421
But I 'm fed up

62
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:52,500
You hesitate

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,440
I like you

64
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:00,840
When did it start

65
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:03,261
I can 't say it

66
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,861
What do you like about me ?

67
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,600
I don 't know .

68
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,261
What should I say about it but

69
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,100
But I but I wanted to tell you

70
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,600
I 'm real

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,921
Okay , I know , I know

72
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:12,021
You don 't have to say it

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,340
It doesn 't matter

74
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,500
Write it quickly

75
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,861
I can 't hold a fart for a long time

76
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,721
No matter what today

77
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,460
Thank you anyway

78
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,901
I made a special trip

79
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,700
You also accompany me to write a review here

80
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,940
You 're welcome

81
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,361
I 'd love to

82
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,140
If

83
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,901
If this helps me save a little bit

84
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,140
Of course

85
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,500
But if you cannot

86
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:44,020
You still don 't want to see me

87
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,260
It 's worth it

88
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,520
At least I got it .

89
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,320
A little time with you

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,820
It doesn 't mean that I don 't want to say anything .

91
00:04:57,361 --> 00:04:59,700
We will definitely meet you .

92
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,580
And no matter what happens in the future

93
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,481
We 're still friends at least

94
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,820
Comrade Police

95
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,681
I 've written it

96
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,541
All without punctuation

97
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,281
Two thousand one hundred thirty-eight words

98
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:20,440
Read it once

99
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,181
You can leave when you reflect on it .

100
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:22,741
OK

101
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:26,380
Criticism

102
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,341
Dear Leaders

103
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,440
Don 't be so loud

104
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,361
Sorry

105
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,481
I am used to it

106
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,781
Criticism

107
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:36,721
Dear Teacher

108
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:38,320
Dear Students

109
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,760
Today I 'm full of guilt and remorse

110
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,781
Wrote this criticism

111
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:44,380
to express

112
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,820
What I 'm saying about my violation

113
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,580
Deep Confession

114
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,721
Because I left the house with the purified body

115
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,421
Divorced Single Mother

116
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,601
Plus Father

117
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:55,020
Frequent delinquency of financial support

118
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,320
My family is not well off

119
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,120
I often watch at home

120
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,060
It 's hard to be a mother without rice to cook

121
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,520
Sigh

122
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,580
With the original intention of compassion for mothers

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,060
Last Wednesday

124
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,981
Arrived at Golden Five Star Store

125
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,520
In the crowd

126
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,661
In front of a booth full of merchandise

127
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,760
First opening

128
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,921
And that guy about my age

129
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:16,020
While doing homework

130
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,020
Helping Parents

131
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,560
Talking to the boy at the booth

132
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,620
How to sell these

133
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,560
Three yuan and five cards

134
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:23,921
So expensive

135
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:25,781
He opens a notebook

136
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:27,421
Find answers above

137
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,940
This is already the cost price

138
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,560
Unprofitable

139
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:33,520
I pretended to leave

140
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,520
He flipped through the other lines

141
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,781
Look at something else

142
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:40,960
Discount for more purchases

143
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,361
So I got close to him again

144
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:46,801
You 're in fifth grade , too .

145
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,161
Which school are you from

146
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:50,241
Qinghe Primary School

147
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:51,401
What about you

148
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,880
I 'm a

149
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,661
Students of Yuk Tak Primary School

150
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,380
I proudly say

151
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,820
I am proud of my alma mater

152
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,760
OK OK

153
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Criticism

154
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,000
This unwanted

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Just mention it .

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,921
Continue to review

157
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,080
Next

158
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,820
I helped him write a test paper

159
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,421
He sold it to me for half price

160
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:12,560
Thirty cards

161
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,380
Two yuan each

162
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,241
Three for five dollars

163
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:16,060
I took advantage of class break the next day

164
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,221
Conducted card peddling activity

165
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,661
My classmate asked me to lower the price

166
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,460
I turned a deaf ear

167
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,281
Absolutely no price reduction

168
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:25,520
It can 't be cheap

169
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,861
My best friend wants to go through the back door

170
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,260
I 'm indifferent

171
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,380
I like Sakura , please send me one

172
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,421
No , no

173
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,361
Both of us are treated equally

174
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:35,721
No special treatment .

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,601
The teacher came to seize

176
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:42,060
I am a cunning rabbit in three grottoes

177
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,421
All right , class is on .

178
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,401
This is what we are today

179
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,041
Review and Reflection

180
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,681
Please talk about it mainly

181
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:53,020
Your buying and selling process

182
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,060
I 'm diligent

183
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,401
Forgetting to eat and sleep

184
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,200
I forgot my studies and school rules

185
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:00,500
Focus on it

186
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,401
Make Business Good and Stronger

187
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,861
Taking shape quickly

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,861
People with lofty ideals in all grades

189
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,981
To be my dealer

190
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:11,560
It can be said that it is crushing your head

191
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,721
All of them are available

192
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,500
Card Exit Outside Class

193
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,060
Across six grades

194
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:18,661
In a moment

195
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,380
I

196
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,060
Gu · Commercial Giant · Yunsu

Unparalleled scenery

198
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:27,520
However , it is cold at the top

199
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,921
Malicious competition soon appeared

200
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,520
The senior year is engaged

201
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,460
A senior in a related trade industry

202
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,560
Attempting to annex my business

203
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,760
I want to withdraw my card

204
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,901
Your cards

205
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:39,801
It 's covered with scratches and creases

206
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,421
The one next door sells better than you

207
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,261
Cheaper than you

208
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:43,161
There are many types

209
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:44,560
But when I sold it

210
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,801
It 's not like this at all .

211
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,761
Don 't you think it 's quite good ?

212
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,001
You see , these are scratched

213
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:50,360
If only one person has a scratch

214
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,761
He must have done it himself

215
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:52,801
So many people have scratches

216
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:53,901
You must have done that

217
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:55,060
Line , line , line , line , line , line , line , line , line , line , line

218
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:55,840
Don 't be wordy

219
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,820
She summoned her minions

220
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,501
Buy my cards in bulk

221
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,401
After intentional damage

222
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:03,021
Citing poor quality

223
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:04,161
Request return

224
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:06,261
and conduct malicious propaganda

225
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:08,460
Which is next door ?

226
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,001
Senpai 's house

227
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:11,860
Senpai

228
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,021
This Moment

229
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:15,100
Father 's Business Blood

230
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,320
Awaken here

231
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,161
I 'm going to face it head - on

232
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:21,001
A brutal commercial war begins

233
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,521
I spread rumors

234
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,881
Claiming that senior is a trendy person

235
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:27,901
But actual grade

236
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,761
Just like a square dance lady

237
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:31,460
As soon as the rumor comes out

238
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,720
Senpai 's reputation has dropped sharply

239
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:36,161
Even being pushed out and isolated by class

240
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,480
You like them

241
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,641
Isn 't it too rustic ?

242
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:42,161
The sound of horses ' hooves rises and the sound of horses ' hooves falls

243
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,781
I saw the right time

244
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,860
Buy bargain and acquire its industries

245
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,801

246
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,200

247
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,940

248
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,700
No more

249
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,060

I 'll give you another step

254
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,220

256
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,021
Seven three is seven three

257
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:12,621
Happy cooperation

258
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,521
Finally

259
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,340
I became a history books

260
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,421
Described industry oligarchy

261
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,340
Created

262
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,401
Own Business Empire

263
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:26,340
However

264
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,661
Great trees attract wind

265
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:28,881
Thousand precautions

266
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:30,021
Insiders are hard to guard against

267
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:33,220
I used to be confused

268
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,281
Why friends get rich together

269
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:36,460
To betray me

270
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,200
Now I 'm fully enlightened

271
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,360
Finally understand

272
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,761
Take a walk and have a look

273
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,421
Don 't miss it when you pass by

274
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,720

People walk in the world

277
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,360
We must abide by the law

278
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,161
I didn 't follow school rules when I was young

279
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,421
How can I keep the legal bottom line when I grow up

280
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:56,681
When I was young , I dared to drill

281
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,200
Earn money from the loopholes of school rules

282
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,281
Dare to grow up

283
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:01,200
Take advantage of the loopholes of criminal law to make money

284
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:02,501
This is exactly the case

285
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:04,661
The experience of the sea is difficult to find water

286
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,921
That 's why we are today

287
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:07,421
Review and Reflection

288
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:09,621

After school time

Selling small commodities

291
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,860
Although it comes from subsidized households

292
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,881
The original intention of sharing parents ' pressure

293
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,360
but seriously damaged the class order

294
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,921
I promise my teachers and students

295
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:24,001
In the future , we will do our filial piety in another way

296
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,621

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,001
There are no bets , only winning or losing

377

See for yourself

381
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:19,901
Is this a criticism letter

382
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,960
Throughout the story , she was smart .

383
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,401
Filial piety will make money

384
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:24,521
Such a criticism should be able to pass

385
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,421
Our children are all

386
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:26,360

I 'm really sorry

392
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:33,700
Blame me too

393
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,600
I didn 't discipline Gu Yunsu well

394
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,860
Gu Yunsu Gu Yunsu

395
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:40,001
You said you were smart

396
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,621
You 're smart and don 't have to be on the right path

397
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:42,381
Then you become

398
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,600
Sneaking and cheating

399
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,521
School is a place to study and educate people

400
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:46,261
I didn 't want you here

401
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,521
Setting up a stall for business

402
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:48,720
Do you know you 're wrong

403
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,440
I will definitely use it in the future

404
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,360
Teacher Yang

405
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:57,921
Gu Yunsu is very smart

406
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,060
You only have to talk about her once

407
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,121
She understood in her heart

408
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:02,360
She won 't do it again

409
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,200
Can you give her a chance ?

410
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,360
Gu Yunsu 's mother

411
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,421
Don 't worry .

412
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,021
I asked you about this semester

413
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:09,421
How many times have you come to school

414
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:11,320
Everyone knows you

415
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,401
Are you embarrassed

416
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:13,600
Is there any light on your face

417
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,801
I have been a teacher for so many years

418
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:16,121
I 've never seen such a skinny child before .

419
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:17,421
still a girl

420
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:22,621
Teacher Yang , it 's not easy for you

421
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,820
I really am

422
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,460
Usually I 'm too busy at work

423
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,220
He neglected to discipline Gu Yunsu

424
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,421
This is really my fault

425
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,440
I indulged her a bit

426
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,041
In the future

427
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,560
I 'll pay more attention too

428
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,460
But what about Gu Yunsu ?

429
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,161
He is actually very filial .

430
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,840
She just wants to help me

431
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,960
Share the stress of life

432
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,541
It depends on this .

433
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:44,220
Please forgive her , okay ?

434
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,801
Who isn 't busy ?

435
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:46,860
You are busy and I am busy

436
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,060
Everyone is busy

437
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,761
You can be busy

438
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,060
Don 't you educate your children

439
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,960
You take her alone

440
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,600
Of course you 're busy

441
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,820
She doesn 't have a father

442
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,220
If you ask me , you shouldn 't get a divorce

443
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,901
I 'll tell you

444
00:15:57,901 --> 00:15:59,761
You are delaying her education now

445
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,080
You 'll be too late to regret it later

446
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,921
Do you know

447
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
You 're right

448
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,681
I know

449
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:20,921
You feel sorry for me and understand me

450
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:23,560
I also know about our Susu

451
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,600
Very smart

452
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,661
Independent and capable

453
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,240
So you were in front of her just now

454
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,521
Keep criticizing me

455
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,521
That 's a teacher .

456
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,220
And under the eaves

457
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,761
I have to bow my head , right ?

458
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,161
You 're two years away from graduation .

459
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,261
Put your little tail in the future

460
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:38,080
Clamp clamping

461
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:41,100
My tail is almost pinched off

462
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,521
But isn 't she still the same

463
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:44,661
Bullying us

464
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,121
She 's not bullying you

465
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:47,060
She is a teacher

466
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:48,621
The teacher wants you at school

467
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,001
Just carefully

468
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,360
Concentrate on reading

469
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,940
Right

470
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,521
That 's what my mother thinks .

471
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:54,401
I don't want to  either

472
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:55,960
These trivial matters at home

473
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,921
Make money to influence you

474
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:59,781
Children do their things well

475
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:00,560
That 's fine

476
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:02,580
When a child is not

477
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,960
You 're going to be wronged .

478
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:09,320
Yes but

479
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,320
It will be fine when you grow up

480
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:13,220
How big is it

481
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,200
Big to your own heart

482
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,960
You can distinguish this from wrong

483
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:20,520
Wait until then

484
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:21,561
You won 't be affected by others

485
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:22,821
Lead by the nose

486
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,921
Recent results are good

487
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,121
Stable Top 3

488
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:32,800
Awesome Susu

489
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,561
Learning is not temporary .

490
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,421
Learning is a lifetime

491
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:39,220
Do you know us ?

492
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,520
Constantly improve yourself

493
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,561
What about in the future

494
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,520
Only then will you have the capital to settle down .

495
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:45,980
In this world

496
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,960
For Women

497
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,061
Self - reliance and self - improvement

498
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,260
So we must

499
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,921
Have your own voice

500
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:51,940
With the right to speak

501
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,661
We won 't be wronged anymore

502
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:55,760
Got it

503
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,700
Susu , go in first

504
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,760
Come on , it 's okay

505
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:15,881
I 'll take care of it

506
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,821
This is easy .

507
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:17,841
It 's done in one go

508
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:26,020
It 's okay , it 's okay

509
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,421
Walk Walk Inside Inside

510
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:28,561
Don 't worry Don 't worry

511
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,601
If you don 't want to do your homework now

512
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,000
You can watch TV .

513
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,960
I 'll go clean up

514
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,901
It will be fine soon

515
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,061
Mom , let me help you

516
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,061
They smashed many eggs

517
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,401
I love eggs

518
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:26,300
What a waste

519
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,361
You might as well just smash it into my bowl

520
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,861
Come on , come on the ground .

521
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:35,121
I 'll wipe it out of your reach

522
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,220
Come

523
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,621
Exactly

524
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,460
I always wanted to clean the windows

525
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,200
It 's clean now

526
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,760
So many delicious food

527
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:55,821
Mainly because

528
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:56,800
Children 's School

529
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,161
Something really happened recently

530
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:59,460
Rushed together

531
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:00,940
That kid again

532
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,740
Child

533
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:03,740
There are children in our unit

534
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,040
You 're not the only one .

535
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,520
Then why are others not like this ?

536
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,200
Yes Yes Yes

537
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,700
I 'm sorry , leader

538
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,440
I promise

539
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,841
Never make this mistake again

540
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:13,341
All right , all right

541
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:14,740
Hurry up and do your own business

542
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,540
By the way the leader

543
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,581
I suspect it 's wrong .

544
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:23,321
Yes No

545
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Watched it twice

546
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,960
Last month 's salary

547
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,040
What happened with half of the deduction ?

548
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,980
I would like to ask

549
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:32,841
You still have the nerve to ask me

550
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,540
Go out and ask about it

551
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:38,321
Which unit

552
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,821
its employees arrive late and leave early

553
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:41,740
Wages not deducted

554
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,280
Yes Yes Yes

555
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:46,240
I didn 't even bother with you

556
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:47,200
You are now reversed

557
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,341
You want to settle accounts with me , right ?

558
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:48,980
No No

559
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,800
I just asked

560
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,181
Just go on like this

561
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:54,181
See which unit dares to use you

562
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:54,800
Yes Yes Yes

563
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:55,661
Wu Limei

564
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,101
Wu Limei is from your company , right ?

565
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:57,641
Where is Wu Limei

566
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:58,280
Where is she

567
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,220
Wu Limei , where are you

568
00:20:59,220 --> 00:20:59,901
Where is she

569
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,101
Come out Wu Limei

570
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:02,821
Help me call her out

571
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,800
Wu Limei

572
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,700
Wu Limei , come out quickly

573
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,681
Your guy named Wu Limei

574
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:07,181
Where is it ?

575
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:07,800
It 's not you outside

576
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,101
What 's going on again ?

577
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,800
Solve it quickly

578
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,440
Solve it quickly

579
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,800
We 're not leaving today .

580
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:13,700
What are you still doing ?

581
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,321
Hurry up

582
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:16,540
Don 't be a shrinking turtle

583
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,440
What are you doing ?

584
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,800
What happened

585
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:20,440
Two days ago

586
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,540
Those broken photos hanging in the small square

587
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,601
I went to the video store .

588
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:25,381
Are you asking .

589
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:26,821
It 's mother and daughter

590
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:27,641
Good things done

591
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:29,381
Forget it if you 're shameless .

592
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:30,161
With her daughter

593
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:31,500
Doing such wicked things together

594
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:33,381
The upper beam is not straight and the lower beam is crooked

595
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:34,101
What 's going on

596
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,421
Don 't bring it to the company

597
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:36,661
Let 's go out and talk

598
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:38,601
What is it doing

599
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,000
You know how you want to lose your face now , right ?

600
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,220
Don 't do that in the first place

601
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,341
Dirty things

602
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:44,540
What did I do ?

603
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:45,641
Don 't think there are too many people

604
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:46,841
Then you can shout and catch the thief

605
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:48,101
You guys have a look

606
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:48,681
This person

607
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:50,101
It 's like this in the company

608
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:51,861
Who can cure her outside ?

609
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,101
Employee Wu Limei

610
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,081
With my daughter

611
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,881
Secretly taking private photos of other people 's homes

612
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,240
Still hanging in the community

613
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,581
This is illegal .

614
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:02,280
We can sue her

615
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,480
What is illegal

616
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,460
What Privacy

617
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:06,561
In broad daylight

618
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:07,540
Doing those wicked things

619
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,720
Don 't let anyone shoot it yet

620
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,540
That 's just right

621
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,101
These are the pictures that I have always carried with me

622
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:13,101
Let 's show everyone

623
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:15,121
Share it with my colleagues

624
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:15,740
What is it doing

625
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:16,740
Give us photos

626
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:18,540
Do what you do

627
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:19,980
I 'm telling you .

628
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:21,881
This is the company 's working hours

629
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,000
If you do this again

630
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,401
I 'm telling you

631
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:24,280
I called 110

632
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,581
If you don 't give us an explanation

633
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,901
We 'll make trouble right here

634
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,440
Noisy to Wu Limei

635
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,280
Until you apologize in public

636
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,861
Yes

637
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,641
Apologize to them

638
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:38,440
Let 's settle things down

639
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:40,300
I did nothing wrong

640
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,841
You should consider it for your company

641
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:45,200
This is the company 's peace of mind

642
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,361
It 's coming , it 's coming

643
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,121
Sorry

644
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,500
You didn 't eat , right ?

645
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,321
Apologize

646
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,841
You have to let the big guy

647
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:02,700
I heard it all

648
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:11,040
Sorry

649
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:14,361
I was wrong

650
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,361
That 's pretty much enough

651
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,901
OK , what about your apology

652
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:18,841
We accepted it

653
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,921
But you still need your daughter 's share

654
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,821
Why did you mention her ?

655
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:24,921
Let her apologize as well

656
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:26,141
Don 't even think about it

657
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,361
It 's quite horizontal .

658
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:29,921
I remember her daughter

659
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:32,020
It should be on Longzhou Road

660
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,381
Grade 5 of Primary School

661
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:33,740
Right

662
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,661
What are you doing

663
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:35,760
You 're mad

664
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,561
I 'll go to your daughter 's school to make trouble .

665
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:38,601
See if you dare

666
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:39,220
OK

667
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,020
What are you doing

668
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,661
Go back and tell the kids .

669
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,700
Apologize to them

670
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,500
Impossible

671
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,800
It 's your side

672
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:49,321
Teased them first

673
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:49,940
Right

674
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,921
You said your daughter was all day .

675
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
Let that school

676
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,661
Call parents over

677
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:56,121
She 's not that fuel - efficient lamp

678
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:58,020
What do you think this looks like

679
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,960
They 're running here

680
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,061
Make trouble here

681
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:01,161
No unit considered

682
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:02,641
You made me the leader

683
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:03,520
What to do ?

684
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:04,901
You tell me

685
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,561
Your class

686
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:06,921
Do you want to continue ?

687
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:08,800
Can 't get on , can 't get on

688
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,460
Can 't get on , can 't get on

689
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,061
You can 't stand any grievances .

690
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:13,861
Can 't stand it ?

691
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:23,361
Why , why , why

692
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,760
Student Gu Yunsu

693
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,960
Our mascot of Class 3

694
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,980
Future Business Tycoon

695
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,381
Already warned once last time

696
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,720
But I don 't know about repentance

697
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:45,421
Another student reported to me

698
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,121
She continues to sell small cards

699
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,081
I was out of school

700
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:50,780
Is it a problem on or off campus ?

701
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,341
You are now a student

702
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,641
Students should focus on learning

703
00:24:53,641 --> 00:24:54,321
Do you know

704
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:55,720
There are always some students .

705
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,240
To violate school rules and regulations

706
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,760
Make some

707
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,121
Disciplinary violations

708
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:01,061
Not only is it bad for yourself

709
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:02,540
It 's not good for others either

710
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,240
What do we call these students

711
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,101
Black Sheep

712
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:08,980
Louder

713
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:12,740
Black Sheep

714
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:14,980
Yes is the black sheep

715
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:16,220
But

716
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:17,500
Student Gu Yunsu

717
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:19,480
The family environment is special

718
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,401
She doesn 't have a dad

719
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:22,321
I have a father

720
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,440
Where 's your father ?

721
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:24,921
Why haven 't I seen him ?

722
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,381
A father gives birth without a father teaching

723
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:27,480
That means no father

724
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,661
Mom

725
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:31,081
Say it again

726
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,520
Gu Yunsu

727
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,740
Is this the first time she did this to you

728
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,121
You can suffer this kind of grievance

729
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,300
You didn 't say it

730
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,921
Should children suffer more grievances

731
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:46,780
Gu Yunsu 's mother

732
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,581
Let 's go to the office to talk

733
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:48,440
Say it right here

734
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,101
In front of the whole class

735
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,720
Is there a teacher like you ?

736
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,561
How old is Gu Yunsu ?

737
00:25:53,561 --> 00:25:54,181
Not only did you not

738
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:55,300
Compassion for her family

739
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:56,020
You still

740
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:57,381
And you humiliated her in public

741
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,601
Are you worthy of being a teacher ?

742
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,121
Gu Yunsu

743
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,581
Grab your bag and let 's go

744
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:10,681
Mom

745
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:11,980
Why are you mad ?

746
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:14,081
Because I don 't want to be wronged

747
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:15,681
I don 't want you to be wronged either

748
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,121
You 're not saying people are under the eaves

749
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:20,540
Do I have to bow my head

750
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,841
I lifted the eaves

751
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:22,760
I resigned

752
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:27,000
Susu , let 's move .

753
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,921
Let 's get out of here

754
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,841
Are you happy at school ?

755
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,561
I 'm not happy when you 're not happy

756
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,341
It 's certainly not our problem

757
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:36,641
The environment is wrong here

758
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:37,321
Let 's go

759
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:38,181
Fly away

760
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:39,280
I 'll find a way .

761
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,240
Change your school

762
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,300
I 'm looking for a new job as well

763
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,921
Is it good ?

764
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,220
Really

765
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,421
But where does the money come from ?

766
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,740
You resigned

767
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:51,520
There is no income either .

768
00:26:52,161 --> 00:26:52,821
What about these

769
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,581
It 's a matter for adults to worry about .

770
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:55,280
That 's right

771
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,121
I don 't want to cook tonight

772
00:26:57,141 --> 00:26:58,341
You keep clamoring for food

773
00:26:58,341 --> 00:26:59,520
What is the name of that restaurant

774
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:00,381
Anita

775
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,940
Let 's go eat Anita

776
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,040
I 'm here

777
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,921
Who 's here

778
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,921
Sister - in - law

779
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,540
Help me for ten seconds

780
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,381
Limei is here

781
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,421
Don 't even say hello to me here .

782
00:27:28,181 --> 00:27:29,700
Can I still see you after saying hello

783
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,641
What is this ? This is

784
00:27:33,621 --> 00:27:34,520
Let me see the days

785
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,401
Didn 't this just give alimony ?

786
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,681
It 's not the day yet

787
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:38,980
It 's not about maintenance this time .

788
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,740
What are you looking for ?

789
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,740
I 'm looking for a favor

790
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:49,141
Transfer Su Su to another school

791
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:50,341
Transfer

792
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:51,401
Not

793
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:52,681
Susu is studying well .

794
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:53,280
Why do you want to transfer schools

795
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,641
That must be because it 's not good .

796
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:56,280
Just ask if you can do it

797
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,480
I said it before

798
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,280
You two leave me

799
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,681
I 'm sure it 's not as good as before

800
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:01,480
Yes No

801
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:07,980
Tell me

802
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:09,720
Susu is not good

803
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:12,901
Or is it your fault

804
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,341
Susu is not good

805
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:33,181
How to do it

806
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,040
This teacher Yang says my child has no father

807
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,361
Don 't be welcome later .

808
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,081
I need to clean up

809
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:44,141
Who are you looking for , sir

810
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,121
Let me ask you who Mr. Yang is

811
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,540
Goodbye , Teacher Yang

812
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,240
Goodbye

813
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:50,440
Xin Xin

814
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:51,480
Rewriting the composition

815
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,280
Give it tomorrow

816
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,821
OK

817
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:55,020
Female Teacher

818
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:57,520
Do you still do it , brother

819
00:29:02,381 --> 00:29:03,881
What are you doing

820
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,101
Teacher Yang

821
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:06,260
That 's right

822
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,641
Mr. Yang , Class 3 , Grade 5

823
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:09,161
Who are you ?

824
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,881
Hello , Teacher Yang

825
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:15,681
I am Gu Yunsu 's father

826
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,460
You mean our children

827
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,500
No Daddy

828
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,960
This Psychology for Children

829
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,321
Hit hard

830
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:22,121
You know that

831
00:29:22,181 --> 00:29:23,940
You are Gu Yunsu 's father

832
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,500
Let me tell you

833
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,540
I 've been looking for you for a long time

834
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,280
Did you know

835
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
Every time it 's my mother

836
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,740
I said where did Dad go

837
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,381
Where 's Dad ?

838
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:31,161
Here it is

839
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:32,681
How did you become a father ?

840
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:33,841
Come with me , come to the office

841
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:34,720
Let me tell you something

842
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:35,641
also

843
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,181
Then you 're the dad

844
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,081
Who are they ?

845
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,561
Uncle

846
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,440
Uncle doesn 't need it .

847
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,121
Uncle , go back .

848
00:29:41,121 --> 00:29:41,841
Dad , come with me

849
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,240
I 'm telling you , it 's really

850
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,780
How did you become this father ?

851
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,740
Hurry up

852
00:29:48,181 --> 00:29:48,921
What should I do ?

853
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:49,921
Just wait

854
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:50,921
This father can 't be like this

855
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:51,720
You know

856
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,020
Let 's go

857
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,520
Get in the car

858
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:21,321
Come

859
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:48,280
Than this

860
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:49,460
I 'm afraid I 'll bully you

861
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:51,181
I 've never played it before

862
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,321
Choose the machine

863
00:30:52,621 --> 00:30:54,561
I 'll give you three familiar sessions

864
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,641
is it enough

865
00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:56,780
This YAN

866
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:00,480
It 's You

867
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,200
Otherwise

868
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,220
Then come straight .

869
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,020
I haven 't played it anyway

870
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:17,621
Here we go .

871
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:32,161
This is how you play it

872
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,020
Quite tired

873
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:05,161
Next

874
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,121
Yes , yes , yes , that

875
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:09,621
This can 't be dominant .

876
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,161
Next

877
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,561
How about

878
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,061
Since we lost ,

879
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,321
Do me a favor

880
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:44,821
Give this to your sister

881
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:47,141
Do you think I will

882
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:48,321
Will you give it to her ?

883
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:50,760
Men are willing to admit defeat

884
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,361
Thank you

885
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,581
Xu Wenbin asked me to give this to you

886
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,901
What

887
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:06,161
I didn 't take it apart

888
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,661
Why did you talk to Xu Wenbin

889
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:12,621
Together

890
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,821
Leave it alone

891
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,321
Li Yan

892
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:20,240
I found you recently

893
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,661
Attitude towards Xu Wenbin

894
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:23,821
Strange

895
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,401
What 's wrong

896
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,720
Because

897
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,980
I like it

898
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:50,661
Xu Wenbin looks for you again

899
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:51,901
I found you recently

900
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:53,520
Why are you so nosy ?

901
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:54,720
Stop giving hope

902
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,720
Don 't worry about me .

903
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,361
I like Gu Yunsu

904
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,061
I understand

905
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,040
I I really am

906
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,321
The response is too slow

907
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:14,921
You 're sorry .

908
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,340
I didn 't find it before

909
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:18,880
A lot of your behaviors when you think about it

910
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,021
It 's all reasonable

911
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,561
It really matched up

912
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,220
Then you say you still

913
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,280
Then the relationship between the three of us

914
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,920
Isn 't it a little awkward ?

915
00:34:28,561 --> 00:34:30,420
It 's a little awkward .

916
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,601
Li Yan

917
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:37,240
Don 't be psychologically burdened , okay

918
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,420
Come on , sister will always support you

919
00:34:53,441 --> 00:34:54,541
You have something to do

920
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,461
None

921
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:00,661
Gone

922
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:02,260
Thank you

923
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,300
I 'm not tired

924
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,380
Sometimes my hands are sore when stirring this .

925
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,700
Aunt Wu , Li Jianxiong

926
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,941
What 's wrong , Xiaoyan

927
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:31,320
Why

928
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,081
I made a decision

929
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,041
Tell me

930
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:45,041
Planning to study medicine

931
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:46,481
Do you mean

932
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:48,041
You 're taking a medical exam this year

933
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,161
Medical school is very difficult

934
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:53,041
I checked last year 's scores

935
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:54,300
Definite line

936
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:55,561
Do you want this matter

937
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:56,601
Carefully considered

938
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:57,280
Excluded

939
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,481
I made a decision

940
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:00,501
I 'm here to inform you .

941
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:02,041
I can do it

942
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,400
I went to study

943
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Dinner is skipped

944
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:06,001
I don 't even have dinner .

945
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,340
He 's going to take medical school

946
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,681
It 's very difficult to pass

947
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,800
Mei Mei

948
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,400
In the future

949
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,681
We don 't have to worry about seeing a doctor .

950
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:25,021
There are so many diseases to see

951
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:25,760
You bah bah bah

952
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,681
Yes Yes Yes

953
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:27,621
Yes Yes Yes

954
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:29,481
I want to

955
00:36:29,941 --> 00:36:30,860
This child

956
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,501
He suddenly understood his mind

957
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:34,920
Is that with Sususu

958
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,700
It had something to do with bringing him to that big drink

959
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:38,441
So that 's Dr. Xu

960
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:39,501
He is his noble person .

961
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,101
A noble person is definitely a noble person

962
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:42,740
It 's not just Li Yan

963
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,840
And the baby in my belly

964
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:46,360
To our little treasure

965
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,561
We also need Dr. Xu

966
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:48,181
And

967
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,360
Say this

968
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,800
Dr. Xu is a member of our family

969
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,340
How nice

970
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,001
I moved somewhere today

971
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,840
Why don 't you make a sound when you walk ?

972
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,001
Let me tell you

973
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,981
To see things you shouldn 't see

974
00:38:09,981 --> 00:38:11,041
You should go back inside and watch

975
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,860
Although we are father and son .

976
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,961
Should be blessed

977
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,101
But basic moral red lines

978
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:19,240
We still have to keep it .

979
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:21,161
I didn 't watch today

980
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:21,601
You

981
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,740
They 're all words , right ?

982
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,360
The words are slightly better

983
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:29,340
Well , look .

984
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,061
You don 't watch

985
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:41,601
Not only do I not look at it

986
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:42,860
I want to tell you something .

987
00:38:43,161 --> 00:38:43,740
What about you in the future

988
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,101
Read less of this stuff

989
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:46,541
You are in senior year of high school

990
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:47,800
Learning is stressful

991
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,880
Dad understands that you 're grown up now

992
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,740
It 's a man

993
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,041
But this stuff

994
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,461
Reading less may be happy

995
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,661
Looking at it will inevitably hurt your body

996
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:01,400
It looks like

997
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,141
You really don 't want to know

998
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,820
What did Aunt Wu do back then

999
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,360
Falling in love with Gu Kangqi

1000
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,800
And in that hospital

1001
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,740
How does Aunt Wu

1002
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,141
Pedal Two Boats

1003
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:15,101
That list of pros and cons

1004
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,720
There are two versions

1005
00:39:19,101 --> 00:39:19,700
Not you

1006
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,200
What are you looking at ?

1007
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:24,200
Didn 't you see it ?

1008
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:26,121
Li Yan

1009
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,700
We 've been getting along for a while , right ?

1010
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,161
Feelings should be

1011
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:33,021
It 's still very harmonious

1012
00:39:33,021 --> 00:39:34,041
Yes Yes Yes

1013
00:39:36,021 --> 00:39:37,220
Family Secrets

1014
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,340
What is secret

1015
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,360
It 's a secret than a secret

1016
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:42,860
A secret to keep secret

1017
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:47,161
This is written by your sister

1018
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:49,961
Abbreviated Family Encyclopedia

1019
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:53,740
So you send me this

1020
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,601
That won 't work

1021
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,700
You have to register yourself

1022
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,441
Update and collection

1023
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,581
One Click Three Connections

1024
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,461
Not this

1025
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,541
What is

1026
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,101
I don 't understand

1027
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:04,320
No

1028
00:40:05,181 --> 00:40:06,340
Stupid

1029
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,601
I 'll teach you

1030
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:26,200
Just in time to come , come , come , come , come , come

1031
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,141
Score

1032
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,141
You 're objectifying women

1033
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,001
Wrong

1034
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,501
That 's right

1035
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:38,860
Sorry , sorry .

1036
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:42,240
Who looks better ?

1037
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,001
It 's okay

1038
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,461
Choose well

1039
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:47,961
She

1040
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,621
What are you doing

1041
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,161
Do you see it clearly

1042
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:53,800
See clearly

1043
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,900
You didn 't see clearly

1044
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,961
Take a good look

1045
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:56,941
Let me tell you

1046
00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:58,141
You have thought about it .

1047
00:40:58,141 --> 00:41:00,081
You can 't go back on your words if you pointed it out .

1048
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:00,900
I didn 't go back on my words .

1049
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:01,860
Take a good look

1050
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:02,621
Take a look

1051
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,340
This She

1052
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:07,220
This She

1053
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,101
That

1054
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:14,400
Take a good look

1055
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,820
You have a good taste

1056
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,900
Who are these ?

1057
00:41:23,601 --> 00:41:24,461
Who is it ?

1058
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:25,141
This is me

1059
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:26,161
You

1060
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:27,541
Isn 't that like it

1061
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,300
These

1062
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,360
This is all me

1063
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,700
Look , this is all mine

1064
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,641
Why is this expression ?

1065
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,340
I understand

1066
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,501
I 'm really not very photogenic

1067
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:43,621
I want to look better

1068
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:45,141
Not

1069
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,161
If you put

1070
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:49,001
Retouching to another person

1071
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:50,081
If it is considered photogenic

1072
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:52,601
You 're so unphotogenic

1073
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,661
What did I fix ?

1074
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,541
This one

1075
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:58,001
The cultivation is a bit too much .

1076
00:41:58,081 --> 00:41:59,400
Well , look at this . I 'll tell you .

1077
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,760
I have a very nice one

1078
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,501
What are you doing

1079
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:08,860
What are you doing

1080
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,900
Why do you send such photos ?

1081
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,240
What kind of photo

1082
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:15,200
This is my highest likes

1083
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:17,340
My God

1084
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,061
Where are you going

1085
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:19,900
I 'll go to study

1086
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,780
That 's right

1087
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,521
Don 't take such photos again

1088
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,260
Interrupting my study

1089
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,181
Gu Yunsu

1090
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:32,380
Are you online

1091
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,521
Scribbling about our family affairs

1092
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:35,900
You blame Su Su

1093
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:38,061
It 's obviously because you can 't sit upright .
