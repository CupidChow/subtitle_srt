00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:42,660
Raised high

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,181
Flying

15
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:45,821
Susu is flying

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,080

Uncle and Aunt

So late

21
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,340
You guys are still awake

You take it

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,120
What about our rules ?

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,241
It looks like this

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,560
If my son brings a girlfriend

31
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,461
First visit

32
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,641
Always prepare red envelopes

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
He has this attitude

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,320
Then we are parents

37
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,660
You have to express your position .

38
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,100
Yes , yes , don 't be too nervous

39
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,380

Wen Bin is actually

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,340
It has always been one

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,940
A particularly obedient child

49
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,900
So this time he did it for you

50
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,541
With such a big change

51
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,921
We are parents

You said you Li Jianxiong

64
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:38,761
Gu Kangqi drank too much

65
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,241
Why are you joining in ?

66
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,681
You 're your size

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,840
Why don 't people worry about it ?

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,780
Hurry up

69
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,201
What is the situation

70
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,301
Are you okay

71
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:54,181
Mei Mei

72
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,840
What 's wrong

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,481
Why are you so happy ?

74
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,241
Suite

75
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,921
Special Luxury

76
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:06,421
What does it mean

77
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:08,600
I , I , I

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,840
I want to live here

79
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,361
OK , you live here

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,600
But I tell you

81
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,880
You have to thank Susu .

82
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,961
and Dr. Xiao Xu

83
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:17,041
Susu

84
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,320
During this period of time

85
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,400
It 's not easy

86
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:20,861
Think of it as

87
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,560
Let them both relax and relax

88
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,081
Relax

89
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,161
I selected a male doctor as the attending doctor

90
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
A male doctor has to do a hand examination for her .

91
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,101
Can 't relax

92
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,041
Call Susu back

93
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,380
Right now , right now

94
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,820
Li Jianxiong , please find out

95
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,481
Is it good ?

96
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,161
These two people have true feelings

97
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:42,841
You 're not a protector .

98
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:44,401
You 're ignorant

99
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:45,281
Did you know

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,401
What are you doing

101
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,700
You 're not going

102
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:51,101
I

103
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:56,080
Don 't throw up on me

104
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:04,861
This father is responsible .

105
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,760
What a shame .

106
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:12,301
Why is there a pig teammate like you ?

107
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,901
They didn 't tell me .

108
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:15,560
That 's his brother .

109
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,921
I 'm satisfied with the result

110
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,041
I 'm not satisfied

111
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:25,140
Hello

112
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:27,520
Then we have to go

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,401
I 'll be there soon

114
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,880
Who is this midnight ?

115
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,700
Who am I to tell you

116
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,041
It 's Susu looking for me .

117
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,361
What happened to Susu

118
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:41,440
Sit down

119
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:42,281
Come , come , come , come

120
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,000
You sit here

121
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,520
I

122
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,841
What about me ?

123
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,841
I thought it was you and Dr. Xu

124
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:56,721
Together

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,721
That 's why I didn 't dare to bother you .

126
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,440
Do you know

127
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,861
Sit

128
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:13,000
You said your father was a teenager until he died

129
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,601
With you

130
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:15,841
It 's your father until you die

131
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,880
But your father is like this

132
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,640
I 'm afraid you will be wronged

133
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,520
It 's not good

134
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,880
But the more you think so

135
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,401
The more I 'm getting trouble for you

136
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:25,741
I didn 't prepare a big cake for you .

137
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:29,901
OK

138
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:31,361
I want to make a wish

139
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,380
All right

140
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:43,460
All right

141
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:46,460
Guess what our daughter wished

142
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,960
It doesn 't work if you say it .

143
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,781
I know

144
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,841
Nothing to say

145
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:52,861
What about my wish ?

146
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,801
It 's simple

147
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:55,200
And it 's already implemented

148
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,041
I hope

149
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,560
You two can be like you are now

150
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:01,361
Sit next to me

151
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:04,580

That means what ?

00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,421
At least later

200
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:02,360
I won 't be thinking about it all the time

201
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,521
Very happy

202
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,360
That 's fine

203
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:14,921
What 's wrong

204
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:16,320
I 'll give it to you

205
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,041
I 'll wipe it for you

206
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,840
I 'll take a shower

207
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,820
Come out

208
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,700
Liang Er

209
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,661
Sansan

210
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:36,860
They 're all here

211
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:38,801
Three can manage two two

212
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,100
Three Big Three

213
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,240
Does it look good ?

214
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:42,840
What is it

215
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,401
What 's the fuss about

216
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:45,521
That 's what I usually wear

217
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,401
The back is pretty nice .

218
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:48,641
There is still a flower .

219
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,560
I 'm mad

220
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,580
Three triple bands versus seven

221
00:11:59,480 --> 00:11:59,980
Dad

222
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,480
Aren 't you sleepy ?

223
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:02,980
That 's right

224
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,720
Go to sleep after playing this

225
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:06,600
Are you sleepy ?

226
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:27,860
Mei Mei

227
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,021
The heater has been turned on .

228
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:30,100
Let me ask you something

229
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,661
One queen bed

230
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,060
How did you sleep

231
00:12:35,181 --> 00:12:36,460
Sleep like that

232
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,181
Sleeping

233
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,501
Not sleeping

234
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,801
I didn 't sleep a wink all night .

235
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:48,240
Last night

236
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:50,960
Forget it , I don 't want to say anything .

237
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,921
I 'm too lazy to say it

238
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:53,200
Tell me

239
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,281
Don 't be so curious .

240
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:56,761
I 'll tell you when I go back .

241
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:57,921
Let me know later

242
00:12:57,921 --> 00:12:58,720
tell you tell you

243
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,281
Go , go , get in the car quickly .

244
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:04,860
I 'd like to borrow a step from you

245
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:06,240
Why do you think about it today ?

246
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,220
Take a step from me

247
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,440
If you are rich , I will borrow it from you

248
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,281
It is said that this woman does nine men do ten .

249
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,480
This is your first birthday

250
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,440
How nice is that

251
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,121
Dad can be by your side

252
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,480
I 'm honored

253
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:25,141
Why did I hear that it was a female doing ten ?

254
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,200
Really

255
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,600
Everything 's the same

256
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,781
It 's the same if you do 10 or 9 .

257
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:30,360
The red envelope arrived late

258
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:31,720
Thank you , Dad

259
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,001
You 're welcome

260
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:34,860
It 's okay , this leg

261
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,700
No problem

262
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:38,960
All right , you go .

263
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,621
Then I 'll go .

264
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,440
Don 't compete with your mother .

265
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,281
You know what she 's like

266
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,360
It 's not like you don 't know

267
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:48,161
Go for it

268
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:49,881
I know happy days

269
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:50,921
They 're all in the back .

270
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:54,460
Don 't do this , let 's go

271
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,381
Let 's go

272
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,700
Take care of yourself .

273
00:13:58,881 --> 00:13:59,681
Don 't keep missing me

274
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Don 't drink .

275
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,200
If you can 't go to the hospital .

276
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,161
Don 't ride a motorcycle when you go back

277
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,960
Okay , I got it

278
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,301
Why don 't you stay ?

279
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,761
Gone

280
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,980
Go

281
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,580
Dr. Xiao Xu

282
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:34,381
You have worked hard this trip .

283
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,881
Over 100 kilometers round trip

284
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,141
No hard work

285
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:39,021
You and Uncle Li are not outsiders

286
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,220
Then you have worked hard .

287
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,421
It 's noisy

288
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,541
Don 't let anyone sleep

289
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:52,901
Noisy , then I 'll turn it off

290
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,080
By the way , Aunt Wu

291
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:56,200
After returning

292
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,641
It 's almost time for us to check .

293
00:14:59,021 --> 00:14:59,661
What I remember

294
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:14,580
Dr. Xiao Xu

295
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,381
Aunt Wu

296
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:18,141
Sit tight , okay

297
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,301
Did you count the fetal movement morning and evening at home ?

298
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,421
It 's normal after counting .

299
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:25,460
Monitoring fetal movement at home is important

300
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,860
Family members must pay more attention

301
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:27,621
OK

302
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,781
Gu Yunsu

303
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,480
Xiao Xu

304
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:35,360
Just now our fetal heart rate monitoring

305
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,641
I 've done it before .

306
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:37,840
b ultrasound also exceeded

307
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,801
Urine was also tested

308
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:39,681
Blood was also taken

309
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:41,600
Do you think we can

310
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,881
Go back

311
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:44,501
We can 't go back yet

312
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:46,240
Aunt Wu

313
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:47,700
I talked to you before .

314
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,381
You prefer natural delivery

315
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,820
We also did b - ultrasound today

316
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,141
No umbilical cord around the neck

317
00:15:52,141 --> 00:15:53,541
So , today we 're going to do a

318
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,580
Pelvic Measurement

319
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,360
See if it matches

320
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,340
Requirements for natural delivery

321
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:58,580
Pelvic Measurement

322
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,161
Yes

323
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,181
Not Uncle Li

324
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,440
Why do I think you are getting more and more weak ?

325
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:09,781
I can 't see you clearly .

326
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:11,021
I also think he is very weak

327
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:13,041
Am I empty ?

328
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:13,661
Virtual

329
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,161
I was in the corridor just now

330
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:16,860
When I look at you , it 's imaginary

331
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:18,940
Yeah , I 'll just say it

332
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:20,381
Uncle Li must be that one again

333
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:22,240
Pregnancy - associated syndrome occurred again

334
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,621
You 're here for my mother

335
00:16:23,621 --> 00:16:25,060
It doesn 't matter whether I am empty or not

336
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,820
I 'll get a Chinese medicine number later .

337
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,901
Let 's measure the pelvis now

338
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:32,301
Measurement of pelvis

339
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,360
Where to test

340
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:36,661
Not Uncle Li

341
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,820
Don 't worry about it .

342
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
I 've arranged it

343
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,060
I 'm sorry

344
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:40,901
Director Chen has just undergone surgery

345
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:41,360
Arrived late

346
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,820
Director Chen , sit , sit , sit

347
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:43,740
Director Chen

348
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,781
This is what I told you

349
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:46,021
Wu Limei , an elderly woman

350
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:46,641
Hello Hello

Director Chen

353

Our hospital 's maternity department

354
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,460
Leader

355
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,901
My clinical experience is similar to my master

356
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,100
It 's definitely incomparable

357
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,460
Considering your situation

358
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,781
I 'll ask my master

359
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,921
To protect you

360
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,820
Uncle Li

361
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:00,220
Uncle Li

362
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,100
That 's right

363
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,161
Xiao Xu told me before

364
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,681
This is a great thing

365
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:09,001
I 'm so happy

366
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,681
I forgot to tell you about Mei Mei

367
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,661
How do I feel

368
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:13,661
You 're worthy of it

369
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,980
Yeah , it 's clear to you now

370
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:16,740
Really

371
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,661
Director Chen is sorry

372
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,621
I 'm pregnant

373
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,361
My husband is very nervous

374
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,500
It 's okay , it 's okay

375
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,921

392
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,720
So cute

393
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:57,881
Come

394
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,561
Come on , let 's have another cup

395
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,940
Let 's dance together

396
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,421
What are you doing ?

397
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,940
Look at this

398
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,841
What is this ?

399
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,081
What is this ?

400
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:09,381
Beauty

401
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,921
There is no shortage of beauty in this world

402
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:12,960
Why bother

403
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,200
On this old elm tree

404
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,181
Competition here

405
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:19,401
Tempted

406
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,641
There 's nothing we can do

407
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,321
What 's your heart ?

408
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,440
I 'm tempted

409
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,280
You are for Susu

410
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,581
And this Xu Wenbin

411
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:28,440
So attentive

412
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,601
Who can this fool ?

413
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:31,921
You can fool someone

414
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:32,740
You can 't fool me

415
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,661
I 'll tell you

416
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,440
Who is not young and ignorant

417
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
In your heart

418
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,300
A little bit of this cinnabar mole white moonlight

419
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:40,381
This certainly allows

420
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,821
But you picked this guy

421
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:44,480
I don 't understand this .

422
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,641
Ten years older than you , don 't tell me .

423
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:47,621
You said this character

424
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,260
That 's definitely the howling of ghosts and wolves .

425
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
What is the picture ?

426
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,681
That 's your sister

427
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:56,300
Legally

428
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,780
You are brother and sister

429
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,381
Are you typing this ?

430
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,381
The edge ball of ethics

431
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,800
Don 't be persistent , right ?

432
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,061
Why should a tender cow eat old grass

433
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,161
There is no grass in the world

434
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,421
Poor digestion

435
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,901
What 's going on ?

436
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,520
Virtue and Medicine Double Help

437
00:19:18,641 --> 00:19:20,200
Empathetic

438
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,661
Li Jianxiong

439
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:32,440
In just ended

440
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,621
In our grade mock test

441
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
Compared to the previous test

442
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,821
All have made great progress

443
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:41,220
Then please come next

444
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,361
Our first place in this grade

445
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:44,561
Student Li Yan

446
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:46,061
on stage to share his

447
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,960
Learning Experience and Insights

448
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,161
Go quick , go quick

449
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:51,061
Let 's applaud a little more .

450
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,341
Come , come , come , come

451
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,520
Sorry

452
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,561
I 'm Li Yan , Class 9 , Senior Three

453
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,000
In fact , my learning method

454
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:26,300
Not much

455
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,700
Just brush questions

456
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,341
When I 'm sleepy

457
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,061
Eat a packet of instant coffee powder

458
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:36,601
directly into the stomach without adding water

459
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,101
This instant coffee is drunk like this

460
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:39,960
This results in better results

461
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:43,361
Usually , I don 't talk much either .

462
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:47,460
Was

463
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,760
Isolated bullying

464
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:50,780
What happened

465
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,240
I never heard him say it .

466
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,800
That 's right

467
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,260
My dad told me since I was a kid

468
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:58,260
Men can 't cry

469
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,760
The man 's grievances were swallowed into his stomach

470
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:04,821
So I 'll put up with it

471
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,321
But recently around me

472
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:08,401
A voice appeared

473
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,500
This voice told me

474
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,480
Don 't hold back , but fight back

475
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:14,980
Don 't give up

476
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,161
If you want to do it , you want to beat him

477
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,141
You 're uncomfortable

478
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:19,681
You have to tell them I 'm upset

479
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,540
Don 't be timid , don 't be afraid

480
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,480
How did I get here

481
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,980
How will their parents get there ?

482
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:25,480
The parents of these children are not coming

483
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,681
I 'll call the Education Bureau

484
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:27,300
Say about your school

485
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,641
There is a problem of school bullying

486
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:29,480
If you don 't realize

487
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,540
The seriousness of this matter

488
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,020
I can call 110 now

489
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,720
This sound to me

490
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,520
Critical

491
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,540
I found it too

492
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,740
My own life direction

493
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,421
Response to the hardship of the present

494
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,421
A boring and tasteless life

495
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,061
It 's also delighted

496
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,260
If you really say

497
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,300
What is the learning method that works

498
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:50,661
I think

499
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,740
I 'm confused

500
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,700
In my senior year life

501
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,500
Find that little meaning

502
00:21:58,081 --> 00:21:59,020
Find that point

503
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:01,480
Just thinking about it makes you feel happy

504
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,061
Meaning of being able to fight for

505
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,000
To me

506
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,500
This means

507
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,861
I want to say it

508
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,841
I said it

509
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:19,361
This means

510
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:37,200
An online novel

511
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,361
My Escape Plan

512
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:41,240
Original Novel Site of Shizhi Literature Network

513
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:43,500
If you have any interested students

514
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
You can take a look

515
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:46,280
I think anyway

516
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,980
It is more useful than instant coffee powder

517
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:51,321
All right , my share

518
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:52,460
That 's it .

519
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,101
Thank you

520
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,821
Come on , look at the steps

521
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:08,141
Invite me to dinner for free .

522
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,300
I haven 't asked you for money yet

523
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,280
Anyway , I also created it

524
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,800
Is your spiritual food

525
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,020
Stingy

526
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:15,901
There is no way to be poor and short ambition

527
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,220
That

528
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,540
Give me a hug of thanks

529
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:21,381
Head Office

530
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:22,960
Come

531
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,980
This is the first time I 've heard you , boy

532
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,940
You talk so much

533
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,841
The end of this model is about to sprint

534
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,940
I just discussed it with my teacher

535
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,980
Intended

536
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:57,061
Moving to School

537
00:23:58,861 --> 00:23:59,240
That

538
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:00,740
Have you visited your dormitory ?

539
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:02,260
Are you used to collective life

540
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,861
Can you get along with your classmates

541
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,621
You didn 't mean them just now

542
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,220
Teacher Li Yan calls you

543
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:13,101
Dad

544
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:17,421
Gone

545
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:21,260
Are you coming back on the weekend ?

546
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Dad will cook you a big meal

547
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,561
Invigorate Brain and Body

548
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,760
Call Dad if you have something to do

549
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:29,621
I 'm not at home . Be grown up

550
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:34,901
All right , all right , all right

551
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:36,381
Will come back .

552
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:38,780
Your son makes you mature

553
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,401
Who are you little brat ?

554
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,661
Who are you with , little brat ?

555
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:09,821
Susu , I 'm looking for you

556
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:11,581
It 's because we fled .

557
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:12,540
Made a new one

558
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,440
Project Plan

559
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,381
Take a look

560
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:18,500
To put it bluntly

561
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:20,181
I just want to

562
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:22,940
Win over Escape and You

563
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,000
What they can give you

564
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,480
I can still give it to you

565
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,081
And give more

566
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,561
This is an escape

567
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:31,200
I do

568
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,421
Has given full authority

569
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:33,681
Qin Yuxuan and the others handled it

570
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:34,921
How long did you give him

571
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Have you signed the contract yet

572
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:37,000
Did you give the money ?

573
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:40,440
In our industry

574
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,101
The contract was not signed and the money was not paid

575
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:43,440
That doesn 't count .

576
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:45,800
What is this cooperation intention ?

577
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,760
We weren 't

578
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,240
We have also intended to cooperate

579
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:49,780
Do you think that 's right ? Yes , yes , yes

580
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,460
But I 'm really sorry

581
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:52,621
I

582
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:54,500
I don 't want to just say we are

583
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,000
The cooperation was successful , right ?

584
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,641
Compromise

585
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:58,601
or sacrificed

586
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:00,061
My styles and expressions

587
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:01,121
I understand

588
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:02,960
That 's why I let you take a look .

589
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,861
Our new

590
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:05,421
What about this project plan ?

591
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:07,161
What are your expressions ?

592
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:08,161
Style

593
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,141
It 's all your way

594
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,861
We give you the greatest freedom

595
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,081
With Creative Space

596
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,061
What I said before

597
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:14,161
What 's the gimmick ?

598
00:26:14,161 --> 00:26:15,720
What explosive models set these elements

599
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:16,641
I don 't want them all

600
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,361
Do not

601
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:19,161
I 'm sure you sign up now

602
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,081
Contract allocation is very fast

603
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:24,841
I tell the truth

604
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,881
At that time , it was said that this novel

605
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:27,841
Posted on the Internet

606
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:29,240
That 's your suggestion .

607
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,561
I am particularly grateful to you

608
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:31,240
But

609
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:33,601
After all , this is already related to them

610
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,240
I 'll talk to you privately .

611
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,760
If you maintain the current heat

612
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,641
But also

613
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:42,321
It 's best to go up to a higher level

614
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,720
The increase of this contract amount

615
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,220
Still more to talk about

616
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:50,240
Why don 't I take a look first

617
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,760
This project

618
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,401
That 's it

619
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,440
Take a look first

620
00:26:56,661 --> 00:26:57,520
Are you good ?

621
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,800
I 'm back

622
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,081
This this this

623
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,280
Who is this ?

624
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,861
Aunt 's Zai Zai

625
00:27:10,181 --> 00:27:11,361
Just fell asleep

626
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,161
Where 's my aunt ?

627
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,161
Aunt just had something urgent .

628
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:17,440
She went back first

629
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,760
She went back

630
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:21,480
What about this , this and this

631
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,161
Stay at our house

632
00:27:24,081 --> 00:27:25,401
Can you click lightly ?

633
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,220
Mom

634
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,720
Your uncle is ill

635
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,401
Mom

636
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:34,960
Mom

637
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,161
Your uncle is ill

638
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,440
Aunt has to take care of the elderly by herself

639
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,200
Take care of the little ones

640
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,280
She 's too busy

641
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,661
The baby 's parents

642
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:47,480
He went abroad

643
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,361
Can 't come back again

644
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:49,260
So my aunt said

645
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,040
Just stay at our house for a few days

646
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,480
Then we 'll do her a favor

647
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,760
Stay for a few days and then leave

648
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,641
No No No

649
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,861
Since she can 't take care of it

650
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:57,800
Own children

651
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,121
Then why did she give birth to him

652
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,881
Said to let our family go .

653
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,280
Who takes care of

654
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,621
Let me say yes first

655
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:05,540
I said I 'd be your nurse .

656
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,980
I promised to take care of you

657
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,980
I 'm not responsible for taking care of him , okay

658
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,780
Gu Yunsu

659
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:12,361
You grew up

660
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
You 've never taken it

661
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,181
Did you get your Aunt 's lucky money ?

662
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,181
Do you have some conscience as a person ?

663
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:19,520
Aunt is in trouble

664
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:21,341
We have to help her

665
00:28:21,581 --> 00:28:23,260
Why are you so unrighteous ?

666
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:24,101
Let 's go again

667
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:25,720
My little baby is born .

668
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:26,540
not exactly

669
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,061
I 'm also familiar with the business

670
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,260
Isn 't that good ?

671
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,861
Row Row Row

672
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:32,960
Then I understand .

673
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,901
Well , let 's get familiar with it .

674
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:36,460
All right

675
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,341
That self experience

676
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:45,800
Find Me

677
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,181
What are you doing

678
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,641
My authorization

679
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:49,661
I have given it to you until now

680
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,240
No news from you .

681
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:51,921
You

682
00:28:51,921 --> 00:28:53,040
If you don 't want to do it

683
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,061
Just return it to me

684
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:55,381
Why are you so anxious ?

685
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,181
The project is placed with me

686
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:58,621
What are you worried about ?

687
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,020
No news for this time

688
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,901
Isn 't it just trying to

689
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,300
Help you run it ?

690
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,061
I was going to surprise you .

691
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,780
Forget about the surprise

692
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,621
Just play steady , I 'm afraid

693
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:08,540
Forget it .

694
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,740
It doesn 't matter if I tell you now

695
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,181
Good News

697
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,500
I 've already talked to Director Li

698
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,681
He was very interested

699
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:15,700
Willing to participate

700
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,220
Previous script adaptation work

701
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:19,141
Which Director Li

702
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:21,121
Which other Director Li could it be

703
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:22,280
The one you always liked

704
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,101
That Director Li

705
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,401
Ang Lee

706
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:27,601
Not

00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:28,621
Li Mo

708
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,681
Who is Li Limo

709
00:29:32,421 --> 00:29:34,460
Li Mo shoots that one

710
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,121
I 'm in a foreign country

711
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,260
Pretty pretentious

712
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,300
Is it him ?

713
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,621
What ? Anyway , it 's that

714
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:40,821

Aren 't you afraid ?

737
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,061
Can you give me a hug from your aunt ?

738
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:32,681

Do you want your mother ?

Isn 't it fine ?

756
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:53,960
How did he get to the night

757
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,200
He knew that Grandma was out

758
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:56,621
I need to pick up my mom

759
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,181
I 'm going to the ground

760
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,780
I know that

I understand Grandma

762
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,780
Think

763
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,540
You 're talking about

764
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,061
What do you want

765
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:03,901
Is it a cock ?

766
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:04,621

I want to go to the ground

770
00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:10,581
Underground

00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:11,500
To the ground

772
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:13,700
Come , come , come , come

773
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,720

Don 't cry , don 't cry , don 't cry .

778
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,581
Think about Li Yan

779
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:21,621
How did I bring it when I was a child ?

780
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:22,300
When Li Yan was young

781
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,341
I 'm divorced

782
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:24,300
I have no experience .

783
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,821
No , think about Susu when she was young .

784
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:26,861
Mom

785
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:27,661
I forgot

786
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,020
You can 't be more obedient

787
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,901
You want sugar

788
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:31,960
I gave it to you too

789
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,740
I went out and went out to play .

790
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,980
What the hell are you doing

791
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,421
What do you say you 're going to do ?

792
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,300
Your father is not here

793
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,540
Don 't cover

794
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,300
Don 't cover

795
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,460
Then we won 't cover it

796
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,061
Don 't cover it or not

797
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:50,700
I 'm moving I 'm moving

798
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:52,141
Moved

799
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:54,460
Moved , Moved

800
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,020
Moved , moved , moved

801
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:03,581
What 's the noise ? This is

802
00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:07,780
My God

803
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:09,841
Early

804
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:10,661
Early

805
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:17,141
You 're laughing .

806
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,881
Okay , don 't catch up on your sleep here

807
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:20,181
If you catch a cold , please go inside

808
00:32:20,181 --> 00:32:22,421
Uncle Li , you 're not going to work today .

809
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:23,700
It 's almost nine o'clock

810
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:31,940
Come on , come on , I 'll put it in for you

811
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,000
You pour it again

812
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,621
I don 't want to put it on my own

813
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:35,940
OK , OK , you can install it yourself

814
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,821
Go in

815
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,720
Leave it to me

816
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
Install it

817
00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:42,200
Just put it in and pour it

818
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,101
Put in and pour

819
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:43,780
Just grab a person

820
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,260
Don 't worry , I 've never been a mother .

821
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,421
Haven 't you been a cub yet ?

822
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:47,661
This is a battle of wits with adults

823
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,061
Don 't worry about that routine

824
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:49,661
Leave it to me

825
00:32:49,661 --> 00:32:51,621
Very simple , very simple

826
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,740
I can 't kill him

827
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,901
Go in

828
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,161
Well , I have to go to work .

829
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,621
Don 't panic .

830
00:32:58,621 --> 00:32:59,861
Su Su You You You

831
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:00,740
Help me take care of it

832
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,821
Mei Mei and Zai Zai

833
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,581
Thank you for your hard work

834
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,940
Bring righteousness , bring righteousness

835
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:13,260
Child

836
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,581
Mom

837
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:21,980
Mom

838
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,940
What are you doing now

839
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,500
You tell me

840
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,940
I 'm looking for Mom

841
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,081
You want to find your mother

842
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,901
You

843
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,460
Is it fine soon ?

844
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:34,421
Why don 't I call your mom

845
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,381
Do you want it

846
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,861
Call Mom

847
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,621
Xing Lai Lai Lai

848
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,101
My mother

849
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:42,861
Your son misses you

850
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:43,780
Come quickly

851
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:45,300
Come quickly , come quickly

852
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:45,921
I sent it

853
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,061
She 'll be here soon .

854
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,161
I 'll be here soon

855
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,760
Okay , okay , okay , okay

856
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:54,980
Mom

857
00:33:58,101 --> 00:33:59,181
I 'm going to hit . Run quickly

858
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:00,361
I 'm gonna bump , I 'm gonna bump , I 'm gonna bump

859
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:01,581
It 's going to bump , it 's going to bump

860
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,780
Don 't Don 't Don 't

861
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,520
Don 't hit me

862
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:11,760
Crashed

863
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,121
What are you doing

864
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,260
I just finished

865
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,420
You don 't want no no

866
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,461
Drop Drop

867
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:22,621
That 's what I 'm looking for .

868
00:34:22,621 --> 00:34:23,820
Still a little upset

869
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:24,860
My mother

870
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,420
This night will definitely be taken by him

871
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,720
I couldn 't sleep well after tossing .

872
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,181
Yes

873
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,621
Bring him to me

874
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:30,420
I put him to sleep

875
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:32,380
Can you

876
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:33,220
It 's fine

877
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,461
I can wash and change it

878
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:35,260
What 's the big deal

879
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,200
You want to breastfeed him , right ?

880
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,981
Come , come , give me , give me

881
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:37,941
I 'll do it for him later

882
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,981
Don 't worry .

883
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:41,220
My mom can 't stay up all night

884
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,700
What about you ? Get up early tomorrow

885
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,441
Isn 't that right ?

886
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:44,240
Don 't worry Uncle

887
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:45,181
Leave it to me

888
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,200
I can 't subdue him anymore .

889
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:00,900
Wu Limei

890
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,021
Wu Limei

891
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,981
Why

892
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,941
I want my mom

893
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:13,720
Cool

894
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:19,400
Sleep well

895
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,240
I don 't even believe you can sleep

896
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,360
We 're so noisy outside

897
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,561
Are you pretending ?

898
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,800
Don 't let , don 't let , don 't let

899
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:43,860
I 'll type first

900
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,380
All right , what about sister ?

901
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,181
Not my sister

902
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,360
I want to write something

903
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,420
Something very important

904
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,461
After I finish writing it

905
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:50,880
I have the money to buy you a mixer .

906
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,481
Is it good ?

907
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:52,021
OK

908
00:35:52,481 --> 00:35:53,181
Happy cooperation

909
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:54,900
Give me a palm , give me a palm

910
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,181
Take care of my children

911
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:58,681
I am much better than Wu Limei

912
00:36:02,081 --> 00:36:02,860
Do not

913
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:04,400
Don 't Don 't Don 't

914
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,641
Fishing Fish , Fishing Fish , Fishing Fish

915
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,441
Don 't hurt others with that .

916
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:07,981
Zaizai

917
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:09,581
It doesn 't matter . He 's cute .

918
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,260
I really want to be on him

919
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,501
Install a shutdown button

920
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,740
One Click

921
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,900
He will soon fall asleep

922
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:18,840
I think Zaizai is pretty good .

923
00:36:18,941 --> 00:36:20,740
Look how good he plays with others

924
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,141
Maybe when you were a kid

925
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,200
Skinnier than him

926
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,061
Impossible

927
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:26,720
I must have been so cute when I was a kid

928
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,501
And sensible

929
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,300
Or my mother

930
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,200
Why is this age

931
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,400
I have to have another one .

932
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,900
Isn 't that right ? She 's so hard .

933
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,700
It must be because

934
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,601
I was cute when I was a kid

935
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:34,641
Bewitched her

936
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,141
Good

937
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,400
Have you ever thought

938
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:45,141
Want a child of my own

939
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,300
I will not consider it for now

940
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,541
Say the truth

941
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:53,860
My own life

942
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,800
I haven 't worked it out yet

943
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,521
I can 't help it

944
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:57,101
Responsible for another person 's life

945
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,001
Can 't afford it

946
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:03,161
Do you still remember me

947
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:04,101
Refused to work

948
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:05,880
Go back to my mother without hesitation

949
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,400
It can actually be understood as

950
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:12,541
I 'm selfish and willful

951
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,780
I just want to

952
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,081
Be a little bit longer

953
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:19,840
Don 't want to face

954
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,021
So a heavy life

955
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:28,441
Then I 'll be a child with you

956
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:31,641
Line

957
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:33,101
Let 's be two selfish ghosts

958
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:50,941
Hello

959
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:55,441
You 'll have a good rest in a while

960
00:37:55,661 --> 00:37:56,920
I 'll ask Li Jianxiong later

961
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,820
Bring Zai Zai to our side

962
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,220
The past two days have been hard .

963
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,840
I have a holiday

964
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:21,860
Aren 't you a giraffe

965
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,780
You can use your tongue

966
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,860
You roll it down with your tongue

967
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:26,461
That 's not a giraffe

968
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:27,260
That 's a lizard

969
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:30,061
I especially like this

970
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:31,220
I 'm also very touching

971
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:50,360
Said he came to see me for a movie

972
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:52,041
It was just a place

973
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:52,880
Making up sleep

974
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,900
This is a little thin .

975
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Li Jianxiong

976
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,181
Before going to bed

977
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:15,621
Gave him some milk

978
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:16,740
But I heated it .

979
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:18,501
Will he

980
00:39:19,521 --> 00:39:21,621
I caught cold in my stomach when I kicked the quilt

981
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,780
Do you want to call the emergency department ?

982
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,420
You don 't need it

983
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,920
I 'll just give him some probiotics

984
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,121
OK OK

985
00:39:26,121 --> 00:39:26,720
Zaizai does not cry

986
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,581
Mom

987
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:32,820
Zai Zai Zai Zai

988
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,561
Take a look at this

989
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:35,240
Come

990
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:37,081
Shall we have a bite ?

991
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:38,320
Don 't want to eat

992
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:39,300
Don 't want to eat

993
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,700
Aunt has worked very hard .

994
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,441
Can you eat a small bite ?

995
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:47,441
All right , all right

996
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,641
Dear Zai Zai

997
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:54,760
Do you think I 'm a magician

998
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,280
Do you like it ?

999
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:57,561
It doesn 't look good

1000
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,601
Would you like to take a bite ?

1001
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:01,400
Don 't want to eat

1002
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:03,240
Give my aunt a face

1003
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,161
Come , come , come , come

1004
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,161
We are good friends

1005
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:07,720
Come here to eat . Is it not delicious ?

1006
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:10,320
Then just eat a piece of meat , okay ?

1007
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,081
Lai Zai Zai

1008
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:12,041
Don 't eat

1009
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,521
Leader

1010
00:40:18,621 --> 00:40:20,021
I didn 't rest well last night

1011
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:26,941
No , it 's okay

1012
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,860
Something happens at home

1013
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,081
Tell me about it

1014
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:31,420
What 's your work schedule for today

1015
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,700
If not busy

1016
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,081
I still want to ask for a leave

1017
00:40:35,081 --> 00:40:36,141
Go home and take care of it

1018
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,760
Leader

1019
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,820
I advise you not to take this leave .

1020
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:42,141
There 's that rumor below .

1021
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,300
Would you like to listen

1022
00:40:44,481 --> 00:40:45,320
Our Institutions

1023
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,300
Believing and spreading rumors is most taboo

1024
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,461
It 's related to your family affairs

1025
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,300
The melons in my own melon field

1026
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,260
It 's okay to eat

1027
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:55,121
Say it 's you

1028
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,941
Before , because I was busy with family matters

1029
00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:58,101
and delayed work

1030
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,661
I 'm not satisfied with this

1031
00:41:00,061 --> 00:41:01,061
You may be subsequently

1032
00:41:01,061 --> 00:41:01,981
Special attention

1033
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:03,981
Nothing happened

1034
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:05,320
I 'll leave first .

1035
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:09,181
Leader

1036
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,360
You

00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,420
Do you really want to transfer my post

1038
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,501
I want you to streamline your team .

1039
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:19,740
You mean to lay off people

1040
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:21,780
There was a meeting at the top

1041
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,700
What about contract employees

1042
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,101
No renewal of contracts

1043
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,941
