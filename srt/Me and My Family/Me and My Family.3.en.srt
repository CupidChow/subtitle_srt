Dad

00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:26,821
Hi

5
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,100
The signal over there is not good

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,540
I 'm in the car . What 's wrong ?

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,260
What about tomorrow night

8
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:35,461
Dad set up a table for a family dinner

9
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:37,301
I 'm welcoming you .

10
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:38,740
Why do you hold a family dinner ?

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,441
You 're not coming home

12
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,140
Have you come to live ?

13
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:42,060
To your Aunt Wu

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,201
The school I contacted

15
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,021
Repeat for one year

16
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:46,041
Then Dad always makes something delicious .

17
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,041
Welcome , welcome

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,341
Isn 't it before school starts ?

19
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:49,341
It 's still early

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,981
That plan can 't keep up with the change

21
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:52,180
As planned

22
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:52,960
Hang up

23
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:54,701
Li Yan Li Yan

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,941
Just do your father a favor

25
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,621
Where 's Dad ? In your name

26
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:00,500
Hosting a Family Dinner

27
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,420
But it 's not a year or a day .

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,701
I really can 't find a reason .

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,301
No help

30
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,621
At least I give birth to you and raise you .

31
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:11,661
My mother gave birth to me and raised me

32
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:13,660
The next year

33
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:15,140
Then I 'm here to raise it .

34
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,060
I 'll take care of it .

35
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,901
Let 's talk about the future later

36
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:19,821
No , no , no , no

37
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:20,741
Don 't say anything

38
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,940
People are really in trouble

39
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,940
Companies will be advanced

40
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,101
Advance of two months ' salary

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,981
Then you should consider it in advance

42
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:27,101
Please help your father

43
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,660
I can 't come back now .

44
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:30,981
Go back and forth

45
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,381

It 's really expensive

52
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,660
Dad ordered this high - speed train

53
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,080
I said your dad could

54
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,321
Buy you first class

55
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:49,241

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,300
Isn 't it all here ?

62
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,800
You want you to see how you get back

63
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,360
Seventeen - year - old young man

64
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,201
Let me tell you

65
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:17,561
The young man is growing

66
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,020
Fresh minced meat

67
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,381
Three - point fat and seven - point thin

68
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:22,281
Make a meatball

69
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,721
Reunion is a good omen

70
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,221
Thank you for good words to give me a pound

71
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:25,840
One catty

72
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,701
Pounds of beef

73
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,941
Cook a hot pot

74
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:33,761
Booming

75
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:34,680
OK OK

00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,501
Come on a chicken

Good luck

78
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,481

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,740
Fry a lotus root box and enjoy the family

80
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,701
Yes Yes Yes

81
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:54,020
OK OK

82
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:55,300
Walk slowly and come back next time

83
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:56,340
Walk slowly , Lao Li

00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,120
Come again next time

Come , come , come , come

87
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:01,101
You see

88
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:54,861
So much to prepare

89
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:59,020
You 're wearing a little too much

90
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,580
I feel a little chilly .

91
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:03,100
Do you want some hot water ?

92
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:04,340
I drank it

93
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,881
Why don 't Li Jianxiong forget it ?

94
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:09,701
It 's almost ready .

95
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,061
I 'm afraid of eating

96
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,160
When something happens at home

97
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,621
Guaranteed at the dinner table

98
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,181
Don 't be afraid

99
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:20,061
I stewed a chicken today

100
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,201
Good luck

101
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:22,321

Don 't worry .

107
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,441
OK

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,441
Happy Family

109
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:38,441
It 's coming , it 's coming

110
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:40,720
Susu is here

111
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,001
Come in quickly Come in quickly

112
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:42,840
Uncle

00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,160
Slippers are set for you

114
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,241
I 've already prepared it for you .

115
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,600
Uncle Thank You

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,640
Come to your own home

117
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,441
Don 't be stiff .

118
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,361
Come , come , come , come in

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,400
Let me pour you a glass of water

120
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,181
You are too busy at work

121
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:03,340
You should have come long ago

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,080
Your mother keeps talking about you

123
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:06,181
Come

124
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:08,001
Uncle Thank You

125
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:09,361
Whatever you want .

126
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:10,640
Take off the bag

127
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,280
It 's like going home .

128
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,261
Uncle , I 'll fry you another lotus root box

129
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:15,241
Let 's have dinner soon .

130
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:16,241
All right , I 'll call you .

131
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:16,761
Uncle Thank You

132
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,441
This chicken soup .

133
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,001
Good luck

134
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,600
Then let 's start

135
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,301
Today is not for Li Yan

136
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:04,340
Clean the wind and wash the dust

137
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:05,640
Do you want to wait for him ?

138
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:07,080
Just wait a little longer

139
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,040
Don 't wait

140
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,840
There is no reason for an elder to wait for a junior

141
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,660
Besides , the dishes will be cold if we wait .

142
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,801
The taste is affected

143
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,280
Affected Uncle Li

144
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,681
A lot of effort

145
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,001
Really not equal

146
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,821
You don 't have to wait for Come Come

147
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:21,140
Come

148
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,621
That start , start

149
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,960
Come , come , come , come

150
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,681
Eat it , eat it

151
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:28,681
Use chopsticks

152
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:32,980
You 're welcome .

153
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,001
Uncle Li has good craftsmanship

154
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,660
My mother is lucky to follow you

155
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,780
You want me to tell me

156
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,580
You should always come back

157
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,340
Try Uncle Li 's skills

158
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,381
Uncle Li is not afraid that I am addicted to it

159
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,801
I want to have a bite every day

160
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,140
What 's so hard about this

161
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,980
Uncle Li will do it for you every day

162
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:55,361
Adding a pair of chopsticks

163
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,840
Mom , I just saw this

164
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,261
The new home is really nice

165
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,660
Beautiful and tasteful

166
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:06,361
It 's a set of three patterns , right

167
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,100
Which room does Li Yan stay ?

168
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
That sleeping time

169
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:11,520
That lighting is very good

170
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:12,840
Also from Chongnan

171
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,701
And I heard that Feng Shui is also good

172
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,400
After all , I 'm repeating the college entrance examination

173
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,321
What you should pay attention to

174
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:18,400
We need to pay attention to it

175
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,501
What about that room ?

176
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,280
This is a storage room

177
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,441
The storage room cannot be occupied

178
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:30,921
What about that room

179
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,681
I 'm thinking then

180
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:33,921
It can be used as a nursery

181
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:35,881
But it 's only been two months now

182
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,001
There 's still a lot of time left

183
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:40,641
Yes , I still have time

184
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,041
Mom

185
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,840
Susu That

186
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,561
In fact , this matter

187
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,401
I didn 't want to hide it from you .

188
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:56,980
You know

189
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:01,100
It 's fine

190
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:02,641
This is originally

191
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,801
What about your family ?

192
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,561
You don 't have to tell me .

193
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
It 's our home

194
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,561
Susu

195
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,901
Eat a meatball

196
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:10,521
Our family is reunited

197
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:12,561
That didn 't mean

198
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:14,421
It takes three months to protect the fetus

199
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,521
If this is said

200
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:17,781
They said there would be

201
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,240
Moving fetal gas or something

202
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,240
So that 's what I think

203
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,801
Just be steady first

204
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:23,760
You know that

205
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:25,681
I 've heard this old saying before

206
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,701
But it 's all hidden from outsiders .

207
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,860
First hearing

208
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,141
hiding from his own daughter

209
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,000
Let 's eat a fried lotus root box

210
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,580
Our family is in harmony

211
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,161
Uncle Thank You

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,521
Uncle

213
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,141
I 'm used to it

214
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:46,480
My mom is always like this

215
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,340
What happened to her ?

216
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,260
You didn 't discuss it with me .

217
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,580
Let me know all of them

218
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,000
This comes down to it .

219
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:56,041
This is my own body

220
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,240
Right , my own womb

221
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,260
This life is not born or conceived

222
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,240
This will be discussed again

223
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,740
I have to decide myself .

224
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,860
Let 's talk about this

225
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,360
I can 't discuss this with you .

226
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,340
It 's all your own business

227
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,401
You can 't discuss it with me .

228
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,901
The first time I divorced my father

229
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:23,980
Can 't discuss with me

230
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:26,161
The second time I married my Uncle Li

231
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:27,260
I can 't discuss it again .

232
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,480
Pregnant at an advanced age

233
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,500
You can 't discuss it with me .

234
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,360
But I really can 't figure it out

235
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,181
You say these things

236
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:35,941
Think carefully

237
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:36,941
Which one is with me

238
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:37,921
It really does not matter

239
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:38,740
None of them .

240
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,901
It 's the first time I didn 't have my father

241
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,000
The second time I lost my home

242
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:43,340
Mom doesn 't have a few points left this time .

243
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,360
What are you talking about ?

244
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,740
Your mother is not dead

245
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,801
What am I missing from you ?

246
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,181
Did I grow up

247
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,521
Where did I treat you badly ?

248
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,421
OK OK

249
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,980
Let 's stop the old scores , okay

250
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,120
Yes Yes Yes

251
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,860
Mom , let me tell you something

252
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,701
My own business .

253
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,720
I broke up with Qin Yuxuan

254
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,061
The one you saw last time

255
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:04,380
Not only did we break up

256
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,141
I quit my job .

257
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:07,641
I have no income now

258
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:08,561
No savings , no place to live

259
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:13,141
That

260
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,061
A good job

261
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:17,941
Why did you resign ?

262
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:19,220
Working for several years

263
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,401
No savings at all

264
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,580
Where did the money go ?

265
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,000
What did I tell you before

266
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:24,801
Is it necessary to accumulate grain to prevent hunger ?

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,281
Did I say it for nothing ?

268
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,720
What have you done with yourself

269
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,480
What are you going to do ?

270
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,041
Let me listen to you

271
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,201
I 'm going to

272
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:40,860
Moving in with you

273
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:44,701
Didn 't Li Shugang say everything ?

274
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:45,740
Multiple pairs of chopsticks

275
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:46,781
That 's right

276
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:48,100
I 'll let you know

277
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,521
Do you think this is appropriate for yourself

278
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,901
Appropriate Appropriate

279
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:57,220
Let Susu live in the big room

280
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,321
Let Li Yan live in a small room

281
00:11:58,321 --> 00:11:59,260
I 'll go clean it up now

282
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,521
Uncle , forget it

283
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:01,181
Not you you

284
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:02,201
Don 't be busy uncle Li

285
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,860
It 's really not necessary

286
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,181
What do you think of my mother ?

287
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,781
What kind of maternal love is overflowing ?

288
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:14,021
It 's all lip service

289
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,541
When I heard that I had no place to live

290
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:16,620
It 's all scolding

291
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:18,220
Not a word of concern

292
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,561
She 's afraid of me

293
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:21,620
Drag herself down

294
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:24,061
dragged down her new home

295
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,100
What are you talking about ? You

296
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:27,860
Why are you like your father ?

297
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:28,661
You will always be

298
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:29,500
You are self - righteous

299
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,620
Isn 't that the man you 're looking for ?

300
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:32,201
Can you rely on me

301
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,521
But

302
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:34,541
You were right to hide it from me

303
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:35,701
Ever since I knew you were pregnant

304
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:36,821
Every time I see you

305
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,100
I 'll make you angry every time

306
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:39,580
What about today 's meal

307
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,580
I understand , too

308
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:41,260
Don 't worry

309
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,580
I won 't live with you

310
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:43,860
I won 't chew on your old .

311
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:45,521
Lest you move your fetal gas

312
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:49,360
Uncle , I 'm leaving .

313
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,840
Look , Susu , you 're here today

314
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,641
Are you here to mess with me ?

315
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:54,240
You

316
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:55,720
For this meal

317
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,880
Uncle Li and I

318
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,061
I have been busy all day

319
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:58,641
Did you know

320
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,141
Can you show your conscience ?

321
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,321
Susu

322
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,061
Mom is pregnant now

323
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:05,061
Your hormones are not stable

324
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:06,161
You are considerate , too .

325
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:08,541
Mei Mei , please calm down too

326
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:09,541
Blood Relatives

327
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:10,980
What are you saying ?

328
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,080
Family

329
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,201
Just dragging each other down

330
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:13,801
Support each other

331
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:14,360
Thank you Uncle Li

332
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,781
That

333
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:15,600
Uncle , I 'm leaving

334
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,120
Susu

335
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:18,521
That Susu is nothing more than one

336
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:19,480
Transition Period of Business

337
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:21,521
Then when it comes to burdensome , when it comes to drag

338
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,000
Then I didn 't get into college

339
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,801
Son who came back to repeat his studies

340
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:24,921
Isn 't that a burden ?

341
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,521
Then I 'll go

342
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:35,641
In fact

343
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:38,340
I also want to congratulate her

344
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,281
Then pick a set

345
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:41,441
Expensive baby clothes

346
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,360
Congratulations

347
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,301
But I 'm twenty-eight this year .

348
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,181
Order a cup of coffee

349
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:48,541
It takes five minutes to struggle

350
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
In the end , because

351
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,240
I can 't give up the thirty or so dollars

352
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,941
Given up

353
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:54,141
Tolerance

354
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,220
Someone who always has spare capacity

355
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,661
A good quality

356
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,141
But I 'm under too much pressure .

357
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,620
I can 't help it anymore

358
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,500
Leisurely do a

359
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,600
A filial daughter

360
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,541
I didn 't know I was like this

361
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:11,521
Can I still get Wu Limei 's love ?

362
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:13,561
Come on

363
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:14,541
You look sad

364
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:15,301
Have a drink

365
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
One cup is not enough

366
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:20,521
Expand and talk about it

367
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,521
I just think my mom has changed

368
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,000
You remember me before

369
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,880
I told you before

370
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,880
My mom never asked me

371
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,480
Strive to be the top in learning

372
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:38,161
The other parents

373
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:39,600
Something that seems like playing with things

374
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,120
She never interferes .

375
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:42,960
Because in her opinion

376
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,201
I find something I love

377
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:46,120
More important than the score of the exam

378
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,880
Just such a mother

379
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:48,720
Right

380
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,840
Unlike other parents

381
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:50,960
Isn 't that cool

382
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:51,821
Indeed

383
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,201
What about now

384
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,821
After knowing that I 'm not doing well

385
00:14:58,801 --> 00:15:00,260
Not a word of concern

386
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,880
It 's all disgusting

387
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:03,281
Custom

388
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:05,921
So you are

389
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:08,701
I 'm angry that her attitude is not as good as you want .

390
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,840
I still think she has become vulgar

391
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,441
It 's not cool .

392
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,220
I 'm just mad at her

393
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:17,840
Changed

394
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,681
Have a new husband

395
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:23,260
New Home

396
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:24,801
New Child

397
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,821
It 's not that

398
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:28,600
Someone I 'm dependent on .

399
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,181
Bye , see you tomorrow

400
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:33,360
See you tomorrow

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,281
Bye bye

402
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:36,321
Goodbye , Uncle Security

403
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:36,880
Goodbye

404
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,521
Gu Yunsu

405
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,500
Did you go to the ballroom again ?

406
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:44,000
Then we get off work at four o'clock in our factory

407
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,401
Pick you up from school at 5:30

408
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,281
This time

409
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:48,000
I always have to find a place to spend my time .

410
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,360
Then you can 't remove your makeup

411
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,441
Do you want to change clothes ?

412
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:51,941
Students laughed at me

413
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,041
Who laughs at you ?

414
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,960
Laugh at your mother for being young and beautiful

415
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,880
Dominate

416
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:58,661
Okay , I got it

417
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,941
Pay attention next time .

418
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:01,161
Mom

419
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,240
I wrote a composition

420
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,161
Won the second prize in the municipal competition

421
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,120
Really

422
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:07,521
I remember you before

423
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:08,561
Very poor composition

424
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,141
Why did you suddenly make great progress ?

425
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:13,260
Because of family changes

426
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,120
I 'm mature

427
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:17,041
Susu , you promised Mom

428
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:19,360
It 's not too hard to study .

429
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,340
We can stay in the middle of the table

430
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,260
Never strive for the top

431
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:25,401
Your age

432
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,880
Just play happily

433
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,921
Play like crazy

434
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,821
Then I 'll try my best to regress .

435
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,521
Yes

436
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,401
What do you write in your composition

437
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,561
Writing You

438
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,220
What is it about me

439
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:39,620
I 'll see it for you .

440
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:45,301
My mother

441
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:47,561
Mom 's Story

442
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:49,701
Start with the temple

443
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:52,441
I went to the temple in the mountains one year

444
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,801
Taoist uncle said

445
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:55,281
My mother is a

446
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,321
Fairy falling from the clouds

447
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,521
I 'm convinced of this

448
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:00,480
Fresh must be fresh

449
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,980
Boss

450
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,201
I see this fish

451
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,201
It seems to be dying

452
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,441
I take it for the price of a dead fish

453
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:04,921
Is it good ?

454
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:05,720
Don 't talk nonsense

455
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,760
Alive and well

456
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,360
This is all turning your belly . Look at it

457
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,021
What are you doing

458
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,441
Don 't poke it .

459
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:12,260
Let me tell you .

460
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,800
If you want to kill it

461
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,341
But at the price of killing alive

462
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,341
There 's a grass carp over there .

463
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:17,960
Do you want it ?

464
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:20,161
The grass carp has too many spines

465
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,701
Mom , are you listening ?

466
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:23,800
I 'm listening , listening

467
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,720
Okay , I 'll go and see it again

468
00:17:27,341 --> 00:17:27,701
Take a look

469
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:28,980
Is there any other fish ?

470
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:31,161
The fairy in my heart

471
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:32,401
It should be beautiful

472
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:33,760
Mom 's Beauty

473
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,861
There is proof of our neighbors

474
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:38,560
Although she always dresses elegantly

475
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:39,800
Dress Up

476
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,320
But everyone sees her

477
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,681
Can 't help but be amazed

478
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:45,560
This clothes is really dirty

479
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,381
The fairy in my heart

480
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:48,760
You should be happy

481
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,560
Carefree

482
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,320
This is how mom is

483
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:52,641
Always smiling

484
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:54,401
Facing everyone and everything

485
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,000
As if she were the world

486
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,201
The Happiest

487
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,921
Does Susu have any homework

488
00:17:58,921 --> 00:17:59,540
Yes

489
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,361
Do your homework first

490
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:01,401
I 'll cook for you .

491
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:03,960
Come , come , come , come

492
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,081
That 's what I 'm telling you about .

493
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,161
Every day

494
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,460
Beautifully dressed

495
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,500
Run to the dance hall

496
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,560
You say a

497
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,980
A divorced woman

498
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,641
Not self - love at all

499
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,800
I saw her that day

500
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,601
Wear a big red dress

501
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:17,280
Really

502
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:18,760
Put on heavy makeup

503
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,780
What about today

504
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,280
I 'll stir - fry the vegetables for you .

505
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,901
Is it good ?

506
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,181
Let 's not add those

507
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:24,040
Seasoning and so on

508
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,040
Susu

509
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,901
Who initiated the divorce first

510
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:27,280
That must be a man

511
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,921
Just look at it

512
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:30,720
Whose gentlemen are you ?

513
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,000
Would you like to keep such a woman at home

514
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,960
Your gentlemen are willing

515
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,320
Your gentlemen are willing

516
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:36,000
It really is

517
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:37,581
Today

518
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:39,921
Wear this skirt

519
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,500
Wear it here here

520
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:43,841
Stop talking

521
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:44,520
Susu

522
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:45,601
What to do

523
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,320
Not

524
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,980
You didn 't see

525
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,361
There 's someone standing here .

526
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,500
How did your mother teach you ?

527
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,701
Did you do it on purpose ?

528
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:56,460
No tutoring at all is really

529
00:18:58,601 --> 00:18:59,720
Troublesome

530
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:05,480
Children are ignorant

531
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,040
Splashing water on the outside is fine .

532
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:09,181
You adult , you don 't have eyes

533
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,520
Look at the splashed on me

534
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,881
What do you say about our children ?

535
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,161
How about our children

536
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:14,280
You need to take care of it

537
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,601
Do you want to

538
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:15,800
Take care of her reading and writing

539
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,280
I 'll take care of my children myself

540
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:18,361
You 're so funny

541
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:19,960
I splashed water in front of my house

542
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:21,841
I 'll splash as much as I want

543
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,361
What does it have to do with you

544
00:19:23,381 --> 00:19:24,361
You 're still at my door

545
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:24,960
Hanging clothes

546
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,280
I think you 're hiding my light .

547
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:27,740
Forget it , forget it

548
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:28,921
Your clothesline

549
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,760
How do I want to dry

550
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,520
I 'll just dry it .

551
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,421
Okay , then I can splash it if I want

552
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,000
Susulai

553
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,921
We 'll fetch water .

554
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,220
Where to pour the next basin of water

555
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,381
I don 't know .

556
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,820
Forget it , forget it , go , go , go

557
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,040
Forget it , forget it

558
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,141
People without quality

559
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,121
You talk to death every day .

560
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:43,960
Walk , walk , walk

561
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,841
Forget it , forget it

562
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:45,601
Amazing

563
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,921
Scold your mother for giving her face

564
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:50,201
Go

565
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:52,641
Don 't do homework and watch TV

566
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:53,480
OK

567
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,681
Mei Mei

568
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,040
When Susu came in earlier

569
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,181
Holding a box

570
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:05,201
Maybe I was angry when I went out .

571
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,881
I forgot to take it in anger

572
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:07,760
Look at this

573
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:08,960
Then put it here

574
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,960
These Gloves Woolen Gloves

575
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:30,201
I bought it for her at winter camp

576
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,921
I said if you knit

577
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:33,121
You knit me a set

578
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:34,240
Then I 'll learn it .

579
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,280
No No

580
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,000
This Apple Tablet

581
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,760
It can still be booted

582
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,881
In middle school

583
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:39,681
I gave her it

584
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,720
What kind of certificate is this ?

585
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,661
Good composition

586
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,121
Always winning awards

587
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,240
What is this

588
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:49,601
This is

589
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,480
It 's called Polaroid , right ?

590
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,000
You gave this to Susu .

591
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:54,800
In elementary school

592
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,621
I bought it for her

593
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,760
You gave her a Polaroid when you were in primary school

594
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,121
Yeah , what 's the use ?

595
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,000
What 's the use of being kind to her ?

596
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,760
Isn 't it the same way ?

597
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,641
It really is .

598
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,520
Wonderful Mom

599
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:09,000
It 's this

600
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,520
What about the Polaroid photos

601
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,220
Yes

602
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:21,161
When my mom was young

603
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,760
Yes Yes Yes

604
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,040
I was so young back then

605
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:34,101
This is this

606
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,401
The way I see you

607
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,040
How young you were then

608
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:42,381
It 's still the same beauty

609
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:43,300
My Mei Mei

610
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,740
Jingjing 's best friend

611
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Two people can 't wait for it

612
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,240
Together Every Day

613
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,601
Little Susu

614
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:55,161
At that time

615
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:56,421
This is how she looks

616
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:09,921
She was this evening

617
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,201
I 'm going to stay there .

618
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,240
You can see this

619
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:20,841
I don 't know about my daughter .

620
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:24,260
Then we should make the room

621
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,520
Clean it up for her .

622
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,480
OK

623
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:32,421
OK

624
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:33,161
That

625
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,601
No , no , no , no

626
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:35,760
This makes Li Yanzhu

627
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,320
Li Yan is very important to him now

628
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,201
For storage room

629
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,760
You listen to me

630
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:42,201
I think you 'd better not read it

631
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,881
Is that me ?

632
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,520
Eight poles can 't hit one piece

633
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,841
I 'm beautiful except for your mother

634
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:51,000
You used to be almost

635
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,921
That 's it

636
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,841
That was before divorcing your father

637
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,621
You don 't have to go around in society

638
00:22:57,621 --> 00:22:58,740
That 's different now .

639
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,921
Now you know

640
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:03,441
Divorce impulsively

641
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:04,320
I regret it now

642
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,681
I don 't regret it

643
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,000
I 'm happy now

644
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,081
Living happily

645
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:09,480
You don 't like it

646
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,681
Neither

647
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:13,560
Do you think your mother has changed ?

648
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,040
None

649
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,941
It 's the same way as before

650
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:17,921
Easy to get high scores

651
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:21,280
I 'll tell you

652
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,341
Don 't learn

653
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:23,040
Strive for the Top

654
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,960
You 're doing this all for your grades

655
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,881
Whatever it takes is .

656
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:27,000
That 's right

657
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:27,960
Next Monday

658
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,520
I have to attend the school conference

659
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,581
Read that composition aloud

660
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:32,161
The teacher wants you to attend

661
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:33,121
Are you going

662
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,520
If I go

663
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,641
When your teacher sees me

664
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:36,901
Gu Yunsu 's mother

665
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:37,960
It 's not what she wrote

666
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,861
This is revealed

667
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:40,341
You can be like that

668
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,641
You told me to act

669
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,720
Then what good do I get ?

670
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,000
I used to pester you

671
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,941
Buy those little boots

672
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:49,760
I don 't want it .

673
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:51,720
Transaction

674
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:55,161
Then remember

675
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,720
Dress elegantly at that time

676
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:57,760
Dress Up

677
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,040
Be like a fairy

678
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,141
Okay , then tell me about it

679
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:02,040
What else is being a fairy

680
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,000
Specific requirements

681
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,601
Don 't wear such red lips

682
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,040
Don 't wear high heels either

683
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:10,720
Do not use heavy makeup

684
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:11,960
Not to mention big waves

685
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,661
Don 't want that either

686
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:13,960
Sparkling fart skirt

687
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:17,181
Straight hair and light makeup

688
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,081
Wear a plain gauze skirt

689
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,520
The Fairy in You

690
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,441
That 's it

691
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,641
It 's boring

692
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:27,201
What about you

693
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:28,921
Explosive head

694
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:30,641
Smoky Makeup

695
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:33,240
Wear black lipstick

696
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
This is called a fairy

697
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,520
This is the fairy

698
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:37,841
Dress up and shine

699
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:38,800
That 's exciting .

700
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:41,681
Eat your eggs quickly

701
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,820
Look , I 'm just talking .

702
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,980
Being empty nesters

703
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:21,460
This is a bit lonely .

704
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:23,161
This is a swarm of bees

705
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,480
It 's very exciting .

706
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,520
Will she ever come back

707
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:29,320
She just misunderstood

708
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,601
Think you 're doing it for money

709
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:31,540
Are you anxious with her ?

710
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,901
Am I like that ?

711
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:33,980
Of course you 're not .

712
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,901
Don 't I know yet

713
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,780
But what about you tonight

714
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:38,161
That 's true .

715
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:39,480
This is a little quick temper

716
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,240
You two have the same temper

717
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,240
It will explode at one point

718
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,361
The later words

719
00:25:43,361 --> 00:25:45,081
Every sentence pokes each other 's hearts

720
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:45,740
Don 't you think this is just

721
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,941
They just froze together

722
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:49,681
I think so

723
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:51,280
Tonight

724
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:55,081
This fried lotus root box is damaged by blowing up

725
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,800
Fried Lotus Root Box

726
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:58,121
Isn 't this bombing ?

727
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,861
That doesn 't sound very auspicious

728
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:02,740
It 's my fault after all .

729
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,460
Blame me

730
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:06,841
Gu Yunsu and I

731
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:08,681
I never did it for money

732
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:09,720
I had a fight with her

733
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:10,960
I 'm anxious today

734
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,581
You know that

735
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:12,780
A good job you say you

736
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:16,121
What I suffered before

737
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:17,161
I don 't want her anymore

738
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:18,401
All over again

739
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,800
This is a fight for money

740
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,000
jumping up and down

741
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:23,361
What a pain this is .

742
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:25,240
I really did it for her good .

743
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:26,560
Understand Mei Mei

744
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,760
Listen to me

745
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,720
First of all , what you just said

746
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
This is the case

747
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,000
It won 't appear again

748
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Wait for Susu to move in

749
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,121
She will understand you slowly

750
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,040
It 's all owed

751
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:46,121
Li Jianxiong

752
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:48,441
Put those glasses on for me .

753
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:49,861
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come

754
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:58,560
I 'm not going to my mom

755
00:26:59,121 --> 00:26:59,881
You don 't go to her place

756
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:00,760
Where are you going ?

757
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,240
I 've been arguing with her like that

758
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,441
Mother and daughter broke up

759
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:04,941
If I go now , I just bow my head

760
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:05,800
I won 't do it

761
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:07,560
Men are a disaster

762
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,341
This is related to Uncle Li

763
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:09,381
It doesn 't matter .

764
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,841
You too

765
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,020
Mainly to anger your mother

766
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,980
Have a new baby

767
00:27:14,121 --> 00:27:15,581
Forget you old baby

768
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:17,720
Can you talk properly and annoy ?

769
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:19,201
Then go to my house

770
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,960
I won 't delay your night .

771
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:26,081
Where are you going ?

772
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:27,740
Don 't worry

773
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,800
This is a great world

774
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,161
Could there be no place where I can go ?

775
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,141
Heaven and Earth are great

776
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:32,820
You spend money everywhere you go

777
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
There 's another curse

778
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:39,121
You go to your dad

779
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,280
He can 't get pregnant .

780
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:43,881
Walk

781
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:45,300
Open Door

782
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,401
Drive it yourself

783
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,681
Help me

784
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,000
Dad

785
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:15,760
Who is this ?

786
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:18,161
It 's good to run

787
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:19,881
Immediately

788
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,901
You smell too strong .

789
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,181
You drank too much last night

790
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,121
Idle is also idle

791
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:29,000
You don 't come to see me either

792
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:31,280
Am I not here ?

793
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,161
OK OK

794
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:34,141
Stop

795
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,641
OK

796
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:54,040
What brings you here ?

797
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,320
Come on , hug me

798
00:28:57,581 --> 00:28:58,040
All right

799
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,081
French French French

800
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,040
Okay , you smell too bad

801
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,161
Walk , walk , walk

802
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:04,740
What are you drinking ?

803
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,240
This is nutritious

804
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:07,881
This is protein powder with coffee

805
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,401
Chicken tail protein powder

806
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,520
It tastes much better than just drinking protein powder

807
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,240
Come and try it

808
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
No No No No

809
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,720
You belong to

810
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,201
What kind of health care is it ?

811
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,000
This is morning C and evening A

812
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,280
Hard Shell Health

813
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:23,040
You mean hard - checking , right ?

814
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
It 's hard anyway

815
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,760
Look at your father 's current body

816
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,560
How hard

817
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,201
You 're young .

818
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:34,401
I want to keep practicing like this

819
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:35,121
Let me tell you

820
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,820
I 'm almost your brother .

821
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:42,760
Take a look

822
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:52,960
You usually sure

823
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,921
Not at this level

824
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,280
Mainly because of hangover

825
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,361
Right

826
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:59,201
I 'll take what my daughter gave you .

827
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,240
You 're really good .

828
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:09,641
Why are you here ?

829
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:12,520
I miss you ? Look at you

830
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:16,401
How are you doing ?

831
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,401
OK

832
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,240
Is there anything

833
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:23,960
It 's an attempt

834
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,401
What can I do ?

835
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,921
I just miss father and daughter

836
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:28,161
Exchange the current situation

837
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:30,460
Invite me to a meal at Jiangnan Station

838
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,040
It 's too expensive and I have no money

839
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,040
Then I 'll treat you

840
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:34,881
Who told me to be your father ?

841
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,800
You have money

842
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,480
Isn 't your father rich ?

843
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:39,320
Business has been good recently

844
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,240
Wind and water are flourishing

845
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,101
Earn money and play

846
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,441
It 's enough to eat and drink

847
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:47,161
What bicycle do you want

848
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:49,240
How is your relationship status

849
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:55,320
Look at my good body

850
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:57,601
I don 't know who it is reserved for .

851
00:30:57,841 --> 00:30:59,161
You see , there are zits .

852
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:00,520
That means there isn 't , right ?

853
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:02,601
Old Man Gu who lives alone

854
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,720
Knock at the Door

855
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,800
But there 's a lot of people .

856
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:06,980
I know

857
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,720
There will be someone soon

858
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,560
Knocking on your door

859
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:09,341
Who is it ?

860
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:11,980
Dad , please sit first

861
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,040
Come on , come on , listen to what I 'm telling you

862
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,560
Don 't squeeze pimples

863
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,441
No acne at all

864
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,121
Sit , sit , sit , sit , your skin is so good

865
00:31:19,081 --> 00:31:19,841
Caught up

866
00:31:20,121 --> 00:31:21,701
I recently have a  on hand

867
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:23,540
An investment plan for a business

868
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,460
Especially for you

869
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,260
Are you entering now

870
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,401
It is a bottom purchase

871
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:27,560
Steady profit without loss

872
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:30,560
Why does it sound like a pit ?

873
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
You tell me and I 'll listen to it

874
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:34,201
You vote for me

875
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,960
You vote for me

876
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:38,040
I 've voted for you for almost thirty years .

877
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:38,800
How to vote

878
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,520
I 'm telling you Dad

879
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,121
If you don 't vote for me this time

880
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,800
I 'm really desperate .

881
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:49,800
I just resigned

882
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,601
Now unemployed and lovelorn

883
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:53,320
There is no place to live .

884
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,520
It doesn 't matter what you want

885
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:57,601
I can say that I have nothing left

886
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,040
That 's all

887
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:08,960
I thought

888
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,720
Your mother asked you to come .

889
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,581
What do you do with this

890
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:13,560
Don 't go to your mother .

891
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,460
My mom is now

892
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,161
She 's not exactly my mother anymore

893
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:17,320
She 's married

894
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,921
Become someone else 's wife

895
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,841
Her home

896
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:21,000
It 's not exactly my home anymore

897
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,040
But you 're different .

898
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:22,720
Dad

899
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,560
My father , right ?

900
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,280
You 've been where you were .

901
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:29,000
Not only are you home in place

902
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:30,240
What you look like

903
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:31,480
Your temperament

904
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:32,760
You 're all where you are

905
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,201
How energetic you are

906
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,601
You still have pimples

907
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:37,421
Are you your age ?

908
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:38,921
How many people have acne ?

909
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,020
As soon as I walked in

910
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,641
Swear to tell the truth

911
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:42,341
I looked around

912
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:43,881
I couldn 't find out which one is you

913
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:44,421
Really

914
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:45,141
I have a look

915
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:46,540
A row of handsome guys

916
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,841
This is my dad

917
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,760
I 'm telling you this .

918
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:51,901
It sounds like a pit

919
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,161
But why am I so happy ?

920
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:54,060
By no means

921
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,121
What I said is true

922
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,161
I beg you to stop practicing

923
00:32:57,161 --> 00:32:58,641
If you practice again , you will really become my brother

924
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:00,000
Just look for me . Take it

925
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,881
Come

926
00:33:00,901 --> 00:33:01,381
OK

927
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:03,040
Where 's the luggage

928
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:04,201
Put it in front of your door

929
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:06,040
It 's my daughter

930
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,881
Let 's cut it first and then let 's go

931
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:08,320
Go

932
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
We can relax

933
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,720
Let 's eat at Jiangnan Inn first

934
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,560
Go

935
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:12,280
Go

936
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:16,201
Come , come home

937
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,320
Good

938
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,681
Haven 't been here for years

939
00:33:18,841 --> 00:33:19,800
Full of memories

940
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,201
The key is that people have not changed

941
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:22,960
It 's still changed

942
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,560
We used to raise fish and now we raise turtles

943
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,881
Turtles are easy to raise

944
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,000
Now I only keep good ones

945
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,121
Do you still live in your old house ?

946
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:31,921
Line

947
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:32,841
Yourself

948
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:34,441
It 's pretty good .

949
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,841
You 're not worse than my mother .

950
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Does your mother clean up ?

951
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:40,560
Your mother is here , and I will clean up .

952
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,121
You 're not at home

953
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:06,641
I 'm a mess

954
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:07,500
Something is piled up

955
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,121
Sofa bed

956
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,401
You spend the night first

957
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:11,941
And then tomorrow

958
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:13,081
I asked someone to clean it up .

959
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:18,880
You still have this hobby

960
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:19,740
Give it to me

961
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,840
Give me

962
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,280
What is this rope used for

963
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,260
This rope for hanging clothes

964
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:25,400
What do you say you 're doing ?

965
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,780
OK , OK , OK

966
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:29,360
They 're all adults .

967
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,021
There 's nothing we can 't talk about

968
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,001
It 's fine

969
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,681
I think you 're doing fine now

970
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:35,641
I 'm happy too

971
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,320
What 's wrong

972
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,720
You and your father are living now

973
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,601
It 's not awkward , right ?

974
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:39,760
What 's wrong with me

975
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,701
You 're not going to ask

976
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:41,681
I 'm going to be here

977
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:42,601
How long does it stay

978
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,001
You can stay as long as you want

979
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:44,800
This is your home

980
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Of course it depends on your mood .

981
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:49,840
If you are not happy , you may have to leave at any time

982
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:51,601
Is holding grudge holding grudge ?

983
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,800
All these years

984
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,280
You still mentioned this to me , right ?

985
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:55,720
Unforgettable

986
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,961
If it weren 't for you

987
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:57,840
I can be here

988
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,001
Does this prodigal son live ?

989
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:01,920
Thank you

990
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:02,860
Row Row Row

991
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,081
It 's exciting , right ?

992
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,121
Then we two

993
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:06,220
Today happens to have time

994
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,201
Do you want to take the past ?

995
00:35:07,201 --> 00:35:08,800
Explain it one by one

996
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:09,920
Get Get Get

997
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,360
Surrender without talking about this

998
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,920
Is it good ?

999
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:15,081
Your mother has probably forgotten .

1000
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:16,920
You forgot , too , and I forgot , too .

1001
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,240
We 'll start a new life

1002
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,360
Forgot

1003
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:21,440
Do you want to program on the hour

1004
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,121
Yes , give me a glass of forgetting love water

1005
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:28,001
Give me a glass of forgetting love water

1006
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,081
If I won 't be sad all my life

1007
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:30,760
Waiting

1008
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,001
More fruit

1009
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,940
OK , OK , OK

1010
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,481
Mei Mei

1011
00:35:43,961 --> 00:35:44,601
You

1012
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:46,440
Keep your legs warm as well

1013
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,800
I 'm not cold at all

1014
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:51,121
What 's wrong with you now

1015
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,121
Can 't give birth

1016
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,400
Know Know Know

1017
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:55,760
What are you looking at ?

1018
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,481
I 'll clean it up .

1019
00:35:58,601 --> 00:35:59,880
Articles written by Susu

1020
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,760
Just the one in her box

1021
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,880
I helped her tidy up

1022
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:05,001
Idle is also idle

1023
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,840
Is this a novel written by Susu

1024
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,400
Yeah

1025
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,701
The writing style is very good since childhood

1026
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:12,840
I went to her

1027
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,260
What about the composition commendation ceremony

1028
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:20,141
Gone

1029
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:21,961
Went to pick up our Susu

1030
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:24,601
Get out of the car politely

1031
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,800
Give me a courtesy and pull over

1032
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:35,581
Here we go .

1033
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,440
Mr. Gu

1034
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:39,081
Come , come , come , Mr. Ding

1035
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:39,681
Boss Ding

1036
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:41,121
We have to have a good time today

1037
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:41,920
Please inside

1038
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,601
Don 't return until you get drunk

1039
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,840
All right , let 's agree .

1040
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,661
Can 't refuse tonight

1041
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:19,081
Come in pairs

1042
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:20,961
Come , come , come , come

1043
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,280
Why are you here ?

1044
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:27,280
Gu Kangqi

1045
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,141
You keep telling me

1046
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,561
You are on a business trip

1047
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,601
As a result , you just lied to me

1048
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:33,800
You just don 't want to give me support

1049
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,320
Not

1050
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,360
I just came back from other places

1051
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,280
As soon as the result comes back

1052
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,300
I will accompany you

1053
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,840
Accompanying my big client

1054
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,800
Money , he can only help me

1055
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,641
He helped me

1056
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:44,280
When I return the money , I can give it to you

1057
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,001
Is it good ?

1058
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:45,720
Don 't come here

1059
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:47,161
You always say this

1060
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:47,961
Accompanying Mr. Wang last month

1061
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,001
Last month with General Manager Li

1062
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,001
I 'm too lazy to listen to it anymore

1063
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,161
I just want to get my money today

1064
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:51,961
Receive maintenance payment

1065
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,041
Of course I have to accompany someone every month

1066
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,400
I don 't accompany anyone with my money

1067
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,360
You don 't do business , you don 't know

1068
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,481
This money is in the business

1069
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:58,661
Rolling back and forth

1070
00:37:58,661 --> 00:37:59,420
Do you understand

1071
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,280
I don 't understand

1072
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,121
All I know is that the law says it

1073
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:03,601
You should be on time every month

1074
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:04,081
On a monthly basis

1075
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,240
You 're gonna pay for me

1076
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,280
Maintenance payment

1077
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,561
The law is dead

1078
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:09,601
Are we living ?

1079
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,961
How many days will you let me do this ?

1080
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:12,661
I got my money back

1081
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:14,161
Can I give you a little more ?

1082
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:14,601
Give more

1083
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:16,041
Who wants you to give more ?

1084
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,041
Give as much as you should

1085
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,001
You have to give me money today

1086
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:18,920
No

1087
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:19,601
Let me tell you

1088
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:20,481
You don 't give me any money today

1089
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:20,961
I won 't know next time

1090
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:21,920
Where did I catch you

1091
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,081
Why can 't you catch me ?

1092
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:23,981
Where 's your money

1093
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:24,360
I don 't

1094
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,720
What are you doing ?

1095
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:30,121
Let go Let go Let go

1096
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,240
You let go

1097
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,501
This is my ex wife

1098
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,420
This is my secretary

1099
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,201
Let go , let go

1100
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:37,780
Let go , let go , let go

1101
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:41,820
What are you doing ?

1102
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:42,840
Are you okay

1103
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:48,940
Let go

1104
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,201
Let go , let go

1105
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,681
Let go , you dare to hit me

1106
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:54,541
I have money , I 'll give it to me

1107
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:55,541
I give you money

1108
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,001
Let me see if anything is okay

1109
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:11,800
Is it okay ?

1110
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:12,920
Bald

1111
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,961
Let me see

1112
00:39:14,181 --> 00:39:14,840
What to see

1113
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,001
It 's fine if you 're not bald .

1114
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,021
Where are you going

1115
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:19,041
I asked Xiaohui to send you .

1116
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:19,961
Who wants you to send it

1117
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,760
You 're not looking for me

1118
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,880
In addition to money

1119
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,161
Gu Kangqi

1120
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,760
I can 't figure it out

1121
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,360
Does it have to be like this

1122
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,280
Gently open the map

1123
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:49,760
The first thing I saw was

1124
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,760
China in Color

1125
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,400
Green is the grassland

1126
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,800
Golden is the desert

1127
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Blue is the sea

1128
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,161
Winding is a river

1129
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:03,840
Not here yet

1130
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:08,280
Can you arrange another one

1131
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:09,481
It 's too late

1132
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:10,521
You are next

1133
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:11,840
Sing loudly

1134
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:14,521
Long live the motherland

1135
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,521
OK , thank you for this classmate

My mother

It doesn 't matter , just read it carefully

1145
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,260
It 's okay

1146
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:06,001
My mother

1147
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,481
Take a look . They are all new models .

1148
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:19,720

What about this

I actually know

1173
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,521
There is no fairy in the world

1174
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,240
A faint smile on my mother 's face

1175
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:54,521

You see

1246
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:49,760
Mom was dressed beautifully .

1248
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,760
Does the fairy feel right ?

1249
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:54,161
It 's dirty .

00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,400
It 's dirty and I can 't wear it .

1251
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,880

That 's what you wrote ?

1255
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:06,760
I 'm not because

1256
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,141
I wrote it because I wanted to get high marks

1257
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:10,720
I just wanted to tell them

1258
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,760
You are not what they say

1259
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,121
That way of discussion

1260
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,800
