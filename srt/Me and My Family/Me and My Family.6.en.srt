I wanted to show off

17
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,759

I want to eat more of this wedding candy

22
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:45,940
Good

23
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,879

Eat well , drink well , look good

26
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,099
Slow down

27
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,200
spent money

28
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,080
You said it was a joke

29
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,919
Why do you invite so many elders ?

30
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,679
You know your father

31
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,700
Why didn 't you come

32
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,279
I 'm afraid of being embarrassed

33
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:00,919
So push me over

34
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,840
Eat , sit and laugh with you

35
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,620
What is it doing

36
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,080
My face is so worthless

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,520
Sister Zhao is so lucky .

38
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520

39
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:11,040

I just want to laugh

45
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:26,480
How shameless

46
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,719
At this moment

47
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,880
Through ups and downs

48
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,840
Through the Four Seasons

49
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,719
Through Spring , Summer , Autumn and Winter

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,400
Wine is the best embellishment

51
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:45,600
Please bring a glass of wine

52
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:48,480
OK

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,939
It doesn 't matter what you are in front of

54
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,340
Red , white and beer

55
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,820

00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,939
Have you drunk this drink together ?

57
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,320
OK

58
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,900
Cheers Cheers

59
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,680
Who gets the marriage certificate first

60
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,059
Who will be in charge of this family from now on

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,700
We 're ready

62
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,279
Three Two

63
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,540
Bridegroom

64
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,019
To

65
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,999
After this , this family

66
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:16,359
It 's the bride who decides .

67
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:17,799
OK

68
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:26,560
Kiss

69
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,760
OK

70
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,399
Sister - in - law , you have to drink , right ?

71
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,320
How do we drink this wine

72
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,820
Drink more

73
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,119
Let the groom drink more

74
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,600
The bride is not feeling well .

75
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,179
This way

76
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:43,339
Let 's use other people 's liquor

77
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:44,519
How about changing it to water

78
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,459
Take care of lesbians

79
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:46,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

80
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,679
You don 't need to change it . No , no , no

81
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,139
I decide on this table

82
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,000
No need , bring the water over .

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,500
No need

84
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:50,940
Come

85
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,419
You have changed the water

86
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,560
No way , I smell it

87
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,079
Inverted

88
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,079
It 's wrong and insincere

89
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,639
Is it wrong ?

90
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,079
She 's pregnant .

91
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,220
Pregnant

92
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,280
You

93
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,260
Pregnant

94
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:05,919
Get on the bus first and then buy the ticket . What are you doing ?

95
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,239
It 's immoral .

96
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,040
That 's it

97
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,220
I 'm embarrassed to hold a wedding

98
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,320
Lao Wu did not come

99
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,700
Not really sick

100
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,619
That is

101
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,160
Delicious and delicious

102
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
I can 't keep your mouths shut .

103
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,679
Isn 't that right ?

104
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,339
Yes , I 'm going to be a grandmother soon

105
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:21,880
This is a blessing for our family

106
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,519
You 're not afraid of losing your children and grandchildren when you talk about it .

107
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,399
Xiao Zhao , I didn 't say anything .

108
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:26,899
It 's both of you

109
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:27,679
You didn 't say it first .

110
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,600
Sit down and eat quickly

111
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,799
Sitting down is not a good entertainment .

112
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,359
It was done very hastily

113
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,119
Does the food still suit your appetite

114
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,280
Yes Yes Very Good

115
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,560
This is all right

116
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,639
Everyone knows the scandal

117
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,880
Liju eats it

118
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:17,219
Susu

119
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,639
Susu , please stay for a while

120
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,120
Uncle Li promises you

121
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,279
Definitely with your mother

122
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,479
Can you explain it clearly

123
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,680
Mei Mei , please say something

124
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,000
Susu You

125
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,099
Grandma

126
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:34,700
Mom

127
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,599
What 's wrong ?

128
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:38,240
Mom

129
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,500
Mei Mei Ma

130
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,639
Mom is here

131
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:41,380
Come

132
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,760
I 'll come , I 'll come , I 'll come

133
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,880
Grandma , why are you here

134
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,680
Mom

135
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,320
Why are you here

136
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,899
Jianxiong calls

137
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,159
Say you 're not fine

138
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,860
Of course I 'm here

139
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,079
Taking care of pregnant women

140
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,440
What can I do ?

141
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,860
I

142
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,719
I 'm still small this month

143
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,760
No

144
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,459
No need now

145
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,519
I brought all my luggage .

146
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,120
Then I 'll push it right now

147
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,039
No , no , no , give it to me

148
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,620
I 'm afraid of troubling you

149
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,500
Come

150
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,519
I 'll take it , I 'll take it in

151
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,579
Then hurry up

152
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,079
Hurry up

153
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,479
Let me help you prepare

154
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,680
Grandma misses you so much

155
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,599
Grandma wants to live with you

156
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,079
I miss you too

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,459
Fighting with your mother again

158
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,279
Is our sound insulation so bad

159
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,719
How long will you be at the door

160
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,380
My cause and effect

161
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,680
I heard it pretty much

162
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,880
What did your mother plan ?

163
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,479
Tomorrow morning

164
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,880
After breakfast

165
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,740
You accompany me

166
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,479
Go to your mother 's publishing house

167
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,779
Put her personal effects

168
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,719
I have to pack it up and bring it back

169
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,620
Is there anything else

170
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,760
to their leaders

171
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,120
Brought some gifts

172
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,620
You said your mother

173
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,060
This suddenly goes

174
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,219
People must complain

175
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,579
Grandma

176
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,399
Forget it if you don 't persuade her

177
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,159
Why are you fueling the flames ?

178
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,159
Something you mother and daughter decided

179
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,320
I can get through it

180
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,599
I didn 't know before

181
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,079
Your mother 's temper

182
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,680
It 's clear now

183
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,380
I 'll just follow it

184
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,459
But I don 't want to talk to her right now

185
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:20,959
What to do

186
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,519
Then you will fulfill me .

187
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,599
Do more of your duty as a mother

188
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,539
Mama Wu , please Mama Wu , please

189
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,539
Thank you thank you

190
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,380
Look , Mama Wu

191
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,760
This is near our unit

192
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,700
A small restaurant

193
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:42,000
A table is reserved for us

194
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,240
Director Hao is here . Hello

195
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:44,820
The environment is still good

196
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,279
Come on , girl

197
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:45,920
Sit here , sit here

198
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,219
Leader

199
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,979
We came here today

200
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:50,800
I just want to

201
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,099
Thank you , leader

202
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:52,820
Thank you Company

203
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,659
To our family Wu Limei

204
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,180
Many years of cultivation

205
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,019
Don 't dare to take it , don 't dare to take it

206
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,779
Cultivation can 't be said

207
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,000
Na Teacher Wu

208
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:01,219
It 's also in our community

209
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:02,740
Old Hero

210
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,539
That Susu

211
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:05,200
Get a gift

212
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,219
I 've got a little gift

213
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,899
That Wu Limei resigned

214
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:10,099
It was extremely sudden

215
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:12,800
Please bear with me

216
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:17,019
Mama Wu , you are too polite

217
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,399
I didn 't expect it

218
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,260
Teacher Wu and her family

219
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,940
That 's reasonable

220
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,579
Compassion for us like this

221
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:24,399
Thank you thank you

222
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,700
We 're all very reasonable

223
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,579
Don 't look at my mom like this

224
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:28,339
Our family is decent , right ?

225
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,839
I educate my children from an early age

226
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,420
Convince others with virtue

227
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:33,740
What about this kid

228
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,700
When I was young , I suffered a lot

229
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,560
So sometimes above the thought

230
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,579
A little extreme

231
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,300
Doing things is a little fierce

232
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,099
Sorry

233
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,700
Please bear with that

234
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:45,660
Mama Wu

235
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,979
Originally

236
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,259
The club wants to help Teacher Wu

237
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,920
Hold a farewell party

238
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,060
But Teacher Wu

239
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:53,579
Strongly disagree

240
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,540
What does she think ?

241
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,180
We don 't sign her

242
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,780
It 's just unkind

243
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,820
Throw this farewell party for her

244
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,700
To mock her .

245
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,640
We just want to simply

246
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,219
Take this farewell party

247
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,599
What about Teacher Wu

248
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,940
We apologize

249
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:10,619
You didn 't renew her contract

250
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,379
She didn 't take the initiative to resign

251
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:24,339
They are all decent people

252
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,900
Remember to convince others with virtue

253
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,300
Convince others with virtue

254
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:35,979
This This

255
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:38,160
I won 't drink my daughter 's wine .

256
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,820
Drink less

257
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,040
So you don 't accept it

258
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,099
Our apologies

259
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:42,640
I have a meeting in the afternoon

260
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,079
Don 't drink wine , Director Hao

261
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,520
I first represent my mother , Wu Limei

262
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,660
I apologize

263
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,200
I am a contract worker

264
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,820
Pregnant at this juncture

265
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,680
This is the way to survive .

266
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,660
Do you ask for trouble ?

267
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,320
Deserves it

268
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:53,900
Yes

269
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,160
Daughter thank you thank you

270
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,820
Alcohol is absolutely prohibited

271
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,180
She 's not sincere enough .

272
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,499
It 's just that I 'm not honest enough

273
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,379
Everyone from Shizhi Publishing House

274
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:02,300
I represent Wu Limei

275
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,259
Apologize to everyone

276
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,780
I have caused trouble to your club

277
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,940
Tell me about a woman who is pregnant

278
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,259
I also hope to be in the company

279
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:08,940
Business as usual

280
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,820
Isn 't this a dream ?

281
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,219
Yes

282
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:11,700
That 's stupid , right ?

283
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:12,540
For her stupidity

284
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,379
I 'll drink a toast

285
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,459
Come , come , come , come

286
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,099
I-I-

287
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:17,099
You , you drink less

288
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:18,420
Drink less , drink less

289
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:19,379
No , no , no , no

290
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,540
No , no , no , no

291
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,680
OK

292
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:23,660
This woman is pregnant

293
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,900
It 's easy to get confused , right ?

294
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,219
Nowadays young people say they are pregnant

295
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:28,219
What is it called again

296
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:29,499
Pregnant Silly

297
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:29,820
Yes Yes

298
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,900
Definitely not appropriate

299
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,420
Working in this publishing house

300
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:32,940
Right

301
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,579
Yes Yes Yes

302
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,200
Right , you want to drink it .

303
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:41,520
Dry Again

304
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:43,180
Still good wine

305
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,060
Say no drink or no drink

306
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,579
A drink is more exciting than anyone else , you see

307
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:46,339
Fifty-three degrees

308
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,060
Yes , fifty-three degrees come , come , come , come

309
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,219
Delicious Fifty-Three

310
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,599
That Director Hao

311
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,619
I have a thing

312
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:52,940
I 'm curious

313
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,900
You have such foresight

314
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,599
Yes or not before

315
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:56,560
This has been handled

316
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,459
Experience

317
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,079
Experience cannot be said

318
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,300
But after years of summary

319
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,900
Come to a point

320
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,540
You said you said

321
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,420
What about the men

322
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,320
After Work

323
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,940
Marriage has no effect

324
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,180
Work down to earth

325
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,200
Women are different

326
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,420
When a woman gets married

327
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:13,540
Faced with

328
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:16,780
Breastfeeding when pregnant and giving birth

329
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,099
This and That

330
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:19,479
What do you mean ?

331
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,979
It 's better to be a man

332
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:21,940
Is that right ?

333
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,259
No , no , no , you can 't say that

334
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,979
Director Hao , please ignore my grandma

335
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:26,820
I support you

336
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:27,999
Strongly agree

337
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,420
Come on , I resonate with you

338
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,859
To our friendship

339
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,660
Come

340
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:39,379
Although I am a woman

341
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,020
But from the bottom of my heart

342
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,020
I think men are good

343
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:44,339
Get married and have children

344
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,739
It 's clearly a matter between two people .

345
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:46,979
But after giving birth

346
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:47,619
It becomes a woman

347
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:48,599
It 's a matter of one person

348
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:49,859
Men are very busy

349
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:50,520
You know men

350
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,619
How difficult is it ?

351
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,339
He has to support his family

352
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,180
He 's on a business trip to accompany his clients .

353
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,680
How hard it is for him , man

354
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,900
That 's a lot of pressure

355
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,979
Women are different

356
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,219
Only mother is good in the world

357
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,180
Only mother is good in the world

358
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,140
You must not take care of your child .

359
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,359
So we get married and have children

360
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,300
For a man

361
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,660
That 's a career bonus

362
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,820
It is for a woman

363
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,180
That was a career watershed

364
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,280
Let me tell you , Director Hao

365
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,999
This life

366
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:12,140
You can 't have children

367
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,660
Right

368
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,820
This child is not good

369
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,619
That 's true

370
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:15,060
Come

371
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,420
What 's right ? Let 's go .

372
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,979
No , no

373
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:18,540
Let me tell you

374
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,959
Your sarcasm is to sarcasm them

375
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,839
You still want a baby

376
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,160
Have a daughter

377
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,040
What we have suffered

378
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,020
Let her suffer .

379
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,900
Have a son

380
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,060
What should I do if I give birth to Director Hao

381
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,300
Born to embarrass me

382
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,420
Yes Yes

383
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,780
Why did you give birth to Director Hao ?

384
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,140
You have an ordinary child

385
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,219
Cultivate well

386
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:35,640
It wouldn 't be like him .

387
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,440
I don 't give birth

388
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:38,379
Director Hao

389
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:39,940
Do you support me

390
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,640
Support

391
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,739
Support us and drink one

392
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:42,780
Come , come and go

393
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,320
Walk a

394
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,320
You You

395
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,379
You killed my granddaughter

396
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:48,499
We don 't have children

397
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:50,060
If you don 't have a child , leave one .

398
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,160
I disagree .

399
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,280
Grandma , let me tell you

400
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,719
It 's hard for us women

401
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,660
Labor liberated

402
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,719
Our family burden

403
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,739
Not Liberating

404
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,359
It 's hard to work hard

405
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,379
It lifted up half the sky

406
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:03,020
What 's the result

407
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,739
We 're going to be another

408
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:04,780
A Good Wife and Mother

409
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,339
We have to meet our husband and teach our children again

410
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:07,499
We need to clean again

411
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:08,140
Clean up housework

412
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,259
We need to be a good mother

413
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:09,859
Good Wife

414
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,420
We should learn to go out and make money

415
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,540
We need to be refined

416
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,339
We want to be beautiful

417
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,339
We can 't be yellow - faced women

418
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,359
We can 't be so sophisticated

419
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:15,900
So beautiful

420
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,579
What are we doing

421
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,020
Why do we do this again

422
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,619
I want to know that again

423
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:19,440
Can we need this ?

424
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,140
That doesn 't work

425
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,040
We had a hard day

426
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,079
I went to work

427
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,020
I survived it

428
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,259
It turned out because I was pregnant

429
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:24,839
Now I want to

430
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:25,900
Dismissed by such a person

431
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:26,619
Why would you

432
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:27,300
Send me on this path

433
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,020
Director Hao

434
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,979
This is all your fault . Look at it

435
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,560
Yes

436
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,379
You you you you

437
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:38,259
You drink it

438
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:39,239
I still have

439
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,540
There 's still something to do

440
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,140
Director Hao Director Hao

441
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,020
Call Wu Limei

442
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:48,979
Drink again

443
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:49,900
Hello to Wu Limei

444
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,060
Hello , can you hear you ?

445
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
Fortunately , nothing happened .

446
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,739
Why did you drink like this ?

447
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,739
No drink

448
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,140
Yes , mainly to thank you

449
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:08,020
Thank you for what

450
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,660
Thank you , leader

451
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,300
Let you quit so happily

452
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:15,859
No spite

453
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,459
Then I want to thank someone else .

454
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,520
You have to have a sense of formality

455
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:22,579
All right

456
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:24,739
If you have a sense of formality , you drink alcohol

457
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,979
Gu Yunsu , you drank someone

458
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:28,700
No No

459
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,020
She didn 't advise .

460
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,259
And I didn 't advise you .

461
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:35,020
I think he wants to drink it .

462
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:36,660
He 's greedy

463
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,619
He saw that the wine was good .

464
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:39,739
He drank himself

465
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:40,280
Yes Yes

466
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:40,979
Right

467
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,259
At first , I said no drink or no drink

468
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:43,719
But

469
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,339
I think he had a good time drinking .

470
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:47,300
Very happy

471
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,079
Finally , we say

472
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,219
Stop drinking , stop drinking

473
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:50,619
Alcohol is not good or

474
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:52,459
This guy is a bad drinker .

475
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,300
People don 't feel good either

476
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,940
You don 't look good either

477
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,540
Later

478
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,759
Grandma and I went looking for it .

479
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,839
Labor Arbitration

480
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,239
The publisher also gets

481
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:02,499
They deserve their punishment

482
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,420
But even so

483
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,560
Failed to stop it .

484
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,379
Wu Limei 's Determination to Resign

485
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:10,700
Still fighting with your mother

486
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,940
It 's still in the cold war

487
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,200
But I saw you today

488
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:17,780
Fight for your mother

489
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,680
Aren 't you quite excited ?

490
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,180
I did it subconsciously

491
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,320
Finally figured it out today

492
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,239
Right

493
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,420
Your mother is afraid of others looking down on her

494
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:34,440
Said it was to raise a baby

495
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,099
Voluntarily resigned

496
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,280
You guys stop it

497
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:38,940
You stopped me here and there

498
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,520
Everywhere

499
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,619
Didn 't you poke her where it hurts ?

500
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:42,820
Can she not be angry ?

501
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,459
Yes

502
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,459
I hit a sore spot on her .

503
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:46,999
Then I poked her where it hurts .

504
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,140
It 's done today .

505
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,940
Right

506
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,680
She she slandered me

507
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,040
Grandma slandered me

508
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,140
It 's not over either .

509
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,820
All right , Grandma

510
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,060
Don 't worry about this .

511
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
My feud with her

512
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,099
We solve it ourselves

513
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,099
OK , OK , I don 't care , I don 't care

514
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,300
You keep giving it to your mom

515
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,660
Put on airs

516
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,499
I think it 's fine

517
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,520
Each mother

518
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,619
Everyone has their own daughter to clean up

519
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,459
Just take it out for me

520
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,640
She made you unhappy

521
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,359
Sooner or later

522
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:41,959
You go inside a little bit

523
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,599
Who and how old are you with ?

524
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,800
You 're squeezing me down .

525
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,479
What are you doing

526
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,959
I want to talk to you a little longer

527
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,020
What are you doing ?

528
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,359
You know what she said

529
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,640
How bad is it ?

530
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,900
Which words

531
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,599
Just feel

532
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,300
That feeling when I blackmailed her

533
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,079
Did you know

534
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,180
Wu Limei

535
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,239
I hate it

536
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,099
Let me tell you something

537
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,560
You said I listened

538
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,839
You have to promise me

539
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,959
A child is born

540
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,880
Where are you running ?

541
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,959
Sleep Sleep

542
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,039
Come to sleep

543
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,680
Stop looking at me .

544
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,479
Sleep Sleep

545
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,880
This kid , you say

546
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,519
Yes

547
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,380
Come , come , come , come

548
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,559
Clothes Clothes

549
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,019
This

550
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,239
It 's not cool

551
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,640
It 's careful enough .

552
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,559
Specifically checked the information

553
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,239
You can 't rotate and enclose the ground

554
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,959
It 's easy to wrap the umbilical cord around the neck .

555
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,319
Also check information

556
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,799
Pretending to be a father for the first time

557
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,840
Wasn 't I young then ?

558
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,600
I 'm interested in caring for pregnant women

559
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:31,440
That is

560
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,459
To be honest

561
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:33,759
No idea at all

562
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,739
You know when I

563
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,239
Realize I 'm a dad

564
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,759
It was when my son called me dad

565
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,420
Li Jianxiong

566
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,799
Everything is fine for you

567
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,660
But one thing

568
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,840
Less than others

569
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:47,799
What is it ?

570
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,759
You 're just a little slow

571
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,719
Don 't you think

572
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,779
But I 've reacted now

573
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,840
I know I 'm not a father - to - be

574
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,360
What kind of father are you ?

575
00:18:58,819 --> 00:18:59,440
I

576
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,880
You 're slow to react .

577
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,100
You sometimes

578
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,279
It 's a little confused

579
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,719
But it doesn 't matter . I don 't dislike you

580
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,759
This is your posture

581
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,959
Yes Yes Yes

582
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,319
This needs some fuel .

583
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,719
It was left and right just now

584
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:19,200
Now up and down

585
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,459
Come on

586
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,660
Breakfast is ready

587
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,319
Mom , you 've done everything

588
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:34,999
Pregnant

589
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,799
You have to eat breakfast on time

590
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,200
I said it to Mom

591
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,640
I should have done it

592
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,160
I didn 't expect you to get up so early

593
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,440
It doesn 't matter who does the same thing

594
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,299
Call the little ones up .

595
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:47,479
I 'll hurry Mei Mei again

596
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,640
OK OK

597
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,799
Let 's serve the porridge later

598
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,080
OK

599
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:54,440
Mei Mei

600
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,440
Breakfast is ready

601
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,880
Let 's not grind anymore

602
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,940
You are pregnant now

603
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,279
You have to eat breakfast as you order

604
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,479
Get up quickly

605
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,400
OK OK

606
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,799
What is this ? It 's not covered properly

607
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,880
This is for belly wiping

608
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,319
Put this thing on your stomach

609
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,440
Yeah , prevent stretch marks

610
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,219
It 's not that you have checked it .

611
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:22,279
Is it harmful to your baby ?

612
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,200
All pregnant women are using this

613
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,160
It doesn 't necessarily mean if it 's okay .

614
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,400
Everyone wipes it

615
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
That 's safe

616
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,160
Mom , it 's the Internet age

617
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,340
If something happens to you

618
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,400
Everyone knows

619
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,319
Don 't worry

620
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:33,940
Line

621
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,640
I 'll get you shoes

622
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,360
Don 't do it

623
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,759
You don 't bring me shoes

624
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,739
Don 't squat down

625
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:39,360
It 's okay , it 's okay

626
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:40,840
Do you want to put on some more clothes ?

627
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,319
No , no , no , I 'm fine

628
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:42,900
You go .

629
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,719
OK OK

630
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,819
The old method is still safe

631
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,479
Rapeseed oil

632
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,440
That 's it .

633
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,559
Mom

634
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,680
Don 't worry about this

635
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,019
Something for Mei Mei

636
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:11,940
I 'm strictly

637
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,039
Have done their homework

638
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,799
That 's absolutely natural

639
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,600
Absolutely safe

640
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,340
Then tell me

641
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,200
What is decanoic triglyceride

642
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,259
Look

643
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,459
Glycerol decanoate and

644
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,799
Ethylhexyl stearate

645
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,719
Ethyl linoleate

646
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,799
Cetearyl Alcohol

647
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,799
And what is bisabolol

648
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:31,799
Are you listening ?

649
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:32,519
It 's scary

650
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,380
Like fetal sliding drug

651
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,440
Mom

652
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,400
Then I won 't hurt Mei Mei , right ?

653
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,380
She is pregnant with my own flesh and blood

654
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,940
Of course you and I believe it

655
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,860
But I don 't believe in additives .

656
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,279
That 's the case for rapeseed oil

657
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,680
Grandma

658
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
You don 't have to use it

659
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,759
Rapeseed Oil

660
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,239
Yes , yes , yes

661
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,680
That sesame oil and peanut oil

662
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Everything is fine .

663
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,299
That

664
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:55,620
This is definitely possible

665
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,400
Rapeseed oil is rapeseed oil

666
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:08,640
No you

667
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:09,600
You 're not eating

668
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,519
I 'm full

669
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,680
It 's not that you didn 't eat it

670
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,239
I 'm full without eating

671
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,380
Insist on using rapeseed oil

672
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,180
I 'll be in a while

673
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,039
Help you apply some rapeseed oil after eating

674
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,779
Roll

675
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,120
She doesn 't paint

676
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:27,200
Insist

677
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,239
Be careful

678
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,039
Jianxiong

679
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Mom , tell me

680
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,519
I was not careful this morning

681
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:45,340
I hear

682
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,840
You 're making trouble in the bedroom

683
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,440
I thought I shouldn 't say

684
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,999
But I 'm thinking about it

685
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:51,640
I think still

686
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,080
It is necessary to remind me

687
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,039
Don 't make any noise

688
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,640
Did I bother you ?

689
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,959
Let 's keep our voice down in the future

690
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,400
It 's not about sound size

691
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,360
Yes , don 't make any noise

692
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,200
You

693
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,200
You guys are not young , right ?

694
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,719
This first three months

695
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:18,440
Three months after

696
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,719
It 's the most dangerous time

697
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:21,799
And you are now

698
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,039
Age of both persons

699
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:23,559
You said

700
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,880
Risk factor compared to younger adults

701
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,160
Much higher

702
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,279
So not like young people

703
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,719
Be that kind of couple

704
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,360
The husband and wife

705
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:35,959
Don 't make any noise

706
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,019
I went to school

707
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:44,860
I 'll go

708
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,759
I 'll take out some garbage

709
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,120
I 'll take a shower

710
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:56,519
Li Jianxiong

711
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,420
What about my mother ?

712
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
Easily nervous

713
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:01,840
Don 't mind .

714
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
How bearable it is

715
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:05,019
Mom is like this

716
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:06,880
On the contrary , I was relieved

717
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,160
It 's about caring for people

718
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,180
A man who loves his wife again

719
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,400
Can 't beat it

720
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,920
Is that my real mother ?

721
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,600
I can 't catch it .

722
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,759
Can you handle this

723
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,120
This is prone to morning sickness

724
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,400
I went to work

725
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,019
Sister Su Su

726
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,779
You have successfully registered

727
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,660
Please go to the clinic on the third floor

728
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,120
Sister Su Su

729
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,860
Sister Su Su

730
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,479
Aunt weighs fifty-four

731
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,239
Then blood pressure is

732
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,840
One hundred twenty-three seventy-nine

733
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,400
OK

734
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,440
You said today was really

735
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,600
Thanks to Susu

736
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,380
This process

737
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,200
It 's more complicated than it used to be

738
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,840
Nothing complicated

739
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:08,039
This is now the hospital

740
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,319
It 's nothing more than scan a code

741
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,080
A book to be noted

742
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,459
It 's a family member who needs to know .

743
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:12,620
What else should we do ?

744
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,360
Then I won 't .

745
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,719
I followed it down .

746
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:16,499
This process is still

747
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:17,640
Confused

748
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,999
Grandma , you don 't have to know .

749
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:19,979
In the hospital at your age

750
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:20,680
Gold is precious

751
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,440
The pregnant woman has to make way when she sees you

752
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:24,479
Who told you to run up and down to take care of you

753
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,719
Isn 't that ignorant ?

754
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,239
I just saw

755
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:30,200
Many nurses greet you

756
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,400
We all know you

757
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,380
That means your mother 's prenatal check - up

758
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,799
Not a single miss

759
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
You 're wrong .

760
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,759
She actually came here once before

761
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:40,640
And that time I was checking myself

762
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,239
Unmarried pregnancy again

763
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:46,200
Not in danger Not in danger

764
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:46,880
It 's fine

765
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,920
Wu Limei Wu Limei

766
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,959
Ultrasound Room Examination

767
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,759
I checked my grandmother .

768
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,680
Let 's go , go , go , go

769
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,479
Walk , walk , walk

770
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,299
Susu

771
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,400
Family members are not allowed to take photos or video .

772
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,580
I 'm sorry , my grandma doesn 't understand .

773
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,319
Sorry

774
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,160
I 'm sorry I can 't shoot it .

775
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,420
Then I know , I know

776
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,959
Single live fetus in early intrauterine pregnancy

777
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:12,459
The current size of the gestational sac

778
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:16,559
It is 5.3 times 3.9

779
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,440
Multiply 1.8

780
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,400
You can see the germ now

781
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,360
Bud length is 6.5

782
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:24,519
Doctor

783
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:27,039
Is this fetus of normal size ?

784
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,059
Current ultrasound gestational age

785
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:30,559
About twelve weeks

786
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,200
Then according to you

787
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,360
Calculation from the last menstrual period

788
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,059
It should be eleven weeks plus three days

789
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,319
Four days too old

790
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:36,559
Doctor

791
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,620
It 's better to be bigger

792
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,600
Still not good

793
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:40,680
One week difference in size

794
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,719
All are normal

795
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:42,700
You see

796
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,400
Already in human form

797
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,499
You have everything you should have .

798
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:50,400
It 's all right

799
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,559
What are you saying ?

800
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,440
It 's not that I heard about advanced parturients

801
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,279
The fetal malformation rate is very high .

802
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,440
You see

803
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,400
This is his big head

804
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,459
These are his two arms

805
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,680
These are his two calves

806
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,160
This is his belly

807
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,799
This little baby is active

808
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,840
You see , he 's in your belly

809
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,799
Doing exercises

810
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,440
You can do exercises at such a young age

811
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,400
That will be very skinny when born

812
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:16,739
You see

813
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,920
It 's just that big in my stomach

814
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,080
A sparrow is small and has all the internal organs

815
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,959
Mom

816
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,120
When I was so young

817
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,880
Do you do exercises in your belly too

818
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,080
At that time

819
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,680
Not as advanced as it is now

820
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,479
The belly looks fuzzy

821
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,640
I can 't see anything

822
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:39,840
That is

823
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,120
What is that twinkling ?

824
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,380
Is it the heart

825
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:43,920
Yes

826
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,559
You see us on the screen

827
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,259
You can see

828
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:48,400
The beating of the baby 's heart

829
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,559
Is he jumping too fast ?

830
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,940
The fetal heart rate is so fast

831
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,120
As long as it is normal

832
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,200
Doctor

833
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,299
Would you please make this sound

834
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:01,680
Open wider

835
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:02,580
OK

836
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:23,920
At this moment

837
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,380
I seem to see it

838
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,479
Before I was born

839
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,440
Wu Limei 's expression

840
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,920
Grandma

841
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:40,880
Give me a look

842
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,680
What to see

843
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,120
You wouldn 't think

844
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,259
Your own candid camera technique

845
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:45,279
It 's awesome , right ?

846
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,180
Neuropathy

847
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,920
OK , I 'll show you .

848
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,039
Let me take a look

849
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,059
Family members are not allowed to take photos or video .

850
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,999
I 'm sorry , my grandma doesn 't understand .

851
00:28:58,999 --> 00:28:59,799
Sorry

852
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,559
I 'm sorry I 'm sorry

853
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,840
Then I know , I know

854
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:04,900
Didn 't you record it

855
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,880
You didn 't press it

856
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,440
I pressed you and look at it

857
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,920
What a precious opportunity

858
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,160
Can you tell me why I did this ?

859
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,400
It 's okay , it 's okay , it 's okay

860
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,999
Susu , next time you come

861
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:19,539
There is that 4D color Doppler Doppler > in the back

862
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:20,440
That 's better

863
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:21,140
Really

864
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,479
Pregnant women and their families

865
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,680
Today , our hospital has some

866
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,360

867
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,759
Free Training Courses

868
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,039

You can go to 308 on the third floor

870
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:30,519
Learning

871
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
What to study

872
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,219
Mainly some

873
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:34,400
Care of newborns

874
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:36,039
For example , how to hold a child

875
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:36,840
How to feed

876
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,160
And Heimlich First Aid

877
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,920
Drill , etc.

878
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:39,680
That

879
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,019
That guy my age

880
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:41,799
Can I learn it

881
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,640
Of course you can

882
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,840
Then I sign up

883
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,160
I I want to go

884
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,479
Go , go , go

885
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,360
Then you go .

886
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,559
I 'll wait for the results here

887
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,100
Good .

888
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,880
I 'll show you .

889
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,759
OK OK

890
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,059
Okay , let 's learn first

891
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,700
The first way to hold your baby

892
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:54,640
First of all

893
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,440
We 'll use one hand

894
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,519
Spread your fingers

895
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,420
From our baby 's neck

896
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:00,719
to the back of his head

897
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,059
With our hand

898
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:03,519
Hold his head

899
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,160
Neck and Back

900
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,180
Because the baby at this time

901
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,039
Still small

902
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,360
Not Grandma

903
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,880
Why are you here to learn this ?

904
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,360
My aunt , my aunt 's daughter

905
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,340
My Aunt 's Daughter 's Son

906
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,019
My mom and I

907
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,400
Which child have you never held

908
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,640
You mean baby care

909
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,059
You are not an expert

910
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:20,200
It 's also a civil science level

911
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,759
Reviewing past and learning new things

912
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,819
I want to study hard

913
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:26,019
Practice well

914
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,319
Your age

915
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,860
You still want to be my mother 's confinement nanny

916
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,360
You take care of my mom and I take care of you

917
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:32,620
If you can do something , it 's a little bit .

918
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:35,940
When your mother gave birth

919
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,459
You 're having trouble with me .

920
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,700
I didn 't accompany the student

921
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,900
He didn 't accompany him either .

922
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:41,499
You said you were two

923
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:43,019
I just saw you for the first time

924
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:44,299
What a pity

925
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,080
This time we can make up for it

926
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,019
Get up , hurry up

927
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,660
Learn to stand well

928
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,299
What 's fun for kids

929
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,380
It 's annoying to death to cry and noise all day .

930
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,559
This kid is fun .

931
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,140
That one was born with a soft head

932
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,380
Not like it is now

933
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,299
Let me tell you .

934
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,499
You have to hold up a little

935
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,819
Reach out to you

936
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:07,459
Hold your waist and stretch out your hand

937
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,279
That 's how you

938
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,840
From below

939
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:12,819
Yes

940
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:14,499
Slowly pocketing from under this

941
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,380
Right

942
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:17,900
Yeah , lift his hips up

943
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:18,539
OK

944
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:18,999
This way

945
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,080
We can take our baby

946
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,140
Picked it up

947
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,319
So we can take the baby

948
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,180
Who is it ?

949
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,440
How can you be like this ?

950
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,180
Fake

951
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,539
No , isn 't this fake ?

952
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,100
What are you doing ?

953
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,819
Sorry

954
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,559
It 's okay , then let 's continue

955
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,279
I hate you .

956
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,880
You guys are crazy

957
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,779
All crazy

958
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:48,620
Dr. Xiao Xu

959
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,819
Do you think this is OK ?

960
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:52,380
All indicators are normal

961
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:55,620
You had a blood check last week

962
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,219
Although she is an elderly woman

963
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,299
But blood routine is not necessary .

964
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:00,259
Doing so hard

965
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,440
Logically

966
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,979
There is no need to check today

967
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,279
I was wondering if it was

968
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,900
Is it about drawing an extra tube of blood ?

969
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,140
Be safe

970
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,180
This is your second child

971
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,319
How is it better than many first - born parturients

972
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,140
Still nervous

973
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,620
Isn 't that old ?

974
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,160
You can 't compare to young people

975
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:17,479
Did Gu Yunsu tell you ?

976
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:18,779
There are many risk cases

977
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:19,499
Yeah

978
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:21,140
She 's always frightening me

979
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,400
I 'm afraid , you know ?

980
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,880
I stressed it to her

981
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,180
These are all theoretical

982
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,200
Possible

983
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,860
Extreme Case

984
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:28,279
You don 't need to be so nervous

985
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,860
You talked

986
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,340
I 've talked to her before and I 've praised her

987
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:32,739
Few family members can

988
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:33,340
Like her

989
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,620
Doing such detailed work

990
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,559
I don 't understand .

991
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,660
Tell me

992
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,499
A little brat

993
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:44,380
Why did my mother have to give birth

994
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,739
If she really wants to inherit the bloodline

995
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:48,279
Then I 'm enough .

996
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,059
If she thinks the house is too quiet

997
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,380
Trying to cause some trouble

998
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,019
I 'm enough for her to drink a pot .

999
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,299
If she had endless love

1000
00:32:57,739 --> 00:32:58,979
Endless happiness

1001
00:32:59,219 --> 00:33:00,140
Throw them all at me

1002
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,259
I can catch it too

1003
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,680
I think she just hates herself

1004
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,640
I 'm in good health

1005
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,299
Don 't you suffer from this ?

1006
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:06,100
Self - committed

1007
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,499
Just like your mother

1008
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:09,100
I love to say irony

1009
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:11,860
You say good things are bad things .

1010
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:12,940
You don 't look at it either

1011
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,340
Who follows this source

1012
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:16,660
Your great grandmother

1013
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,640
I kind of know why I am

1014
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,979
So fond of throwing blame

1015
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:22,700
You admit it now

1016
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:24,499
You said angry words

1017
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:25,920
Always get along with my mom

1018
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,380
It 's just thankless

1019
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,979
I know you are wronged

1020
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:35,080
What you wrote

1021
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,440
Larger pages of notes

1022
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,620
I saw it all

1023
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,499
Fighting with your mother again

1024
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,239
Is our sound insulation so bad

1025
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:45,059
What do you think of people and things

1026
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,420
Talk about your mother

1027
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,700
Open your mouth and say that you are chewing on old people for money

1028
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,719
Who 's not angry when you say you 've changed ?

1029
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:55,620
But it 's a family

1030
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:57,100
Right , you said

1031
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,880
Who has never been arrogant and unreasonable

1032
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:02,380
who didn 't blurt out

1033
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,819
When you hurt someone

1034
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,120
What do you do ?

1035
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,140
Family remembers a lifetime

1036
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,039
What about you ?

1037
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:11,080
Wait until your mother 's day

1038
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:13,279
I understand that I am wrong about you

1039
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:14,440
By then

1040
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,160
Bounce back

1041
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,700
Be a little overbearing

1042
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,299
Isn 't that right ?

1043
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,040
Whose family doesn 't live like this ?

1044
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:27,739
It 's all a muddled account

1045
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,279
Is that true

1046
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,460
Great job

1047
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,160
Yes

1048
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:39,439
You look decent

1049
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,399
Really troublesome

1050
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,020
This child

1051
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:46,339
In the past half month

1052
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,359
She does her homework and searches information every day

1053
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,060
Rain or shine blocks me off work

1054
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:50,859
Every time

1055
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:51,739
Ask me a few questions about

1056
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,140
Risk Issues for Older Mothers

1057
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,259
Of course

1058
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:55,700
Also for

1059
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,259
Save three hundred yuan in registration fee

1060
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:00,060
I 'm sorry

1061
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:01,339
This is my daughter .

1062
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:02,219
This is clever

1063
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:03,620
It 's all used for this

1064
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,379
Very interesting Very interesting

1065
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,460
The hospital also arranged for today

1066
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,939
Labor Pain Experiencer

1067
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,899
If you want to

1068
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:23,319
Experience it first hand

1069
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:25,080
Expectant father with parturient labor pain

1070
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,000
and family members

1071
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,200
You can try it here

1072
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,899
Try it

1073
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,480
If I don 't go , what 's going to try ?

1074
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,719
I 'll try it .

1075
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:32,259
I want to try

1076
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:33,120
This general family member

1077
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,419
Come and experience it .

1078
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:35,399
I am a family member

1079
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,660
I want to try it for my mom

1080
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,319
OK

1081
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:41,120
No , no need to try this

1082
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,600
You will come one day

1083
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:44,120
You can feel it

1084
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,680
That 's not necessarily

1085
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:48,660
The baby is still going to be born

1086
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,799
Susu

1087
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,160
Why don 't you try

1088
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,419
Face Me

1089
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,500
Take off your clothes

1090
00:35:57,219 --> 00:35:57,859
I 'm sorry

1091
00:35:57,859 --> 00:35:58,660
Let me ask

1092
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,520
That 's the one

1093
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,739
Training for new parents

1094
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:02,060
Where is that room ?

1095
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,060
At 308

1096
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,819
Come with me

1097
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,779
Thank you

1098
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,980
No feeling yet

1099
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,620
Okay , let 's add more .

1100
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,399
It 's itchy

1101
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,359
It 's itchy

1102
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,899
OK , add a little more .

1103
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:22,500
You have a feeling , right ?

1104
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,399
What is the situation now

1105
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:26,620
Now open to two fingers

1106
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,000
You can go to the delivery bed with two fingers .

1107
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,680
Got to bed

1108
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,939
I went to bed

1109
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:31,100
Then let 's add a little more

1110
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,600
OK OK

1111
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,140
OK

1112
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:36,980
Give birth

1113
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,339
Have you given birth

1114
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:39,620
If it reaches five fingers

1115
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,299
The distance to open all the fingers is quick .

1116
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:41,919
Line

1117
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,279
Almost done .

1118
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:04,600
Open , open , continue to open

1119
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,960
That 's almost enough .

1120
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,879
You said Wu Limei

1121
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:08,120
Is your brain sick ?

1122
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,600
It hurts so much . I can 't remember it .

1123
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,000
We have to do it again , right ?

1124
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:12,960
Let me tell you

1125
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,640
Is there any pain in other hospitals

1126
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,580
What are you doing

1127
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:16,379
Stop

1128
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,540
OK

1129
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,839
Come , come , come , come

1130
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,279
It hurts like hell , right ?

1131
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,960
Don 't tell me if there is pain or not

1132
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,919
You didn 't tell me

1133
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:25,100
I didn 't know you 'd come here

1134
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,040
I 'm sick

1135
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,680
How do you speak ?

1136
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,759
You 're the one who 's sick .

1137
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,100
Yes , yes , I 'm sick

1138
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,000
That 's what you are

1139
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,279
Never appreciate it

1140
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,500
I 'm sick

1141
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:35,419
How painful is it when it is painless

1142
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:36,759
The hospital has regulations

1143
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:38,600
You must open two fingers to injection

1144
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,939
So at least we have to bear it

1145
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,100
Pain in both fingers

1146
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,319
Two fingers , right ?

1147
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,040
Two fingers just right

1148
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,500
One finger less for some people

1149
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,640
Remember to eat but not to beat

1150
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,040
One more finger

1151
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,960
No more finger is needed

1152
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:51,200
Just two fingers

1153
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,100
Let me help you up

1154
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,200
Grandma takes me to confinement .

1155
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,799
Come , come , come , come

1156
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,700
I asked if you can

1157
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,160
There 's a door .

1158
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,779
Thank you .

1159
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,839
