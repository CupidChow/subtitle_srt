1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,539
Xiao Xu

2
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:21,459
You

3
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:23,560
Go and accompany Susu

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,980
You don 't need to accompany me . I 'm fine .

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,879
No No No No

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,980
Su Su and Aunt Wu

I went to a spa treatment

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,800
That's still  after all

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,000
Delayed your date

10
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:34,019
No No

11
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:35,579
It 's rare for a family to be together

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,820
Appointment

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,660
Let 's make an appointment later

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,439
What 's wrong

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,799
Thanks to my quick hands

16
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,839
Look at this big one

17
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:04,839
Mosquito

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,700
Thank you , thank you .

19
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,180
Xiao Xu

20
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:14,360
You selected Susu

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,399
Choose our home

22
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,180
Yes Yes

23
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:19,660
That means

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,740
What about our relationship

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,300
It 's different from before

26
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:26,600
Yes Yes

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
But you are first

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,720
Aunt Wu 's doctor

29
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,680
Then Aunt Wu from now on

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,100

00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,720

No , don 't worry .

33
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:44,259
Although Susu and I are in a relationship

34
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,259
But I 'm sure first

35
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,539
Aunt Wu 's doctor

36
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:48,800
I will

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Delivered and hands - on

38
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,059
More than before

39
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:52,899
Serious

40
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:53,839
Don 't worry .

41
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:57,919
That

42
00:01:58,999 --> 00:01:59,639
You You

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,180
You must be nice to Susu first

44
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,100
Important

45
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,020
I think this soul journey

46
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,119
That hypnosis ?

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,760
Pretty good .

48
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,879
I feel better

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,099
Great

50
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:41,960
Out of sight is out of sight

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,080
Don 't let me talk to him

52
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:46,680
Uncle

53
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,899
Dr. Aunt Xiao Xu

54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,040
Little Susu

55
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,319
I 'll leave it to you .

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,779
OK

57
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
You guys have fun

58
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,800
Have fun .

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,240
Where are you going ?

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
I 'll go play .

61
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,599
Go Go Go

62
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:58,740
OK OK

63
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,159
Refuel

64
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,740
Mei Mei Mei Mei

65
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,279
I know I 'm wrong

66
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:02,899
Don 't come here

67
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:03,760
How do I feel

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,580
I reflected on it

69
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,640
They 're not as mature as we are .

70
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,879
It seems a bit naive

71
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,040
But

72
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,839
Shall we go to dinner ?

73
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,860
If there is anything wrong , it will be fine .

74
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,719
I 've been with her all day .

75
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:20,619
I 'm tired too

76
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,319
Really

77
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,379
Go

78
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,099
Go

79
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,699
This way please

80
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,959
Be careful

81
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,579
It 's fine

82
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,340
This can also play movies

83
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,259
This is the reserved seat for you

84
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:31,100
OK , thank you , thank you

85
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,400
You 're welcome .

86
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,780
I have one for you

87
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:52,240
A very cliche birthday surprise

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,040
Very cliche

89
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,319
Then close your eyes

90
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,939
Don 't open your eyes

91
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,360
Immediately

92
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,040
Don 't open your eyes . How can I hear you ?

93
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,800
Tractor Sound

94
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,840
Don 't keep your eyes open , okay

95
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,639
Three , Two , One Open Eyes

96
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,800
I haven 't seen snow for a long time

97
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,559
Do you like it

98
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,480
Like

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,999
Although it 's a little loud

100
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,499
Hangzhou hasn 't snowed for a long time

101
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:49,420
Thank you

102
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,840
Beautiful

103
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,999
Actually , there 's another surprise

104
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,639
And surprises

105
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:15,040
Wait a little longer

106
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,240
Do you want to close your eyes

107
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,519
No

108
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,819
Wen Bin

109
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,759
Didn 't you say you had to be on duty during holidays ?

110
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,180
Why are you here ?

111
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,619
I went out with your brother and the others

112
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,199
I didn 't expect such a coincidence

113
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,939
These are my parents and my brother

114
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,220
This is

115
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:04,840
My friend Gu Yunsu

116
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,400
Hello , Miss Gu

117
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,100
Hello , sister

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,840

Let 's do it one by one

124
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,199
It 's okay , it 's okay

125
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,040
I have something to do too

126
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,780
Goodbye

127
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,519
This is how you surprised me

128
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,139
That 's amazing

129
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,879
I didn 't know they were coming

130
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,840
Then why did you lie to them

131
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,600
He said he didn 't have a vacation .

132
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,600
I understand

133
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,360
Because

134
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:56,639
You never

135
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,699
I told them

136
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:58,860
I 'm like that

137
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,860
The presence of a friend

138
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,340
Thank you

139
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,959
Hello Uncle Gu

140
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:13,920
Come quickly

141
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,040
Happy Birthday

142
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:35,139
It 's just us today .

143
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,059
It 's Fairy 's Day

144
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,680
Fairy 's Day

145
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,959
Is it Xiaobao ?

146
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,959
Are you happy ?

147
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:50,079
Who is it ?

148
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,479
Why did you come back so quickly

149
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:57,400
Even if you say one more word , you can 't end it .

150
00:08:57,939 --> 00:08:59,839
Then your mother cooked the meal

151
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,280
I 'll send it to your unit

152
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:03,120
People in your general department

153
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,219
We all know you 're on vacation

154
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,199
We 're outsiders .

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,599
Wen Bin may

156
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,380
He also changed temporarily

157
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,739
We didn 't know in time

158
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:11,660
Isn 't it normal ?

159
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,040
What are you talking about ?

160
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,839
Parents

161
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,459
Actually , we just got together

162
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,180
That 's why I don 't want her

163
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,780
Facing the pressure of parents so quickly

164
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,880
I 'm upset because

165
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,260
It 's because I think Xu Wenbin

166
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,780
He doesn 't seem to be in him

167
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:28,939
I was mentioned in front of my family

168
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:31,439
You don 't know .

169
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,239
His parents looked me up and down today

170
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,040
That look

171
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,520
It 's like

172
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,400
His precious son is a

173
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,180
It 's a cabbage

174
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,219
And I 'm a pig

175
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,420
How much is a catty of pork

176
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:43,219
How much does cabbage cost per catty

177
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:45,120
Then they look at you

178
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,739
Just look back and it 's over .

179
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:47,579
What 's there to fear ?

180
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,959
I 'm either afraid of me or

181
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,160
Mom , tell me about it

182
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,819
Xu Wenbin and I

183
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,660
What is the situation now ?

184
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,479
Then if

185
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:58,979
We are boyfriend and girlfriend

186
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:01,420
His family doesn 't know me

187
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,140
If you say

188
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,040
They 're not boyfriend and girlfriend , right ?

189
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,400
The resort also came

190
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:05,819
Little Hand also pulled

191
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,780
I feel embarrassed

192
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,900
Where I am

193
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,099
Dad , I actually know her

194
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:13,540
This is what you introduced .

195
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,500
She is Li Jianxiong 's daughter

196
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,819
Isn 't Li Jianxiong a son ?

197
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:19,939
Daughter of Li Jianxiong 's current wife

198
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:20,760
Now

199
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,760
For them now

200
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,099
The whole family is at the resort

201
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:25,380
Isn 't that nice ?

202
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,859
You asked them out

203
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,520
Let 's all sit down together

204
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,120
Have a meal

205
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,059
Learn more

206
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:33,599
Our family treats them to a meal

207
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,559
Ask about Panpandao

208
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:37,099
It will take a while

209
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,719
That 's it .

210
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,300
I 'll call Li Jianxiong

211
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:47,599
Hello Xiao

212
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,359
OK OK

213
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,280
I 'll be right over

214
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,439
Coming

215
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:58,760
Uncle Gu

216
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:01,959
What 's wrong with you

217
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,439
What 's wrong with you

218
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,959
Don 't talk , don 't talk

219
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,719
Breathe easily

220
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,680
I don 't know who is so wicked .

221
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,079
Throw a steak at the door

222
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,920
One foot stepped onto it

223
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:23,020
This freshman somersault

224
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,739
What about the egg cake

225
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,500
Broken

226
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,559
What is it ?

227
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,880
In such a hurry

228
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,800
Call me back

229
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,059
Xu Wenbin 's parents are here

230
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,000
With my son

231
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:37,099
What son

232
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:38,079
Xu Wenbin 's son

233
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,699
Last time we saw that kid

234
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:42,120
Why are you here

235
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:43,000
I don 't know .

236
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:45,640
Does Susu know ?

237
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,660
She must know

238
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:48,380
Quite angry and left

239
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:49,839
In this case

240
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:51,520
Gu Yunsu is

241
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,880
I 'm going to be my stepmother

242
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:55,300
Line

243
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:58,280
If this is true

244
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,339
It 's all on his account

245
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,520
I 'll ask him

246
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
etc. etc.

247
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,280
We can 't be in such a hurry

248
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,599
What do you think

249
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,040
As I arrange

250
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,479
Find me a stick tomorrow

251
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,520
Why are you looking for a stick

252
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,300
Turn

253
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,239
I don 't know who is so wicked .

254
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,719
Throw a steak that you can 't eat

255
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,559
Thrown there

256
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:29,339
Susu

257
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:31,599
Oh my god

258
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:33,059
Scared me

259
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,880
Be careful , be careful

260
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:42,859
You you say

261
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,459
Do we look like this

262
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,239
Romeo and Juliet

263
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,219
It doesn 't look like it

264
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:51,540
There is no enmity between our two families

265
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:58,900
Are you angry with me

266
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,099
A little bit

267
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,540
Don 't be mad at me .

268
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,020
I 'm as innocent as you are

269
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
All parents are accidents

270
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,300
We are different

271
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,180
My parents know you for a long time

272
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,660
Understand you and accept you

273
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,400
I like you

274
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,020
That can 't be compared .

275
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,500
It 's not what you think

276
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,380
Why don 't you wait until I come back ?

277
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,420
Can I explain to you ?

278
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,520
You 're running away when you come back

279
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:22,199
Not

280
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,300
Call me from our department

281
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,079
There are signs of premature delivery in older women

282
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,300
I have to go back

283
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,959
There is a valid reason to escape

284
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,660
Yes

285
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,380
Well , how about this

286
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,180
You come down

287
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,920
You come with me

288
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,260
Walk , walk , walk

289
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,420
You come down

290
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,079
Come on .

291
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,020
Hurry up , hurry up , hurry up

292
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,920
You come down , come down , come down

293
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:46,219
Human life is at stake

294
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,059
Don 't bring Susu to cause trouble .

295
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:49,800
Please go back quickly and be safe .

296
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:52,939
Let 's go

297
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:00,559
Heard

298
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:02,979
I don 't think it 's called running away .

299
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:04,479
This is called a doctor

300
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,020
Fulfill one 's duty

301
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,339
I understand the truth

302
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:09,900
I just feel

303
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,859
Otherwise

304
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:11,660
Let 's run too

305
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,739
Anyway , I think this New Year 's Day is good .

306
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:13,620
It 's not interesting either

307
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,099
What are you afraid of ?

308
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,739
We are here

309
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,439
Don 't be afraid that there are so many of us

310
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,859
It 's them who should be nervous

311
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,939
That is

312
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:23,780
That 's right .

313
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,339
You said they had a brother

314
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:26,420
We also have a younger brother

315
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,420
We have another one here

316
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,140
What are you afraid of ?

317
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:31,099
It 's better if he isn 't here

318
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:31,640
He 's not here

319
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,540
We 'll do it tomorrow

320
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,660
Take care of their whole family

321
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,900
Uncle Xing

322
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:37,260
Let 's recharge our batteries

323
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,079
This tough battle tomorrow

324
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,020
We must win

325
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:40,040
OK , so we will

326
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,739
What about today

327
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:41,680
We 're going to sit down

328
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,099
The details of tomorrow

329
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,760
We finalize

330
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,699
I think today 's meeting

331
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:45,900
Just drive here

332
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,120
You still have your own business

333
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,300
Need to reflect

334
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:51,059
It 's not you . It 's not you .

335
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,079
Did you put it down ?

336
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,459
I picked it up again

337
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,900
One code to one code

338
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,260
Let 's go now

339
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:02,880
Mom

340
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:04,819
Thank you .

341
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,640
What

342
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,180
You still understand me

343
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,579
This is what I received

344
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,459
Best Birthday Gift

345
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:20,979
This

346
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,219
It 's been a little long

347
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:26,900
You can add some hot water later

348
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,040
Five four three two one

349
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,260
Happy New Year

350
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,660
Happy New Year Susu

351
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:54,520
Mom

352
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:57,059
Happy New Year

353
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,280
Happy New Year my daughter

354
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,800
No , this isn 't the point yet

355
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,479
How did you two get it done ?

356
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,319
This is still a

357
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,959
What about the unfinished product ? This is

358
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,079
Today 's mission for us .

359
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,239
Let 's meet his parents first

360
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,599
We do not fight unprepared battles

361
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,319
Only by knowing yourself and the enemy can you win every battle

362
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,359
A hundred battles will not be dangerous

363
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,439
The original text says this

364
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,859
Look how melodramatic you are

365
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:48,479
OK OK

366
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,839
I 'll write it down

367
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,559
Mom tells the truth

368
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,239
I just took a look

369
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,640
Your makeup is a little heavy

370
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,719
Is there any

371
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:56,059
I didn 't want to

372
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:57,239
Do you want to save face ?

373
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,439
Does it not look good ?

374
00:16:58,439 --> 00:16:59,479
Good - looking good - looking

375
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,000
The third trimester will not affect the fetus

376
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,199
I need to prepare something

377
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,939
You need to make yourself look good

378
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,280
Wear nice clothes

379
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:10,760
Let me tell you .

380
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,120
Our topic today is

381
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,199
Gentle

382
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,939
Neither humble nor arrogant

383
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:16,279
Line

384
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,120
The answer is correct

385
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,640
What are you doing ?

386
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,239
Mr and Mrs. Smith

387
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,820
Let 's go , warriors

388
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,560
Go

389
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,799
Make up quickly

390
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,340
Dr. Xu

391
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,680
Is your resort fun ?

392
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,759
Exciting than expected

393
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,299
Unfortunately , the holiday was interrupted

394
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,420
I 'm embarrassed for you too

395
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:45,039
Everything should be

396
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,840
If you have anything else , please tell me .

397
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:48,999
That

398
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,959
The next baby is entrusted to you .

399
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,259
Thank you , Dr. Xu

400
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,160
Hard Work

401
00:17:58,739 --> 00:17:59,499
Lao Xu

402
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:01,600
Jianxiong

403
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,539
It 's been a long time .

404
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:04,320
What a coincidence

405
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,219
It 's been a long time .

406
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,120
Yes Yes Yes

407
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,979
Listen to Wen Bin

408
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:08,180
You 're here on vacation too

409
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:09,400
We 'll discuss it

410
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,580
We must make an appointment

411
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,080
Yes Yes

412
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,420
We haven 't seen each other for a while .

413
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:14,580
For several years

414
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,039
Yes

415
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,259
Sister - in - law , what is this

416
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,640
I 'll make an official announcement .

417
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,279
Our family Li Mei is pregnant

418
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,279
The baby is eight months old

419
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,719
So she 's us now

420
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:28,680
Key Protected Objects

421
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,039
Congratulations

422
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,840
It 's still early for dinner , isn 't it ?

423
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,759
Then we will

424
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,360
Why don 't we go around here

425
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,180
OK

426
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,600
This arrived last night

427
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,999
I can 't see anything clearly

428
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,719
This environment is not familiar with .

429
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,199
Then we 'll go for a walk together

430
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,439
Good , Good , Good , Good , Good

431
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,360
Let me show you around

432
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,880
Walk , walk , walk

433
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,660
What 's wrong

434
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,259
Emergency Rescue

435
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,499
Only five minutes

436
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,459
Speak quickly

437
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:55,999
My parents and Xu Wenbin 's parents

438
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:56,820
We went to meet

439
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:02,140
I 'll give you five more minutes

440
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:02,939
Speak quickly

441
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:03,779
OK

442
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:05,140
You said today 's Hongmen Banquet

443
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,539
What is suitable for me

444
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,080
Look

445
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,959
I know you two

446
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:08,900
Progress is fast

447
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:09,880
It 's not necessary

448
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,160
Go straight to this step

449
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,939
You went to his birthday

450
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:14,039
Bring it directly

451
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,140
Parents of each other

452
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,299
If you watch me again

453
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:17,459
I went to the finale today .

454
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:18,259
Let me tell you

455
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:19,380
I think so

456
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:22,420
Wear it as planned

457
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,519
You don 't have to play a

458
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,939
Affordable daughter - in - law

459
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:25,739
Right

460
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,160
Why do you want to please others

461
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,259
And change yourself

462
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:29,180
Not used at all

463
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,259
To Be Yourself

464
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:31,380
Someone who likes you like this

465
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,219
I 'll like you even more

466
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:35,920
Luo Jingjing

467
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,160
Your recent consciousness

468
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,060
Very tall

469
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
Of course .

470
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,279
Come on and bye

471
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:41,779
Bye bye

472
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,180
Jianxiong

473
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,100
I had known that my younger sister couldn 't take a medicated bath

474
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,860
And to separate you two

475
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,499
Then I won 't come .

476
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,380
I 'm sorry

477
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,060
We can 't always get tired of being together .

478
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:09,939
Keep your distance

479
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,340
Distance produces beauty

480
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,820
Look at this kid , Xiao Zhang .

481
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,580
It 's lively to play

482
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,420
When I talk about learning , I 'm stuck .

483
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,180
Brother studies well

484
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,400
My brother will definitely not be worse .

485
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,039
I 'm used to it mainly

486
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,580
Unlike Wen Bin

487
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:30,499
That didn 't bother me at all

488
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,400
What about him ?

489
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,039
You have to discuss it with your family .

490
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,640
Sister - in - law , what about our family ?

491
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,499
You and Jianxiong

492
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:42,519
I 've probably heard of it before

493
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,519
Wen Bin 's real mother

494
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,920
I went very early

495
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,239
I 'm my stepmother

496
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,360
So there are some things .

497
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,959
This can 't be light or heavy

498
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:53,180
I 'm also embarrassed

499
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,219
Old Xu

500
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:58,380
There is a saying

501
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,979
I don 't know whether to ask or not

502
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,820
Do you want to ask

503
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,739
About Wen Bin 's divorce

504
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,140
I can 't figure this out

505
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,019
Wen Bin is such an excellent child

506
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:09,900
Why are you young

507
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
They 're divorced .

508
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:12,100
I can 't figure it out either

509
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,259
The responsibility lies with the woman

510
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,100
He should not be the fault party

511
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,820
This matter

512
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,699
Not waiting for us at all

513
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,219
He finished his work

514
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:21,660
just notified us

515
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,060
Cut it first and play it later

516
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,180
I 'm surprised too

517
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,180
That 's usually really

518
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,699
A very reasonable person

519
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,340
Particularly determined in this matter

520
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,259
Wen Bin

521
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,259
Studying for MD in the United States

522
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,959
The girl went along .

523
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,499
I studied finance

524
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:37,340
Working in a foreign company for two years

525
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,140
I went to college to teach English again

526
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,739
Prepared

527
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,979
It can be said that it is a perfect match

528
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:44,219
Conditions are equivalent

529
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,660
Prepared

530
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,499
Nana Nana Indeed

531
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:48,739
Then you say he is

532
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,699
What is the reason ?

533
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,620
Three words

534
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:53,060
It 's not appropriate .

535
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,799
We are parents

536
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,759
How can I not feel sorry ?

537
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,360
Here

538
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:06,160
Dodge Dodge

539
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,219
Child surnamed Xu

540
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,279
Child surnamed Xu comes over

541
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,239
Stay here

542
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,999
Surname Xu , right ?

543
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,920
Why did I tell you my surname is Xu

544
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,360
Let me tell you

545
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,439
I know you 're too busy

546
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,560
Where 's your father ?

547
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,699
Why did I tell you

548
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:27,920
My father went to the bath

549
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,699
Your father has to call me daddy

550
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:30,400
Do you know

551
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:32,539
I want to say

552
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:33,739
I have to be your grandfather

553
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:34,640
Grandpa

554
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,160
Not old .

555
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,719
Just call me Brother

556
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:40,640
How old is it

557
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,499
Why did I tell you I was eight

558
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:43,979
Don 't run

559
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:44,519
Little girl

560
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:45,299
You play that way

561
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,519
Child Station surnamed Xu

562
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,840
What are you doing , Gu Kangqi

563
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,160
What are you doing ? Scared me

564
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,699
Didn 't we agree

565
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:53,560
Don 't you act without authorization

566
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,439
Listen to my arrangements .

567
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,120
As you arrange

568
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,239
The daylilies are cold

569
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:00,519
You said you were making trouble

570
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,439
Can 't help but cause trouble

571
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:02,759
I immediately understood .

572
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:03,680
What did you ask ?

573
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,860
Eight years old

574
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
This is not surprising from age

575
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,759
Is his son

576
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,320
You see

577
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,519
I look like Xu Wenbin

578
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,420
At this age

579
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:13,739
Susuna is older than him

580
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,560
Then you say

581
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,939
Why does he

582
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:18,320
He brought such a big trouble

583
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,519
He doesn 't want to admit it

584
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,439
Why did he bring it ?

585
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:23,219
So he

586
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:25,199
Do you think it will

587
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:26,999
It 's Xu Wenbin 's parents

588
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:27,580
In Xu Wenbin

589
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,719
Unknowingly

590
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,580
I brought the child here .

591
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,320
That 's right

592
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,959
Aren 't his parents here ?

593
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,600
What did he say when he saw Susu

594
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
This is my son

595
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,999
Isn 't that over ?

596
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:37,680
That 's impossible .

597
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,360
That 's right

598
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,719
He can say that this is his brother

599
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,320
Right , right , right , right

600
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,160
I don 't think about it now

601
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,699
It 's too late to think about it .

602
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,160
Xu Wenbin made a move

603
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,019
Your daughter will become a stepmother

604
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:49,660
Right

605
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,739
The kid surnamed Xu comes over here

606
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:52,039
Come here

607
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,799
What are you doing

608
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,259
The gentleness and elegance as promised

609
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,439
I flipped my clothes

610
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:05,019
I 'm tired after all afternoon .

611
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,660
Tell me two warriors

612
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,620
How 's the inquiry going ?

613
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,600
Speak , Uncle

614
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,499
You , you , Uncle Li said first

615
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:17,340
Susu

616
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:20,100
Lao Xu said that Xiao Xu 's ex - wife

617
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,860
Ability is not good

618
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,699
Quite bad temper

619
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:24,100
Commanding blindly when nothing happens

620
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,340
Crying when something happens

621
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:27,039
The one with no female at all

622
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,340
Wisdom and tenacity

623
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:31,519
That 's it

624
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,420
So

625
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:33,900
I think Dr. Xu

626
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,100
This condition is in the blind date market

627
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,479
Maybe a 50 % discount

628
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,360
Maybe I have to wipe a fraction of it

629
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,199
So from this point of view

630
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,519
You 're a hot item

631
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,959
You mean I 'm better than Xu Wenbin

632
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:47,060
Of course .

633
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,400
That 's all right .

634
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,039
There 's more

635
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:51,360
My stepmother said that

636
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,880
She said that girl

637
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,479
Said income is not very stable

638
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,039
Then , you spend money and spend it lavishly

639
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,400
Well , I can understand her

640
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,199
I do the same .

641
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,680
The points you just said

642
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,479
It seems a bit like me

643
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,320
Nonsense

644
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,239
Why is it like you ?

645
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:05,999
Not Like Not Like Not Like

646
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:07,400
You are much better than her

647
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,039
That is

648
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,779
Did you just say

649
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,259
That 's his stepmother

650
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,499
Say he

651
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:17,039
His mother died very early

652
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,479
A little pitiful .

653
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:36,140
Today 's menu

654
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,499
Don 't move , I 'll do it .

655
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:38,160
I checked

656
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,640
This restaurant is 400 per person

657
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:40,880
I have to find a

658
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,459
Three hundred is not enough to eat

659
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,340
You don 't have to think about me .

660
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:45,400
To perform as much as possible

661
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,140
Relatively decent

662
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,160
I just showed off a bucket .

663
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,060
Instant Noodles

664
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,060
Really

665
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,759
We 're like people doing great things .

666
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,420
Jianxiong

667
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,060
We won 't wait for Wenbin anymore

668
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,680
He 's working .

669
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,660
Day and night

670
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,759
Let 's eat first

671
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,840
Xiao Xu

672
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,080
How about some red wine

673
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,519
We haven 't seen each other in such a long time

674
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,560
Drink less .

675
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,439
Come

676
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,519
I don 't advise you either .

677
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,439
It 's a big holiday

678
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:08,180
Happy

679
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,920
All right , all right , all right

680
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:10,799
Jianxiong

681
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,479
We haven 't seen each other in such a long time

682
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,459
I didn 't expect it .

683
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,360
Wen Bin and Xiao Su become friends

684
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:18,219
Yes

685
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:19,519
It 's New Year 's Day again

686
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,680
For the fate of our families

687
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:22,999
Let 's have a sip

688
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,080
OK OK

689
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,239
Come and drink one and fuck the other

690
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:26,860
Happy New Year Happy New Year

691
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,199
I 'll use tea instead of wine .

692
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:30,019
Happy New Year Happy New Year

693
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,019
Our family

694
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,979
This is also the first time to play together .

695
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:37,320
This is all Su Su 's filial piety

696
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,479
She was very thoughtful

697
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,539
It 's after the baby was born .

698
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:41,979
It 's not so free

699
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:42,799
Now

700
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,479
Hurry up and relax .

701
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,219
Yes , yes , yes

702
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,320
This hotel is not cheap .

703
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,019
Yes

704
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,340
I heard

705
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,739
You are doing text work

706
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:54,920
Which company do you work for

707
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,479
I 'll just write something

708
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,880
Self - employed , right ?

709
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,019
One person can eat enough

710
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,400
The kind where the whole family is not hungry

711
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:05,519
Very good Very good Very good

712
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,759
She 's a screenwriter

713
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,880
He writes the script

714
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,400
The writer is good

715
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,080
Edit

716
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,999
Which play have you written

717
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,640
I 'll go back and watch it again

718
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:15,400
None

719
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:18,239
Now not

720
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,799
In the future there may be

721
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,239
Hopefully there will be a pair

722
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,160
Yes , yes

723
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,939
She worked hard

724
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,279
Yes Yes Yes

725
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,140
We are in the accumulation phase

726
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,519
The nature of her job

727
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,160
It 's a matter of accumulation .

728
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,539
Yes Yes Yes

729
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,779
Xiao Su

730
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,239
You usually

731
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:35,719
Where do you work ?

732
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,459
I am anywhere

733
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:38,239
With

734
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,039
It 's just in place

735
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,620
In - situ means

736
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,920
Now , for example

737
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,120
There 's a table right here

738
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,039
At this moment

739
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,999
I am holding a computer

740
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,279
I can write stuff

741
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,199
Very convenient

742
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:52,719
Young people are like this now

743
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:54,680
It is particularly convenient

744
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,160
Yes Yes

745
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,560
It 's the Internet Age

746
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,580
It 's young now

747
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,120
You can work with a computer

748
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,279
Yes Yes Yes

749
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,259

00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,239
I retaliate to both of you

753
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:07,039
Come , come , come , come

00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:07,959
This year

755
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:08,959
Rare , rare

756
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:10,620
What 's wrong with your health

757
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,739
Can you chat

758
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:13,880
I 'm trying to lower

759
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,100
What they expect from me

760
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,400
If you don 't know how to talk , don 't talk

761
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,779
You 're talking in the wrong direction

762
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:20,920
Dr. Xu is here

763
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,699
Sorry I 'm late

764
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,459

A place for you

The hospital is done .

770
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,620
Everything has been handed over .

771
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,939
That 's sorry

772
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:33,259
Yes , yes , come

773
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,979

Everyone is here .

775
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,719
It 's hard to drink .

776
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:42,219
Don 't just drink it

777
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,299
Eat something too

778
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:45,299
Wen Binna

779
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,160
In the future

780
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,060
We need to arrange our work properly

781
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:49,219
That clinical work

782
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:50,459
I was busy enough .

783
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:51,779
You still have to write a paper

784
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:52,519
You said

785
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,660
You cooperate with your vice president

786
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,299
What International Journal

787
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,900
Has the submitted paper been published

788
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,180
Not yet .

789
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:01,620
You can 't delay this .

790
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,820
You should promptly be promoted to senior professional title

791
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:06,320
Dad

792
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,160
Drink less wine

793
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:07,900
While eating

794
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,239
Let 's not talk about work .

795
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,320
You see everyone eating .

796
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,180
Don 't keep giving your children

797
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,160
So much pressure

798
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,420
Wen Bin

799
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,820
Let 's not talk about work today

800
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,160
Let 's talk about you and Susu

801
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,360
I plan for the future

802
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,420
I 'm stuck in traffic

803
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:27,019
I want to go to the bathroom first

804
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:30,459
Turn left in front of you

805
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,360
You want to go too

806
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:33,739
I 'm OK

807
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:35,299
You want to

808
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:39,580
I want to go to the bathroom too

809
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,259
Go ahead , go ahead , then I 'll go too

810
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:42,380
I 'll go too

811
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,320
You 're not going

812
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,499
Please wait for a while .

813
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:46,340
That only has two positions

814
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,259
It 's your turn when we 're done .

815
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:49,100
One by one

816
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,400
The toilet has to go further up

817
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,279
That 's all .

818
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:55,939
You You

819
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,999
Did they embarrass you

820
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:00,820
No , they 're fine .

821
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,019
Good to me too

822
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,860
That 's fine

823
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,739
I didn 't mean to hide it

824
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:05,499
Your existence

825
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:06,219
Just

826
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:08,340
Their concerns about mate selection

827
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,219
Too sensitive

828
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,860
I 'm afraid they 'll put pressure on you

829
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,019
I understand

830
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,719
Forget it

831
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:15,920
I don 't really understand that .

832
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:18,340
I 'll stop pretending , okay

833
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,719
This past time

834
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,539
I 've been

835
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:22,360
Trying to convince myself

836
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,519
Convince yourself

837
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,680
I don 't care at all

838
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,979
You and your ex - wife

839
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,320
Why is it separated

840
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:28,499
Why

841
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:30,259
You run away from me all that time

842
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:31,199
then dodge

843
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:31,799
Why are you

844
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,840
not in front of your parents

845
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,439
First Time

846
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,759
Just admit my existence

847
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,199
I can 't convince

848
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,999
I really care

849
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,920
I want to know about your past

850
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,060
It happened in the past

851
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,279
It means there

852
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:54,900
I wonder

853
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:00,019
If you want to know about me

854
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:01,380
You want to know my past

855
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:03,180
I can also give my past

856
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,820
Spread out in front of you

857
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,840
Ask what you want to know

858
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,360
I 'll tell you everything

859
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,400
As long as you want to know

860
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:11,900
I

861
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:13,320
Let 's go

862
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:16,799
You don 't want to say anything and run away

863
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:20,340
We 'll face the past together

864
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,519
Go

865
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:25,499
Their food is okay

866
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:26,519
We 're back

867
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,759
Back

868
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:28,779
Are you going to go ?

00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:29,560
Come , come , come , come

Not going

872
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,759
You 're not going either

873
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,340
Parents

874
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,680
Uncle and Aunt

875
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,259
Let me tell you something

876
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:44,539
The matter between me and Susu

877

I 'm late

878
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,620
What 's wrong with you

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,539
What are you doing with a stick ?

880
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,739

Why don 't you welcome me ?

884
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,680
Where should I sit ?

885
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:58,939
Lao Lao Gu

886
00:31:58,939 --> 00:31:59,820

Grandpa

895
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,860
I don 't want to be your grandfather

896
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,660
I 'm your brother

897
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:18,060
This Seniority

898
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,120
Xu Wenbin

Isn 't my daughter good ?

901
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,759
What a beauty .

902
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,539
I just have no social experience

903
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,380
He is too honest

904
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,039
Easily bullied

905
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,459
It 's fine

906
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:39,360
Your father is here

907
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,060
Nobody dares to bully you

908
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,519
Since I was a child , my heart is the flesh .

909
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,580
In her mother 's hands

910
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,880
I 'm afraid she 'll drop it

911
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,499
in her mouth

912
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,920
I 'm afraid she 'll be melted

913
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,140
I 'm not at ease

914
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,360
In the hands of others

915
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,900

What about you ?

925
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:12,999

00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,259
Just tell me

974
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:36,180
What are you embarrassed to say

975
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,980
There is such a younger brother

976
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,000
Yes No

977
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,940
We had a good time .

978
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,060
You didn 't say anything in the afternoon

979
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,120
You played with people , didn 't you ?

980
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,919
And you played with him

981
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,960
Congratulations

982
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,040
OK OK OK OK OK OK

983
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,600
It 's okay . It 's okay .

984
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,379
It 's okay , it 's okay

985
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,120
Li Yan

986
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,919
Walk , walk , walk

987
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:49,680
Uncle Gu Gu

988
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,419
Uncle Gu , Uncle Gu , don 't go .

989
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:52,180
Let him go Let him go

990
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,060
Uncle Gu , don 't leave .

991
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
Can I say a few words

992
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:55,660
Exactly

993
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,779
Let me talk with everyone .

994
00:34:56,779 --> 00:34:58,379
What happened to me and Susu

995
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,100
Come back , you

996
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,000
Not me

997
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:01,960
Everyone is here

998
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,520
Sit

999
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:05,239
Run away after running crazy

1000
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:05,839
Li Yan , sit down

1001
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:06,699
Just sit down and listen .

1002
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:07,859
Slow down , slow down , you can 't leg

1003
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,759
People are going to talk about Susu .

1004
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:10,719
Please sit down .

1005
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,839
Let me talk about it first

1006
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,000
About my divorce with Yang Xin

1007
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,960
Let me tell you something .

1008
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
This

1009
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:21,680
We don 't know exactly at that time .

1010
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,299
It 's me and Yang Xin

1011
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:24,919
It really looks like a good match

1012
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,440
We study abroad together

1013
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:28,759
Our Educational Work

1014
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,419
And families are in comparable condition

1015
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:35,339
But after marriage , we realized

1016
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,000
This is not the life we want

1017
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,540
So we negotiated friendly

1018
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,020
We broke up peacefully

1019
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,379
Then Yang Xin thinks the same .

1020
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,180
Yes

1021
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,219
We didn 't even argue

1022
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:46,839
Wouldn 't it be nice not to quarrel ?

1023
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,899
We are very polite

1024
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,080
More polite than I was to you

1025
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:56,520
I don 't know

1026
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,460
How to deal with it

1027
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,440
That cold relationship

1028
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,399
between me and her

1029
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:03,680
Don 't share the same interests

1030
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,180
We have nothing to say

1031
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,779
We are not possessive of each other

1032
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,940
We don 't even have a desire to share

1033
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:12,339
I faintly want to break free

1034
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,819
Maybe that 's what marriage is like

1035
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:15,859
Calm and boring

1036
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,279
Just like me

1037
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:19,779
Like me

1038
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:21,060
All these years of life are the same

1039
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,060
I didn 't realize it until recently

1040
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:29,580
True Love

1041
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,500
What does it look like

1042
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:33,759
I don 't want it

1043
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,160
Just a partner

1044
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,140
People who live

1045
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,100
I want to be with a

1046
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:43,359
I can 't see her

1047
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,859
All I can think about is her

1048
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:46,779
When I saw her

1049
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,859
I 'll forget the whole world

1050
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:51,279
Someone who only smirks at her

1051
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,219
Key

1052
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,960
She would smirk at me , too

1053
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:58,759
We are not hiding from each other

1054
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,040
No masking

1055
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,020
Maybe it seems to others

1056
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,399
She has many flaws

1057
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,100
But it seems to me

1058
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,919
That 's all her cute qualities

1059
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:11,540
I love seeing her

1060
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,540
The appearance of baring his teeth and claws

1061
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,219
I love seeing her

1062
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,180
Pretending to be fierce

1063
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:18,199
I think I 've met you before

1064
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,899
Most Realistic

1065
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,580
Most sincere

1066
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,600
The Kindest People

1067
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:33,759
I like it

1068
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,160
Watch you fight with your mom

1069
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:39,060
Because

1070
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:41,399
I never had one

1071
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:42,399
This feeling

1072
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,620
You 're like the summer sun

1073
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,899
Blazing ahead

1074
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:50,680
According to yourself

1075
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:52,339
It also melted me

1076
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:56,859
I used to make you feel uncomfortable

1077
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,000
Because I 'm afraid of losing

1078
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,500
I 'm afraid of losing that good

1079
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,080
I 'm like a coward

1080
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,279
I 'm afraid of happiness

1081
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,299
But I 'm not afraid now

1082
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,239
Because I met you

1083
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:12,799
I want to be as brave as you

1084
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,120
To pursue your own happiness

1085
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,600
I want to be with you

1086
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,399
I want to be with you

1087
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,980
To see the unseen future

1088
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,419
Do you want to

1089
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,759
Will

1090
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,379
Real names agree with them to be together

1091
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:38,580
None of your business

1092
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,600
I do

1093
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,540
This this this

1094
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,879
Hurry , hurry , hurry

1095
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,940
What should be said and what should not be said

1096
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,859
I told you .

1097
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:03,640
Can

1098
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:05,120
Give me and Gu Yunsu a little

1099
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,899
Your own time

1100
00:39:05,899 --> 00:39:07,040
You can go .

1101
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,419
You can go quickly

1102
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:10,500
Go quickly , go quickly

1103
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,419
Bye - bye brother

1104
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,379
That 's right , Li Yan

1105
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:16,100
I 'd like to formally introduce

1106
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:17,919
Our brother 's grades are particularly good

1107
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,040
Ranked among the top three at Westlake High School

1108
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,120
If I need it

1109
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,660
You can contact him for tutoring homework

1110
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:23,960
That 's great

1111
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,140
Children 's homework is hard now

1112
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,020
I can 't

1113
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,640
Punish you

1114
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,339
Talk about writing homework

1115
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:28,620
My blood pressure is rising .

1116
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,040
Yes

1117
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,859
Goodbye Uncle

1118
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:30,779
Uncle Li , I 'm leaving

1119
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:31,819
Mom 's gone , hurry up .

1120
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:33,080
That little word

1121
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
This question .

1122
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,640
This this this

1123
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,819
I 've been thinking about it for a long time .

1124
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,980
Why do you always

1125
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,379
Didn 't tell me

1126
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:44,379
About your mother

1127
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,379
I don 't want to

1128
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,100
Take the initiative to mention my mother

1129
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,580
At that time

1130
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:58,379
You should still be young , right ?

1131
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:04,859
After my mom left

1132
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,480
My dad became more

1133
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:09,339
I don 't like to laugh .

1134
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:11,859
He was even harder on me .

1135
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:13,859
I don 't seem to have any more

1136
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:14,859
You can act coquettish

1137
00:40:15,419 --> 00:40:16,899
A place to make excuses

1138
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,020
You can only pretend to be an adult

1139
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:24,100
Even sometimes

1140
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,379
Even sometimes

1141
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:29,859
It 's like being a sponsor

1142
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,940
Learn to be sensible

1143
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,660
Be good at disguising

1144
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:36,540
Be likable

1145
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:38,819
I know

1146
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:48,020
It is said that the world of adults is very hard .

1147
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:50,899
It 's really hard .

1148
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:53,339
But children

1149
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,060
It 's not that easy either

1150
00:40:58,219 --> 00:40:59,339
In your heart

1151
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,419
It definitely never happened

1152
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:02,600
Truly accept

1153
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,259
Your mother 's departure

1154
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:06,299
Right

1155
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,259
You have worked hard

1156
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:28,600
Thank you

1157
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,580
You can actually rely on my

1158
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,540
You know that

1159
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,980
You can be spoiled with me , really

1160
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:52,239
You

1161
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:54,219
What 's wrong ? You look like a dog

1162
00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:57,180
What did you say ?

1163
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,440
You 're like a Shiba Inu

1164
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,299
So cute

1165
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:07,080
All right , all right

1166
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:11,460
Why are you crying ?

1167
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,540
I don 't know

1168
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,219
May I show you something ?

1169
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,419
I asked the hotel for this .

1170
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,899
The gift I prepared for you yesterday

1171
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:38,620
Alright

1172
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:40,460
A little vulgar

1173
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:43,580
All right

1174
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,460
But I just want to tell you

1175
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,339
Every time I see you

1176
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:53,140
My heart is like setting off fireworks

1177
00:42:56,819 --> 00:42:58,699
You 're not suitable for love words

1178
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,699
I know someone who is suitable

1179
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:05,580
All the wine is less sweet than you

1180
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,699
I 'm really convinced I 'm really convinced

1181
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,620
What 's wrong ?

1182
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,660
Xu Wenbin

1183
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:15,020

00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,540
That love word

1187
00:43:22,419 --> 00:43:23,739
You can think about it again

1188
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,879

I thought you were gonna kiss me

1193
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,299
Hurry , hurry , hurry

1194
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:08,080
Fireworks are set off

1195
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:12,040
