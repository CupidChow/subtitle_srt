1
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,360
Wait for me

2
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,520
I 'm here to watch the fun .

3
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:55,620
Come

4
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,280
Is drinking too much mineral water intoxicating ?

5
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:04,140
This scene

6
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,260
Did it just happen

7
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,760
It stands to reason that you have finished shooting .

8
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,500
I shouldn 't have come to you

9
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,861
Talk about this job

10
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,181
But you say it 's a coincidence

11
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,861
Screenwriter of my project

12
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,861
She 's right here

13
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,120
So I pulled her over

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,980
Meet you

15
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,120
I hope what about her next script

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,741
Can you give me some guidance ?

Young and talented

27

Me My escape plan

29
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,421
The escape plan is

30
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,301
Escape Plan This is Escape

31
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,141
Yes , yes , yes

32
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:39,081

33
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:40,220

38

I especially hope to cooperate with Shangsha Guide

39
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:48,521
Establish a connection

40
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:49,500
Okay , right ?

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,780
I didn 't bring my phone with me

42
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,940
Push it to me later

43
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:52,380

Come , come , come , come

Yes .

70
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,241
Mr. Lai Han is here

71
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,380
Brother Hanhan

Come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come

74
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,220
Inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside, inside

75
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,201
Sit down and talk Sit down and talk

76
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,940
I am honored to have today

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,060
Both rely on the great support of two people

78
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,541
Care

79
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:38,641
I 'll do it first

80
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,741
etc. etc.

81
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,220
Brother Han , how popular you are now

82
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,421
You 're still so modest

83
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:44,421
If you are not popular , who is popular ?

84
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:45,861
How is it designed ?

85
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,861
Come , come , come , come

86
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:49,660
I didn 't make it clear .

87
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,461
Why are we still entangled ?

88
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:53,600
I want to make a deal with you

89
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,481
Schedule for next year

90
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:56,181
I have a really good script here

91
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,021
My escape plan is particularly good

92
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:00,000
What plan

93
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:01,340
My Escape Plan

94
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,761
She really likes you .

95
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,461
I 'm my fan

96
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:07,741
What 's going on with you two ?

97
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:08,900
An Escape Plan

98
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,060
A paternity plan

99
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,340
I 'm confused .

100
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,741
That 's right .

101
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:14,741
One flees and the other accompanies childbirth

102
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:15,741
Escape to accompany childbirth

103
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,581
Escape with Output

104
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,380
Different

105
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,021
How can I not know

106
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:19,380
You have another script .

107
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:20,400
My sister

108
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,100
I 'm usually free .

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,780
As long as I 'm at home , I 'm more .

110
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:24,981
Duoduo code word

111
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,181
Practice is mainly

112
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,320
It happens that we are all there

113
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:29,541
You tell us about it

114
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,721
These two plans

115
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,341
What is the difference

116
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,421
Yes Yes Yes

117
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:34,661
Otherwise , I 'd mutter .

118
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,200
Could our teacher Gu be

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,820
One draft and two sold .

120
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,560
No , no , no , that 's what I said

121
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,580
Dare not dare not dare

122
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,620
I dare not make a mistake

123
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,020
It 's actually very simple

124
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:44,421
What about this escape plan ?

125
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:45,580
Its inspiration

126
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,661
It 's the one I used to

127
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,901
Personal emotional experiences

128
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,940
What about the paternity plan ?

129
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,981
It is actually

130
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:52,200
Inspired by my mother

131
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:54,861
Two completely different stories

132
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,260
I am

133
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,140
Plan Series

134
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,781
I want to make

135
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,000
A Planned Universe

136
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,080
Planning Universe

137
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,200
This plan is OK

138
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:13,460
No way .

139
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,620
Young , young

140
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:16,380
I drank too much wine

141
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,181
I I might have to

142
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,101
Go to the bathroom

143
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:19,020
I 'll be back later

144
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:21,841
See

145
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:22,541
Luo Jingjing

146
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:24,841
Susu

147
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,741
What 's wrong

148
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:29,401
She 's your sister 's friend

149
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:30,080
It 's exciting

150
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,301
Probably

151
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:32,801
Call me to sit down

152
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:33,301
That 's right

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,560
That story I wrote .

154
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:35,181
Master

155
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:37,601
New buyer and old employer

156
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,341
Gather together

157
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:40,341
We have to wait until they finish chatting

158
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,380
I 'll talk to them .

159
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:43,661
I 'll leave it to you

160
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,140
You said this film and television industry

161
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,460
Is it so depressed now

162
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,041
It 's just what I wrote

163
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,440
Is that good ?

164
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,161
How do you feel about the two ?

165
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:51,080
Everyone values me .

166
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:51,841
This This

167
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:53,080
You can use my script

168
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,640
But after I calmed down

169
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,241
I thought about it . It 's wrong .

170
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,841
Contract Contract

171
00:05:58,921 --> 00:05:59,960
One didn 't sign with me

172
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:00,960
This deposit deposit

173
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,161
I didn 't see a dime

174
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:02,500
Isn 't that just

175
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,880
Don 't you poop when you occupy the thatch pit ?

176
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,000
It 's a bad check

177
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,520
Bragging about them

178
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,000
Two boats with feet

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,760
We bumped into each other

180
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,801
The key point is whether the ship capsized or not

181
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:11,921
My IQ

182
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,320
How is it possible to make it flip ?

183
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:14,681
I just fooled it

184
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,361
Originally

185
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:16,820
It 's a matter of one draft and two sales .

186
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,281
Now I 'm saying it is

187
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:19,161
Two items

188
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:21,080
Simultaneously and methodically

189
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:23,041
It 's just like a regular friend .

190
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,000
It 's that smell , it 's that smell

191
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,200
Something like this

192
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,801
It means a career - oriented scumbag

193
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:29,560
You overpraise

194
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,541
This is my green tea in the workplace at best

195
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:33,120
Almost half a pound

196
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:34,741

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,000

I 'm the only one here

239
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,801
People who make their own money

240
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,021
You keep playing

251
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:00,121
Hello

252
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,141
Luo Jingjing

253
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,460
Classmates have met

254
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:03,421
Student Gu Yunsu

255
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,980
Jingjing , hello , hello , hello

256
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,580
You are alone

257
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,700
I 'm looking for Gu Yunsu

258
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:09,801
She

259
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,700
Which one of her is socializing now

260
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,100
I 'll send her a message .

261
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,860
I 'll wait for her here

262
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,980
It 's useless to send her a message

263
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,700
She couldn 't see her phone . She was busy

264
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:18,301
Please dance for a while

265
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,021
I don 't know how to jump .

266
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,421
Why don 't you go to the booth for a while ?

267
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,141
That line

268
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:33,021
Do you two know each other

269
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:35,021
Seen before

270
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:36,580
You two have a good chat .

271
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,141
OK

272
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,700
Well , I 'll go out for a while

273
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,340
OK

274
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:39,781
For a while

275
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:41,060
Susu came over after she finished her work .

276
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:42,980
There 's a wine buffet here

277
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:46,261
Why are you here

278
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,860
My sister brought me here

279
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,781
Your sister brought you here

280
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,181
That 's right

281
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:58,060
Sisters

282
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:00,720
You 've been standing for half a century

283
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,541
In the toilet

284
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,460
Actually , I was just in front of you

285
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,661
There is a bragging element

286
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:07,860
I 'll face these two companies .

287
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:09,820
I 'm not that comfortable

288
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,301
I 'm just pretending , you know ?

289
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:12,840
I did not

290
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,261
Hold them well

291
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:15,421
Anyway , I 'm in a panic right now

292
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:16,781
That 's how people are

293
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:17,781
He told a lie

294
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:19,541
He 's going to round it up with a thousand lies

295
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,381
I can hide for a while .

296
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,141
Anyway

297
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,240
To enjoy the blessings of everyone

298
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,720
You will suffer double hardship

299
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,060
What are the instructions of the Master ?

300
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,261
When the boat reaches the bridge head , it will straight straight

301
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:35,541
What a nonsense

302
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,541
Then let me tell you something

303
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,220
Is it useful ?

304
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,801
Say

305
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,181
Xu Wenbin is here

306
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:43,541
Rest assured

307
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:44,940
I 've helped you steady him .

308
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,781
Li Yan is outside with him .

309
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,421
OK OK

310
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,761
It has to be you

311
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,661
Then , then , let 's go , let 's go

312
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,301
Come with me

313
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:53,141
Can 't go anywhere

314
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:54,940
I 'm half an hour late

315
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,820
Just welcome the man .

316
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,940
You can go

317
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,980
Be brave

318
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:08,681
Niubar

319
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,340
Hello

320
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,860
Hello again

321
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:26,460
Introduce yourself

322
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,240
Qin Yuxuan

323
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:29,860
Xu Wenbin

324
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,501
Have a couple of drinks

325
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,100
OK

326
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,460
Handsome guy , get a cup

327
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,901
My home court is my treat

328
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:51,621
How did Dr. Xu get in ?

329
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:52,720
There should be no one

330
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,980
Send you an invitation letter

331
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:55,580
Susu 's nepotism

332
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:57,580
But you need to know that

333
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,480
Su Su Shi

334
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,021
It 's my nepotism

335
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,901
Mr. Qin , I 'll go first

336
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:07,460
Then I have to thank you .

337
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,200
That doesn 't work

338
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,021
Then I have to thank you .

339
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:11,401
Me too

340
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,240
Gu Yunsu 's nepotism

341
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,641
Why are the three of you sitting together ?

342
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,121
And drank it

343
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:32,921
What are we talking about ?

344
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
Talking about you , talking about you

345
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,041
Talk to me

346
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:42,240
I hear your project is highly regarded

347
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,541
Two companies are competing for it

348
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,381
Congratulations

349
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,641
Not that much .

350
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,801
It is mainly Teacher Gu 's emotional line

351
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,761
Brilliantly written

352
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,521
That 's just a gimmick

353
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,200
There is only one attribution in the end

354
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,881
Drinking alcohol is not interesting .

355
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,001
What to play

356
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:05,600
How about fighting eyesight

357
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,720
Many people say

358
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,521
The producer can tell it at a glance

359
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,761
Is this person good or bad

360
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:11,200
I think the doctor

361
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,840
That 's the case , right ?

362
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,401
Because you look at it

363
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:14,161
You can see if this person is sick or not

364
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,681
Let 's compare it

365
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:17,521
How is it better ?

366
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,840
You look at me and I look at you

367
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,001
Each round tells each other a characteristic

368
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,080
Good or bad

369
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,281
If you say it correctly , the other party will drink it

370
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:26,681
If you don 't know , drink it yourself

371
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,401
It 's all one cup

372
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:28,840
I don 't think this is fair .

373
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,801
How can this be compared ?

374
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:32,980
Who will decide whether it is acceptable or not ?

375
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,840
Gu Yunsu Bar

376
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,401
She treated both of us

377
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:36,240
Everyone knows better

378
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,901
No problem

379
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,141
You are cheating

380
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:40,421
That

381
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,060
You 've seen the list before

382
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,360
Susu , what do you want to say ?

383
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,521
Just say it out loud

384
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,200
She 's afraid I 'll bully you

385
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,881
I will declare it in advance

386
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,161
I know something about you

387
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:49,840
Do you still play ?

388
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,641
Qin Yuxuan

389
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,641
Let me remind you first .

390
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:54,840
You can 't play this

391
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,881
You start and you lose

392
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:57,240
I 'll play if you care about me

393
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,881
This is exciting

394
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:00,100
Producer Qin is a

395
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,440
A person who has a great desire to win or lose , right ?

396
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,921
You 're starting , right ?

397
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:03,681
Standard

398
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,220
Not only do I like challenges

399
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
I also like winning

400
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,301
Dr. Xu is as competitive as I am

401
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:18,460
Is it accurate ? Susu

402
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:19,820
is it accurate

403
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:22,100
Divide people and things

404
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,240
Let me be specific .

405
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:26,220
The person who divides the person is the woman

406
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,060
The matter of separation is the matter of emotion

407
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,141
For example , Dr. Xu and I

408
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:30,960
If you like it

409
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,200
The same woman

410
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:33,421
Originally Dr. Xu

411
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:34,980
He only likes two points

412
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,181
and possessiveness

413
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:36,740
But because

414
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,220
My joining and competition

415
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:40,021
He became very fond of

416
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:41,181
and very possessive

417
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:41,840
Is it accurate ? Susu

418
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,521
No

419
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:46,080
He doesn 't know .

420
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,261
OK , I 'll drink it

421
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,220
Opinion reserved

422
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,060
Producer Qin is very conceited .

423
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,301
Conceitful people are often selfish

424
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:53,580
Stay with him

425
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:55,060
Always focus on him

426
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,541
is it accurate

427
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:57,621
I know this deeply

428
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,600
This

429
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:00,340
In the eyes of Dr. Xu

430
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,621
It 's considered conceited .

431
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,921
That must be Dr. Xu

432
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:04,301
You have some inferiority complex

433
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,700
I remember the last time we met

434
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,781
Dr. Xu is accepting his confession

435
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:10,021
It 's been so long .

436
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:11,560
Still no reply to others

437
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:13,801
I guess maybe

438
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:15,901
I 'm afraid that my old relationship will not be forgotten

439
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:16,860
Maybe

440
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,940
I 'm afraid that I can 't compare to my old relationship

441
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,901
Is it accurate ? Susu

442
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:25,340
Standard

443
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:28,041
I have a reason to look ahead and look back

444
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:28,781
I drink

445
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,460
You

446
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,161
You drink less .

447
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,541
Are you okay

448
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,100
Susu

449
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:38,381
It 's a pity

450
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,980
There is a word called regret is too late

451
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,401
If you miss him , you miss him

452
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,700
It 's really noisy on your side

453
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,681
You 're really noisy in my ears

454
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:45,401
Leave me alone

455
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:46,501
OK , I 'll do this round

456
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:47,261
If producer Qin

457
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:48,940
I fell in love with the same woman

458
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,340
Originally , I only liked two points

459
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,860
and two points of possessiveness

460
00:15:52,141 --> 00:15:53,220
But because of my presence

461
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:54,820
Producer Qin 's feelings

462
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,100
It turned into a great liking

463
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,661
and ten points of possession

464
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,541
Right

465
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,580
You want to call me competitive

466
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:00,740
I want to say you 're pathetic

467
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:02,740
I can 't tell what love is

468
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,440
What is desire

469
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,360
Is it accurate ? Susu

470
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,820
Not

471
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,940
Can we stop playing ?

472
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,641
This game

473
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:07,641
I don 't think it 's interesting

474
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:08,580
Don 't compete

475
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
We have to compete

476
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,381
Let 's compare more than one

477
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,340
Your calculation of who is good and who is bad

478
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,700
Just type more clearly

479
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:15,700
I don 't care

480
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,921
I came to find you .

481
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,401
It 's not what you want

482
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:19,940
You can compare if you want to .

483
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:21,661
Just don 't say every sentence

484
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:23,200
Can you bring me with you ?

485
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:25,240
I have nothing to do with him .

486
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,281
My only relationship with him

487
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:29,840
That 's because of you

488
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,761
What 's your relationship with her

489
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:38,720
Xu Wenbin , let me ask you

490
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,761
For our relationship

491
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,401
What do you think

492
00:16:44,281 --> 00:16:44,700
I

493
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,041
Not

494
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,320
You can 't say it here

495
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:07,881
OK

496
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:09,661
You two are almost on par .

497
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,820
It 's my turn

498
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,341
I 'll play a game with you too

499
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:17,500
Qin Yuxuan

500
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:20,081
At work before

501
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,621
You are my high leader

502
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,401
In Love

503
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:23,061
You are still me

504
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:24,260
A leader from above

505
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:25,881
Regardless of life

506
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:26,621
still working

507
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,000
What are you giving me ?

508
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,561
If you think it 's good , I 'll go on .

509
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,601
I can 't question your disobedience

510
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:32,681
Can 't dominate you either

511
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:34,621
Because you will always be sensible

512
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:35,280
correct

513
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,681
I will always

514
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,040
Unconditionally submit to you

515
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:38,641
Right

516
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:41,220
Accurate or not

517
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,101
That was before

518
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:43,460
Was I sure accurate before

519
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,061
Drink if it is accurate or not

520
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,621
Almost enough .

521
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,621
Xu Wenbin

522
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:00,500
I said I liked you

523
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:02,061
I also won for you

524
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:03,540
More than once , right

525
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:06,460
But you always hesitate

526
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,061
This pulling feeling

527
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:10,621
I really don 't like it .

528
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,960
Every time I take a step towards you

529
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,861
You just take two steps back

530
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,581
When I want to go back

531
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:15,780
You 're coming towards me again

532
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:17,500
I 'm a very useless person .

533
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,381
Every time you wave

534
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:19,000
I 'm just shitty

535
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,881
running towards you

536
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,220
Then I put all my passion

537
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,141
Give you all unconditionally

538
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:24,401
Because I just like you

539
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:25,581
Who made me like you ?

540
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:32,280
But I don 't like me that way

541
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,321
I really can 't stand it .

542
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,641
You 're so timid

543
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,980
Makes me look like a fool

544
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:41,881
You like me , right

545
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,040
At least you treat me

546
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
It 's very feeling

547
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,240
Or you wouldn 't be here

548
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:47,881
But what are you afraid of

549
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,361
Are you afraid I don 't like you enough ?

550
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,480
Still afraid of me

551
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,881
The old relationship with someone else is not over .

552
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,561
In the end , you just have one word

553
00:18:55,821 --> 00:18:56,321
Corpse

554
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,901
is it accurate

555
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,861
Accurate

556
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:03,960
Yes , I 'm a corpse

557
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,821
Susu

558
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,581
I think Qin Yuxuan is human

559
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:21,460
You can worship

560
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,540
Our boyfriend 's

561
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,460
But this surrender .

562
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,621
and Looking Up

563
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:26,141
It is two types

564
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:27,300
A completely different posture

565
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,940
I have always been

566
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,940
Lying down and looking at you like this

567
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,700
I can 't stand it anymore

568
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
I 'm up now

569
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,220
I stand up

570
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,341
It 's impossible to lie down again

571
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:34,141
Maybe I wasn 't clear enough

572
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:35,661
Or in recent times

573
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:36,940
The two of us go back and forth

574
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,220
You have a misunderstanding

575
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,141
Sorry

576
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,621
But now

577
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:40,901
Speak more clearly

578
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:42,181
It 's absolutely impossible for me

579
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,181
I got back together with you

580
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,141
Absolutely impossible

581
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:48,881
You did this for me today

582
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:49,800
Running up and down

583
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,220
I 'm grateful and touched

584
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:52,861
But I 'm using you .

585
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,200
I just want to use you

586
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,220
Facilitated this

587
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:56,421
This matter

588
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:57,480
I didn 't do it properly

589
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,341
I 'm sorry for a bastard .

590
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:10,101
Xu Wenbin

591
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,020
What I want to tell you is

592
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,980
I want it from you

593
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,101
Get an answer

594
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:17,800
Is it good or not

595
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,341
Does it work

596
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:19,260
But I have to come and go

597
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,621
I can 't get your answer .

598
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,581
I don 't want it

599
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,141
I 'm tired

600
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:29,901
My heart

601
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:30,621
It 's always like this

602
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:31,381
Up and down

603
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:32,540
Hanging in that place

604
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:34,460
I 'm hanging in that place .

605
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,421
I 'm like a fool

606
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,621
I 'm the only one at a loss

607
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:38,861
Because I don 't know

608
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:40,621
What kind of response would you give me

609
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:43,760
Tonight

610
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,681
We sit in this place

611
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,921
I just feel quite embarrassed

612
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,520
It 's embarrassing

613
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:50,760
This picture of my life

614
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,800
I 'll never forget it here

615
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,720
I thought of this

616
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,260
I am

617
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,401
My face is burning .

618
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,480
I feel like my toes are picking on the ground

619
00:20:55,681 --> 00:20:56,520
I can 't stand it anymore

620
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,361
I 'm breaking down

621
00:20:58,361 --> 00:20:59,040
How can there be

622
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,280
Such an absurd thing

623
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:01,800
Happened in my life

624
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,800
Particularly disgraceful

625
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,960
I don 't want to like you .

626
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,200
I want to  as soon as possible

627
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,720
Take back my love for you

628
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:09,581
Of course I know

629
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:11,280
People can 't do it so easily

630
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,681
I don 't like another person

631
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,520
But try it

632
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,641
I think I can do it

633
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,401
Take your time and everything will be fine

634
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:17,341
I hope

635
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,700
In the future , both of us

636
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,780
When we meet again

637
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:22,421
between each other

638
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,881
Please give me some face .

639
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,000
Shall we all be decent ?

640
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,121
There 's so much I 've done

641
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:53,081
Let 's not play today

642
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:54,700
Don 't drink it , I 'll do it

643
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,601
What are you doing What are you doing

644
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:57,161
What are you doing

645
00:21:57,821 --> 00:21:58,881
Li Yan Li Yan Li Yan

646
00:21:58,881 --> 00:21:59,841
Be careful

647
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,000
Hurry , hurry , hurry

648
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,161
Hurry up , hurry up , hurry up

649
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,440
That 's really good

650
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,621
Is Li Yan okay ?

651
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:06,841
It 's okay , it 's okay

652
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:21,921
Repeat

653
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:22,641
Parents ask

654
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,641
Where did you go tonight

655
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,440
How to say

656
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:26,821
Chasing Stars

657
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:27,561
Chasing Stars

658
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:29,960
Why suddenly remember idolize

659
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,520
Learning is stressful

660
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:33,601
Release it by idolize

661
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:34,800
Yes , yes , yes , just say that

662
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,921
You won 't betray me even if you die

663
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,681
Gambling on our men 's dignity

664
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:44,841
Can that

665
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,161
Don 't be in front of the whole school

666
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:48,361
Public execution

667
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,921
That depends on what Li Yan means .

668
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:50,921
As long as he says yes

669
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:52,240
Hello Master

670
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,321

671
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:55,921
OK will come out soon

672
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:58,321
The online ride - hailing service has arrived

673
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,940
Disband and leave on the spot

674
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,681
Where

00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:05,980

680
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:15,081
Is this all right ?

681
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:15,800
It 's okay , it 's okay

682
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,200
No big problem

683
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,800
Thank you for your hard work

684
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,101

Have a good celebration party

688
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,161
Aren 't they all in the hotel ?

689
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,641
I have to go to that place

690
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,720
So many Internet celebrities yesterday

691
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,760
So many big names are there

692
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,641
When the public opinion comes out tomorrow

693
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,361
How do you handle it

694
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:31,681
Don 't worry

695
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:32,321
I 'm communicating right now

696
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:32,881
I 'm worried .

697
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:34,000
I 'm not at ease now

698
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:35,621
When I first worked on this project

699
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,440
What did you tell me ?

700
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,361
What breast is patted

701
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,861
What do I say to the board now

702
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,901
More than one hundred million

703
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:40,821
You can handle it

704
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:41,161
Mr. Xie

705
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:43,040
I 'm contacting these guys right now

706
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,361
Their media is awake

707
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,280
Wake up Wake up

It 's fine

710
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,361

00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,121
Adult

715
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,720
Then someone asks you next time

716
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,280
You say that

717
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,841

It 's all taken care of

721

Don 't worry if I 'm here , Mr. Xie

726

Don 't give it away

You got things done

728
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,800
Okay , okay , don 't worry

729
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:10,540
Walk slowly

730
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,000
Happy Birthday

731
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,220
Happy Birthday

732
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,641
How does the adult world feel ?

733
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:28,760
It 's too uncomfortable

734
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,601
Grow Up

735
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,321
Discomfort is normal

736
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,861
Sorry

737
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:08,760
Sorry for what

738
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,881
It 's causing you so much trouble

739
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,081
There 's more

740
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,561
While playing games

741
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,280
It 's too heavy .

742
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,601
There 's more

743
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,881
Taking advantage of your confidence

744
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,200
Yes

745
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:31,561
I 'm too confident

746
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:35,200
I 'm just too confident

747
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,601
It 's not easy

748
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:42,780
General Manager Qin

749
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,480
Are you aware of this now ?

750
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,200
In fact

751
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,500
It 's not shameful to bow your head .

752
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,401
At this age

753
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,361
Bend down

754
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,841
To continue to live a good life

755
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:14,841
I don 't call it bending over .

756
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:17,440
The most basic face

757
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,720
We still have to give it to him

758
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,321
Don 't worry

759
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:21,341
Dare not do anything to me

760
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,681
In fact , Gu Yunsu

761
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:28,681
You are right

762
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,280
You 're more mature

763
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,641
But it 's still the same

764
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,240
Not Accepted

765
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,921
You just won 't accept it

766
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:41,440
Knowing that I should bend but not bend

767
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,440
That 's pretty handsome .

768
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:51,601
I don 't know

769
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:55,800
I don 't know .

770
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,641
This will be  from now on

771
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,861
It 's home for two of us

772
00:27:59,081 --> 00:28:00,621
If it 's more greasy than sweet

773
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,760
Then I 'm quite confident .

774
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:05,881
I really like you

775
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,520
I like you too

776
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:12,440
This gentleman

777
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
Your breakfast has been delivered

778
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:16,040
Come on

779
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,161
Why do you love me so much

780
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:19,881
Why are you so good ?

781
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,601
What do you think

782
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:22,601
Where are we ?

783
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,561
The step of meeting parents

784
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:27,621
Meeting Parents

785
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,020
I booked a ticket back to Shanghai tomorrow

786
00:28:38,621 --> 00:28:39,661
What time is the plane ?

787
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:41,821
What plane do you take back to Shanghai ?

788
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:42,700
High - speed rail

789
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:45,621
What time will I send you the high - speed train ?

790
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,020
OK

791
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,700
That gives me a hand

792
00:29:08,361 --> 00:29:09,020
What 's wrong

793
00:29:10,061 --> 00:29:11,540
Get up a little bit

794
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,000
Is this enough ?

795
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,280
A little higher

796
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,200
A little higher

797
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:19,921
Yes

798
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,381
Yes .

799
00:29:22,181 --> 00:29:22,841
Be careful

800
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,440
Starting today

801
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:34,700
Qin Yuxuan left .

802
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:40,141
Technically , he didn 't appear .

803
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,861
After Today

804
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,341
I will be an adult

805
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,621
So I came in

806
00:30:00,861 --> 00:30:01,661
I said I entered the field

807
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:02,740
I 'm eighteen

808
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,540
Happy Birthday

809
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,821
Happy Birthday

810
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,700
You see

811
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:24,101
Chihuahua and Golden Retriever are fighting

812
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:27,740
Gu Yunsu

813
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,061
Why are you a sister ?

814
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,780
Are you dizzy , aren 't you

815
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,220
All right , all right

816
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,300
What do you think of all the time ?

817
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:33,740
Mei Mei Mei Mei

818
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,141
This can 't be blamed on Susu .

819
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,500
You are quiet and calm .

820
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:38,421
Don 't rush

821
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:39,061
Hurry up and take a look

822
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:40,020
Let me go see Li Yan

823
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:42,460
How about Li Yan

824
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,061
Don 't worry , Auntie

825
00:30:44,061 --> 00:30:44,901
I just drank too much

826
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:46,181
No additional questions

827
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:47,601
What 's wrong with you

828
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,621
You can 't figure it out yourself

829
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:49,940
Don 't bring others with you

830
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,561
Is it good ?

831
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,901
In case there is a problem

832
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:52,940
You 're gonna kill me you

833
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,821
I know I know

834
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,460
I was wrong

835
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,260
Think about it .

836
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,760
Wrong

837
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:56,581
Don 't shout

838
00:30:56,581 --> 00:30:57,561
I hate you .

839
00:30:57,561 --> 00:30:58,980
Not good for your stomach

840
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:07,300
See it

841
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:08,500
I have to bend down too

842
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,181
For Life

843
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,520
You have to bend down when you should .

844
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,280
Master , let 's wait a moment .

845
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:52,101
Hi

846
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,861
Hi

847
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,121
What are you doing

848
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,361
What is it doing

849
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,260
I just wanted to try my outfit

850
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,641
Can you be recognized by others

851
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,720
I was thinking about this hotel

852
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,040
It 's very close to my house , isn 't it

853
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:05,480
People come and go .

854
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,220
In case an acquaintance finds out

855
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,401
Isn 't this critical ?

856
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:08,940
OK

857
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:09,960
You don 't recognize me

858
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:10,800
I 'm relieved

859
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,960
What are you doing ?

860
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,161
You 're wearing this two cake

861
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:14,161
You have tears in your eyes

862
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,641
Still in love with me ?

863
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:17,240
I really envy your confidence

864
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,720
Here 's a power of attorney for you

865
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,760
Escape Plan

866
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,000
Give me full agency

867
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:31,921
Sister Zimeng and I have also explained it .

868
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,921
She understands

869
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:34,921
After all , we haven 't signed this contract .

870
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,040
You 're not afraid that I 'm mercenary

871
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,960
Sold you

872
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:43,440
We are neither lovers now

873
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,321
Not a friend either

874
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:46,681
Qin Yuxuan , I believe you once .

875
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:48,601
Trusted

876
00:32:48,881 --> 00:32:49,821
Bundling of common interests

877
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:51,101
is the strongest relationship

878
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:52,520
Being a Comrade

879
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,480
Revolutionary friendship is unbreakable

880
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:55,681
Don 't worry

881
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,641
Let 's go

882
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,260
Goodbye this time .

883
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,800
Top people don 't dress like you

884
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:25,440
Stop looking and go

885
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,121
Exercise between classes

886
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:27,121
Walk

887
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,520
Your sister

888
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,460
What else have I taken you to ?

889
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,440
There are no other fun places

890
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:32,101
Li Yan

891
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:33,401
Take us with you next time

892
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:34,921
It 's better to have fun alone than to have fun with others

893
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:35,960
That word read music

894
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,641
Whatever it reads

895
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,280
You 're still good - looking

896
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:54,841
It looks good . I told you just now .

897
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,161
Too expensive

898
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,321
Wait until I save money .

899
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:58,200
Too expensive

900
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,720
It 's not expensive anymore

901
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,700
Yes , it happens to be our store today

902
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,121
9th Year of Operation

903
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:05,000
You can get a 10 % discount on the site

904
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:06,500
Yes

905
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,280
Forget about 10 % discount

906
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,960
I 'm fine , fine , fine

907
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:11,641
Our family has

908
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:13,161
Supreme VIP Membership Card

909
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,480
50 % discount is available

910
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,081
How much is the 50 % discount card ?

911
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,400
Not expensive twelve thousand eight thousand

912
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,061
This is good

913
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:19,001
This is good

914
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:20,041
This is mainly convenient for washing hair

915
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,541
We also have a shampoo card at home

916
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:23,501
No , no , no , no , no

917
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,340
My home is still a little far from here

918
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,581
I have another matter behind me

919
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:27,900
I 'm almost done today .

920
00:34:28,021 --> 00:34:28,941
That 's fine . Let 's do it for now .

921
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,200
Line

922
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,220
Let 's check out at the front desk .

923
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,021
OK OK

924
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:31,800
OK

925
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,181
Still good looking

926
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:35,860
I look good here , I look good here

927
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:37,420
My Good My Good

928
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
Xu Wenbin is looking for you again

929
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,521
I found you recently

930
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,900
Why are you a little nosy ?

931
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,300
Stop giving hope

932
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,800
Aunt Wu

933
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,280
There is no family accompanying me today .

934
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:54,300
Family members refused to come in

935
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,461
Then it 's best to contact us .

936
00:35:57,461 --> 00:35:58,260
Some Notes

937
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,340
It is best for family members to be there

938
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,101
Listen together

939
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,541
You see it

940
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,541
I told her to come in .

941
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,181
OK

942
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,461
Hello to Dr. Xu

943

I want my family to come in

944
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,300
Don 't worry about me .

945
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,181
Susu Ne

946

I am a family member .

947
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:28,021
Li Yan

948
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:29,780
Why didn 't you attend school ?

949
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,541
Exam papers were handed in early

950
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,541
I am a family member

951
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,541
Just tell me if you have anything to say

952
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:01,880
Xiaoyan

Is there much homework today ?

954
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,581
Not much , it 's done soon

00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:13,380

00:38:41,461 --> 00:38:42,061
I don 't want to see you

1019
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:44,920

00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:27,220
What 's going on ?

1047
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:29,581
Susu is like me

1048
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,941
He ran back to his room

1049
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:32,661
I

1050
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,420
What is this for

1051
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:35,941
I 'll ask her

1052
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,720
You can 't

1053
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,941
There 's another chance

1054
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,941
Why

1055
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,621
You can 't have it with me

1056
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,181
What does it mean

1057
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,300
Literal

1058
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,601
You mean you like

1059
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,001
It 's not her . Isn 't she your sister ?

1060
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:00,920
What do you care ?

1061
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,441
She said she didn 't want to see you

1062
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:05,641
Stop looking for her and go back quickly

1063
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:08,240
I won 't give you a chance

1064
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,161
We received a report

1065
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,941
Say you brought some high school students with you

1066
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,081
Access to entertainment venues

1067
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:20,141
and destroying property in the store

1068
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,041
Failure to compensate

1069
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:21,840
Request our police

1070
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,961
Criticize and educate you

1071
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,561
and supervise claims

1072
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,501

Gu Yunsu 's

1084
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,240
Police Uncle

1085
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,501
Which good citizen do you say

1086
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:43,760
I heard that I was going to get involved

1087
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,121
Don 't be scared to death

1088
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,760
Make a phone call to apply for foreign aid

1089
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,181
That 's reasonable , right ?

1090
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:48,961
Yes

1091
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,021
That day we

1092
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:51,121
They are all with Li Yan

1093
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,681
So what happened

1094
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:53,920
We have to bear the burden together

1095
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,400
Right

1096
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,880
Yes

1097
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,601
I was there when he fainted

1098
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,081
To say there is responsibility

1099
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,121
I 'm to blame .

1100
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,501
When your brother fell

1101
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:01,601
It did damage some

1102
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:02,320
In - store items

1103
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,001
The shop owner alarms

1104
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:03,700
Our police

1105
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,860
It must be handled seriously

1106
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:05,920
Supervise you

1107
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,360
In addition to compensation for the loss of the shopkeeper

1108
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:08,601
Critical education is also carried out

1109
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:09,521
Yes Yes Yes

1110
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:10,521
We give it to the police uncle

1111
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:11,240
Sorry for trouble

1112
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,760
That moment

1113
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,240
Who of you is responsible for compensation

1114
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,021
Let me do it

1115
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:15,800
They come

1116
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:17,681
We 've agreed .

1117
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,320
Mind your own business

1118
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:22,661
You eat and drink from your parents

1119
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:23,501
What are you paying ?

1120
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:24,601
I broke the cup

1121
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:25,400
What is your position

1122
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,200
Pay this for me

1123
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,081
Dr. Xu

1124
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,880
I think you do

1125
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,200
There is no position to take care of other people 's family affairs .

1126
00:41:35,081 --> 00:41:36,280
Gu Yunsu and I are friends

1127
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,141
Friends

1128
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,360
On Time

1129
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,601
Not as long as my friend

1130
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:42,041
Talk about Relationship

1131
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:43,541
You 're not as close as Li Yan

1132
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,541
I think it 's better to forget it .

1133
00:41:46,141 --> 00:41:46,621
Right

1134
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:52,581
I like Gu Yunsu

1135
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,380
Younger Brother

1136
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,681
Or give it to him .

1137
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,760
Let him perform

1138
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,800
He 's confessed .

1139
00:42:11,081 --> 00:42:12,760
I just don 't want him to pay

1140
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:13,920
Younger Brother

1141
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,021
Let him pay

1142
00:42:15,521 --> 00:42:16,441
I have a little eyesight

1143
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,021
Let 's see

1144
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:19,121
Any objection

1145
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,320
Give a QR code

1146
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,320
Where do I scan ?

1147
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:22,601
Row Row Row

1148
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:24,001
I 'll come , I 'll come

1149
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,200
OK

1150
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:28,121
OK

1151
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,400
You as a parent

1152
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:31,041
Bringing high school students into entertainment places

1153
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,840
Leave a copy for inspection

1154
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:34,601
I also apply

1155
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:35,920
Accept criticism from police comrades

1156
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:36,800
As a companion

1157
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,161
I didn 't do a good job in supervision

1158
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,121
