1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,761
What are we going to eat later

2
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,661
How about pizza

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,360
Yes Yes Yes Yes

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,220
He he he

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,380
So handsome

6
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:35,941
Li Mei

7
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:40,381
I only know your name is Li Mei

8
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:42,921
I don 't know your last name yet

9
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:47,201
Her name is Wu

10
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:52,860
What are you doing

11
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,501
This is for you

12
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,900
No need to pay me back

13
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,521
Mom

14
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,201
Actually , I think my father is this time .

15
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,081
You 're really serious .

16
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,000
Of course

17
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,521
It 's also because he 's old .

18
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,581
Restored

19
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,041
Your father 's heart

20
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,241
It 's different from others

21
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,880
What about others

22
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,780
What age is it

23
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,361
What kind of life , right ?

24
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,681
Your father is not

25
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,600
What age is your father

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,720
All have to pass

27
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,041
The day he wants

28
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,440
He couldn 't live ordinary days

29
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,241
You know that

30
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:10,681
Your father 's life

31
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:12,081
It 's a pity not to be an artist

32
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
I 'm different

33
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,440
I want to live an ordinary life

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,081
So I choose

35
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,241
Life like this now

36
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,201
Select such a person

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,681
What I 'm looking for now

38
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:24,081
I don 't regret it at all

39
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:25,641
I think

40
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:26,641
Uncle Li is

41
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,921
The kind of person I want

42
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:31,641
Ordinary and ordinary

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,000
But he is at ease

44
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:37,081
I support

45
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:39,521
In Love

46
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:40,801
Once unreliable

47
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:41,801
Never reliable

48
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,600
That 's so right

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Mei Mei

50
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:46,160
Susu

I 'm upstairs and downstairs

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,340

54
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,440
You came here for a walk

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,641
Not tomorrow morning

56
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:52,880
Did we just switch ?

57
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:54,521
Your mother will be early tomorrow morning

58
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,880
Fasting Physical Examination

59
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,201
Several tubes of blood will be drawn

60
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:58,081
I 'm not at ease

61
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:59,880
I have to come early

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,720
Then you accompany me

63
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,681
I 'll draw less blood

64
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:02,761
Nah Nah Nah

65
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:04,681
Smoke as much as you need

66
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,241
Then you should feel at ease

67
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,000
All right , all right

68
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,961
Don 't worry

69
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,261
No, how can you  today?

70
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,320
This

71
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:12,880
Come this far for a walk

72
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,921
I am in a good mood today

73
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,600
I didn 't know you were coming here

74
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:44,960
OK

75
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,421
You know you feel sorry for me

76
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,481
Get better quickly

77
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,640
Yes Yes Yes

78
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,721
This time is more serious

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,241
After discharge

80
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:53,460
I must exercise well

81
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:55,401
No longer let you worry about me

82
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,921
Then let 's agree

83
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,801
Don 't heal the scar and forget the pain

84
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,721
Next time ,

85
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:02,940
I 'm exhausted

86
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,520
I really don 't care about you .

87
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:07,361
I don 't believe it

88
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,960
How can my wife ignore me

89
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:11,960
Then try

90
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,260
You parents

91
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,620
No matter how big the contradiction is

92
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,380
Not in front of children .

93
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:33,221
How much harm does it do to children

94
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,580
Comrade Police , you are right

95
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,901
Today I was really impulsive

96
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,101
This thing should be compensated

97
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,181
Will definitely compensate

98
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,341

99
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:45,161

Husband and wife

109

Due to relationship breakdown

110
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,101
Reconciliation is no longer possible

111
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,020
You said this

112
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:01,301

200
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,560
Already went to see it

201
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:02,901
Hi

202
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,560
Let me tell you

203
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,541
I 'm in the next bed

204
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,181
You and your wife fainted

205
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,161
Come quickly

206
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,340
We can 't live without our family .

207
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:10,501
Is it better ?

208
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,060
Much better

209
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:14,340
My expression slowed down

210
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,200
Much better than just now

211
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,320
Here , here , here

212
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,960
Thank you .

213
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,881
Special thanks

214
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,801
Wife

215
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,060
How is your health ?

216
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,641
Dead

217
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:23,641
How 's it going

218
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:24,761
Agreed

219
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,200
Little sister has something this morning

220
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,881
You want to accompany me for the prenatal check - up

221
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,541
Yes

222
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,720
It 's agreed but people

223
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,200
You said I was uncomfortable this morning

224
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,360
How many times did I call you

225
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,521
You didn 't answer any .

226
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:34,301
What about last night

227
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:34,921
Mr. Zhang

228
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,320
He insisted on letting me go over for a drink

229
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,480
I said I won 't drink when I go home

230
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,360
He said no

231
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,200
Are you there ?

232
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,401
He drank from that pot

233
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:41,480
Who can stand it ?

234
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,761
As a result , I drank too much Mei Mei

235
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,681
The prenatal check - up must be accompanied

236
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:45,340
Yes Yes Yes

237
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,001
It 's dangerous to have no one with her .

238
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:47,740
I know

239
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,521
Why don 't I hurry over ?

240
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:49,621
I know it 's not you yet

241
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,121
I 'm not drinking too much , right ?

242
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:53,041
This is a delay . Look , look .

243
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:53,921
How is your health now

244
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:54,641
Hate

245
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,921
You don 't eat either .

246
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:56,521
Can your body stand it ?

247
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:57,720
What do you think ?

248
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,200
Fortunately , there is one next door

249
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,381
Uncle and aunt take care of me

250
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:01,560
I just recovered .

251
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,041
I count on you

252
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:05,001
That uncle and aunt

253
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:05,901
Really giving it

254
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,161
I 'm sorry for your trouble

255
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,521
I 'm very busy recently

256
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,080
That aunt disturbed your rest

257
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,761
It 's okay to rest

258
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:11,560
I 'm fine

259
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,100
Uncle , thank you very much .

260
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,860
Not this

261
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,041
Look at my wife

262
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,641
I knew you were here today

263
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:22,200
We need to draw blood on an empty stomach

264
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,440
I specially put this chocolate

265
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,001
I 've already

266
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:25,041
I 'm ready for you .

267
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:25,641
You see

268
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,001
Eat a chocolate first

269
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:28,521
The couple quarreled

270
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:29,600
What 's interesting

271
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:31,801
Let me tell you

272
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:34,121
These two are unhearted

273
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,960
This one has an uncle

274
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,860
One Aunt at a Time

275
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,681
What are they doing

276
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,600
If I knew , I would have ignored them

277
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,161
I 'm from Susu 's generation

278
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:44,720
It 's normal to call me uncle and aunt

279
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:47,840
Enter

280
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:49,200
Dr. Xu

281
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,940
This is Wu Limei from Number 35

282
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,641
This morning 's test report came out

283
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:53,921
OK , thank you

284
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,161
Uncle Li and Aunt Wu

285
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,240
If nothing goes wrong

286
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,521
We can be discharged next week

287
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:08,401
Dr. Xiao Xu

288
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:09,480
You mean

289
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,720
I saved the child

290
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:11,801
The data is good

291
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:13,240
The height of the placenta has also increased a bit

292
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,440
To be on the safe side

293
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,521
We 'll watch for another week

294
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,921
If everything goes as usual

295
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,240
We can go home and have an abortion .

296
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,560
It 's not easy for us

297
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,881
We finally got through .

298
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:23,080
It 's not easy

299
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:23,960
Come , come , come , come

300
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,921
Now there is one thing to note

301
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:26,200
It is gestational diabetes

302
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,080
Except for fruit

303
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,860
Desserts and drinks

304
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,761
You can 't eat these high sugars

305
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:29,681
Need to control not eating or not

306
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:30,100
Don 't eat , don 't eat well

307
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,840
I want to write this down

308
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,600
What we know

309
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,761
For desserts

310
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,521
High sugar

311
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,001
After we go back

312
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:39,600
You can prepare one of these instruments

313
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,240
Monitor values every day

314
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:42,560
How to use this

315
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,240
After turning away

316
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,141
It 's this needle

317
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:45,600
It 's bleeding when it 's stuck .

318
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,401
Touch it up

319
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,200
It can display blood sugar values

320
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,440
Look , I 'll show you .

321
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,560
Is this the right thing to do ?

322
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,720
That 's it

323
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:54,360
Does it hurt

324
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,720
It hurts a little bit

325
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,641
But tolerable

326
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,720
But I can 't stand it

327
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:58,960
Six months after you

328
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,521
I have to get an injection every day

329
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,121
It 's for the good of our children anyway

330
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,960
Then

331
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,801
From now on , you will get every needle

332
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:05,881
I 'll take a needle with you .

333
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:07,281
That kid is also my kid

334
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,240
I have to do my part .

335
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,480
No need , Li Jianxiong

336
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,761
I 'll just measure my blood sugar , by the way

337
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,960
You don 't need to be so righteous .

338
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,681
What 's wrong

339
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,801
You really need to test it

340
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:18,240
The sugar content is too high

341
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,281
We often do this

342
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:23,881
Come

343
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,580
OK

344
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,881
Dr. Xu

345
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:34,600
How is my mom 's diagnosis ?

346
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,281
Why is it hot ?

347
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:38,161
You 're crazy

348
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,001
Hot

349
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,641
You know it 's hot .

350
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,340
Are you trying to burn me ?

351
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,681
You still want to piss me off

352
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:44,761
You are pregnant

353
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,521
I 'm not the same as you .

354
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:47,840
This belly isn 't big .

355
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,720
The temper is not small .

356
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,240
I have a big temper

357
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,921
I have a big temper

358
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,161
You didn 't force it .

359
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,080
Who did you drink with last night

360
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,881
Is it with Mr. Zhang ?

361
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:56,440
Which Mr. Zhang did you drink with ?

362
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,480
Mr. Zhang , have you seen Mr. Zhang ?

363
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,401
Make it up for me again

364
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,641
You have this information

365
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,801
What is the King 's Canyon ?

366
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,080
With your friends

367
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,921
Drinking together

368
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,580
Everyone else is for this family

369
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,021
Running there for my career

370
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:08,041
What 's your name

371
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,521
You call that black

372
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:11,240
I 've worked hard .

373
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,360
You call that running around

374
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,720
You call that moving

375
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,921
Being a father can 't be so easy .

376
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,840
Complain in front of me every day

377
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,421
Say that you worked hard

378
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:20,480
Where did you work hard ?

379
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,001
You or you wouldn 't come

380
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,440
Sit there when you come

381
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,021
Your butt

382
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:25,301
It 's like a nail growing

383
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:26,360
You sit uneasy

384
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,041
You don 't want to

385
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,681
Tell me a few more words

386
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,921
I hold your broken phone every day

387
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:32,041
Not watching short videos there

388
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,161
It 's just playing games

389
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,041
You like mobile phones so much

390
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,200
Why don 't you use your mobile phone ?

391
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,161
These husbands

392
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:36,881
It 's not all there

393
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:37,801
Do you play with your mobile phone ?

394
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,440
How can I talk to my wife ?

395
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,480
Bed next door

396
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,720
The bed next door will not

397
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:45,021
I don 't know how others live .

398
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,080
I can 't control it either

399
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,121
But I look at the bed next door every day

400
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:49,641
I have only one thought

401
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,041
I feel like being your wife

402
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,480
I 'm embarrassed

403
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:12,720
Uncle

404
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:17,760
Give it to me

405
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,960
No , no , I 'll do it , I 'll do it

406
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:20,921
Don 't get your hands wet .

407
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:21,921
I washed it together

408
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,401
Thank you , Uncle

409
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:25,601
What are you thanking for

410
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:27,020
Thank you for bringing my mother .

411
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,161
So well taken care of

412
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,800
That 's my own wife

413
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,121
I 'm pregnant with my own baby

414
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:32,720
Isn 't it right to be nice to her ?

415
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:34,040
What 's there to say about this

416
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,681
Then I won 't thank you anymore .

417
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,800
Is there anything else you want to say

418
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,321
It 's okay , I just think

419
00:17:52,161 --> 00:17:53,040
You said

420
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,480
If my mother could be young

421
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,081
I wish I had met you earlier

422
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,440
What about the fate between people

423
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,161
Pay attention to an opportunity

424
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,040
One second earlier is impossible

425
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:13,720
Not even a second later

426
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:16,881
Also

427
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,161
If I met earlier , I wouldn 't be there .

428
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,000
This screen

429
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,280
It 's very warm and touching

430
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,921
What are you talking about ?

431
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:27,760
Timing Emotion

432
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:29,980
Are you talking about the same topic ?

433
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,181
This donkey 's mouth is wrong

434
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,681
This chat is sometimes like this

435
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:33,401
One Meaning

436
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,881
I do have one

437
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,000
With timing and affection

438
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,361
If it 's all involved

439
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,200
Dr. Xu said it

440
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:45,161
I 'll be out next week

441
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes

442
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:06,040
You have something to do with me

443
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,980
I heard my mom will be discharged next week

444
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,861
If nothing goes wrong

445
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
I want to talk to you

446
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,440
Change Place

447
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,760
Where to go

448
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,881
A place to eat

449
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:37,601
A place to eat

450
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:40,841
I 'll go eat first .

451
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,881
Xu Wenbin

452
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,440
Where have you been

453
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:10,200
I went to the canteen on the rooftop .

454
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:12,520
Isn 't it a place to eat ?

455
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:18,681
Didn 't you ask me for something ?

456
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:19,520
What 's going on ?

457
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,361
I

458
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,040
I want to say

459
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,720
What do you want to say ?

460
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:38,841
I want to say

461
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:40,621
Or

462
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,480
Qin Yuxuan

463
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:51,321
What are you doing here

464
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:52,561
Why can 't I come ?

465
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,440
You are ill

466
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,841
I came to see you

467
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:55,760
Who is he ?

468
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,200
Who he is and what does it matter to you

469
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,141
What are you yelling about ?

470
00:21:58,141 --> 00:21:59,141
Why has nothing to do with me ?

471
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:00,240
I can 't care about you .

472
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,121
Don 't shout , okay ?

473
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:01,460
Don 't shout

474
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,280
Why don 't you catch up first ?

475
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,321
I 'll go first

476
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:04,520
Xu Wenbin Xu Wenbin

477
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,480
I like you

478
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:18,601
I I like you

479
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,260
What I wanted to tell you just now

480
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,141
This is it

481
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:30,681
Do you have any

482
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:32,081
What you want to tell me

483
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:37,480
You guys should find out first

484
00:22:38,341 --> 00:22:39,141
I 'll go first

485
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,161
We 've figured it out pretty well

486
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,921
I have nothing to talk to him

487
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,881
Qin Yuxuan

488
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:46,040
I don 't want to talk to you right now

489
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,280
What are you doing here ?

490
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,341
The lioness is in heat

491
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:53,421
It came to look for

492
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:55,700
Two male lions of the Super Pride

493
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:57,681
Why did you want him to come to me ?

494
00:22:58,601 --> 00:22:59,440
Add fun

495
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,440
What to help

496
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,700
Let me tell you

497
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,561
I found something

498
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:03,181
Did you know

499
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,581
This male world

500
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:06,720
I especially like competition

501
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:08,000
Really

502
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:09,960
As soon as this little Qin appears

503
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:11,161
Have you found anything

504
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:13,401
This little Dr. Xu is very excited

505
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,280
How about

506
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,720
Is the fire fierce or not

507
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:17,240
You 're trying to draw money from the bottom of the pot

508
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,240
The fire is all out

509
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,401
How could the fire be extinguished

510
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,960
This animal world says

511
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Mom , the man and the man

512
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:24,881
He 's a little different , right ?

513
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,960
What 's the difference ?

514
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,841
All the same

515
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,681
Right

516
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:30,540
Yes Yes

517
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,040
Push Tower Push Tower Push Tower

518
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,800
Hurry up

519
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,800
You can always trust the animal world

520
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,480
If the fire goes out

521
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,720
It must be your problem

522
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,561
Line My Question

523
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:42,440
OK my question

524
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,081
That 's right

525
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,220
How about

526
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,520
Let 's look forward to it together

527
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,681
Tomorrow 's Animal World

528
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,520
You will accompany me tomorrow .

529
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Seeing the Animal World

530
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,240
OK

531
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:55,361
But today 's issue is not very good

532
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,280
It 's scary

533
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,681
You 're scarier than they are

534
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:02,480
I 'm doing it for your own good , you know ?

535
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:03,561
Not knowing good or bad

536
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,621
After Uncle Li 's work

537
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,980
Will go home to cook first

538
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,800
And send it over

539
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,720
It takes almost an hour

540
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,681
Make the sky visible

541
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:14,921
Let the white clouds hear

542
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:16,720
No one can erase it

543
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,641
The promises we made

544
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,940
But if you tell him

545
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:36,641
My mom wants to eat from Anita 's

546
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,800
Croissant Sandwich

547
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:39,780
He would stop by after work

548
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:41,821
And Anita Restaurant

549
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:43,901
Exactly between the unit and the hospital

550
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:44,841
You 're welcome , thank you

551
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:47,141
This way he will be better than usual

552
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:48,740
Arrive about an hour early

553
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,821
And this time

554
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,141
It 's pretty tight

555
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,141
Are you stupid ?

556
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:54,760
Yes No

557
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,641
Nobita is here

558
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,960
Arrived late

559
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,520
Lao Gu is here today .

560
00:25:05,141 --> 00:25:06,401
Are you anxious for Mei Mei ?

561
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,440
Lao Gu , you wear a hospital gown today

562
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,121
What is the condition in the maternity ward

563
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:12,861
Just think of us

564
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:14,040
Are you wearing pajamas

565
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:15,881
We are in the same boat

566
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:16,800
Just wait .

567
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,601
Uncle , you came early today

568
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,321
Mei Mei said she wanted to eat Anita

569
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:22,681
She sent me a special WeChat message

570
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,321
I said from the unit

571
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:25,480
Why don 't you bring it here ?

572
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:26,601
So I want to eat Anita

573
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:27,520
A little earlier

574
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,240
I told Gu Yunsu that I

575
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,401
I want to eat Anita

576
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,641
You 're very sweet .

577
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:34,601
Yeah

578
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:36,921
I took your phone specifically

579
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:38,280
I sent a message to Uncle

580
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:39,841
I have more thoughtful things .

581
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,841
My mother loves watching Animal World recently

582
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:42,881
I 'll turn the channel later

583
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:44,121
Tuned to CCTV10

584
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:45,841
I heard that there was a lion fight today

585
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:46,480
It looks good .

586
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
What 's the fight ?

587
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,681
The winner is already decided

588
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:50,161
What do you eat , Anita

589
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:51,000
Try this

590
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:52,240
Then Anita has changed .

591
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:53,440
The cooks have been changed

592
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,700
Mei Mei said she loves to eat it

593
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:56,240
Chef changed

594
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,601
The taste has changed

595
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:59,240
I 'm not happy with this

596
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:00,720
Come , come , come , eat , eat , eat

597
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,361
Come to Su Su and open them all

598
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:03,800
The croissant is still hot

599
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,681
Don 't we have croissants ?

600
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,520
then why

601
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,000
You want me to buy croissants

602
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:11,121
My mom is pregnant recently

603
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:12,161
Mouth is tricky

604
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,641
My father gives her croissants every day

605
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,720
Every day

606
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,921
This croissant is not that croissant

607
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,361
Just love my bite

608
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,321
I can 't do it without coming

609
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,540
I said I 'll give it to you

610
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,821
Make so many nutritious meals

611
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:25,040
Why don 't you have any appetite

612
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:26,800
You eat croissants every day

613
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,460
That croissant is so high in calories

614
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,300
High fat stuff

615
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,040
It 's all butter

616
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,061
You can handle it

617
00:26:31,061 --> 00:26:32,401
You the baby in your belly

618
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:33,240
I can 't stand it either .

619
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:35,601
What

620
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:37,361
What did you say

621
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:38,641
I said so high calories

622
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:39,480
High fat stuff

623
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,980
The baby in my belly can 't stand it

624
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,760
I understand

625
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,881
What baby

626
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,240
Isn 't it gone , baby

627
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,520
If you can 't control it

628
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,401
Where 's your mouth

629
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:51,421
Just take care of your legs

630
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:52,361
You can go out

631
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,121
Outside

632
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:55,161
It wasn 't abortion .

633
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:57,520
Raise yourself here

634
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,800
Then I got so angry

635
00:26:58,841 --> 00:26:59,800
Conditioning and conditioning

636
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,720
You 're interesting .

637
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Who told you that

638
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,601
Who did she tell me ?

639
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:07,841
She told me that too

640
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:09,000
That 's all told me

641
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:12,681
You are so interesting

642
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,601
Mei Mei , you told Lao Gu .

643
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:16,000
I didn 't say anything .

644
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:18,480
I accompanied my mother for surgery

645
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:19,881
What surgery is it ?

646
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:21,480
People flow

647
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Misunderstood

648
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:28,040
Not

649
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:30,520
Then why do you still let me

650
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:31,800
Why did I come ?

651
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:32,921
That is

652
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,760
You let him come every day

653
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,681
It 's your wishful thinking

654
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:39,121
Is it wishful thinking

655
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,361
Isn 't it your love and my wish ?

656
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:42,161
Yes , you look at it

657
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,000
Are there so many dishes ?

658
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,520
You said we were eating and talking

659
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,260
What 's going on

660
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,440
Can 't be solved at the dinner table

661
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,821
Yes No

662
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:50,081
We 've reached this point

663
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,401
What else are we talking about

664
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:52,561
What are you sitting on ? Uncle Uncle

665
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:55,321
Please tell me clearly .

666
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:56,841
What do you mean ?

667
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:58,200
I 'm willing to love her

668
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,000
Or I love her

669
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,641
They all mean the same thing

670
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:00,800
Don 't you understand ?

671
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:02,641
Didn 't I want to tell the details ?

672
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:03,901
It 's the two of us reunited .

673
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:04,681
We 'll both be fine soon

674
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:05,401
Get up

675
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,921
What are you doing ? What are you doing ?

676
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:10,000
Figure it out now

677
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:11,720
It 's me and Wu Limei now

678
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:12,760
Legal husband and wife

679
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:13,760
You 're so blatant

680
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,641
My kidnapper

681
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,240
You 're shameless to poach me

682
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,361
Do you have a moral bottom line

683
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,280
I 'm shameless

684
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:20,321
Love is my morality

685
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:21,280
I have no bottom line

686
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,520
Let me tell you

687
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,081
Li Mei regardless of whether she has children or not

688
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,280
I 'm sure you 're the foot of the wall

689
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,200
I dig it .

690
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,141
I dug Limei

691
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:28,401
Can I dig it today ?

692
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:30,121
I dig when I dig

693
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,121
Repeat

694
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:31,800
I dig it .

695
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,720
Digging , digging , digging

696
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,800
Don 't you like it ?

697
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,581
Dig , dig , dig

698
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:37,280
Stop digging

699
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,780
I will

700
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,960
I 'll tell you

701
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:39,841
I think you are

702
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:41,081
Su Su 's biological father 's share

703
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,601
Give you one last chance

704
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:43,480
Apologize to me

705
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:44,561
Otherwise , my fist

706
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:45,520
It 's not used to it

707
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:46,520
You apologize to Li Mei

708
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,161
You apologize to her and you two

709
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:47,861
You guys no no no

710
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:48,841
You must be sorry for her

711
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:49,720
This opportunity is available

712
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,760
You apologize to her

713
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,321
What does this have to do with Li Mei ?

714
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:52,561
Hit me with your fist

715
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:54,401
Don 't turn on Wu Limei

716
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:55,561
I 'm afraid of you

717
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:56,760
I 'm for her

718
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,240
Born to block a fist

719
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,181
Gu Yunsu

720
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:00,760
Why don 't you stop them ?

721
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,161
I just knew that I was messing around here

722
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:04,121
Let go

723
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
So many pregnant women

724
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,960
If you want to hit , you will hit it

725
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,081
Get Out Out

726
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:08,321
Walk

727
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,520
Come on

728
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,000
Come on

729
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,401
Go

730
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:11,921
Go

731
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:13,760
Where to call

Is this fine ?

736
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,200
Yes

00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:20,881
Come , come , come , come , come , come

738

739
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,000
What 's wrong

740
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,681
How to practice

741
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:23,161
How to practice

742
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,121
Come , come , come , no corpse , no corpse

743
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,540
Don 't move

744
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,561
You can 't slap your face .

745
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:30,601
I have a meeting tomorrow

746
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,881
I 've had surgery here .

747
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,040
Be careful

748
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,841
You can 't afford to fight , you know ?

749
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,280
Then protect your crotch .

750
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,800
I 'm a military boxer

751
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,200
Stretch the crotch and push the elbow

752
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,921
Don 't you stop Gu Yunsu ?

753
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,321
What can be stopped

754
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,361
At their level

755
00:29:48,361 --> 00:29:49,641
Who can beat who ?

756
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:50,720
Enjoy watching

757
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,361
Not touching each other at once

758
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:54,561
Hand pain Hand pain

759
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:55,480
Don 't be spattered with blood .

760
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,280
Don 't you feel too embarrassed

761
00:29:57,861 --> 00:29:58,540
Alright

762
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,960
Nobody knows us anyway

763
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Don 't even laugh .

764
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:04,000
This is a duel of men for dignity

765
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:05,240
Fighting for you

766
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:08,940
For Limei , for true love

767
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,401
I educated him

768
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,681
For Mei Mei , for my family

769
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:14,440
Come

770
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:20,200
Stop fighting

771
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,101
Will you two fight to the end ?

772
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,901
I haven 't stepped on this foot for half a day .

773
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:40,200
I can 't stand it anymore

774
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,901
I can 't stand it anymore

775
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,460

Is it all right ?

972
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,501
This is also clear .

973
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,581
Can 't stay any longer

974
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:41,941
It 's all like that .

975
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,780
When I went through the discharge formalities

976
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,181
He also walked with sunglasses .

977
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,061
You said that at such an old age

978
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:48,181
What are we doing ?

979
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,420
I 'll go back and churn .

980
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,181
No matter what , I can 't rest well .

981
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:56,820
My heart hurts .

982
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,820
Completely enlightened

983
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,161
I said I had to talk to you two .

984
00:37:59,161 --> 00:37:59,860
Nobita

985
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:00,661
Nobita

986
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:01,621
Nobita is not here

987
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,420
Not here . Such a coincidence .

988
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:04,541
It 's not so unfortunate

989
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:06,181
Then let 's talk .

990
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:07,360
What else is there to talk about

991
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:08,941
Just talk for two minutes

992
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,621
Three minutes Five minutes

993
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:11,441
Ten minutes

994
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:12,501
Fifteen minutes at most

995
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:15,360
To

996
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:16,661
Supplements

997
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,541
Nobita

998
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:21,780
You 're not at home , but I came in .

999
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:22,900
Change shoes

1000
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,820
OK

1001
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,661
No need to pour water

1002
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:30,860
In the future , you

1003
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,900
Don 't buy me anything

1004
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:35,900
Not you

1005
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:37,340
Tell me what you need

1006
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,780
I 'll send you

1007
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:40,461
I don 't need you

1008
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:41,581
Do I need to

1009
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:42,121
That 's it

1010
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,780
It has nothing to do with you .

1011
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,900
Don 't get me wrong

1012
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,860
My purpose

1013
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:48,541
The child is still there

1014
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:50,300
I 'm not bullshit , am I

1015
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,220
Your little life

1016
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,441
Having a prosperous life

1017
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:53,981
It 's too late for me to bless

1018
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,141
Even if I had that thought

1019
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:57,860
I have to stop if I don 't give up .

1020
00:38:58,121 --> 00:39:00,181
I just want to be nice to you .

1021
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,101
Pure

1022
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:03,541
Gu Kangqi

1023
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,061
Can we set a rule ?

1024
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:07,501
In the future

1025
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:09,860
Except for birth , old age , illness and death Gu Yunsu

1026
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Between us

1027
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,661
Don 't contact us again

1028
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:14,840
So old

1029
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,021
What other rules do you need ?

1030
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,061
Not

1031
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,101
Life and death are still far away

1032
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:21,380
Let 's stop talking .

1033
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:22,461
My illness

1034
00:39:24,021 --> 00:39:25,181
This is too old

1035
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:26,661
It 's easy to figure things out

1036
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,021
I 'm still thinking about the past

1037
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,041
You said

1038
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,820
Am I an asshole ?

1039
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:32,820
I 'll just ask you

1040
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,340
Am I an asshole ?

1041
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:36,021
Am I still human

1042
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,220
You had a big belly at that time

1043
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,181
Pregnant with Susu

1044
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:41,181
You just need me

1045
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:42,981
How difficult is it for you ?

1046
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,900
If I can 't help you , let 's not tell you .

1047
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:46,181
I still don 't go home every day

1048
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,260
I 'm hanging out .

1049
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,941
Am I Human

1050
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:49,700
I should be like

1051
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,101
Thrown away like garbage

1052
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,661
You should abandon me

1053
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:55,900
I 'm thick - skinned , right ?

1054
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,981
I came to your door again

1055
00:39:57,941 --> 00:39:59,621
I still want to be nice to you

1056
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:00,461
Compensation Compensation

1057
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,700
Is there a chance to think beautifully

1058
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:06,021
I was wrong

1059
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,441
I think

1060
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,101
My mind is small

1061
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,621
Right or wrong lies in my mind

1062
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,820
I always

1063
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,621
I always want to give you what you owed me before

1064
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,860
I think you owe me .

1065
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:17,981
I want to make up for it

1066
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:18,780
You know that

1067
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:19,981
So

1068
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:21,501
But I know now

1069
00:40:22,021 --> 00:40:22,941
This is not appropriate for me to do

1070
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:23,800
It 's not you

1071
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,501
Where did you hear it

1072
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:25,900
I 'm complaining about you .

1073
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,941
I didn 't mean that .

1074
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:29,280
I didn 't want you to say you were wrong

1075
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,141
Where are you wrong

1076
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,380
You 're right

1077
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:32,820
If you have to say that

1078
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,501
That means you have me in your heart

1079
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:38,541
You have me again in your heart

1080
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:39,700
It 's too late

1081
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,661
We are more suitable

1082
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:42,220
Your little life has been like this

1083
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,300
Right

1084
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,320
Nobita

1085
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:48,061
Not your cup of tea

1086
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
When will I say this ?

1087
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,320
I have to tell you .

1088
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,501
You shouldn 't have said that

1089
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,141
My mouth is salty and my mouth is light

1090
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:54,621
I love sour food and spicy food

1091
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:55,541
I know it myself

1092
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:56,661
I know better than you

1093
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:04,141
It 's because you two are not suitable anymore

1094
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:06,061
You two are not just

1095
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:08,860
Isn 't this life ?

1096
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:10,420
I 'm sorry for Nobita

1097
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:12,420
Veteran Cadre Nobita

1098
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,181
Be good

1099
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:14,541
Let me become a celebrity

1100
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,820
He doesn 't want to bring goods or anything .

1101
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,461
Right

1102
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:17,621
Strangely wronged

1103
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:19,181
I 'll go to his unit to find him

1104
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:20,501
Pay him a compensation

1105
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:21,661
One yard is one yard

1106
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,280
This is not a code

1107
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,101
I think this this

1108
00:41:25,101 --> 00:41:26,181
You don 't have to be so particular

1109
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,200
It 's also noon .

1110
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:29,300
Why don 't we have a meal ?

1111
00:41:29,581 --> 00:41:30,220
Jiangnan Station

1112
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,181
Remember again
