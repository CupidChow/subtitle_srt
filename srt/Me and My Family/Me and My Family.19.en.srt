1
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,040
Where are you going ?

2
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:02,880
Leave it alone

3
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:14,880
An Yiming

4
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:16,799
How every time

5
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,839
You 're the one who choked with me .

6
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,079
Why is it you who owes your mouth every time

7
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,839
This is the police station

8
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,600
Fighting is not easy

9
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,339
The place I chose

10
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:26,720
Can I not know

11
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:27,880
Chicken Thief

12
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,519
What are you doing

13
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,959
Weapon just prepared

14
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,079
I wanted to swing you with this .

15
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,799
Weapons

16
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,459
Let me interview you

17
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,079
Who wrote the novel

18
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,919
As for your dead move

19
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,399
Secret Crush

20
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:58,480
Your sister

21
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,440
OK , I understand .

22
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,160
I delete

23
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,320
Over 700 items

24
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,179
All deleted

25
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,280
Delete all

26
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,060
Go over there and delete it

27
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,980
Jingjing , I 'm on fire

28
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,100
I became hot overnight

29
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,000
As soon as I update it

30
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,260
Just a moment

31
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,899
Smashed more than 700 comments

32
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,100
I 'll just say I 'm talented .

33
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,779
Let me just say I was right to change careers

34
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,139
In the future , I 'll take care of you .

35
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,240
I can eat a bite of abalone

36
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,620
You have a crayfish

37
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,800
In fact

38
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,260
I still feel a little inferior

39
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:34,779
I feel that I am inferior to anywhere

40
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,019
Xu Wenbin 's ex - wife

41
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,320
Now I think

42
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:38,820
Xu Wenbin is afraid

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,219
It 's a little higher than me .

44
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:01,860
Jingjing is embarrassed

45
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,979
Happy for nothing

46
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,820
It 's just two netizens talking about each other

47
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,459
One is rubbish

48
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,180
A garbage scolding garbage

49
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,639
Well , it 's okay .

50
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,700
I also have an iron powder

51
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,820
A black powder

52
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:34,300
Jingjing , I may be sick

53
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,740
Otherwise , you 're crazy

54
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,820
I 'm crazy about being red

55
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,120
Li Yan can 't delete it .

56
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,159
Why do you think you can 't think about it ?

57
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,420
I have to pick up your sister

58
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,740
If you change your target

59
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,700
We don 't have to go through this effort

60
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,860
Otherwise , we won 't delete it

61
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,779
I 'll enlighten you , okay

62
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,000
I don 't bubble

63
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,760
I don 't want you here with me

64
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,180
Scolding back and forth

65
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,959
No bubble

66
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,159
You forced me to delete comments here

67
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,959
She hasn 't been very well lately

68
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
I want her to be more confident

69
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,019
Last meeting

70
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,880
Add you

71
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,639
A total of three men chased her at the same time

72
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,719
That person 's temper will burst when he 's a little bad .

73
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,000
This is called lack of confidence

74
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,920
This needs to be confident

75
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,159
You can 't fly up

76
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,639
You 're even more out of reach .

77
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,760
Do you want to delete or not

78
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
If you don 't delete it , I 'll help you

79
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,300
Let me say

80
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,279
If you really want to help her

81
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,519
You go get the first place in your grade

82
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,500
How to say

83
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:37,079
I 'm at the Moral Education Department today

84
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,159
Penalty Standing

85
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,120
I heard from our class teacher

86
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,519
No. 1 in this year 's model

87
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,120
Can be across school

88
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,300
And in front of parents

89
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,920
Public Speaking

90
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,440
When the time comes , you go to that

91
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,719
One stop on the podium

92
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:51,579
You call her over

93
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,159
Look at how handsome you are

94
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,639
Maybe it will fall in a second

95
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,240
Than you comment here

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,320
Much more useful

97
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,839
Okay , okay , then thank you , doctor

98
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:12,839
Dr. Yang

99
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,519
Can I see your face ?

100
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,700
I really want to know

101
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,740
What do you look like

102
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,500
I wonder

103
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,300
Are you better than in the photo

104
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,019
It looks good

105
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Because you 're so nice

106
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,320
You are fine everywhere

107
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,360
You have good eyes and good hands

108
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
You have a nice voice .

109
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,959
You are smart and capable and have a compilation

110
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,740
I don 't believe anyone .

111
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,079
How can there be so many advantages ?

112
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,979
Why these advantages

113
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,519
It seems that it has nothing to do with me .

114
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,839
What are you talking about

115
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,760
I don 't understand it at all

116
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,240
I like your ex - husband

117
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,719
I don 't have enough confidence

118
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
He 'd like a

119
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,360
People like me

120
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:50,839
All of my teeth - baring behavior

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,159
It 's just to cover up

122
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,639
It 's just my guilty conscience

123
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,680
Sorry to disturb you

124
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,440
Do you like Zhou Tianqi

125
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,039
Zhou Tianqi

126
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Zhou Tianqi

127
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:10,360
Dr. Yang

128
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,479
Uncle Li

129
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,279
Susu

130
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,500
Why are you here

131
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,380
Understanding

132
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,019
This is my girl

133
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:30,440
Li Jianxiong has no living expenses

134
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,680
Transfer me some money

135
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,680
Xiaoyan , you 're back

136
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,560
My dad

137
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:39,300
Your father doesn 't know why today

138
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,479
This point is not returned yet

139
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,339
I 'll go to the room first .

140
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,440
OK OK

141
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,180
Breast cancer

142
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,060
Says it 's very likely

143
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,339
There is a high probability that he didn 't run .

144
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,060
What is the probability

145
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:06,020
Already arranged

146
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,739
Puncture biopsy next week

147
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,140
Could it be earlier ?

148
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:10,560
If it 's really cancer

149
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,420
Cannot be dragged

150
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:13,020
Once diagnosed

151
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:14,579
I will be hospitalized

152
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,339
I 'm afraid of being hospitalized

153
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,379
This won 't be able to get out for now

154
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,300
Outside this home

155
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,619
A lot of things to do

156
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,820
I want to handle it last

157
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,060
Just enough for one week

158
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,379
Susu

159
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,060
Good fortune tricks people

160
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,140
You said I

161
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,820
A good man .

162
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,619
This is what happened .

163
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,020
Tell me this

164
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,140
I 'm ashamed too .

165
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,719
Uncle Li

166
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,800
Don 't think about that now

167
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,820
Some are gone

168
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,619
If you get sick , we will treat it

169
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,979
Treat without shame

170
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,979
Treat without panic

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,479
My mother , I Li Yan

172
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,140
Our whole family

173
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,259
We are all with you

174
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:08,839
Susu

175
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:10,379
This disease

176
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:13,859
You need to keep it secret

177
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,160
This large family

178
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,719
No one can stand to be frightened like this

179
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,079
Just wait for the results

180
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,379
Wait another week

181
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,099
The results came out

182
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
It 's fine

183
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,219
It 's okay , it 's okay

184
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:25,520
Xiaoyan

185
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,540
School is a little early today

186
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:29,800
For today 's exam

187
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,759
Really ? Did you do well in the exam

188
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,180
Alright

189
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,820
Let 's eat something then

190
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,520
Play for a while

191
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,999
Then go do your homework

192
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,040
Line

193
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,520
Come

194
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,300
Xiaoyan

195
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,599
Usually your father

196
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,219
How much is your living expenses ?

197
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,800
Aunt Wu can also give it to you first .

198
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,640
It 's okay

199
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,280
When my dad comes back

200
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,180
I just asked him for it

201
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,900
Think of it as giving you pocket money .

202
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,739
In case you have a pair of shoes

203
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:54,640
I want to buy it .

204
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,759
It 's okay , I don 't need it

205
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,680
Xiaoyan

206
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,839
Auntie gossips with you

207
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:03,959
You 're so handsome

208
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,020
In your class

209
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,119
Are there many female students ?

210
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,079
I like you

211
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,239
None

212
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,160
You have your favorite

213
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,900
Little girl

214
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,040
Neither do I .

215
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,479
Aunt is your age .

216
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,479
Pregnant

217
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:18,160
But I 'm a negative example

218
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,040
I mean to say it

219
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,800
That is if there is

220
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,959
The little girl I like

221
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,060
Actually , talk about love

222
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,320
As long as it does not affect your homework

223
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,800
I don 't think it 's a problem

224
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,200
In case of two days

225
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,020
You come across a

226
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,560
The little girl I like

227
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,440
You want to invite her to a movie ?

228
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,839
There 's some money on him

229
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,440
It 's always happy , right ?

230
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:35,800
That

231
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,400
I don 't like little girls

232
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,339
Aunt Wu , you may be mistaken

233
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,619
Crooked

234
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,640
Crooked

235
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,379
I mean

236
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,839
I like it

237
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,540
Older girls

238
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,320
Mature

239
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,759
What a coincidence today

240
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,839
The two came back together

241
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,820
Run into

242
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,479
It 's not like a family doesn 't enter a house .

243
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,359
Where did I meet you ?

244
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,680
At the entrance of the community

245
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:56,540
Where else could it be

246
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,660
That 's what you asked

247
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,920
You 're a little redundant .

248
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,160
Li Jianxiong

249
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
You 're overreacting

250
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,599
Excessive

251
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,079
I 'm okay . I 'm going to change clothes .

252
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,280
Do you have any secrets

253
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,400
I see it

254
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,599
Tell me about it

255
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,280
There is a secret

256
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,359
This

257
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:38,839
It was before we got married

258
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,959
Some money I saved

259
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:46,079
I wanted Li Yan to get married .

260
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,219
or something urgent at home

261
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,020
Top

262
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,079
The password is written inside

263
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,320
I 'll leave it to you

264
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,259
You take this out now

265
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:55,160
What are you doing ?

266
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,599
It 's twenty-three weeks today .

267
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,560
No movement yet

268
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,959
You 're afraid

269
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,839
Somewhat

270
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:12,680
Check every two weeks

271
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,180
Every time we

272
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,719
Passed the test smoothly

273
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,900
What are you afraid of

274
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,700
The older you are , the less courageous you are

275
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:27,520
You are so strange , Li Jianxiong

276
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,999
When will I eat ?

277
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,959
Hungry

278
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,959
What are you doing

279
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,379
Not

280
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,660
Dad just remembered

281
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,759
It 's been a long time since I hugged you

282
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,359
Stronger

283
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,800
Isn 't Dad a long time ?

284
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:07,879
I didn 't tell you

285
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,719
Dad

286
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,900
Dad

287
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:15,820
Love Love

288
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,140
Love You

289
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:26,780
I

290
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,440
I

291
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,920
You said son

292
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:37,739
If you burn your mouth in the future

293
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,040
You don 't need to say it

294
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,579
That

295
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,400
After this earphone

296
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,359
Turning down the volume will hurt your ears

297
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,039
What 's wrong with your Uncle Li

298
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,160
It 's okay

299
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,900
You must know

300
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:23,959
Tell me

301
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,319
I think it 's because of the recent

302
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,200
The season has changed

303
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:32,759
It makes people a little bit

304
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,400
Sad spring and sad autumn

305
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,640
I 've been recently

306
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:39,019
This

307
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,259
Eat more of this too

308
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,539
Eat more

309
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,059
These dishes

310
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,580
They are all my specialties

311
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,100
Mei Mei , how much do you like this ?

312
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,900
I 've pinched I 've pinched

313
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,440
You you you

314
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,019
Eat more , eat more , eat more

315
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,900
Susu , you love eggs

316
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,680
You are this .

317
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,959
Uncle , I 'll do it myself .

318
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:57,940
Thank you , Uncle . Come more often .

319
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,700
Li Jianxiong , you have so little time

320
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,140
You cook so many dishes

321
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,140
Can we finish eating

322
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,059
Is this necessary

323
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,219
He said he was hungry

324
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,499
Grow your body

325
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,900
He he he eats a lot

326
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,420
Come

327
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,299
Don 't you love this meat ?

328
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:08,979
You eat more

329
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:10,400
Come

330
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,860
You won 't eat it

331
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Let me take a moment

332
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:19,979
Dad likes to watch you eat and eat

333
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:31,660
Is there something wrong with you ?

334
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,140
Can you say something ?

335
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,019
You 're so scary

336
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,860
I

337
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:39,819
I 'm fine .

338
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:41,259
What can I do ?

339
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,380
You guys

340
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,100
So many dishes

341
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,340
So many dishes last time

342
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,299
still announcing

343
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,580
The day Aunt Wu was pregnant

344
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,380
Last time it was announced

345
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,140
The time you wanted to marry me

346
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,860
You 're definitely fine

347
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:55,400
This paranoid

348
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,799
Hello , you 're going to be Sherlock Holmes

349
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,999
You 're out there with this smell

350
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:00,380
You can 't eat it .

351
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,940
Only available at home

352
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,700
This is the taste of home

353
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:06,620
It 's also my taste

354
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:07,420
I hope

355
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,880
What do you think of these flavors ?

356
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,700
Remember

357
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:11,259
There is a saying called

358
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:12,999
Preserving Memory

359
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,719
The best and longest way

360
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,499
Is the sense of smell

361
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:18,979
This is called taste

362
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,940
This smell of oil smoke on you

363
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,100
It 's called sense of smell

364
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,860
You

365
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,739
I haven 't bathed for days

366
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,160
Your father showers every day

367
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,219
I can guarantee that

368
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:28,519
What does this smell like ?

369
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,680
Where do I

370
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,860
Where is there ?

371
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,979
That 's cooking every day

372
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:32,880
Over time

373
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,420
This is marinated

374
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,380
Have a meal

375
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,539
Why do we talk for so many days

376
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,100
The dishes that Uncle Li worked so hard to cook

377
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,019
It 's cold for a while

378
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:41,979
It 's not delicious

379
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,819
It 's delicious to feel the taste

380
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,259
I was full and I went inside

381
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:46,059
Sit down

382
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,499
It was you who called hungry just now , right ?

383
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,100
Eat quickly and don 't waste it

384
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,259
This dish is finished .

385
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,660
You 're also eating

386
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,420
I asked you to come this time

387
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,420
Actually , I want to .

388
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,979
Put our previous policy

389
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:26,660
Make a change

390
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,739
What is the change about

391
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,759
I want to add

392
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,779
Insurance Beneficiary

393
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,979
That 's fine

394
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,819
Mr. Li , are you all right ?

395
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,299
I 'm fine

396
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,259
That 's fine that 's fine

397
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:39,459
That 's true after all

398
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,660
You 're getting older .

399
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Family again

400
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,519
So I hope

401
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,620
Have a guarantee for your family

402
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,299
Be steady

403
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,019
I remember your beneficiaries

404
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:47,999
Before

405
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:49,739
Li Yan , right ?

406
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:50,700
To my son

407
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,459
Who are we going to add now ?

408
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:54,700
Wu Limei

409
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,539
Wu Limei

410
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,759
My lover I remarried

411
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,120
I want to add another

412
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,660
Gu Yunsu

413
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,059
Uncle Li , I 'm sorry

414
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:10,380
Late

415
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:12,219
Where is it , where is it

416
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:12,920
Sit down quickly

417
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,620
What is this today

418
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,160
This is a temporary invitation

419
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,620
You are so busy

420
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,700
I can appreciate it

421
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,420
I 'm honored .

422
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,140
Lai Xiao Xu

423
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,100
You accept this

424
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,940
Uncle Li , what are you doing ?

425
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,140
Why did you give me a gift ?

426
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,700
No , this is for your dad .

427
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,459
Hold it , hold it

428
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,340
Sit here

429
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:29,739
This

430
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:31,580
It 's been a long time since I saw your father .

431
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,200
What 's wrong

432
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,499
You can just tell me .

433
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:35,940
Still mobilizing people

434
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,039
Li Yan

435
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,559
What are you looking at ?

436
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,420
What is it ?

437
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,620
I have an exam in the afternoon

438
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,019
That brain of yours

439
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,340
It doesn 't matter if you miss one or two exams .

440
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,759
Have a meal with your dad and sit down

441
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,180
Xiao Xu

442
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,779
You move your chopsticks

443
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:01,700
Uncle Li , what are you looking for from me ?

444
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,059
What 's wrong ?

445
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,420
This is this

446
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,360
It 's been so long , right ?

447
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,059
Have a light meal with you

448
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:09,700
This is not a casual meal , Uncle Li

449
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,459
Tell me if you have anything to do

450
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,340
Hao Xiao Xu, you,

451
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,080
Uncle Li and I

452
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
There was indeed one today

453
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,019
Unkind request

454
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,279
You see this is not

455
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,819
Did you call Li Yan ?

456
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:23,979
Uncle Li actually wanted to

457
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,459
Entrust Li Yan to You

458
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,559
Li Yan told me before

459
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,700
He wants to go to medical school

460
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,900
It should be influenced by you

461
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,440
What about our family

462
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,700
No one studying medicine

463
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,299
What about Xiao Xu ?

464
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,799
Possible in the future

465
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,360
This is my brother - in - law ?

466
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:43,860
I 'll leave Susu to you

467
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:44,920
I 'm relieved

468
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:45,900
Then you

469
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,059
Li Yan 's eldest brother ?

470
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,299
Then do you treat him

471
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,059
Future studies will be good .

472
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:51,100
Work is good

473
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,900
Including the path of life .

474
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,420
You should help him more .

475
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,860
Help him look after him

476
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:56,940
My eldest brother is my father

477
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:57,959
Come

478
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,719
This eldest brother is like a father

479
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:02,459
Then we have to wait until my father leaves .

480
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,920
Then I want to walk

481
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,739
The one in front of you

482
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:05,499
I don 't need it

483
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:06,059
You need

484
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,059
I don 't need it

485
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:08,900
Just think I need it

486
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,219
You need

487
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:10,140
My sister doesn 't need him either

488
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,959
About your sister

489
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:11,640
Why are you so wide ?

490
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,299
Of course I have to take care of my sister 's business

491
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,459
He was divorced

492
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,420
So what ?

493
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:19,819
Who divorces a serious man

494
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,299
Then I divorced your father .

495
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,420
You 're different .

496
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,620
You 're remarried

497
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,959
That means

498
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,940
People who have been divorced and have not remarried

499
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,799
There is a problem

500
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,380
Yes

501
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,559
For example

502
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,580
Gu Kangqi

503
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,499
This makes sense

504
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,180
Dad , let me tell you .

505
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,259
This marriage is a man 's spectrum

506
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:41,519
Divorce is outrageous

507
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,779
Dr. Yang

508
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,160
Why are you here again

509
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,380
Is it convenient for you to talk

510
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,420
What 's my ex - husband 's business

511
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,499
It 's still about your uncle

512
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,380
About Uncle Li

513
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:02,459
Tell me

514
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,219
Thank you .

515
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,479
I just wanted to ask

516
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:06,819
Uncle Li 's physical condition

517
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:07,920
What happened ?

518
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,160
If confirmed later

519
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,700
Which treatment method

520
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,559
More suitable for him

521
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,440
We are family

522
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,559
What should I pay attention to

523
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,180
I want to ask a little more

524
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,680
I wrote a piece of paper

525
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,680
You can take a look

526
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,039
It happens that I have something to do .

527
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,360
I 'd like to know about it

528
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,819
Your family 's financial situation

529
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,559
How about

530
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:28,400
Selling iron in a pot

531
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,039
Heavily in debt

532
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,559
We can 't give up on Uncle Li

533
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,019
Where 's your uncle

534
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:34,180
I came early this morning

535
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,380
But for my condition

536
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,400
Not a word

537
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,160
He asked me to help him bring his future child

538
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,019
and his son

539
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,180
About breast

540
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,059
Inspection time and inspection item

541
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,400
Sorted it all out

542
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
I 'm worried

543
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,840
For financial reasons

544
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,440
Don 't want to cooperate with intervention treatment

545
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,200
Because of his current actions

546
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,039
It 's more like arranging the funeral

547
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,200
Dr. Yang

548
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,299
I haven 't encountered it either

549
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,200
This situation

550
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,200
You are a doctor

551
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,600
You should see a lot of them

552
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,620
Then encounter this

553
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,880
If you want to give up treatment

554
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,640
We as family

555
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,479
What should we do ?

556
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,680
What should we do

557
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,880
Do you have any suggestions

558
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,239
Otherwise

559
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,160
I have something to deal with right now

560
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,840
Wait for me in the canteen at noon

561
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:13,640
OK

562
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:22,459
Everyone

563
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:24,979
Due to my

564
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:26,360
Some personal reasons

565
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,160
I need a vacation for a while

566
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,120
The leader has approved it

567
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,680
It 's a little sudden .

568
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,979
What about my work

569
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,860
You may need to help with your hard work

570
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,680
Coordinate and undertake on your behalf

571
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:41,719
Sorry for troubling everyone

572
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,380
It 's all okay , Brother Li

573
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,200
For small things

574
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,479
It 's easy to go early and come back early .

575
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,920
You wouldn 't be with

576
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,080
Our sister - in - law is together

577
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,440
Go take maternity leave

578
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,360
Possible

579
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,400
What about your salary

580
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,880
I have to share it with everyone .

581
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,019
Yeah

582
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,559
Rest assured , everyone

583
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,440
The leader will quickly deploy manpower

584
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,640
Top my job gap

585
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,499
Won 't let everyone

586
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:01,920
Working hard for too long

587
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,400
Wang Dachu

588
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,959
Li Feng

589
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:15,519
Mingming

590
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:17,719
Sun Zhen

591
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,319
Zhou Shen

592
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,799
Everyone

593
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,840
One game with colleagues

594
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,759
I am very honored

595
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,700
You , you , Brother Li , you

596
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,200

597
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,920
What are you doing ?

598
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,160
Brother Li , what happened to you

599
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,959
Did something happen

600
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:43,039
How

601
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,559
It seems like I can 't come back .

602
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,600
Brother Li , where are you going ?

603
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,640
Not Brother Li

604
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,819
What do you want ?

605
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:50,319
Squeak for the big guy .

606
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,140
Yes , what happened ?

607
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,600
You tell us

608
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,039
Chief

609
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,840
Li Ge Li Ge Li Ge

610
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,440
Chief

611
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,640
What 's going on ?

612
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,860
Hello , senior leaders

613
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:25,840
I am Li Jianxiong who has been transferred to the job

614
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:57,519
Thank you , Dr. Yang

615
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,380
I 've remembered all these points .

616
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,660
I 'm really sorry .

617
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,019
It 's delaying your meal time

618
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:03,059
You can go eat first

619
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:03,860
It 's fine

620
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:04,880
The most important

621
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,340
To keep your uncle in a good state of mind

622
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,420
Actively

623
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:08,860
OK

624
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,660
Dr. Yang

625
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:15,660
And that

626
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,779
What 's wrong ?

627
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,140
If there is a person

628
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,620
Seriously ill

629
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,140
I want to give up treatment now

630
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,940
You as a doctor

631
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,700
Any good suggestions

632
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:37,979
What 's wrong with you

633
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,259
Not me

634
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,840
It doesn 't matter who it is

635
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,239
I just want to ask you

636
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,840
You as a doctor

637
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,039
Encountered this

638
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,140
What should I do

639
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,120
That can arouse his desire to survive .

640
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:51,840
Is it Uncle Li

641
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,080
How do you know ?

642
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,299
What do I say

643
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:55,840
Two days ago

644
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,979
Got me a meal

645
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:58,819
Eat the clouds and mountains of mist

646
00:29:58,819 --> 00:29:59,979
inexplicable

647
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,940
He must be because of me

648
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,719
I have no income at this time

649
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,039
We have to eat and drink at home

650
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:06,200
All the burdens at home

651
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,660
It 's all on him .

652
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,539
That 's why I wanted to give up treatment

653
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:11,680
I think now

654
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,940
What Uncle Li is most worried about

655
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,360
It 's Aunt Wu

656
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,100
And his unborn child

657
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:17,940
He may be worried

658
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,039
If he treats himself

659
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,319
After spending all the money

660
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,120
Where is their future

661
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Where is their protection ?

662
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,200
I can return to work .

663
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,120
I can make money .

664
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,559
Possible

665
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,959
Not at this stage

666
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:30,819
What I want to do most

667
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:32,539
But I can do it well

668
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:34,299
Li Yan has grown up in two years .

669
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,719
He can be on his own .

670
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:37,519
What 's so scary ?

671
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:38,559
So

672
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:40,400
You 're not his burden

673
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,819
You are his greatest comfort

674
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,979
And if you need it

675
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,200
I will try my best

676
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:52,920
Thank you

677
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,360
Aunt Wu 's 4D color ultrasound

678
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,880
Can it be arranged in advance

679
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:06,360
Four - dimensional color Doppler Doppler > can

680
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,400
When is the fastest

681
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,920
I 'll make arrangements tomorrow

682
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,239
OK , I 'll let them know .

683
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,499
When you have specific time , I will send you WeChat

684
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,539
OK OK

685
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,799
You know her

686
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,319
I really like her

687
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,840
But you 're out of chance

688
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,420
Why

689
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,819
She likes Zhou Tianqi

690
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,920
Who is Zhou Tianqi ?

691
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,200
It 's my ex - husband .

692
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,799
She likes your ex .

693
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:47,600
That 's right

694
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
You don 't know

695
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:52,120
She specially brought her family with her

696
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,400
Come to see me for an examination

697
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,299
I want to use the name of inspection

698
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:56,200
Come see me

699
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,319
Explore my bottom

700
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,400
Anyway , I think she 's very affectionate .

701
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:01,959
I 'm a little touched

702
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,559
But this girl

703
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,080
I think everything is fine

704
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,600
I just don 't have a good eye

705
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,259
What does Zhou Tianqi like ?

706
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,400
Too bad

707
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:17,880
What are you happy about

708
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,539
It 's fine

709
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,799
That

710
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,640
Why do you order vegetarian food ?

711
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,680
Let me add a meat dish for you

712
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,039
Why are you so nice to me suddenly

713
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,559
You have a good name

714
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,739
I 'll give you some yogurt .

715
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,200
Actually , Aunt Wu

716
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,299
The indicator is normal

717
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,660
Let Director Wu check it .

718
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,019
Then feel at ease

719
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:42,700
OK

720
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,100
Feel at ease , feel at ease

721
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,499
What about the future ?

722
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,940
Our family is old and young

723
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,819
Then please ask Dr. Xiao Xu

724
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:51,499
Dr. Xu is very careful

725
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,580
Uncle Li

726
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,700
What did you say

727
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,539
This I

728
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,600
I know what Uncle Li said

729
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,620
Talking a little too much

730
00:32:58,739 --> 00:32:59,680
But not now

731
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,979
I just want to be practical

732
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,620
Dr. Xiao Xu

733
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:03,700
He is menopausal now

734
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,580
Ignore him

735
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,779
Don 't mind .

736
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,219
Don 't worry

737
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,380
Everything is fine

738
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,219
Thank you , Doctor

739
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:10,979
Director Wu

740
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:13,120
This is Wu Limei

741
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,259
Hello Hello

742
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,779
Come here

743
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:15,440
Thank you for your hard work

744
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,580
You 're welcome .

745
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,380
Thank you , thank you .

746
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:20,819
It is best to enter one family member

747
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:21,499
Sorry

748
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,600
Uncle Polaroid is inside

749
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,140
OK , please ask if you can

750
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,299
I can 't see it at all

751
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,259
Let 's take a look first

752
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,080
Baby 's facial condition

753
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,400
Full forehead

754
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,279
Two ears are exposed

755
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,299
The contour of both left and right ears is normal

756
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,440
Let 's look at the nose first

757
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,880
This nose bridge is quite high

758
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,319
It 's a beautiful baby

759
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,080
Take a look at the mouth again

760
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,899
Both eyeballs are normal .

761
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,140
Like my mother 's big eyes in the future

762
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:44,759
Like Mom

763
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,299
The baby will grow

764
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,580
Eyes Like Mom

765
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,180
Would you like to take a picture of Dad

766
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,040
Commemorate

767
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,580
This is the baby 's life .

768
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,399
First HD color photo

769
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,200
Yes Yes Yes

770
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,239
Susu

771
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,879
Su Su told me to

772
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,200
Bring her this Polaroid

773
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,600
Yes , yes , yes , yes

774
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,620
Come , come , come , come

775
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:20,540
Take a picture

776
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,140
One Two

777
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:11,160
I heard from Dr. Yang

778
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,620
Do you like Zhou Tianqi

779
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,779
I put Dr. Yang

780
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,419
Misunderstood for your ex - wife

781
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:29,379
Why would you

782
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,919
My friend 's ex - wife is so interested

783
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:42,620
That 's right

784
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:44,319
What did I do to my friend 's ex - wife

785
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:45,700
So what about interest ?

786
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,580
Why

787
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:10,560
How 's it over ?

788
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:12,080
None

789
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:14,960
The director said this baby

790
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,839
He kept one fist clenched .

791
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,520
He wouldn 't let go

792
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,899
Asked me to come out for a stroll

793
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:21,680
Possible change of posture

794
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,120
His finger spread out

795
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,620
Pat it out

796
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,799
This is human

797
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,919
I 'm human .

798
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:32,399
Yes Yes Yes

799
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:33,339
He He is a human being

800
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,799
Uncle Li

801
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:37,419
This is the first time .

802
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:39,100
I officially met him .

803
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,520
How does it feel

804
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:45,919
Don 't be so excited

805
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,259
Li Jianxiong

806
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,500
Uncle is excited

807
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:50,460
Uncle , give him a name .

808
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,480
Not this

809
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:54,719
It 's not good to be so anxious

810
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,960
Go home and think slowly

811
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,640
OK OK OK

812
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,739
I think . Think about it slowly

813
00:37:58,799 --> 00:37:59,839
First meeting

814
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,160
Take advantage of this heat

815
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Give a name

816
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,319
With a name , there is a concern

817
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,279
Many things are reluctant to part with

818
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,640
Then let 's go for a walk

819
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
Let 's think about the name when we 're done

820
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:18,239
All right

821
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:19,219
Let 's go for a walk .

822
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:19,960
Think of names

823
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,500
Thank you , Dr. Xu .

824
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:28,460
How about

825
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,239
This little hand is still holding .

826
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:32,719
Still not letting go

827
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:33,520
What should I do ?

828
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,600
We have to walk again .

829
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,219
No hurry

830
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:37,379
I thought about it carefully

831
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:38,680
The name of the child

832
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,419
What is it called

833
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,799
I named Li Yan before

834
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,759
Li Yan

835
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,080
I hope he can speak well .

836
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:47,819
Unexpectedly

837
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:50,120
He 's quiet now

838
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,040
Name a child

839
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
Often reversed

840
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,359
Let 's talk about us Susu

841
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,319
When I was born , I often thought

842
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,000
I hope she 's gentle

843
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,899
Be emotional

844
00:38:57,899 --> 00:38:58,919
The result is born

845
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,120
Whole reverse

846
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:02,319
Sometimes what do you think

847
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:03,759
There 's nothing for her , you know ?

848
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,239
Therefore , we learn from the pain

849
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,859
I 'm going to fight fire with fire

850
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:08,879
That 's why Lee

851
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:09,439
Li

852
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,480
Widow

853
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,540
Just

854
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,040
Can we take a walk again ?

855
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:24,919
We are not in a hurry

856
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:25,879
There 's no hurry at all

857
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,100
Uncle Li , let 's think again

858
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,160
Yes , yes , thinking while walking

859
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,239
Let 's think again

860
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,160
Don 't worry Don 't worry

861
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:31,080
Li Li Wugang

862
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,759
It really doesn 't work

863
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:32,600
Definitely not

864
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,640
How unpleasant

865
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,839
What do you want ?

866
00:39:38,819 --> 00:39:40,259
Li Mo Hard

867
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,040
Think again , think again

868
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:47,279
Think again , think again

869
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:53,439
Li Jingjian

870
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,160
Uncle

871
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:58,799
Otherwise

872
00:39:58,899 --> 00:39:59,799
I think the name thing

873
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:00,799
We still can 't rush

874
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,359
Let 's look through the dictionary when we go home

875
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:04,180
Do you want to

876
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,819
Try talking to him .

877
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,080
Scared him

878
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,279
Maybe he was afraid

879
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:09,680
His hand reached out

880
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,279
You can

881
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:11,600
Put these names you just named

882
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,480
Tell him about it

883
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,080
Or tell a ghost story

884
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,040
When he was nervous

885
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,540
He might have reached out .

886
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,100
Go

887
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:19,560
Let 's find a place with few people

888
00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:20,680
Let 's try it .

889
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,419
Yes Yes Yes

890
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,620
He can hear it now

891
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,719
There 's no one here

892
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:29,439
Line fits

893
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,480
Suitable for telling ghost stories

894
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,580
OK

895
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,759
Is it ok

896
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,520
Line

897
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:40,540
Don 't listen

898
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,580
Why

899
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:43,200
What can I do to scare you ?

900
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:44,299
It 's incredible

901
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,700
OK , OK , I won 't listen .

902
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,939
I 'm very scary

903
00:40:53,279 --> 00:40:53,819
Baby

904
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,060
The doctor said

905
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:02,299
Dad 's tumor is not very optimistic

906
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:06,779
The biggest worry is

907
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:08,160
Spend all the money

908
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:10,339
But the disease has not been cured yet

909
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,839
Then you and mom

910
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,040
And your brother and sister

911
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,120
There is no decline

912
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,640
But today

913
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,480
After seeing you

914
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:24,259
Dad changed his mind

915
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,219
I really can 't bear to leave

916
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,000
I want to see you grow up .

917
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,299
I want to spend it with your mother

918
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,600
Those good days that are not over yet

919
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:45,219
Want to watch your brother work

920
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:45,960
Promise

921
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,580
I still want to see your sister

922
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,180
Make the script she wrote for TV

923
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,819
Think about it

924
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,620
Dad 's life is really good .

925
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,700
There are so many reluctances

926
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,839
Where is anyone else 's home ?

927
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,339
In case dad

928
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,899
Baby

929
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:25,060
Daddy loves you

930
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,060
Give him a bluff .

931
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,140
I 've finished scaring

932
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,779
Look at how dishonest he is

933
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,299
Li Jianxiong

934
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:33,899
Let 's go

935
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,020
Go
