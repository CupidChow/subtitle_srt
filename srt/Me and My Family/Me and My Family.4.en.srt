1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,480
Take it and soak it first

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,641
OK

3
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:19,520
OK

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,161
OK

5
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:21,800
Susu

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,261
Why did you come by yourself

7
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:25,641
Come on , come on , come in quickly

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,601
Why did you come by yourself ?

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,020
I had a quarrel with my mom

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,641
We quarreled

11
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:35,880
We quarreled

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,200
She let you do it yourself .

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,681
Why is this a mom ?

14
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:42,220
Daughter

15
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:44,620
Don 't be mad at your mother

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,961
Your mother isn 't really like that .

17
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:49,440
She 's a knife - mouth and a tofu - heart

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,400
Don 't be the same as her .

19
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:52,921
How smart and obedient you are

20
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:53,521
Yes No

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,720
Talk to Dad

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,860
Your mother never told me .

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,321
Where you and your mom live

24
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:00,900
How about

25
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:03,321
It 's fun

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
It 's fun

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,360
How about comparing it to home ?

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,400
Different

29
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:12,400
Let 's go back anyway

30
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:13,941
If you 're angry with your mother

31
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:14,980
You just go home

32
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,721
Daddy Friend

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,540
Xiao Cai

34
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:26,280
Susu , my daughter

35
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:28,120
Susuhao

36
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:30,120
What

37
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,861
Cook something for Susu

38
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,700
Rest assured

39
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,241
Susu

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,840
Dad has to go to the company

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,340
A few uncles

42
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,540
Waiting for my father 's meeting

43
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,321
When Dad is done , he will come back to accompany you .

44
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:40,140
Is it good ?

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,601
You stay at home .

46
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:47,521
Take care of it .

47
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:48,181
Rest assured

48
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,681
Then Dad is gone .

49
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,780
Bye bye

50
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,441
You come back early

51
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,961
Hello Auntie

52
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:06,120
Susuhao

53
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:07,721
Auntie will peel you an orange

54
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:08,340
Is it good ?

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,480
No , thank you , auntie

56
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,000
That aunt will pour you a glass of water

57
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,441
OK , thank you

58
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:16,241
It 's fine

59
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:18,440
Aunt

60
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:19,961
My father

61
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:21,521
When will I come back ?

62
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,361
Probably until midnight

63
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,981
Lysusu

64
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:27,720
I

65
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,361
Can you sleep in the old room

66
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:31,521
Which house used to be

67
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:33,600
Where should I sleep ?

68
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,081
Susu

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,961
Are you going to live here ?

70
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,120
But this is not your home .

71
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,600
I mean

72
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:45,560
If Susu goes back too late

73
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:47,320
Mom will be worried , isn 't it ?

74
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,761
But this is not your home either .

75
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:50,361
Isn 't your mother worried about you ?

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,921
Auntie has been here for a long time

77
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:54,880
I 'm sure I 've outdone you

78
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,961
I 've lived for ten years

79
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:56,801
And

80
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,521
What is your relationship with my father ?

81
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,320
Where 's Aunt

82
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,041
Is your father 's girlfriend

83
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:05,880
You may also be your stepmother in the future

84
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,060
Stepmother I have a real mother

85
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:08,940
Farewell

86
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,380
My good girl is back

87
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,940
How about

88
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,460
I forgot everything

89
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,861
Dad personally adjusted it for you .

90
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,580
Happiness

91
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,260
Whole

92
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,221
Comfortable

93
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,140
My own daughter told me

94
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:03,060
Had a hard time

95
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,241
You said this was a father

96
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,460
You can 't do anything .

97
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:07,060
You can do this every day

98
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:09,500
Dad , this is your starting point

99
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,020
Pull me a little too high

100
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:12,101
Do you regret it

101
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:13,140
Here here

102
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,140
Today

103
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,940
Why do you need such a big circle ?

104
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,241
Days to come

105
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:19,661
It 's so luxurious

106
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:21,981
Compare with your mother .

107
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:22,981
My mother has been recently

108
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:24,140
I have no time to compete with you

109
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:26,361
She and your Uncle Nobita

110
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,421
There is a relationship problem

111
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:28,620
That 's not true

112
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,301
They are excited .

113
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:31,981
That 's called a conjoined baby

114
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:33,401
Then why are you telling me this ?

115
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,060
Here

116
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,041
Me

117
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,000
I 'm happy for your mother from the bottom of my heart

118
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,460
You 're so old .

119
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:39,981
The old tree is blooming

120
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,901
Old trees not only bloom

121
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:43,301
The old tree is bearing fruit

122
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:44,700
What does it mean

123
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,181
Pregnant

124
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,221
What are you pregnant with

125
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,140
If you are pregnant , you are pregnant

126
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,260
The couple are pregnant

127
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,101
Literal

128
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,940
Pregnant

129
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,421
Pregnant

130
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,721
How old is your mother

131
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,620
Forty-eight , right ?

132
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,661
Forty-eight is pregnant

133
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:16,341
This is inappropriate .

134
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,241
This is inappropriate .

135
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,580
Are you kidding ?

136
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,020
Not

137
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,320
What 's wrong with this

138
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,460
Is she pregnant ?

139
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,020
This has nothing to do with you .

140
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:25,020
I 'd rather

141
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,380
Of course it has nothing to do with me .

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,301
It wasn 't forced by Nobita , right ?

143
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,181
Can Nobita be forced

144
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,020
This is not a matter between you and me .

145
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,781
Nothing to do with me

146
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:36,341
What do you think of this ?

147
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,901
Isn 't this a joke ?

148
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:39,221
Don 't people gossip

149
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,320
What do you think of this ?

150
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,161
What do you think ?

151
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,000
This little thing at home

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,861
How can it be raised outside ?

153
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,580
It 's not that there are too many families .

154
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,781
That one by one

155
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,700
Can that be managed ?

156
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,120
You don 't care what people think of it

157
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:50,620
People don 't look at it much .

158
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,301
You 're here

159
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:52,580
Talk a lot about it

160
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:53,921
Talk endlessly

161
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:56,460
Are you missing me ?

162
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,421
I miss you . You 're in this place

163
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:00,020
You are the center of this home

164
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,101
You 're a baby

165
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,341
Have you ever seen a thirty - year - old baby

166
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:04,460
I 'm almost thirty , Dad

167
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,981
I can 't be anyone 's baby anymore

168
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:07,661
No , why are you so stupid

169
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,880
Waiting for Really Small

170
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,060
Another child

171
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,820
Take a look again

172
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:11,901
What is your situation

173
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:13,380
Who still takes you seriously

174
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,421
How can there be such a thing ?

175
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:15,421
What the hell is this ?

176
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Has anyone done this

177
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,880
That 's selfish .

178
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,861
Right , no matter what others feel

179
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:20,801
Your mother is like this

180
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,661
Not slipping away

181
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,380
You 're not kidding .

182
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,981
I told you about your mother 's brain

183
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:26,520
Really

184
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,861
Dad

185
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,000
Push harder , push harder

186
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:29,760
Not

187
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,380
What does it mean to be a mother ?

188
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Wu Limei is such a mother

189
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,880
What are you dissatisfied with ?

190
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:36,880
Am I not satisfied ?

191
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:38,721
I 'm not satisfied

192
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:39,361
You 're not dissatisfied

193
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:40,120
Why are you eating one at a time

194
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,161
How to be a mother How to be a mother

195
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,421
He liked to tell me since he was a child

196
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:42,981
How does she become a mother

197
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:43,721
How to be a mother

198
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:45,281
Why do you always complain about her ?

199
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,221
I want to complain

200
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:47,421
I 'm also blaming you here

201
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:48,380
Okay , okay , let 's not talk about this .

202
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,221
Do I need you to complain , Dad

203
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,260
It 's true that I always complain about her

204
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,940
But because she does so much

205
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:54,421
These years

206
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:55,781
She gave a lot for me

207
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,981
The more you do , the more wrong

208
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:58,500
Nothing is wrong if you don 't do it

209
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,940
So I 'll blame her again

210
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,120
She 's also my real mother , okay ?

211
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,601
Row Row Row

212
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:02,681
I won 't say anything , okay

213
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:03,500
Is it ok

214
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:04,760
Yes

215
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,640
Let you feel now

216
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,500
A good life .

217
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,101
Come on , let 's not talk about that .

218
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:08,861
Don 't talk about it .

219
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,520
You say this is so annoying

220
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,460
Really

221
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,500
Come , come , come , come , come .

222
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,981
Okay , let 's stop talking .

223
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:17,460
That 's all , right ?

224
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:22,380
People have many things to do

225
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,921
Right

226
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,500
You have to take the road in this life

227
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,940
You can 't take a narrow path

228
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,080
Forty-eight , you said

229
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,041
Still walking this dead end , you say

230
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,341
I I I I don 't

231
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,741
Stop here today , okay ?

232
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:36,301
It 's not me

233
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,421
Please come back first , okay ?

234
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:38,841
I was talking to my dad

235
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:39,380
Here here

236
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,521
I 'm afraid of what I 'll say next

237
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,141
It will sound bad

238
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:42,181
Makes you lose face

239
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,460
I can 't make you unhappy either

240
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,860
Right

241
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,781
You say you say

242
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,060
What can I do by saying a few words ?

243
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,980
Come , come , come , come

244
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,360
Listen to everyone , listen to everyone

245
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,320
Listen to our family 's dirty laundry

246
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,661
I won 't talk about anything else either

247
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:56,580
Let 's talk about how she became a mother

248
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,560
How did you become a father

249
00:08:59,141 --> 00:08:59,781
All right

250
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:00,921
Why

251
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:01,860
It 's like this

252
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
You don 't know

253
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:04,621
You really don 't have a little

254
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,021
Family Responsibility

255
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,421
We have come to this day

256
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,580
Really because of you

257
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,820
My mom is at home

258
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,940
Laundry , cooking and taking care of children

259
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,381
Wait on me , wait on you

260
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:13,980
What about you

261
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,921
Swallowing outside

262
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,860
This sister today

263
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,781
That sister tomorrow

264
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,100
After leaving you

265
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,761
Why are we both

266
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:20,901
It 's so miserable

267
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:22,340
You have some money , right ?

268
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,901
Right

269
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:23,940
Why do you keep dragging ?

270
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,421
That alimony will not be given to her

271
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,381
Where do we live

272
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:28,100
Did you know

273
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,820
No fan

274
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,580
No air conditioning

275
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,200
Cold in winter and hot in summer

276
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,141
My mom took me in a cold shower

277
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:33,060
Did you know

278
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,860
She works three jobs a day

279
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:35,641
You know when my mom

280
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,580
How tired are you ?

281
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,261
Malnutrition

282
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:37,781
Fainting

283
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:39,141
Even if she had an egg

284
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,541
My mother can 't bear to eat it by herself .

285
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,580
She will always be

286
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,560
In my bowl

287
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,261
Let me eat

288
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,320
At that time

289
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,340
That 's how we got here

290
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:46,580
This is my mom

291
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,141
Your mother will always be

292
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:49,301
Your father is never right

293
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:50,700
You 're gonna say that , right ?

294
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:51,921
I know

295
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:53,360
This is what your mother told you .

296
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:55,940
You were young then

297
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,940
You know nothing

298
00:09:59,041 --> 00:09:59,960
Since you 're here

299
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,041
I 'll tell you about it

300
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:01,980
Let 's sort this out

301
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,681
Your mother insists on leaving you with me

302
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,121
Your mother abandoned me

303
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,681
I can 't stop it .

304
00:10:08,661 --> 00:10:10,001
I 'm still here

305
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:11,580
I haven 't changed

306
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:14,240
I didn 't do anything sorry to your mother

307
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,781
I didn 't cheat

308
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,560
The money I earned outside by then

309
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,261
I 'll give it to your mother on time

310
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:19,600
Not

311
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,141
Go to the court and ask

312
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,181
You gave me these

313
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:23,161
What you call these

314
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,541
My mother didn 't want it .

315
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,621
You run outside every day

316
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,220
My mom is stuck here

317
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,340
This location

318
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,501
Just this sofa

319
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,501
I saw my mom cry many times

320
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,980
My mom didn 't live .

321
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,261
The days she wants

322
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:35,501
I want to give her a

323
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,261
A Wider Day

324
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,401
You didn 't give it .

325
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:38,661
Can 't you try hard ?

326
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,820
Who am I working for outside ?

327
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,940
Did she give me this chance

328
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,621
I said everything I had to say

329
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:45,460
Does she listen ? I don 't understand

330
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,820
I still don 't understand

331
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,340
Why did she abandon me

332
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,401
I asked you to do it

333
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:50,460
That day just now

334
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,360
Am I stupid

335
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,100
Why don 't I understand ?

336
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,621
I want to keep her

337
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,781
She 's 48 and pregnant

338
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,781
I 'm still waiting for her .

339
00:10:58,781 --> 00:10:59,220
You 're here

340
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,301
Are you looking at me ?

341
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:01,901
A lonely old man

342
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:02,860
Alone in a vacant room

343
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:04,421
You 're so self - righteous

344
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,501
I am self - righteous

345
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:10,381
What should I do ?

346
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:10,980
You tell me

347
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,980
What should I do

348
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,340
You educated me , didn 't you

349
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,281
Let me deny me

350
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:15,600
This life of over 40 years

351
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,220
Really

352
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:18,220
Sorry

353
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,181
What are you doing ?

354
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,181
You stand for me

355
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,381
You stand for me

356
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:27,021
You 're not allowed to go anywhere

357
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,901
You 're not allowed to go anywhere

358
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:30,820
Can 't leave

359
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,141
What are you doing ?

360
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,060
Come when you want

361
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,580
You can leave if you want

362
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,220
What are you doing ?

363
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,501
Why are you just like your mother ?

364
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:36,381
Let go , okay , okay , okay

365
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:36,840
Baby

366
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,220
OK , OK , OK

367
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,141
Dad

368
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:41,820
Let me be honest with you

369
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:43,281
You keep saying my mom doesn 't do it well .

370
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:44,080
That 's not enough

371
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,960
But in my opinion

372
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,840
My mother is in my heart

373
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,860
Just a very good mother

374
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,881
Amazing mom

375
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,661
Maybe

376
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:50,080
Men and women are really different

377
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,440
When a woman becomes a mother

378
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,681
She did 90 % of it

379
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:53,521
Others will criticize her as well

380
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:54,881
Not a perfect mother

381
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,881
But what about you men ?

382
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,720
It starts from zero points , right

383
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,600
Just do a little bit

384
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,381
There will be people

385
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:00,281
To praise you all

386
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:01,080
Amazing

387
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,401
I actually

388
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:03,641
I just told you so much

389
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,281
You 're not that bad in my heart

390
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,261
I 'll give you 10 %

391
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:07,560
You can accept it as you please .

392
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:08,281
Is it ok

393
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,960
It 's gone . It 's really gone .

394
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,801
Do you have any money ?

395
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:35,121
Susu 's father is back

396
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:37,501
Back

397
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,940
Give me the bag

398
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:40,080
That what

399
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
You put your clothes on

400
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,501
Susu changed her clothes

401
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:44,281
Dad will take you to eat steak and pasta

402
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,181
Stop shouting

403
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,360
Susu has gone back .

404
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:47,560
Change your shoes

405
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:49,360
Go back

406
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,161
That 's right

407
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,161
When did you leave

408
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,301
I just sat down

409
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:57,480
It didn 't take long to leave

410
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Her mother picked her up

411
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:05,600
Susu left by herself

412
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:11,560
She 's that big

413
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,641
You let her go .

414
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,121
What do you think about you

415
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:22,220
Dogs

416
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,381
Mom

417
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,820
Gu Yunsu

418
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:28,820
Why are you here on your own ?

419
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,460
Didn 't you go to your dad 's place ?

420
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,161
Where 's your father

421
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:32,501
Why didn 't he send you ?

422
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:33,820
That 's not my home

423
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:38,940
Then go home with your mother

424
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,700
Susu

425
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,681
You see

426
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,100
Is it bald ?

427
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,381
I 'm thinking .

428
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,100
A fairy cannot be bald

429
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,820
That 's why I bought that wig

430
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,021
That one is the cheapest

431
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,381
I can 't help it either

432
00:13:57,781 --> 00:13:58,580
Sorry

433
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:02,740
See

434
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:04,021
Fish

435
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,220
Do you eat fish today

436
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:07,200
Live

437
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:08,820
Go

438
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:10,421
Go home and eat fish

439
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,021
When you go home , your mother will cook fish for you

440
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:14,700
How long did you squat ?

441
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,320
Here

442
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:16,940
It 's been a long time

443
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,881
I have a dog with me

444
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:20,261
Everywhere you go

445
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:21,781
Many , many people like you

446
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:22,421
Yes No

447
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:23,661
The dog likes you too

448
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,060
Mom likes you too

449
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,220
Your father likes you too , right ?

450
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,041
Do you want to drink fish soup tonight

451
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,881
Let me steam it for you

452
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,200
Or do you want it to be braised

453
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:37,480
Steam it

454
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:38,480
Yes

455
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,881
Li Jianxiong

456
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,621
What day is today ?

457
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:31,261
It 's Friday

458
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,541
The holiday is tomorrow

459
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,621
You are pregnant

460
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:34,901
I can 't remember the days .

461
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,940
The house rented by Susu

462
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,060
Due today

463
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:42,641
Then we 're going

464
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,940
Bring her over .

465
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:46,100
That

466
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,181
We 'll pick her up

467
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,501
Come on

468
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,661
Can you

469
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,261
OK

470
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,440
Who is it ?

471
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,220
Who put the shoes ?

472
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,401
Who put it

473
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:06,161
All right , class is on .

474
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:07,421
Go back to your seat

475
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:11,781
Gu Yunsu

476
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:13,320
What is this on your desk ?

477
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,440
A smelly shoe

478
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,080
Don 't laugh

479
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,360
Quiet and quiet

480
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:19,560
Broken shoes

481
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,080
A broken shoe

482
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:21,720
Li Mingyuan

483
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,100
How can you

484
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,960
That 's what you say about classmates

485
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,440
My parents say that .

486
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:25,921
Gu Yunsu

487
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:26,340
How to say

488
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:26,901
You are not allowed to beat classmates

489
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:27,720
What to say

490
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,281
What are you two doing

491
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:29,521
How can you fight ?

492
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,340
Teacher Yang

493
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,980
Li Mingyuan and others

494
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,320
I 've put my shoes away several times

495
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,401
He deserves it

496
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:34,001
How can you say

497
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,080
Students deserve it .

498
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,240
Go Go Go

499
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,360
You both go out and stand .

500
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:38,840
Go quick

501
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:40,440
You still laugh

502
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,740
You go , you two

503
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:42,761
Deserves it

504
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:44,200
What you deserve is what you deserve

505
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,840
Li Mingyuan

506
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,580
You deserve it

507
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,340
Your whole family deserves it

508
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,621
Go out and stand

509
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,100
Go out and stand for me too .

510
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:51,700
Thank you .

511
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,641
Just speak for me

512
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:57,021
What is this ?

513
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,560
Last time you were in the auditorium

514
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,881
When reading a composition

515
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:00,801
I thought

516
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,641
Your mother is really special

517
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:03,700
But then

518
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,261
Someone will laugh at you

519
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,220
Just laugh at it

520
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:08,681
Your mom is so cool

521
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:10,041
How did she do it

522
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:13,921
She said that when she was bitten by a dog

523
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:16,220
I can 't bite it back .

524
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:17,581
Why not

525
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,921
Because if you bite it back

526
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,720
Don 't you become a dog ?

527
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:24,321
A lion can bite back

528
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,841
Even tigers can bite back

529
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,081
A leopard can bite back

530
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,581
Which dog have you seen

531
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,500
Dare to bully lions and tigers

532
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,321
and Leopard 's

533
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,641
Mom

534
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:46,861
Why do you have to go to the ballroom

535
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,061
My first date with your dad

536
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:52,040
In the dance hall

537
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,861
The day of the divorce procedure

538
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:55,421
It happened to pass the ballroom again

539
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,000
By accident

540
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,181
I went in again

541
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Maybe I want to remember it .

542
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,940
What does remember mean

543
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,500
Remembering is an analogy .

544
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:07,540
You every year

545
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,940
I have to visit my grandparents ' graves

546
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,480
Right

547
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,901
When I went to the grave

548
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:12,341
You are remembering them

549
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,000
What do you mean ?

550
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:16,901
To visit my dad 's grave

551
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,101
It 's pretty much the same thing .

552
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,581
Anyway , as soon as I entered the ballroom

553
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,020
I panicked .

554
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,141
I think about myself

555
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,220
Old and Ugly

556
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,220
Returning Earth

557
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,780
It 's out of place anyway

558
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:32,700
I can 't step the beat correctly .

559
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:34,141
But actually

560
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,780
Ballroom is still the same ballroom

561
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:37,540
Songs or those songs

562
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
I 've changed

563
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:40,020
What about my years

564
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,581
Keep yourself in your home

565
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,780
Be his wife

566
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,861
Be Your Mom

567
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:44,881
All these years

568
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,540
Not long ago

569
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,980
The ideal Wu Limei is beautiful

570
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,940
Guess what

571
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,700
As soon as I entered that day

572
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,061
I just wanted to run away

573
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,581
Someone will invite me

574
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,540
Dance a dance

575
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,421
I wanted to come .

576
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:01,500
Just jump

577
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,020
In case I make a fool of myself

578
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,220
It 's never too late to run .

579
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,381
As a result , I finished dancing .

580
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,460
Someone invited me to dance again

581
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,861
One after another

582
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,980
One after another

583
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,740
I remember that day

584
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,821
I made a lot of circles

585
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:15,540
I 'm spinning

586
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,220
My mind is not clear .

587
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:18,540
But

588
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,960
That Moment

589
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,621
I feel myself

590
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:22,700
It 's not so bad

591
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,980
Please save your shots .

592
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,960
This camera is your father

593
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:38,121
What friends

594
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,181
Bought from abroad

595
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,020
I don 't even know about the photo paper

596
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
Where can I get it for you

597
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,421
Mom , I know .

598
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:45,260
Do you want to be liked

599
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:46,901
That 's right

600
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,821
Can you stop going in the future ?

601
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:54,861
You have I like

602
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,540
Not enough

603
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:01,661
My grandmother and my father

604
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:02,780
They all like you

605
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,101
Not enough either

606
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,381
How much does it cost ?

607
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,381
Wait until one day

608
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,641
I can do it myself

609
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:13,181
When I like myself

610
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,300
That 's enough

611
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:15,681
What do you have

612
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,980
I really don 't like myself .

613
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:18,181
You don 't understand

614
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,621
It 's right if you don 't understand .

615
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:20,760
I wish you all your life

616
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,540
Don 't even understand

617
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,700
Vs 701

618
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,040
Gu Yunsu

619
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,921
Is there no one ?

620
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:44,940
There seems to be no one

621
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,861
Will it be because I have trouble with you ?

622
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,341
I went to a friend 's house for a few days

623
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:52,141
Not necessarily

624
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,520
Hi

625
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,260
Jingjing , I am Aunt Wu

626
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:00,381
I would like to ask

627
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:01,121
Has Gu Yunsu

628
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:01,980
It 's here

629
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:04,901
Went to her father

630
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:08,540
OK OK

631
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,581
Thank you Jingjing

632
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,700
Goodbye Goodbye

633
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,621
Went to her father 's place

634
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:22,940
You shouldn 't have moved around .

635
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,200
But now Gu Yunsu

636
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,381
I left in the middle of the night

637
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,381
I give

638
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:27,661
I called Jingjing

639
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,460
Jingjing said it was at your house , right ?

640
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,061
So what you just said

641
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:32,960
Carrying the box and leaving

642
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,861
Then it must be

643
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,220
Come , come , come , come

644
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,621
It 's hard to come here

645
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,780
I didn 't do anything to prepare .

646
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,780
Congratulations , congratulations

647
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,861
Good things are coming

648
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:41,901
The two of them

649
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,101
Pay attention to your health and make up for it

650
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:43,940
Thank you , thank you

651
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:44,901
That is

652
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,740
Am I just a broken mouth ?

653
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,520
Say a few sarcastic remarks

654
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,561
Don 't take it personally

655
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:49,500
This isn 't necessary

656
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,081
At night

657
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:51,401
The whole family is dispatched to inquire about the crime

658
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:51,821
Right

659
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:52,861
Gu Kangqi , stop it .

660
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:53,581
You , you , your mouth is broken

661
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:54,500
What did you say ?

662
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,621
Don 't avoid the important and take the light .

663
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:56,421
You pick the heavy thing

664
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:57,621
I can handle it

665
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:01,161
Isn 't it just between father and daughter

666
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:02,220
Do you communicate normally ?

667
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,720
What can I say ?

668
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,960
Are you in a hurry to leave ?

669
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,780
Gu Kangqi

670
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,581
But I told you I couldn 't leave today

671
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:08,500
Don 't believe me , try

672
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,141
I won 't leave until you say it .

673
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,780
Sit , sit , sit

674
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,581
Come to that line

675
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:15,341
You stay here

676
00:22:15,341 --> 00:22:15,901
All right

677
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:17,101
Make your own tea

678
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,300
I 'm sorry

679
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,581
When my daughter left , it was a rush point

680
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:21,800
I said I didn 't even want to transfer some money to her

681
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,740
You said she

682
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,921
I 'll say

683
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,040
You 're so old

684
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,161
Being a child is unreliable

685
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:33,321
Not like a mother

686
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,601
Selfish

687
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:35,861
Regardless of other people 's feelings

688
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:36,480
Right

689
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:37,720
It 's been like this for so many years

690
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:38,720
Do you want to hear anything else

691
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,141
Mei Mei

692
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,141
Fetal gas , fetal gas , okay ?

693
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:41,081
Alright , are you satisfied ?

694
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:41,780
Gu Kangqi

695
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,300
Let me tell you

696
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,361
Think about it yourself

697
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,561
What did you say

698
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:45,760
You don 't look in the mirror

699
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,520
Do you look like a dad yourself

700
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,061
Mei Mei Mei Mei

701
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:48,641
Mei Mei We

702
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:49,520
Hello , let 's come today

703
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,720
I 'm not like a mom

704
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:52,280
We 're here today to find the kids

705
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,000
Not here to quarrel

706
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,161
Can you wait for me ?

707
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:56,240
I 've got something going on here

708
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,121
Didn 't you call just now ?

709
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:57,720
If she doesn 't answer , call you again

710
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,540
Call me again

711
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,480
What if she answers ?

712
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,081
Try it

713
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:02,040
She doesn 't answer

714
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,740
I think so

715
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,421
Life or Death

716
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:04,540
Everyone , calm down .

717
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,421
At this time

718
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,861
With your understanding of Susu

719
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:07,881
At times like this

720
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:09,540
Does she not think about it for a while ?

721
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,161
Had this suicidal thought

722
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:11,960
Impossible

723
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:12,960
Scold me when I left

724
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,800
Scolding happily

725
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,361
Lively and businessful

726
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,421
Why did I scold you when I left

727
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:17,040
Let me listen

728
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:18,841
What happened if I couldn 't get through

729
00:23:19,821 --> 00:23:21,520
There is another possibility

730
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,760
It 's late now after all

731
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,500
She 's a girl

732
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,520
Go out alone

733
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:25,881
Will someone be unkind ?

734
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,000
My daughter and her mother

735
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,181
It 's from the same mold

736
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,641
People block killing Buddha block killing Buddha

737
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:32,101
Who wants to meet her

738
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:33,480
That 's how bad people are .

739
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
There is another possibility

740
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,960
It 's not possible

741
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:39,121
Ridiculous , haven 't you ever been young ?

742
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,940
I 'm in a bad mood

743
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,960
Not looking for a busy place

744
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,921
Sasa Huaner

745
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:42,760
Right ? Let 's vent .

746
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
It will be fine the next day

747
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,621
Why don 't you find a quiet place

748
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:45,440
Wait alone

749
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
Don 't disturb others

750
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:49,000
A daughter is better than a biological parent

751
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,480
What does this mother think ?

752
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,321
I don 't know

753
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:53,141
My real father told you .

754
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,361
It 's fine

755
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:01,200
Mei Mei

756
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,661
I think it 's better to use Susu

757
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:03,921
We need to go find her

758
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:05,940
During this time

759
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,881
Actually , I feel quite wronged

760
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,720
She is only in career .

761
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,520
It 's not going well either

762
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,520
Emotionally

763
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,321
We broke up again

764
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,000
So at this critical moment

765
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,020
If you left her alone

766
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,040
Living on the Street

767
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,200
Homeless

768
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,561
Well , what do you say in her heart

769
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:20,520
Will it be very chilling ?

770
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:23,740
There 's more

771
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,200
We were married .

772
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:28,240
I think Su Su

773
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,401
More or less in my heart

774
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,480
There will be a little bump

775
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:32,081
She doesn 't say anything .

776
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:34,121
Look , she went home in the last year

777
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:36,760
Come back less .

778
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,000
So in this

779
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,361
It 's a critical moment for you

780
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,321
You said a few more harsh words

781
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:43,361
This is

782
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,280
When did I say anything harsh

783
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,121
She played it first that day

784
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:48,220
I put it first

785
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,520
She lost her face first

786
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,480
You didn 't see it

787
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:52,780
I understood .

788
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,940
So that 's what happened

789
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,181
I had a quarrel with you first

790
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:58,460
I 'm so angry .

791
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,700
Then it ran again

792
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,740
This is the root cause

793
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,141
I 'm telling you that this is a big deal

794
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,621
Whoever quarrels with her can 't stand it

795
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,200
Nobita , your blood pressure is high

796
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,581
I 'm OK

797
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:06,780
You should always have some medicine on hand

798
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:07,901
Gu Kangqi , are you very happy ?

799
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:08,740
No No No No

800
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:09,700
The child is gone now

801
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,381
Are you particularly happy ?

802
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,061
Not

803
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:12,980
What do you mean ?

804
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,661
I 'm not in a hurry

805
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:14,540
Can 't you see it

806
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,720
I didn 't see it at all

807
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,661
I think you 're anxious about this

808
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:17,280
Something really went wrong

809
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,940
I don 't want to talk to you .

810
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,181
You may commit suicide . Let me tell you

811
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:20,661
Wait a minute , wait a minute

812
00:25:22,661 --> 00:25:23,581
I said supplement

813
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:24,381
Supplements

814
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,081
Sorry , according to the rules

815
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,121
Disappearance time

816
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:36,200
Less than 24 hours

817
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,760
We have no way to file a case for investigation

818
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:38,480
Not

819
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,361
I haven 't heard of it

820
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:40,440
There is such a rule

821
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:42,200
This rule is unreasonable .

822
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,341
If it exceeds this time

823
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:45,381
What if it 's too late

824
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:47,480
What should I do if my daughter has an accident ?

825
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,601
I fully understand your feelings

826
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,861
But we often encounter

827
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:52,240
Parents come and say that their children are lost

828
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,520
90 % of them

829
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,561
Children play by themselves

830
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:55,121
lost track of time

831
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:55,720
No No

832
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,821
My children are very sensible

833
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,760
She 's definitely not playful

834
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,240
She either ran away from home

835
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,861
She is either

836
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,101
She is either

837
00:26:05,101 --> 00:26:05,960
What 's in danger

838
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,280
If she is in danger

839
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,200
Twenty-four hours

840
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,401
It 's too late .

841
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:12,661
Can you set up a case for me ?

842
00:26:12,661 --> 00:26:13,740
I really can 't find it

843
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,421
I 'm going nuts

844
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:15,841
Lao Li , help me keep an eye on it

845
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:16,460

Co - author has no direction

852
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:30,841
No clue

853
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,720
Finding a Needle in a Haystack

854
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,321
Just looking around like this

855
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,881
Meimei , think about it

856
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,661
Susu

857
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,440
When she is in a bad mood

858
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:41,000
What kind of place does she usually go to

859
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,720
What a fuck

860
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,200
I mean don 't blame yourself

861
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:49,081
You still treat others like children

862
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:50,361
I 've grown up long ago

863
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:52,421
Let 's not worry about it .

864
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:53,641
Disgusting

865
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:55,621
When we were young

866
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,141
Yes No

867
00:26:56,141 --> 00:26:56,881

Don 't talk .

869
00:26:58,101 --> 00:26:59,220
Is it OK ? Gu Kangqi

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,740
There 's no such thing .

971
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,260
Unable to accommodate

972
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,000
You come out

973
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,361
He 's stuck here

974
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
Here you go , you take it

975
00:30:36,841 --> 00:30:37,641
Put away Put away

976
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:38,321
Put it away

977
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,081
What do I charge

978
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:40,161
Manager Manager

979
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:41,401
Now someone has broken into the gate without permission

980
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:42,681
OK OK OK OK

981
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:44,921
Inactive

982
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:46,141
Hi

983
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,280
Immediately

984
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,121
I 'll run the stairs

985
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:49,121
Send it to you .

986
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:50,081
Excuse me , excuse me

987
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:54,121
Staircase

988
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:55,760
There are stairs here .

989
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,720
Twenty floor , right ?

990
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:57,881
I 'll go up and have a look .

991
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:58,621
Floor 20

992
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,200
Can you

993
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,561
It 's okay

994
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:00,641
I 'll take it as exercise .

995
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:02,040
Find a place to rest

996
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
I walk slowly

997
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:04,121
Don 't worry .

998
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:05,020
Then slow down .

999
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:05,740
OK

1000
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,361
Nobita 's health is good .

1001
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:09,300
Yes

1002
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:13,921
You should go too

1003
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,881
Lao Gu , please slow down

1004
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:20,841
Maintain constant speed

1005
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,581
Can 't slow down

1006
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:22,681
At first glance , it seems like a fake anxiety

1007
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:23,841
I 'm still climbing at 60

1008
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:24,681
Mount Everest

1009
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:25,480
What is this ?

1010
00:31:25,561 --> 00:31:27,240
It 's better to keep water flowing slowly

1011
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,740
Adjust your breathing .

1012
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:36,240
Why are you here ?

1013
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:38,561
I 'm telling you

1014
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,081
The water needs to flow slowly

1015
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:41,841
I won 't wait for you

1016
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:43,121
Can you catch up

1017
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:45,121
Have you climbed Mount Tai before

1018
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,861
Slow is fast

1019
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:48,681
Climbing Mount Tai is not good

1020
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:50,520
You still want to climb Mount Everest

1021
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,760
You 're still excited

1022
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:56,720
Nobita

1023
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:57,960
Take a break for a while

1024
00:31:58,341 --> 00:31:59,161
I don 't use it

1025
00:31:59,460 --> 00:31:59,861
Take a break

1026
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:01,300
What if you really can 't do ?

1027
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,300
You can rest here

1028
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:03,800
I can go up myself .

1029
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:04,740
Don 't touch your hands

1030
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,621
I have to go up

1031
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:06,700
Nothing more than looking at it

1032
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,780
Is Susu here ?

1033
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,901
I have to read it first .

1034
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:09,940
There is no biological father

1035
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,081
It 's not as good as my stepfather

1036
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:11,881
Give me a hand

1037
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:12,960
Come

1038
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,700
You are really

1039
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:16,540
You have a thick skin .

1040
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:17,821
Be civilized , be civilized

1041
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:18,280
Slow down

1042
00:32:18,621 --> 00:32:18,980
Let me tell you

1043
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,401
Isn 't it because of my shoes

1044
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:21,061
Can 't it ?

1045
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,321
This physical strength is good

1046
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:27,061
Hurry up

1047
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:27,980
Go to the rooftop and have a look

1048
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,601
Someone No One

1049
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:29,280
I 'll give you a hundred dollars

1050
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,040
Take a run

1051
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
I still have an order that is going to run out .

1052
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,121
No No

1053
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,460
Two hundred

1054
00:32:34,081 --> 00:32:34,841
Two hundred fifty

1055
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:37,020
Why is it running ?

1056
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,581
At this time

1057
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,240
Don 't you have to be the first to go up ?

1058
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,240
I 'll compete with you

1059
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:44,200
I 'm faster than you .

1060
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,081
Susu

1061
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:48,260
Dad is here

1062
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,740
White Climbing

1063
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,700
Where is this good ?

1064
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:17,061
This physical strength is similar to mine .

1065
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,480
This night

1066
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,341
Provocative

1067
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,381
I can 't dance

1068
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,841
It 's fine

1069
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:39,361
Watch me dance

1070
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:40,300
Good jump

1071
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,361
You buy me a drink

1072
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:42,780
I don 't want to buy you a drink

1073
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,921
You are an expert

1074
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,661
Small fights can 't fool you

1075
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:47,800
You wait

1076
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,901
Let me think of something else

1077
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:50,361
Can I go back to my seat ?

1078
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:51,641
Cannot

1079
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,300
I have to drink it today

1080
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,200
Wine you invited

1081
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:55,760
What are you doing

1082
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,081
I 'm hot

1083
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,401
I have clothes

1084
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,440
All right

1085
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:03,480
Let me give you a big move

1086
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,081
Are you pricking all over ?

1087
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:14,361
I am a female dance goddess in Hangzhou

1088
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,780
Let me give you a big move

1089
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,641
Handsome Guy

1090
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:26,800
Why are you bleeding

1091
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,280
Are you okay

1092
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,400
It 's fine

1093
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,161
Assay

1094
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:40,081
Recognize who I am

1095
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,501
I really didn 't expect it

1096
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,161
I thought you doctors

1097
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,740
I wouldn 't come to such a place

1098
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,541
This is going out for a drink

1099
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:49,601
How to bring my luggage

1100
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:51,621
I was thinking

1101
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,981
Appropriately Lulufu

1102
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:56,561
More people like me

1103
00:34:56,621 --> 00:34:57,700
Run away from home

1104
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,220
The last time I saw you

1105
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:00,780
You 're already under siege .

1106
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,461
More than besieged on all sides

1107
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,360
I 'm a treason now

1108
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,820
Homeless

1109
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,320
No one wants me .

1110
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,941
We seem to meet

1111
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:09,920
This always happens

1112
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,820
Bad Things

1113
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:12,740
I 'll stay away from you

1114
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,900
To avoid secondary damage to you

1115
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:16,780
Sorry to interrupt

1116
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,200
Why are you going ?

1117
00:35:20,141 --> 00:35:21,141
Find someone to drink

1118
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,121
Don 't drink it .

1119
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,141
You 're already drunk

1120
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:24,461
You shook just dancing

1121
00:35:25,061 --> 00:35:26,820
You don 't understand that I 'm not drunk

1122
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,720
I 'm slightly drunk

1123
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:28,981
Tipsy , do you understand ?

1124
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:29,920
Just drink happily

1125
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,820
When you are right above

1126
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:31,880
I 'm happy

1127
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:37,021
I drank so much

1128
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,300
Not a penny spent

1129
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:41,461
Cost - effective

1130
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,961
Your night

1131
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:46,941
How many orthographs should I save

1132
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,021
Save

1133
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:53,900
Until someone really likes me

1134
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:00,081
I agreed I 'll buy you a drink

1135
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,380
Help you save a sum

1136
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:03,061
Two glasses of tequila

1137
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:03,961
Agreed

1138
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,461
You buy me a drink because I dance well .

1139
00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:06,780
The dance you just danced

1140
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,420
All my life

1141
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,461
Can 't meet the second one

1142
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:10,501
Reciprocity

1143
00:36:11,141 --> 00:36:12,181
Let me borrow your mobile phone

1144
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,541
Call me

1145
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:21,981
Not

1146
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,141
You can be

1147
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,621
What did I say to you ?

1148
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:27,041
I 'm sexy

1149
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,581
It 's fine

1150
00:36:28,581 --> 00:36:30,521
I know my mom 's primary doctor

1151
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,380
No loss

1152
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:34,621
We can also add WeChat

1153
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,541
I 'll go out for a while

1154
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,501
Then I have to return that phone

1155
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,161
I know where you work

1156
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:52,840
Talk too much will lead to loss

1157
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:53,981
Don 't be cocky

1158
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:01,820
Nobita , are you okay ?

1159
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,061
I 'm fine

1160
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:06,820

You open the door and open the door

1188
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,320
Hurry up , hold up , hold up

Wait for me

1200
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,661
You weren 't home when I came home .

1201
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:20,320
You know I ran away

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,200
How many places ?

1204
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:23,280
You talk .

1205
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,300
I went home to find you

1206
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,420
Then you 're not here

1207
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,021
I 'm not home

1208
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:27,420
You can wait for me at home

1209
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,541
I called the police .

1210
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,340

I thought you were coming to the ballroom

1214
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:36,240
They say minors are not allowed in

1215
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,481
I 'll wait for you right here

1216
00:39:38,521 --> 00:39:39,920

00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,661
What are you doing in the ballroom ?

1229
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:57,461
Do you like dance halls ?

1230
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:00,420
I don 't like it anymore , okay

1231
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,740
I won 't come here , okay ?

1232
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,220
But you like dance halls .

1233
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,581
Why don 't you come

1234
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,581
I think you wear that

1235
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:06,220
Sparkling

1236
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,461
Sparkling skirt

1237
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,760
Wear red lips and wear high heels

1238
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,661
Very happy

00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,501
I like you happy .

1240
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:13,920
You divorced my dad

1241
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,621
Isn 't it just for fun ?

1242
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:17,880
I think every time you 're happy

1243
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:19,860
You will like yourself more .

1244
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,260
Isn 't it true

1245
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:32,340
I 'm not cold

1246
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:37,240
Susu

1247
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:39,481
You tell Mom

1248
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,461
Did someone bully you ?

1249
00:40:43,461 --> 00:40:44,581
Someone Told You What

1250
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:45,541
My mother is not good

1251
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,561
No

1252
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:47,820
Is it okay ?

1253
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:49,260
You must have been wronged

1254
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:49,860
Yes No

1255
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,300
Luo Jingjing told me

1256
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:53,700
If someone wants to hit you and scold you

1257
00:40:53,941 --> 00:40:55,101
Don 't change yourself

1258
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:56,461
but to shut them up

1259
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,900
Mom is so sorry for you

1260
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,501
You 've been wronged for following me

1261
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,181
I 'm sorry I just

1262
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,521
I 'm not wronged . Mom just

1263
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:14,661
It 's a little fierce .

1264
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:15,641
Sorry

1265
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:16,700
It 's fine

1266
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,981
I love being with you

1267
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:24,541
Don 't cry , Mom

1268
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:28,541
Is Mom Ballroom fun ?

1269
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,420
Don 't cry

1270
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:36,941
Alright

1271
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:38,880
That is

1272
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,941
It 's fun

1273
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:44,920
My mother took me that day

1274
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,581
I went to a closed dance hall

1275
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:48,320
But lucky

1276
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,101
There are still many

1277
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:50,541
Uncle and aunt come with me

1278
00:42:00,161 --> 00:42:03,081
She 's so drunk .

1279
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,240
It is best to lie on your side

1280
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:06,681
Otherwise , if she throws up

1281
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:08,001
She 'll choke on herself

1282
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:09,200
It 's okay , I 'll give it to her later

1283
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,021
Drink some honey water

1284
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:10,880
Get her up

1285
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,961
If she could get up

1286
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:13,220
I 'll drink some cold beer with her

1287
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,840
Clear through

1288
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,760
Ready soon

1289
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,400
We can continue when we wake up

1290
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,001
I 'll have another game .

1291
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:24,800
I forgot

1292
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
I can 't stay any longer

1293
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,181
I have to go

1294
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
It 's past one point

1295
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:30,760
At the beginning

1296
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,521
You today

1297
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:33,681
The physical exertion is not small .

1298
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:35,621
Susu

1299
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,041
Your father worked all night for you

1300
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:38,720
Let 's go

1301
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,481
Talk to her when you wake up

1302
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:41,320
Yes , yes

1303
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,461
Su Su , I 'm sorry for troubling you .

1304
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:52,200
Then don 't worry .

1305
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,320
Nobita doesn 't need it

1306
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,161
Don 't give it away .

1307
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:54,961
Meimei , please send it to me

1308
00:42:54,961 --> 00:42:55,700
I , I give it to Su Su

1309
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,200
Pour some honey water

1310
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,121
OK OK

1311
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,981
Are you so anxious today ?

1312
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:06,501
You said this Susu is really my daughter

1313
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:09,481
Inherited my excellent gene

1314
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:12,240
This is really beyond reach .

1315
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:15,061
Drunk

1316
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,101
This is a luxurious place

1317
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:17,521
How can you choose such a handsome guy ?

1318
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:19,720
You mean this doctor

1319
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,041
Clean and tidy , isn 't it

1320
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:34,001
I 'm talking nonsense

1321
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,260
Mouth missing

1322
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,161
Don 't take it personally .

1323
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,760
No

1324
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,601
It 's your Lord who has a lot

1325
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:41,840
Of course

1326
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:43,021
Line

1327
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:43,920
I withdrew

1328
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,441
OK

1329
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,161
Gu Yunsu , stop pretending

1330
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:00,681
Get up and drink some water

1331
00:44:06,441 --> 00:44:07,481
I 'm thirsty

1332
00:44:14,641 --> 00:44:15,380
Finished

1333
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:22,880
What about this room

1334
00:44:23,481 --> 00:44:24,280
Here 's simply

1335
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,420
I cleaned it up .

1336
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,041
The lighting is not very good

1337
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,200
Cold in winter

1338
00:44:30,521 --> 00:44:31,800
Add an electric blanket for you

1339
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,981
Then

1340
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,240
By then

1341
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,720
Electric heater or something

1342
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,161
Should not be a big problem

1343
00:44:40,641 --> 00:44:41,681
I 'm Li Yan

1344
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:43,400
This year is the repeat of senior year

1345
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,240
A critical year

1346
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:47,001
So you 're wronged

1347
00:44:47,021 --> 00:44:47,661
Is it ok

1348
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:49,681
I am not wronged

1349
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:51,780
I think this place

1350
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,681
Very good

1351
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,601
Crowded and crowded

1352
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,681
Full

1353
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,081
This is not the same as when we were young

1354
00:44:57,081 --> 00:44:58,200
Do you live in the same place ?

1355
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:01,121
It feels like home

1356
00:45:01,581 --> 00:45:02,601
I like it

1357
00:45:11,081 --> 00:45:12,161
The bar is fun

1358
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:14,200
More fun than ballroom

1359
00:45:15,681 --> 00:45:16,760
I 'll take you there another day

1360
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,041
You can 't go here either

1361
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:21,740
OK

1362
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,760
Hurry up and take a hot bath

1363
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,521
Comfortable

1364
00:45:25,081 --> 00:45:25,900
Go to bed early

1365
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:39,320
I like this one best

1366
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:41,081
I like this one the most

1367
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:42,001
Why

1368
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:43,061
This is blurred

1369
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:44,141
Why do you like it

1370
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,681
It 's a memorial

1371
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,081
What commemorate

1372
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,700
Memorial

1373
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,320
Commemorating the Year

1374
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:02,880
Divorced

1375
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:05,561
Low education level

1376
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:08,081
I don 't earn enough .

1377
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:11,320
Raising a daughter alone

1378
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,121
But I have a lot of hopes .

1379
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:19,880
I think

1380
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:24,061
The golden age of my life

1381
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,961
It 's just about to begin
