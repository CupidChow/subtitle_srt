1
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,599
What about me now

2
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:21,640
A total of 4350

3
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,640
How much are you

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,000
Eight hundred twenty-seven dollars and a half

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,919
We have so many now

6
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:31,239
After I quit my job

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,879
There will be no stable income

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,919
Every month

9
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:36,039
You can only make money by selling clothes

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,800
Is that a profit or a loss

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,000
I can 't even tell it .

12
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:40,520
This monthly rent

13
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,039
Four hundred thunderbolts cannot be beaten

14
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:42,799
The flowers went out

15
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,039
Then

16
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,600
Our daily commute

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,479
Eating and drinking

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,560
And your extra - curricular tutoring

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,240
A whole lot

20
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,939
Even if we save money

21
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:51,780
Search Search

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,479
Eight hundred also went out

23
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,079
What about this money ?

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,479
Enough to last us for four months

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,920
But if

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,920
If I go to evening school now

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,000
I paid my tuition

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,799
Even if I retire the house

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,039
I moved to the student dormitory

30
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,500
This remaining money

31
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,719
Less than three months of live head

32
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,119
If I quit snacks and milk tea

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,339
No pocket money

34
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:15,600
How long can it last ?

35
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,820
three months

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,960
A little bit

37
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,259
What you said before

38
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:23,020
I destroyed this family .

39
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,899
I 'm drunk

40
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:24,899
It 's a lie

41
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,880
And your camera

42
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,119
Why don 't you play less

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,639
That photo paper is very expensive

44
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,639
Wu Limei , you have to pay the tuition fees

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,680
Do you think I can do it

46
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,479
Of course you can

47
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,039
Wu Limei , you must pay

48
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,080
Grandma said

49
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:43,820
No matter how poor you are , you can 't be poor in education

50
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,539
But if I really

51
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,720
I paid the tuition fee

52
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:48,539
There will be no way out by then

53
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:49,779
Come with me

54
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:50,919
Are you ready to endure the hardships ?

55
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,699
Grandma also said

56
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,180
When I was a child , I ate all my hardships

57
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,699
When you grow up , you can only enjoy happiness .

58
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,059
Who is it ?

59
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,339
Takeaway

60
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:34,140
I didn 't order takeout

61
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,260
I didn 't order takeout

62
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,399
Who is this ?

63
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,219
Come in , Come in

64
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,300
Why are you here

65
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,059
I want to eat something with you

66
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:58,140
I want to watch it with you too

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,920
Movies I didn 't watch that day

68
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,420
Hug

69
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,460
Let me put the stuff behind first

70
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:03,939
Is it ok

71
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:04,740
Yes Yes Yes

72
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,659
Can you have barbecue at this point ?

73
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,420
You can eat it

74
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,939
That 's fine

75
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:08,740
Of course you can eat it

76
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,279
Is your mom settled ?

77
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:15,460
Jingjing found a place for her .

78
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,499
Depart early tomorrow morning

79
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,540
Why don 't you let her go ?

80
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,819
My mother is pregnant

81
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,460
But she also has personal freedom

82
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,159
Right

83
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,780
Where is she now

84
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:25,900
Make this decision

85
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,579
Actually , I understand her very well .

86
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,259
As long as she is safe

87
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:31,300
Then I 'll support her

88
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,660
Let 's go again

89
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,600
Jingjing will take her

90
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,699
Well taken care of

91
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,579
You too

92
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:37,759
I feel at ease when you are here

93
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,840
It 's too rich .

94
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,019
I 'm a little greedy

95
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,459
I 'm so happy , right ?

96
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,220
I went to work

97
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,300
I 'll pour water here for you

98
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,340
Can you sleep a little bit more then ?

99
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,019
Waiting for you

100
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,879
Gone

101
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,740
Okay , thank you .

102
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,300
You 're welcome

103
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:08,079
Aunt

104
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,660
Jingjing

105
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,540
Don 't move , don 't move

106
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,559
OK , OK , I 'll do it , I 'll do it

107
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,379
I 'll come , I 'll come , I 'll come

108
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,819
Jingjing

109
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,559
This dress style

110
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,699
A little adjustment

111
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:20,300
Work ?

112
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,319
How to get it conveniently

113
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,139
Your room

114
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,459
I 've packed it for you .

115
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:24,980
OK

116
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,920
Take a look

117
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,879
This is my territory

118
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,119
Don 't look like this now .

119
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,459
It 's beautiful in spring and summer

120
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:34,480
Everything

121
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,920
I thought .

122
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,519
You arranged for me a

123
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,220
Yes It should be

124
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,420
A place of luxury and luxury

125
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,240
I didn 't expect

126
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,220
Here comes a return to basics

127
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,400
Stay away from the noise of the city

128
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,259
Unique flavor

129
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:46,819
How about

130
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:47,980
Good

131
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,319
That 's it

132
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,040
I think my mom is

133
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,720
The next stage has been entered

134
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,319
Susu , I checked .

135
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,840
This third stage

136
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,579
Called the negotiation phase

137
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,699
What about people at this stage ?

138
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,600
His mind is always

139
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,100
Thinking over and over

140
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,400
That 's what I want .

141
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,600
I want that to be fine

142
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,079
You said Mei Mei was like this

143
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,660
Isn 't she internal friction ?

144
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,220
Nothing happened .

145
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,660
No , Uncle Li

146
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,600
What about the next stage ?

147
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,139
It was created by my mother .

148
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,459
Revenge Phase

149
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,319
Uncle , don 't worry too much .

150
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,540
I think it 's okay

151
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:23,740
Give my mom some space

152
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:25,459
Let her calm for two days

153
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:27,180
I also told Luo Jingjing

154
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,939
She 's gonna be my mother too

155
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:28,860
Thought Work

156
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,840
Don 't worry .

157
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,379
That

158
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,459
Then you are

159
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,059
One must be uninterrupted

160
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,780
We need to keep in touch with her .

161
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,119
You can 't leave her alone

162
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,420
Don 't worry

163
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,099
Tell me if you have something . Bye .

164
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,800
OK

165
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:51,780
Coming

166
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:54,760
Hello

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,900
Thank you thank you thank you

168
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,520
A little heavy

169
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,260
It 's pretty heavy

170
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,420
Thank you

171
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,979
What are you doing ?

172
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:18,620
The one today

173
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,420
What time will I get off work ?

174
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,099
Tonight you will

175
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:24,140
Don 't eat in the cafeteria .

176
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:25,939
I 'll cook you something delicious

177
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,180
I guess you 're busy now

178
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,339
You you you

179
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:44,300
You see my message

180
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,059
Tell me about it .

181
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:45,680
I can 't find it

182
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,059
Your vacuum cleaner is up

183
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,660
I found it I found it

184
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,540
Go ahead with your business

185
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,900
You don 't have to worry about me .

186
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,680
Mei Mei

187
00:09:58,339 --> 00:09:59,300
Have you taken the medicine ?

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,059
I didn 't do it well

189
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:02,219
I was wrong

190
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
I shouldn 't hide something from you

191
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
But you must not be because of me

192
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,339
I was so angry

193
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:08,839
No matter where you are

194
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,859
As long as you are safe and happy

195
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,559
Take care of yourself

196
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,319
When you want to

197
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,040
I 'll pick you up and go home

198
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,819
Mei Mei , you love to kick the quilt when you sleep

199
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,640
Remember to turn on the heating at full capacity

200
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,680
Don 't worry that everything is fine at home

201
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,319
Hi

202
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,339
Hi

203
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,719
Are you okay

204
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,599
Very good . How are you ?

205
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,280
Why didn 't I see your update ?

206
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:34,800
I 'm at Xu Wenbin 's .

207
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:36,979
We 're in love .

208
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:38,359
Why do you call me ?

209
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,520
Mom

210
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,400
I

211
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,040
I think it 's a little strange

212
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:50,400
You see , I came here this morning

213
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,280
I 'm at his house

214
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,000
No one asked me to do it .

215
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,479
I don 't know why .

216
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,599
I really want to clean up for him

217
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,339
I 'll just wipe the table

218
00:11:58,339 --> 00:11:59,479
Then pier the ground

219
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,079
I bought him again

220
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,640
These food and drink

221
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,400
Yet

222
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:03,599
I also set up fruit plates

223
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,520
Can you believe it

224
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,719
But I 've done all these things

225
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,400
And the harder I work , the harder I work .

226
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,880
The more I work , the happier I am

227
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,339
I 'm full of imaginations

228
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,120
He came back from work and saw it all

229
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,599
Do you feel particularly happy

230
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,520
When I think about it , I feel

231
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,959
Fireworks were set off

232
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:18,880
Do you understand

233
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,439
But I sent him a message

234
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:23,199
He doesn 't reply either

235
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:24,520
He doesn 't answer the phone .

236
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,260
My own novel

237
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,319
I can 't even remember to write it .

238
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,540
Anyway , I think

239
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,400
It seems like the only thing I have today

240
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Just waiting for him

241
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:34,640
It 's only one day for me

242
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,800
But I can already feel it

243
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,079
The kind you used to be

244
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,739
That kind of frustration

245
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,819
Where are you ?

246
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,000
Let me tell you something

247
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,479
At that time

248
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,640
Your father and I haven 't divorced yet

249
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,479
I 'll take out the garbage one day

250
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,439
I walked to the trash can

251
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,760
I saw a little toy

252
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,300
As soon as I saw it I thought

253
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,319
This is not

254
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,339
The one who looks like Susu

255
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,479
Is it similar ?

256
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,920
But this thought comes together

257
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,880
I was just thinking

258
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,920
How can I see something ?

259
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:10,559
I didn 't even think about myself .

260
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,959
I 'm not missing my daughter .

261
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,160
I just miss my husband

262
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,719
That time I suddenly realized

263
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,719
One thing .

264
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,800
A woman she fell in love with

265
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,520
As if she would

266
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,359
I want to give unconsciously

267
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:27,400
Want to sacrifice

268
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,579
Yes

269
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,140
And when you give

270
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,859
Not getting the response you expected

271
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,359
You may still feel wronged

272
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,959
Then

273
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,520
Love yourself well first

274
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,239
Love yourself well

275
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,400
Love someone else again

276
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,420
Yeah , so

277
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:45,059
If you have been talking to Uncle Li recently

278
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:45,900
I 'm not happy .

279
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,660
You 're not feeling well

280
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,939
You want to be alone for a while

281
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,239
I am fully supportive of you

282
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,199
I was thinking .

283
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:54,280
I have to make myself clear first

284
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,719
Then I 'll face someone else

285
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,300
Yes

286
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,199
Don 't care what others think .

287
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,719
Happiness is the most important thing

288
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:02,260
Right

289
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,000
I finally know

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,280
Whoever I 'm doing this is up to me

291
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,199
All right , all right

292
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:07,000
Don 't be wordy

293
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:08,400
I want to read a book

294
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,120
Hang up

295
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,079
You 're dead now

296
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,760
I 'm not done yet

297
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,439
So ruthless

298
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,319
Su Su ah

299
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,500
We 're going this time

300
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,020
Don 't be lazy .

301
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:28,939
We must be good

302
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,880
To make my grandparents happy

303
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,579
Is it good ?

304
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,479
Got it

305
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,000
This time .

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,380
We 're not visiting relatives

307
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,859
We have nowhere to live

308
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:38,579
Go back and eat old

309
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:39,939
You know what it means

310
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:40,579
I know .

311
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,459
So

312
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,280
We need to gnaw our attitude

313
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,140
Gnaw out your character

314
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,059
Are you okay

315
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:49,780
I see you crazy

316
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,579
Run for me

317
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,520
Please slow down

318
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,040
In your eyes

319
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,620
Are there any adults ?

320
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,819
Yes , yes , yes

321
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:02,400
I can 't catch you today

322
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,939
Is that true ?

323
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:04,140
Don 't sprain your feet

324
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,099
Can you sit for a while ?

325
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:11,680
Mom

326
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,260
Where 's my dad

327
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,739
Do you still remember your father

328
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:16,420
Your dad doesn 't want to see you

329
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:20,059
Susu That

330
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,199
You like eating strawberries

331
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,540
Grandma bought you strawberries .

332
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,140
You eat

333
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,180
You don 't eat it

334
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,939
You 're angry with me

335
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:27,400
What else can you do ?

336
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,339
Useless stubborn seed

337
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,579
OK , I won 't eat

338
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:31,520
Don 't be angry .

339
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:33,260
Can you give it all to Susu ?

340
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:34,380
Mom

341
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:36,180
You 're different today .

342
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,140
I would have talked back before

343
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,620
Didn 't he come back for help ?

344
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,579
People under the eaves

345
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,219
Then you need to put on your posture .

346
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,739
And your grandmother swears .

347
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:46,339
There are only three axes in total

348
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,920
Total Score Total

349
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,040
Learn this technique

350
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,500
It will be useful for writing essays in the future

351
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,620
What does that mean ?

352
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:54,040
Useless stubborn seed

353
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,339
This sentence is the tone set

354
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:56,219
This is called total

355
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,199
Next

356
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,319
Your grandmother would say something

357
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,540
One Two Three Four Five

358
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,859
Those are the specific reasons

359
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:01,819
That is called a point

360
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,520
Total

361
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,339
People in their thirties

362
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,459
My daughter follows you for a meal

363
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:07,339
A full meal

364
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,739
Living a stretched life

365
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:10,979
You yourself are young

366
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:11,819
Dropped out of school

367
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:12,739
You still want Su Su

368
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:13,939
Follow in your footsteps

369
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,300
Article 1

370
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,180
Being a mother is not like being a mother

371
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,420
I advised you

372
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,900
Don 't talk to Gu Kangqi

373
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,339
The Vase Wedding

374
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,620
Not solid at all

375
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,120
He 's not the material for marriage ?

376
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,300
Article 2

377
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,380
Poor vision

378
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,199
I didn 't marry a good person

379
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,780
Disconnect

380
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,880
Where do you say there are parents ?

381
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,059
Hurting your own child

382
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,859
Then I 'm also a parent .

383
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:37,920
That comes from your mouth

384
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,079
It 's like I 've been doing a scourge

385
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:39,719
Gu Yunsu

386
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:40,500
You 're different

387
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,180
You are outrageous , you do things

388
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,420
What do you say about you

389
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,900
You 're not stupid , you

390
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:46,699
Article 3

391
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,099
Being a daughter is not like being a daughter

392
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,300
You said

393
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,140
You didn 't even discuss it with us

394
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:53,699
If you say leave , you will leave .

395
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,760
I 'm going to change my routine next .

396
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,939
Take a look .

397
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,479
Mom

398
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,300
I went through divorce

399
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,439
Thoughtful

400
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:06,020
Marriage is not allowed

401
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,579
Divorce is not allowed to leave

402
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,099
What do you want me to do ?

403
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,540
You parents

404
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,320
Don 't always interfere or influence

405
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,459
Our children 's decisions

406
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:14,100
Is it good ?

407
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,180
What do you mean ?

408
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:16,719
We did something wrong

409
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:17,820
Then I and your father

410
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,400
I don 't look like a parent anymore

411
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,400
Well , didn 't you just say that ?

412
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,459
I am not a good daughter

413
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,499
I 'm not a good wife either

414
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:24,539
I 'm not a good mother either

415
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:25,860
I feel wronged too .

416
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,499
You can 't just let state officials set fire

417
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,620
You 're too overbearing

418
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,479
Then you can go .

419
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,820
Be your strong woman

420
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:31,860
You go

421
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:34,580
That 's not what I meant , Mom

422
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:36,299
I just think you and my dad

423
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,239
You should have

424
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,180
Hit me hard

425
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:39,699
Can you lock me at home ?

426
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:40,759
I have listened to you

427
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,699
One sentence and a half sentence

428
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:42,459
I won 't

429
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:43,380
Today is so miserable

430
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,039
Right

431
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:45,779
You just indulge me too much

432
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:46,739
You 're just too

433
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,479
Customed

434
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:52,140
It 's good to know

435
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,499
Dad

436
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:55,380
Dinner

437
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,499
Lai Su Su Lai

438
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,699
Choose the biggest one to eat

439
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:19,939
Come

440
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,120
Dad

441
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,499
I want to tell you something

442
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,180
I 'm going to go to Night University

443
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,160
Then after I go to school

444
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,100
A lot of work this time

445
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,620
It is indeed incorrect

446
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,380
I want to take advantage of Susu 's holiday

447
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:42,539
Take her temporary

448
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,539
Put it with you first

449
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,439
A period of time

450
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,959
I also have time

451
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,660
Let 's go and work more jobs

452
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:50,640
How

453
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:52,340
You get married and divorced

454
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,499
Without discussing it with us

455
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,100
Why are you pretending to be polite ?

456
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:57,239
Susu is our granddaughter

457
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,259
Su Su ah

458
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,380
You can stay as long as you want .

459
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,519
Susu must be obedient .

460
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:05,620
If you were

461
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,779
Can listen to us

462
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:08,820
Who is it ?

463
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,019
I 'll go I 'll go

464
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:10,939
I 'll check it out

465
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:13,400
Who is it ?

466
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,140
I

467
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,439
Li Mei

468
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:18,039
Why are you here ?

469
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,100
I just heard from my mom

470
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,939
I met you on the road

471
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:21,060
I 'll come and have a look .

472
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:22,580
Who is it ?

473
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,340
It 's Yunxi

474
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:25,519
Walk inside and sit for a while

475
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,539
I 'm not going . Let me tell you a few words .

476
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:27,140
I went back .

477
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,979
It 's fine

478
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:28,380
Come inside

479
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,620
We just cooked a meal

480
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,380
Let me tell you

481
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,380
Come in for dinner

482
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,019
I won 't go uncle

483
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:34,160
Let me talk to Li Mei

484
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,140
I went back .

485
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,900
How is it recently

486
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,499
I 'm planning to go out

487
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:39,820
Where are you going

488
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:40,640
Shenzhen

489
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,699
I have a relative over there

490
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,439
He told me that as long as he was willing to endure hardships

491
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,219
There 's no chance there .

492
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:47,979
But I heard it .

493
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,680
That price over there

494
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,580
Very tall , tall , tall

495
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:52,920
You 're there by yourself

496
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,739
Stranger

497
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:54,660
Can you take it ?

498
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,779
Is it possible ?

499
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:57,060
Even if it doesn 't work , it will work

500
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,580
You can 't sit still and wait for death .

501
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,799
Otherwise for the rest of my life

502
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,019
I really have to be stuck here

503
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:04,620
Okay , then you can go .

504
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,180
What about you ? How are you ?

505
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:09,420
I didn 't tell you before

506
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,779
Should I take the exam

507
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,759
Passed

508
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,660
I passed the night university

509
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,299
Really

510
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,299
That 's great

511
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,180
I went to school in the next year

512
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,539
If you could go back to school

513
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:18,219
Far from your goal

514
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:19,080
It 's a little closer

515
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,660
That 's right

516
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,060
But it 's a very troublesome thing

517
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,620
It 's giving me a headache now

518
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,360
You know when you get there

519
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,219
It is stuck during class time

520
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:28,340
What does this mean ?

521
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,739
I couldn 't get into that

522
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:31,100
Very stable class

523
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:32,380
Gu Yunsu

524
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,820
I 'll start junior high school soon

525
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,100
What is the tuition fee ?

526
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,680
Pocket money

527
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,100
She usually plays with that camera

528
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,939
What you 've seen before

529
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,380
That camera eats money .

530
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:40,900
Did you know

531
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,060
That photo paper

532
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,739
That 's a basket of eggs

533
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,299
Sometimes at night .

534
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:45,979
I 'll think about it

535
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,660
I quit my job at that time

536
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:49,100
I have a little regret

537
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:50,560
Li Mei

538
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,560
I divorced at that time

539
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,340
from you

540
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
That two thousand dollars

541
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,420
For a while , I will

542
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,860
What did you tell me

543
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,459
I 'm complaining to you

544
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:00,140
It 's not like I 'm asking you to collect debts .

545
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:01,820
Don 't come here .

546
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:03,979
That 's right

547
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,259
I 'm back this time

548
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:08,560
I didn 't bring much money either

549
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:09,900
That 's all

550
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,560
You take it

551
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,060
Li Mei

552
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,979
Why don 't I want it ?

553
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,580
You 're almost ready .

554
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,759
You take it and go over there

555
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,219
There are many places to spend money

556
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:16,459
You need some money in your pocket

557
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:17,699
I don 't have much money to begin with

558
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:18,360
Don 't give it to me

559
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,400
I really don 't want Li Mei if you take it .

560
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,439
OK

561
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,180
OK

562
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,060
Alright , Limei

563
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,719
OK OK

564
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,100
Hold

565
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:26,979
I am angry

566
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,420
Take this money as

567
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:29,939
When I invest in you

568
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,620
You can do a good job over there

569
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,180
We must make some achievements .

570
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,019
I haven 't been to Shenzhen yet

571
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,660
By then

572
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,539
I brought our family Susu with me

573
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:37,340
To find you

574
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,420
I heard it from others

575
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,979
There is a window into the world

576
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,699
Very beautiful and fun

577
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:43,180
Let 's go to you

578
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,739
Li Mei

579
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:47,580
It must be fine .

580
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,180
You too

581
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:52,880
Yun Happy

582
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,420
No matter how hard it is , we can 't give up

583
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,920
There will always be a turn in life

584
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,779
Unrecognized

585
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,939
You too

586
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,739
Unrecognized

587
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,479
Aunt Yunxi

588
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,180
You bought me a lot of snacks

589
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:23,820
For you

590
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,160
What is this

591
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,019
I don 't know

592
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:37,320
Money

593
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,239
But Aunt Yunxi 's house

594
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,459
Don 't you have money either ?

595
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:44,620
You Aunt Yunxi

596
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,539
This idiot

597
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
She is even more afraid that we will not have any money .

598
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,060
Are we rich ?

599
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:56,199
Can you buy it for me

600
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,299
New photo paper

601
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,180
Everyone should give themselves

602
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,279
Retain a certain degree of

603
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,439
Loneliness and Freedom

604
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,120
Whether it 's a dream

605
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:09,340
Reading and thinking

606
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:10,959
Anything is fine

607
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:13,199
Because there are only lonely moments

608
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:14,459
is completely free

609
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,320
I believe

610
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:18,560
Ms. Wu is now free

611
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:45,660
So happy

612
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:48,820
Are you tired

613
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,820
Why are you living today

614
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,019
Don 't answer my calls

615
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:56,820
You don 't reply to my messages either .

616
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:57,680
Sorry

617
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,699
I had three surgeries today

618
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:01,459
I didn 't care about it

619
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:05,499
OK

620
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,820
Get angry

621
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,019
None

622
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:18,900
All right

623
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,140
A little bit uncomfortable

624
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,120
I just think

625
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,340
Can you be busy next time ?

626
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,420
You , you smoke ten seconds

627
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,219
Send me a message

628
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,320
You tell me

629
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,380
I feel at ease

630
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,820
Sorry

631
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,060
I 'm rather dull

632
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,100
Haven 't adapted yet

633
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,539
Having a girlfriend

634
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,580
I forgot that someone was thinking about me

635
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:52,539
I 'll tell you more often in the future

636
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,180
My itinerary

637
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:55,459
Then what do I do

638
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,340
I 'll tell you in advance .

639
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:58,939
Then I 'll send you a message when I 'm okay

640
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,340
Then I will check my phone as well

641
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,299
In case you message me

642
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,620
Can I get back in time ?

643
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,180
It doesn 't have to be so timely either

644
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,979
Actually , you are

645
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,459
You can just send an emoji

646
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:09,459
Just a code

647
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,900
I knew you were busy .

648
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,100
OK

649
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,620
You 're hungry

650
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,100
Set the plate for your love

651
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,219
OK

652
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,779
Do you want to eat it

653
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:27,560
Eat

654
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,660
Are you willing to eat it

655
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,439
Mei Mei

656
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,019
Remember to eat breakfast when you wake up

657
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:50,039
Take antihypertensive medication again

658
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,060
Aunt

659
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,739
Jingjing

660
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,739
Cooking

661
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:36,880
Let me tell you .

662
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,680
I haven 't cooked for too long

663
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,560
I 'm now

664
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,600
I can 't even tell you a knife .

665
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,680
This is a blessing

666
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,840
Sometimes

667
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,180
It 's better to be yourself

668
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,939
You know that

669
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,380
Relying on others is unreliable

670
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,600
Still angry with Uncle Li

671
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:52,820
What are you angry with

672
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,219
That 's what young people do .

673
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,459
At our age

674
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:58,019
I 'm tired of being angry

675
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:00,539
Su Su ah

676
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:01,560
Originally this matter

677
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,900
It 's just a misunderstanding

678
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,439
I 'll explain it to her .

679
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:05,840
It may be solved

680
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,019
You always make me wait

681
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:08,499
Wait and go

682
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:09,340
In case

683
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,100
She thinks we

684
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,979
Not giving her space

685
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:12,459
But I don 't care about her at all .

686
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:13,860
Meimei 's brain circuit

687
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,880
It 's not like you don 't know

688
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,259
And

689
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:16,279
She is now being taken up by that

690
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:16,900
That that

691
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,779
That pregnancy stimulus

692
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:19,380
Progesterone is dominating

693
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:20,340
Uncle Li

694
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,479
I believe in your love for my mom

695
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:23,840
I believe it too

696
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,580
It 's because you love her so much

697
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,799
She can figure it out

698
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,979
Own thoughts

699
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,180
Don 't worry , Uncle

700
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,279
Continue

701
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,439
Daily message greetings

702
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,900
Give her some time

703
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,519
OK , I 'll hang up .

704
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,719
Let me know if you have anything .

705
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:45,680
Aunt Wu

706
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,620
Xiaoyan

707
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
How can you

708
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,660
Found this place

709
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:53,759
I want to talk to you

710
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,199
This is my dad

711
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,560
What I 've been doing these days

712
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,100
One Two Three

713
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,100
One Two

714
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,680
He

715
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,140
He was so serious

716
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,219
That 's why

717
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,860
Yes

718
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:15,779
At that time

719
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:17,499
He thought he had a terminal illness

720
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,360
I went to learn how to dance

721
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,759
Because he always remembers

722
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:22,820
You like dancing

723
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,600
Hello Sir

724
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,759
Are you looking for someone ?

725
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,479
No , no , no

726
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,120
So you are

727
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,400
Are you a dance teacher

728
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:33,180
Yes

729
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,420
Do you want to learn to dance ?

730
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,779
He wants to dance with you

731
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,400
Dance a decent dance

732
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,160
But he 's really stupid

733
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:48,759
I didn 't learn well after studying for so long

734
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,439
That 's why I kept it hidden .

735
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,799
Sorry to tell you

736
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:07,620
There is another

737
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,779
What about this notebook

738
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,539
Actually when I first came here

739
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:14,739
Just look at my dad up there

740
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:15,840
Write many things

741
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,279
And then when he got sick

742
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,100
I secretly opened it and read it

743
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,279
I think Aunt

744
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,699
You can take a look

745
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:10,999
Aunt Wu

746
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,239
My mother came to Hangzhou

747
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,900
Actually , I came to see a doctor .

748
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Because always

749
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,499
She 's a bit depressive

750
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,039
I was too young at that time

751
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,199
I don 't understand anything

752
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,100
But this time she came

753
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,939
She 's afraid of affecting my grades

754
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:24,999
You didn 't tell me

755
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:26,519
Actually , my dad

756
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,680
Relationship with my mother

757
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,699
Very simple

758
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,239
That is

759
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:31,279
One helps another

760
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,840
Something you can do

761
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,640
That 's all

762
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,580
Xiaoyan

763
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:45,680
Actually , you are

764
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,799
Don 't worry about me

765
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,900
I think the most important thing is

766
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:51,900
Do you want to

767
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,479
Take good care of your mother

768
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,360
Yes , I know

769
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,060
But

770
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,380
Auntie , you and my dad

771
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,739
Is husband and wife

772
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,999
You 've been frozen here .

773
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:04,739
How should my mother deal with herself

774
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:10,880
This matter

775
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:14,279
I 'm a bit willful .

776
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:16,400
You tell your mother

777
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,279
Rest her at ease

778
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,340
I came here

779
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,039
There 's actually another reason

780
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:21,360
Because

781
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,199
I 'm afraid this baby will be born

782
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,140
This time is not up to me .

783
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,140
So let 's say

784
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,920
I just thought

785
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,600
Press a pause button for life

786
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,799
During this time

787
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,580
I 'm fine

788
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,840
Get along with yourself

789
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,140
Do you understand ?

790
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,900
It means

791
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:44,820
Because you 're going to be a mother again

792
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,539
Is there some psychological problem ?

793
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:47,539
Yes Yes Yes

794
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:49,199
When I was born Susu

795
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:50,299
It 's hard for me

796
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:51,680
Then Susu came out

797
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,279
I walk around the stove every day

798
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,299
Around others

799
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,939
I 'm afraid of myself

800
00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:57,080
Be lived again

801
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,479
Ripped and Devoured

802
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,699
So I 'm afraid

803
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:01,400
I have to rely on myself again

804
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,239
Maybe it 's prenatal worries

805
00:32:03,979 --> 00:32:05,239
I think this time is different

806
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:07,840
Because this time I have my dad

807
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,259
There is Gu Yunsu

808
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,439
And me

809
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,499
Our family will be with you

810
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:23,820
Thank you for Xiaoyan

811
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,320
Thank you for visiting me

812
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,380
Thank you

813
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:12,420
Hello Susu

814
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:13,920
You can order one for me tomorrow

815
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,120
Better Restaurants

816
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,840
I have to meet someone

817
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,519
Director Hao

818
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:22,320
See what more wine you want

819
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,360
Thank you for your order .

820
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,160
Wine is not necessary

821
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,840
Wine is not necessary

822
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,759
It 's good to have tea

823
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,779
Teacher Wu

824
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:29,320
Suddenly invited me to dinner

825
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,160
There must be something going on .

826
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,259
There 's something I 've always wanted to

827
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:34,479
Ask you to explain

828
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,759
At that time , Gu Yunsu came

829
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,920
While packing things for me

830
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,719
It 's a little offensive

831
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:38,959
Particularly inappropriate

832
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,080
She came back and knew she was wrong

833
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
Dare not tell me .

834
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,519
If I had known

835
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,499
I 'll slip her over .

836
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:45,920
I apologized in person

837
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,959
Teacher Wu , you are too polite

838
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,400
It 's okay , young man

839
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:51,999
Furthermore

840
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,140
So are we

841
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,840
Old friends for more than ten years .

842
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,640
Yes Yes Yes

843
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:56,920
You say a person 's life

844
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,519
I have some old friends for more than ten years

845
00:33:58,519 --> 00:33:59,120
Right

846
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,759
That 's it

847
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:00,519
Director Hao , please eat

848
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:01,719
Eat , eat , eat , eat , eat , eat

849
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,880
I really don 't want wine

850
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:03,759
Don 't do

851
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:04,959
OK OK

852
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,860
Director Hao

853
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,120
That is

854
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,459
I am

855
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,039
I want to recommend someone to you

856
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:18,199
If you think it 's of interest

857
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,520
I put her information

858
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:20,680
Send it to you

859
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,859
It doesn 't matter

860
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:24,480
Let 's take a look Let 's take a look

861
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:27,000
Okay , okay , thank you .

One Two Three

866
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:38,960
One Two Three

00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,620
Good rest

869
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,219
Hard Teacher

870
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,859
Mei Mei You

871
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,000
Didn 't you mean

872
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:54,799
Every Monday afternoon

873
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:56,339
Talk to your subordinates

874
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,020
Have a meeting or something ?

875
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:03,419
I am

876
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
I 'm not embarrassed to tell you

877
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:12,060
It 's pretty good .

878
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
Slow progress

879
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,799
I 'm still trying to practice

880
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,319
What 's going on tonight

881
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,799
It 's fine

882
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,600
It 's fine

883
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:23,359
It 's fine

884
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,940
Then let 's have dinner together

885
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:31,140
That 's fine

886
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,199
Na Na

887
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,000
Meimei , wait a minute

888
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,839
I 'll clean it up .

889
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:34,899
Then we will work together

890
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:35,379
I I

891
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:35,799
No No

892
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,020
Keep dancing

893
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:37,799
See you tonight

894
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:38,699
No

895
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,120
Mei Mei I

896
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,060
To prepare for class

897
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,940
Coming to class

898
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:47,799
Put just

899
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:48,899
The last shape is set

900
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:49,640
Preparation

901
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:54,879
Gu Yunsu

902
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,180
I asked you to accompany me today

903
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,000
To see Director Hao

904
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,759
Why don 't you come

905
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:58,540
That 's unrighteous

906
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,040
I don 't want to go

907
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,040
Didn 't you tell me that ?

908
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,719
When the man shouldn 't have bowed his head

909
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,719
You can 't bow your head

910
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,100
This is a matter of principle

911
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,359
Why didn 't you remember ?

912
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,040
What about the other things I told you ?

913
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,839
When people are in trouble

914
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:11,819
Need your help

915
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:12,819
You have to help

916
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,960
People can 't live so selfishly

917
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:15,980
Row Row Row

918
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,160
You said the truth .

919
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,160
You 're right .

920
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:19,460
I always make sense , right ?

921
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:21,480
Why do you have to

922
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,140
Li Yan 's mother

923
00:36:22,259 --> 00:36:23,600
Recommended to Director Hao

924
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,000
What 's so puzzling about this

925
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:27,359
Let Uncle Li feel at ease

926
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,259
Let Xiaoyan be practical .

927
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,620
We Meimei really are

928
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,080
It 's getting more and more considerate .

929
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:35,799
So gentle and considerate

930
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:37,359
Like a little angel

931
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,540
Then you 've done it .

932
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,520
Explanation

933
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,080
You stopped being angry with Uncle Li a long time ago

934
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,120
Let me tell you a feeling .

935
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,419
I just went to

936
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,600
Their dance classroom

937
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,980
Go see him dance .

938
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,640
That one , two , three

939
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,940
These eyes are full of little stars .

940
00:36:58,819 --> 00:36:59,839
I think this guy

941
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,160
I don 't think I know anyone at all

942
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,600
So I later found out

943
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,080
I think sometimes

944
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,399
In the closest relationship

945
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,719
The person closest to you

946
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,199
You don 't know him very well .

947
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,919
Actually , sometimes

948
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:20,680
For you

949
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,460
It 's really strange .

950
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,919
This is normal , right ?

951
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:25,379
I think everyone

952
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:27,160
He has to have a part .

953
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,680
Is his own

954
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,500
You know these days

955
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:35,000
There 's one thing I keep carrying with me

956
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,960
What

957
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:40,419
I carry it with me

958
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,520
You carry this with you

959
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,799
I can 't throw this away even if I want to .

960
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:53,980
Let me see

961
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,759
Grandma 's Diary

962
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,160
I said our family .

963
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,540
Everyone loves to write a diary .

964
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,759
For the Diary Family

965
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:11,919
This is my grandmother 's girlhood .

966
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:14,520
So beautiful

967
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,839
There are little stars in my eyes

968
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:21,839
Grandma is pretty cool .

969
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,600
It 's annoying to say blind date

970
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,460
I want to be a translator , Grandma

971
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:35,219
She had so many dreams before

972
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:36,879
Have I talked to you

973
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:39,120
Day by day

974
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,799
Then the dream is compromised day by day

975
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,160
This is what most people say

976
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,600
Ability to realize your dreams

977
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,719
They are all lucky ones

978
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:51,819
Small Town Girl

979
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:52,560
You have to allow her to

980
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,839
Your dream , right ?

981
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:57,239
Actually , I remember

982
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,399
Grandma seems to feel this way

983
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:01,120
What about the whole person

984
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,000
Be careful

985
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:04,799
Then

986
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,000
It makes me feel that she is very conservative .

987
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:09,839
Before and after marriage

988
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:10,859
You see before she got married

989
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:12,540
Written and said

990
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,080
It 's all her own feelings

991
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:15,980
After I got married , I wrote it

992
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,359
My grandfather

993
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,399
Write about you and my aunt

994
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,120
She 's gone .

995
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,699
I remember my mom

996
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,379
The day I laughed the best

997
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:33,299
Do you know what day it is

998
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,819
It 's certainly not the day I was born

999
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,000
You are so unconfident

1000
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,339
I received it

1001
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,839
College Admission Notice

1002
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,480
That Day

1003
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,839
She was very happy that day

1004
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,719
Hold that piece of paper and look at it and laugh

1005
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,919
Look at it and laugh

1006
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,160
She laughs and I laugh

1007
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,419
This university acceptance letter

1008
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:08,839
What a good thing

1009
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,839
This makes us both happy

1010
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,319
Days and days

1011
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,080
That Summer

1012
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,319
The sky is particularly blue

1013
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,080
The trees are also particularly green

1014
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,419
All that stuff

1015
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:26,520
They are all beautiful .

1016
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,640
Beautiful for my whole life

1017
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,520
I can 't forget it

1018
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,919
You said you would go back this time

1019
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,440
Don 't say it 's a

1020
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,680
It 's a decent home

1021
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,239
A place to stay

1022
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,040
I don 't know where it is

1023
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,319
Therefore , you should bring everything with you

1024
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,359
That pig 's trotter

1025
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,399
Pig 's trotters can be eaten at home

1026
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,359
Take

1027
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,120
You work outside to earn money

1028
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,699
Let me tell you

1029
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:57,120
You must not have a good meal .

1030
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,100
For instant noodles all day

1031
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,600
How can you have nutrition ?

1032
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,520
You tie two ways

1033
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,680
OK OK

1034
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,480
Let me remind you something .

1035
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,299
A woman should show her face

1036
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,319
Take care of it

1037
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,399
You can 't be very haggard

1038
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,239
You will be like this in the future

1039
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,279
How do you find someone ?

1040
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,480
I 'm not looking for anyone

1041
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:15,759
You 're talking nonsense here

1042
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,560
Alright , you should go to bed early

1043
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,180
Let me think

1044
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,600
What was that ?

1045
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:22,980
American ginseng

1046
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:23,839
Yes

1047
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,120
Take this box of American ginseng with you

1048
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,399
I bought this for your father

1049
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:29,339
Then let my dad drink it .

1050
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:30,520
Let him replenish his Qi

1051
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,759
Give it to my father

1052
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:32,440
Did he make it up ?

1053
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,640
Blood pressure is replenished together

1054
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:35,199
My temper is also healthy .

1055
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,399
Make up for it

1056
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:38,640
If you really

1057
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,580
The anger replenishes

1058
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,640
I 'm relieved

1059
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,399
Put this over there

1060
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,680
Lest others say they bully you

1061
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:44,919
All right

1062
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,359
It 's almost ready . There 's more .

1063
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,080
Don 't worry

1064
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,680
Snacks

1065
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:51,680
Snacks

1066
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:52,819
By the way , I forgot .

1067
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:53,879
One of the most important things

1068
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:54,600
Cotton quilt

1069
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:56,259
This is for me

1070
00:41:56,259 --> 00:41:56,859
What are you doing ?

1071
00:41:56,859 --> 00:41:58,279
I just played it .

1072
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,120
Take it and see

1073
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:00,080
Take it and see

1074
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,759
How did you install this ?

1075
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:02,839
I can 't take it with me . How can I pretend it ?

1076
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:03,960
I 'll tell you about ten pounds

1077
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,440
How can I get ten pounds ?

1078
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,000
It 's so heavy .

1079
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,799
Then sleep warm and sound

1080
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,839
What are those silk quilts ?

1081
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:11,819
What duvet

1082
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:12,799
Fluttering

1083
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:13,440
That sleeps on the body

1084
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,199
It 's not comfortable at all

1085
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,799
It 's too big to take away

1086
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,160
This can 't be taken away .

1087
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:18,399
Native Products

1088
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:20,440
It 's all your father

1089
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,480
You know that it was given by someone else

1090
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,960
And tea and so on

1091
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,600
Let me tell you

1092
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,000
You see people

1093
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,339
Stuff a pack

1094
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:29,399
If you are like this

1095
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:31,940
It 's easier for you to do things

1096
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,120
People don 't tell me .

1097
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:35,759
A man 's mouth is soft and a man 's hand is short .

1098
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,319
I 'm dying and I can 't close it .

1099
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:38,080
Take a look

1100
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,640
Not even closed .

1101
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,520
Return and Return

1102
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,739
Don 't worry , I 'll shut it down .

1103
00:42:41,879 --> 00:42:42,919
All right , you go to bed

1104
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:43,799
I 'll figure it out

1105
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:45,160
Can you put it together ?

1106
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,839
I 'll figure it out

1107
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:48,060
I have more snakeskin pockets

1108
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,660
Damn it

1109
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,440
I 'll bring one tomorrow

1110
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,500
What does a snakeskin pocket look like

1111
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,259
Snakeskin pocket , of course .

1112
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:51,919
I bring a snakeskin pocket

1113
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:53,259
Why are you going to school ?

1114
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,520
I actually have a feeling

1115
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:08,560
I think we 're saying these things

1116
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,239
Grandma can hear it

1117
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,960
Grandma

1118
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:18,399
I miss you .

1119
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,219
Please answer when received

1120
00:43:26,879 --> 00:43:28,719
She said she missed us too
