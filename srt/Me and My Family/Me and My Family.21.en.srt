1
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,260
Hi

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:16,799
Hi

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,479
Jingjing , let me tell you something

4
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:20,200
What 's wrong

5
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,200
That 's where I bled .

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,039
I was angry with my mom

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,879
Holding hands with a boy

8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,759
She said holding hands would get pregnant

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,099
That 's not true .

10
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,160
I didn 't believe it at first .

11
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,719
Then you don 't have a baby , right ?

12
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:37,539
Yes

13
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:38,460
I 'm in PE class today

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,759
Running and jumping

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,980
In the novel

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,840
That will make the child jump out

17
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:45,319
Do you think I had a miscarriage ?

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,160
No common sense

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,660
You start now

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,599
Only then do you have the ability to get pregnant .

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,800
You listened to my phone again

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,639
I learned to love puppy

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,760
The upper beam is not straight and the lower beam is crooked

24
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:02,040
Where am I crooked

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,739
Your father and I were first in love

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,779
Let 's go again

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,300
At that time

28
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,520
I 'm an adult , okay ?

29
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,239
That 's the family harmony of my grandparents

30
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,739
I didn 't give you a chance to learn bad things

31
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:10,639
Not like me

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,320
This is my fault .

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,200
Gu Yunsu

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,260
I found you recently

35
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,880
Really enjoyed being against me

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,200
Didn 't you say that ?

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,120
I reached adolescence and rebellion

38
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,359
OK , OK , OK , OK

39
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,880
I can 't tell you , you 're amazing

40
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:29,880
This is called a sanitary napkin

41
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,659
You 're so good

42
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,680
You know how to use it

43
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:32,559
For you

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,480
What ?

45
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,480
Do not disassemble Don 't disassemble

46
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,120
I 'll teach you later

47
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,260
Does it hurt

48
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,240
It 's not hot .

49
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,279
It doesn 't taste good

50
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,240
In the future

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,820
Every time you come

52
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,240
There 's still time to come .

53
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:04,900
Cook yourself a bowl like this

54
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,919
Brown Sugar Egg Water

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
Do you have pain too

56
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,519
Of course I 'm in pain .

57
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:11,960
I doubt it .

58
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,320
You 're genetic

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,799
Ancestral dysmenorrhea

60
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,359
Does it hurt every month

61
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,679
It hurts every month

62
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,600
Being a woman is miserable

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,320
Young

64
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,560
I ask you not to say this

65
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,160
Is it good to be old - fashioned

66
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,179
I feel

67
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:37,619
You don 't seem like you used to

68
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:38,839
So annoying

69
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,040
I said how are you recently

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
Why is your temperament so changing ?

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,040
Bicker with me every day

72
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,299
PMS

73
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,119
Okay , I understand .

74
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,239
And this is your first time

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,320
PMS

76
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,119
So the momentum is a little louder

77
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:52,700
Susu

78
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,760
Congratulations , you 're growing up

79
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,239
Mom

80
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,239
In the future

81
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,079
Don 't treat me like a child anymore

82
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,720
Your PMS

83
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,359
Don 't explode at me again .

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:08,799
Line

85
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,600
We both restrained ourselves

86
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,280
Is it good ?

87
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,959
Why should women embarrass women

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,119
It 's not easy

89
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:02,820
Class started

90
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,579
Li Yan , where are you going

91
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:04,240
Diarrhea

92
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,800
Uncle Gu

93
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:12,300
What is the situation

94
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:13,399
What did you find ?

95
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,639
So slow

96
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:17,079
Waiting for the bus

97
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,779
Waiting for a bus , what bus is waiting for

98
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,820
Uncle Gu

99
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,219
I said if anything

100
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,019
Notify me of any major discovery

101
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,639
I found that he didn 't have his own car .

102
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,019
This is not worthy of my daughter

103
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:30,659
Tangtang - Yi Attending Doctor

104
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,300
Usually glamorous

105
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,219
Respected

106
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,180
Earn so little money

107
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,060
I can 't afford a car

108
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,860
This is a major discovery

109
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,659
Row belongs to

110
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,539
Run faster

111
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,159
Don 't you really like running ?

112
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,779
Where are you going ?

113
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:05,620
Here again

114
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,399
Waiting for the bus again

115
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,899
I said he didn 't have a car

116
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,420
Uncle Gu , you 're playing with me

117
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,779
Don 't worry , look , look

118
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,560
See for yourself

119
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:16,800
Do you understand ?

120
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,200
You said this kid

121
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,339
What is the relationship with him

122
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,979
I don 't know .

123
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,339
Who do I ask if you ask me ?

124
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,500
His son

125
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,300
Close enough .

126
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:30,760
It 's time to take bus

127
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:36,399
The color of this car is quite suitable for you

128
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,680
Where is it not going ?

129
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,320
Take you back to school

130
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,159
Start measurement

131
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,599
Please stand straight

132
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:51,560
Eyes Flat

133
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:52,380
What are you doing ?

134
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,019
This is not your normal weight

135
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,139
After giving birth to the baby

136
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,200
I 'll lose weight back

137
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:58,560
Then you 're too late

138
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,420
I saw it all

139
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:00,719
I 'm still unhappy

140
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,200
It 's the weight of the baby

141
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:11,599
You hear that ?

142
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,060
Mei Mei

143
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,060
Although we are older

144
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,459
But the baby is still strong and powerful

145
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,440
All right , all right , Li Jianxiong

146
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,219
Mom , I 'll go get you some water .

147
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,000
I 'll go I 'll go

148
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,599
No , no , no , I 'll go .

149
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,760
The man is older

150
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,339
The older you are , the more kind you are

151
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,860
He was moved

152
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,899
Go quickly

153
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:45,959
Where are we going ?

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,740
To accomplish your future cause

155
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,899
You 're so funny

156
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,760
That horoscope is a strike

157
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,560
Are you going or not

158
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,260
Farewell

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,120
I 'm bored

160
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,019
To the pregnant woman today

161
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,339
During manual pelvic examination

162
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:58,579
She just doesn 't cooperate

163
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
When choosing a doctor

164
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,279
What did you do ?

165
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,760
Another first child , right ?

166
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,920
Little experience

167
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,300
I don 't know .

168
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,200
I selected a male doctor as the attending doctor

169
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,399
A male doctor has to do a hand examination for her .

170
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,039
That would be a bit awkward .

171
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,459
That 's true .

172
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,079
Dr. Xu

173
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,200
Such a coincidence that you are off the night shift

174
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,360
Coincidence

175
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,339
I heard all the coincidences

176
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,539
It 's all planned for a long time

177
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,940
I 've been off work for an hour .

178
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,880
Why are you here ?

179
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,719
Just our baby

180
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,040
I can 't afford to stay in bed

181
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,560
The fetal heart rate cannot be detected .

182
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:43,459
My mother is so tormented

183
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:44,800
I ran a few laps upstairs and downstairs

184
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,599
He just got up

185
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,940
I 'll check the indicators later .

186
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,680
Dr. Xu

187
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,540
Twenty-six wounds are inflamed

188
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,239
OK , I 'll be right there .

189
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,339
You go .

190
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:55,200
Then I 'll go to work .

191
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,140
By the way , what are you doing on New Year 's Day

192
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,780
It 's fine

193
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,959
I 'm going out with you

194
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:00,040
Appointment

195
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,140
I selected a male doctor as the attending doctor

196
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,379
A male doctor has to do a hand examination for her .

197
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:21,400
Li Jianxiong

198
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:22,700
Where did you go

199
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,800
I have a big belly

200
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,379
Looking for you everywhere

201
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:25,440
You give me give me give me

202
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,599
Come , come , come , come

203
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
What 's wrong with your hand

204
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:28,839
I

205
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:30,339
It 's okay just now

206
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,839
It was scalded when receiving water

207
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,859
Does it hurt ?

208
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,759
It 's okay , it 's okay

209
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,300
I think

210
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,859
Are you a little nervous ?

211
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:38,759
I

212
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,239
Actually , it 's okay

213
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:41,920
When I gave birth to my eldest

214
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,359
Nothing happened

215
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,060
This is all over again .

216
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,940
It wasn 't me , I wanted to

217
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,359
Didn 't Susu accompany you ?

218
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,879
Everyone is here

219
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,680
Do you think she can accompany me

220
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,540
I went to find Xiao Xu again

221
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:57,719
You think she gets up early in the morning

222
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,079
He accompanied me for the prenatal check - up

223
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,739
But it 's fine to leave her alone

224
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:10,259
Mei Mei

225
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,440
We left Susu in the hospital

226
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,259
He 's at Dr. Xiao Xu 's place

227
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,999
Meimei , do you think

228
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,219
This Susu and Xiao Xu are now

229
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:24,160
It 's moving a little too fast

230
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,099
Not at all

231
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,540
Such a good son - in - law

232
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,599
The sooner the better

233
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,060
I think Susu is at this stage

234
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,440
Still focus on business

235
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,640
Don 't be so urgent about this matter

236
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,560
Don 't delay anything , okay

237
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,499
Mei Mei

238
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,379
Xiao Xu is a good doctor

239
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,379
Our whole family is with Xiao Xu

240
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,219
Established a good doctor - patient relationship

241
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,300
Even beyond

242
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
Say the point

243
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:53,459
So let 's start

244
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:54,300
It 's Xiao Xu

245
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,999
As a doctor .

246
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,599
not a future son - in - law

247
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,839
The relationship is different now .

248
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,020
So is it this

249
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,780
Some things need to be reconsidered

250
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,879
You thought of it too

251
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:10,739
Li Jianxiong

252
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:12,160
Do you think

253
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:13,420
What kind of boy

254
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,680
Not worthy of Gu Yunsu

255
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,979
Li Jianxiong , you can

256
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
You 're better than me now

257
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,700
Everyone who is a real mother protects her calf

258
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,520
That 's right .

259
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,660
I 'm definitely putting Su Su

260
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,800
As my own daughter

261
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,440
But I mean

262
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,660
First , Xiao Xu

263
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,040
An obstetrician and gynecologist

264
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,400
is your attending physician

265
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,440
He should

266
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,359
Complete the doctor 's responsibilities first

267
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,140
Then

268
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,140
He 's Susu 's boyfriend

269
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,200
Then it is possible in the future

270
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,599
Becoming a future son - in - law

271
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
These two relationships

272
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,060
You go around and around

273
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,700
What are you trying to say

274
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:06,619
What are you struggling with

275
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,719
Let me interview you

276
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,540
That dish is going cold .

277
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,560
It 's not going to be burnt

278
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:15,979
You go out

279
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,959
Xu Wenbin invited me to a resort hotel

280
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,400
Is it appropriate

281
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:30,560
What 's wrong with this ?

282
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,959
Congratulations on your success

283
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,359
What happened ?

284
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:34,040
I 'm asking you

285
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,879
Does this dress fit ?

286
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,520
And it 's very formal

287
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,160
That 's the kind of hot spring hotel

288
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:41,160
That is

289
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,400
It 's not what you think

290
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,979
What am I thinking ?

291
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,700
These clothes ?

292
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:49,940
How about

293
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:51,879
If you put it on

294
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,800
You can talk to him

295
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
I went directly to farm

296
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:56,619
He booked for a few days

297
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,800
Several rooms

298
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,180
What room type

299
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,400
I don 't know him

300
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,739
He sent me a location

301
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,759
I didn 't ask

302
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:06,900
Anyway , I think so

303
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,339
I want to race at high speed

304
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:09,839
These macabaka

305
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,619
Why don 't you wear it ?

306
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:14,440
No , no , no

307
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,259
This , this , this is too unreserved .

308
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:16,859
This this this

309
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,099
No , no , no

310
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,599
The place is cold

311
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,560
But as

312
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,959
Experience of people who have experienced it .

313
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,280
I think

314
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,959
A couple who just got together

315
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,219
Let 's go on a trip together

316
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:28,780
Not a wise move

317
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,560
Short trips are not considered as trips

318
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,540
Its properties are the same

319
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:34,640
None of the advantages have gained firm foothold

320
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,280
The shortcomings are immediately above them

321
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:37,999
Exposed to each other at the same time

322
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,320
No matter how generous and tolerant you are

323
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,560
People may not tolerate it .

324
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,540
It 's fine .

325
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,200
Before I get stuck in the quagmire

326
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:47,800
Right

327
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,259
This trip will be a test .

328
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,200
Do we get together

329
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,839
If you don 't agree , it will break up .

330
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,999
Each other is very happy

331
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,099
This love has just begun

332
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,359
Why are you so negative ?

333
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,459
That 's not because of him

334
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:58,140
It feels like I am

335
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:59,060
Feeling again

336
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,359
You don 't seem to like me that much

337
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,800
I didn 't understand what you were saying .

338
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,739
What does it mean to feel like

339
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:04,739
I don 't like it again

340
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:06,959
Is he a guy ?

341
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,300
Test me later

342
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,379
After a while , he avoided it

343
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,440
That hesitation

344
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,499
Working hard

345
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:13,839
Like a thousand year old bastard

346
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,060
I just stuck my head out and there was a trouble

347
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,660
Head retracted again

348
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,280
Annoying

349
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,459
I think this one is fine

350
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:20,499
Do you want to try it

351
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:21,459
What is this ? This is

352
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,859
Pajamas

353
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,160
Pajamas , isn 't this too grandiose ?

354
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,060
I don 't wear it I don 't wear it

355
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,520
Jingjing

356
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,099
That what

357
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,940
I 'm the one I want to

358
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,780
You have that

359
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,259
Extra underwear

360
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,540
Can you lend me two

361
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,499
Su Su 's birthday is coming , right ?

362
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,560
Should we

363
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,359
Give her a celebration

364
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:02,359
People have already reported to me .

365
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,900
To talk to Dr. Xiao Xu

366
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,459
Go to the resort together

367
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,200
Vacation

368
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:08,259
They say

369
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,599
In Huzhou

370
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,440
There is an Internet celebrity resort hotel

371
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,879
There is a hot spring inside

372
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,680
You said that the young people now

373
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:15,859
Enjoy more

374
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,759
What you 're talking about

375
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,300
I heard it quite interesting .

376
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,499
Why don 't we go along ?

377
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,359
That 's ignorant

378
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,359
It 's my birthday

379
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,940
Isn 't it a lot of people ?

380
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,859
It 's not appropriate

381
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:30,640
And you want to

382
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,940
You and the baby are now

383
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,820
Long - distance travel is not suitable right now

384
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,700
This surrounding tour is the best choice

385
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:37,359
This

386
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,160
Although it 's not a big problem

387
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,640
But go out and relax

388
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,540
That will definitely be a problem for recovery

389
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,959
There are all benefits but no harm .

390
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,140
We can

391
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,040
In the off - season

392
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,359
Why don 't you wait ?

393
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:53,780
You gave birth to your baby for a month

394
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,339
No , it 's still a little small .

395
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:57,619
Waiting for one year old

396
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,140
But a one year old baby

397
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,020
Diapers and baby bottles

398
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,680
It 's troublesome to carry a lot of things .

399
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:04,879
Why don 't it be bigger ?

400
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:06,300
I can run and jump at the age of four or five

401
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,579
But then

402
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,379
I just don 't know

403
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:09,759
The Sunset Red Tour Group is

404
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,180
You are the sunset red

405
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,140
As you say

406
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,160
It 's gone in four or five years

407
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,839
That is

408
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,680
Or

409
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,680
Let 's go together

410
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,739
Look at me

411
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,459
Su Su ah

412
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,140
Your mother said it

413
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,900
Said you 're going out on vacation today

414
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,099
That birthday

415
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:48,599
I can 't eat at home .

416
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,180
Yes Yes Yes

417
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,200
Can 't be happy birthday

418
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,479
There should always be a sense of ritual

419
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,420
So

420
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,140
Uncle Li made you a longevity noodle

421
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,520
Birthday plus New Year

422
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,940
Two eggs were laid

423
00:16:59,239 --> 00:16:59,900
Thank you Uncle Li

424
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,459
The red envelope called you .

425
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:02,160
Please accept it

426
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:03,300
My mom is really

427
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,459
It 's getting better and better .

428
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:05,440
That 's necessary

429
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,540
Thank you

430
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,420
You two pack your bags

431
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,479
I have to go out too

432
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:17,459
It looks like this

433
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,759
When I was born to you

434
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,440
I 've lost a layer of skin .

435
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,299
I 'm going to revisit my old place now

436
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:23,640
I 'm a little scared too

437
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,180
So I was just thinking

438
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,200
Before New Year 's Day

439
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,739
I let myself relax

440
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:29,600
And give yourself some courage

441
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,380
Good

442
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,140
So let 's take a holiday too

443
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,059
We 're on the way anyway

444
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:34,880
On the way

445
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,959
What a coincidence .

446
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:36,999
Which hotel do you book

447
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,840
The same hotel as you

448
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,100
A hotel

449
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,999
That hotel

450
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:54,559
Because it 's an Internet celebrity hotel

451
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,360
We also want to see the world

452
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,459
If you don 't want to

453
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,680
It 's okay

454
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,539
Then we cancel the cancellation

455
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,739
I I

456
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:06,999
I 'll see if I can cancel it first .

457
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,979
This This

458
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,380
Let me take a look , let me take a look

459
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:10,080
This

460
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,039
Cancel is OK

461
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:11,940
But it won 't be refunded

462
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,160
No refund .

463
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,420
That 's unreasonable

464
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,900
Yes

465
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,779
Susu is okay

466
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:18,640
Don 't worry about these things .

467
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,840
Your birthday mood is the most important thing .

468
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,739
Then change the hotel

469
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:22,279
Switch a family

470
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,140
What 's so great about it

471
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,900
What about so many hotels

472
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,680
If the price is changed

473
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,979
Will it be higher

474
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,840
It 's not a question of high price

475
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:31,279
Full

476
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,580
Okay , okay , okay , okay

477
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,440
You two are not here with me

478
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,420
I played one , two , three

479
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,799
The luggage is also packed

480
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,080
The raw rice is cooked

481
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,259
Let 's go , let 's go together

482
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,239
I 'm not unwilling

483
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,180
Let you go together

484
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,080
Mainly because of Xu Wenbin

485
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,299
This time

486
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,459
To save my face

487
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,380
You can go

488
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,400
But do what I say

489
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,779
You said

490
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:50,380
You say you say

491
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:52,819
First

492
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,580
This time I went out with my family

493
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,440
It wasn 't my idea

494
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,400
It was his idea . It was mine .

495
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,120
Second , where are we ?

496
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,200
Can we play our own games ?

497
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,600
Do not disturb each other , okay

498
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,700
Don 't worry

499
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,840
Everyone must play their own game

500
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,640
I 'm not happy if you play with me .

501
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,459
Uncle Li and I

502
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,059
There is a two - person world , right ?

503
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:12,499
OK OK

504
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,279
Thank you

505
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,559
Where 's your luggage ?

506
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,120
Let me tell you something

507
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,360
Not

508
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,920
Do you regret it ?

509
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,739
No , no , no

510
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,239
No No No

511
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,660
I 'm scared right now

512
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,279
You 'll regret it after I say it

513
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,739
What does it mean

514
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,519
You know that too

515
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,140
I started as a child

516
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,819
It 's my mother alone

517
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:51,779
She raised me alone

518
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,279
This way

519
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,739
She actually went through a lot

520
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,140
Unknown hardships

521
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:58,420
Is it Aunt Wu ?

522
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:00,100
She and I

523
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,319
My mother

524
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,380
This

525
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,219
Dr. Xiao Xu

526
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,519
Dr. Xiao Xu

527
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,140
Come on

528
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:13,019
Bad sight when riding motorcycle at night

529
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,860
You all take my car

530
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:16,299
Come with us

531
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,219
You

532
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:25,759
Is Aunt Wu

533
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,660
Pollen allergy

534
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,360
Let 's throw the flowers away

535
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,059
No , no , no , no , no , no

536
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:31,640
It 's okay , it 's okay

537
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,219
It will be fine in a moment

538
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:33,259
To be on the safe side , it 's better to throw it away .

539
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:33,900
Wait for me , me , me

540
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,239
I 'll take a picture , I 'll take a picture and throw it away

541
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,019
Just put it in the trunk

542
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:37,999
Don 't , don 't , don 't throw it away

543
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:39,100
Throw it away , throw it away .

544
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,640
I 'll tell him a little bit .

545
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,559
I 'm sorry

546
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,100
Preserving my mom 's health

547
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,959
I can only sacrifice you .

548
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,600
I 'm sorry

549
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,340
It 's okay , I 'll put it .

550
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,459
Plug in that

551
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,700
Put it with other flowers

552
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,319
It 's pretty good .

553
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:49,920
Sorry

554
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,380
I 'm sorry

555
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:52,680
Let 's go .

556
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,120
Seat belt fastened

557
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,680
OK

558
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,640
This way

559
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:04,600
Where are you going ?

560
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,380
Leaving me behind again

561
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
Why are you back ?

562
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,340
I handed in my exam in advance

563
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,700
Can 't come back early yet

564
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:10,080
That

565
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:11,660
Then get in the car , get in the car

566
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,420
Get on the bus Get on the bus

567
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,680
Walk Together

568
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,479
Come on

569
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,840
Squeeze behind and sit like this

570
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,539
Then

571
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,100
Susu , go in the middle .

572
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,700
OK OK

573
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,100
Yes Yes Yes

574
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,700
Come this way

575
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,360
Come this way

576
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,499
Xiaoyan , you can

577
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:28,180
Yes

578
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,719
OK

579
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:42,739
Is it crowded to sit in the middle ?

580
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,539
It 's fine

581
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:44,360
Lean aside

582
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,219
It 's okay , it 's okay

583
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:46,700
Too crowded

584
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,340
Li Yan , are you okay ?

585
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,499
I 'm fine

586
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,440
Li Yan

587
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,620
Are you ready for your next exam ?

588
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:55,940
Dad

589
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,680
If you have nothing to say

590
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,719
You don 't need to talk hard .

591
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:00,539
I think there are some people .

592
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:01,100
Get used to it

593
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,180
There are no more days without me

594
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,660
How can that be ?

595
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,799
It was our plan

596
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,860
I 'll pick you up at school

597
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,100
Then we went to celebrate together

598
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,219
New Year 's Day the day after tomorrow

599
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,940
Right

600
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,380
Really

601
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,080
Yeah

602
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,700
Yes

603
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,799
That father and I

604
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,719
I know

605
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,160
Family Travel

606
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,299
You 're happy , right ?

607
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,940
I need to shit

608
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Take a look at that

609
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:44,519
Immediately

610
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,039
There is a service area in front

611
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:46,660
Hold on

612
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,279
Can you still bear it ?

613
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:47,979
I can 't help it

614
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,999
What should I do ?

615
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,100
Then you have to bear it .

616
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,380
Then you have to hold it back

617
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:52,059
Immediately

618
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:52,680
Hold on a little longer

619
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,440
Hold on a little longer

620
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,140
This step is a bit steep

621
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:01,880
OK

622
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,479
It 's okay , it 's okay

623
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,080
Slow down

624
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,819
You go ahead

625
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,819
It 's quite unique .

626
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,299
The moon is so beautiful today

627
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,140
That 's right

628
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,959
Watch your step

629
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,680
Note

630
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,100
Just watch yourself

631
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,239
Okay , okay , rest assured

632
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,200
So romantic

633
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:13,999
Mr. Li

634
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,739
It 's me

635
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:16,200
You have a reservation

636
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,140
Secret Double Room

637
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,340
No problem , check in for you .

638
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,299
OK , thank you

639
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,140
Mr. Xu

640
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,380
You have two reservations

641
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,140
Secret Double Room

642
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,940
Yes Yes Yes

643
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,739
Happy

644
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:25,640
I 'm sorry

645
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,539
We have one of them

646
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,779
There 's something wrong with the hot water pipe

647
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:28,660
It is being repaired

648
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:30,239
And it 's a holiday

649
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:31,279
The rooms are full

650
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:32,959
Otherwise

651
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,499
One of our rooms will give you a refund

652
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:35,660
Another room was upgraded to

653
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,559
Garden Suite

654
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,080
Then I 'll give you an extra bed

655
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,239
Do you think this works

656
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:39,860
Let 's do this

657
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,039
One room for boys and one room for girls

658
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:42,880
How about

659
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,799
Row Row Row

660
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,039
Okay , I 'll do it .

661
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,620
Let 's do this

662
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:50,979
Thank you .

663
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,519
Auntie that 's like this

664
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,340
Then you will stay in this large suite

665
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,479
This makes it more spacious .

666
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:57,979
This is not appropriate

667
00:23:58,059 --> 00:23:59,340
Don 't be polite because of your own family .

668
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,539
Who is with your own family

669
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,200
Li Yan

670
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,420
Let 's arrange it like this

671
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,259
Meimei , you girls ' family

672
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:07,380
It should be a better place

673
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:08,719
Don 't let you down .

674
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,019
Xiao Xu 's good intentions .

675
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:10,459
Dad

676
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,420
Susu

677
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,519
Such a moment

678
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:16,600
Uncle Gu

679
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,239
Gu Kangqi

680
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,080
Why are you here

681
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,880
Why are you here

682
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,880
Yeah , it came right away .

683
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,340
This is a coincidence .

684
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,860
This can happen

685
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,519
Hello Hello

686
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,160
Hello

687
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,580
Hello

688
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,140
It 's okay

689
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,219
That

690
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,880
Those who celebrate the holidays are all their own families

691
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,479
Just one piece , right ?

692
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,180
Not together

693
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,840
But Dad doesn 't have room here .

694
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,880
You have no place to live

695
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
I 've booked it

696
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,999
Isn 't it booked long ago ?

697
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:51,840
OMG

698
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,799
Hello , sir , isn 't that amazing ?

699
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,519
You asked him to come .

700
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:55,880
I swear

701
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:57,440
Did you call it

702
00:24:57,739 --> 00:24:58,979
I 'm sick

703
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,660
Are the three of us still living in a room ?

704
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,100
In the hotel room

705
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,580
It has a couch .

706
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,499
Sorry

707
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:06,920
We don 't have sofas in our rooms

708
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,380
Extra beds are available

709
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,360
If necessary

710
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:11,920
However , there is an extra bed charge

711
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,039
Then it 's not necessary

712
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,039
Okay , okay , I 'll pay

713
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:14,880
I 'll give you an extra bed

714
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,059
No no no no no no

715
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,580
We

716
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,120
No , no , no , no

717
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,880
No need to do this

718
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,559
Squeeze

719
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,779
Me and Uncle Gu

720
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:22,940
Let 's just sleep at night

721
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,979
Why is this related to me

722
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:25,120
Just make do with it

723
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,840
You don 't ask me if I 'm willing .

724
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,380
I snore when I sleep

725
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,979
It 's okay , I slept soundly

726
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:31,940
I smell bad .

727
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,279
My feet smell and I burp

728
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,700
My rhinitis is fine

729
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,620
Can you adjust it ?

730
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,360
Li Yan , you and Xiao Xu

731
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,120
Forget it

732
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,479
Why don 't I pay for an extra bed ?

733
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,739
No , no , no , we 're together

734
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:49,680
Extra bed is not required

735
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,360
Think again

736
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:51,940
Think about it again and let 's go through it again

737
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,920
Forget it

738
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,140
I 'll sleep with Uncle Gu .

739
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,880
This house is so cute

740
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,620
Susu

741
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,600
Is it a house in a fairy tale ?

742
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,819
Susu

743
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,440
This bathtub is so big

744
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,600
Wu Limei

745
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,360
This trip is considered a mother depending on a daughter , right ?

746
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:12,380
Come on this trip

747
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,200
You have to thank me

748
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,259
Thank you thank you

749
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:14,719
Thank you

750
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,319
Put it here first

751
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,100
This is a little smaller than expected

752
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,340
Pretty cute

753
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,900
This bed is pretty big

754
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,080
Which side do you sleep

755
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,380
I can do anything I can do anything

756
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,479
Uncle Li is sleeping on the right side .

757
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,700
I am used to it

758
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:36,479
That 's the left

759
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,140
This way , right

760
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,039
Anything is OK

761
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:48,559
Uncle Li , why did you bring a Chinese medicine pot ?

762
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,380
I found a Chinese medicine doctor to prescribe a prescription

763
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,180
Conditioning Conditioning

764
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,120
Relax

765
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,080
It will be cured .

766
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,400
Yes Yes Yes

767
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,319
Xiao Xu , you said that

768
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,459
Then I 'm relieved

769
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,299
There is a doctor at home

770
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:00,600
It really benefits the whole family

771
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,239
Li Yan is determined to apply for medical school  00:27:06,700
That 's your credit .

772
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,779
But you doctors

773
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:08,880
It 's really hard .

774
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:09,539
Xiao Xu

775
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,120
Don 't burn yourself .

776
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,519
Are you tired ?

777
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:13,779
Give yourself a long vacation

778
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,140
Go out for a walk

779
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,440
I 'm thinking too

780
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,700
But there are too many patients

781
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,999
I can 't walk away

782
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,340
Let 's go again

783
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,039
Not for others

784
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:23,959
As long as Aunt Wu doesn 't give birth for a day

785
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,640
I will stick to my post .

786
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,140
That 's right

787
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:30,360
You still want to give it to Aunt Wu

788
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,279
Delivering a baby

789
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,900
That 's right .

790
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,940
What a hard job .

791
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:39,759
Can 't you ask me to come

792
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,420
Let me supervise your study .

793
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,920
Give me a call

794
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,340
I violated the rules and regulations all the way , regardless of my life

795
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,739
Booked online

796
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:47,620
Coming for you

797
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,219
You don 't want to

798
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:50,319
Take half of my bed

799
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,999
To rub half your bed

800
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,140
You see , I 'm at home

801
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:54,539
very low status

802
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,059
Then just say it .

803
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:58,279
Don 't be so hasty

804
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,559
Weird scary

805
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:00,580
What does that mean ?

806
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:01,680
Thief 's heart is not changed

807
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:03,580
Tell me what 's going on quickly

808
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,279
What day is the day after tomorrow

809
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,140
You don 't know .

810
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,100
January 1st

811
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,080
Isn 't that New Year 's Day ?

812
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,959
There is another

813
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,620
What day did you say

814
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,819
It 's Gu Yunsu 's birthday

815
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,080
It 's interesting

816
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,920
You 're really thoughtful .

817
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:25,239
I thought this world

818
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,360
I 'm the only man

819
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,420
Remember this day

820
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:29,580
I didn 't expect you to

821
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,100
Thinking about it

822
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,759
Yes this is valid information

823
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:34,940
I 'm thinking about it at home

824
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,479
Tell me how to spend this day

825
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:39,279
Have you prepared your cake ?

826
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,459
Call me for nonsense

827
00:28:43,459 --> 00:28:44,559
Where am I going ?

828
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:46,259
But can this stump me

829
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,539
You 're so careful

830
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,920
You told me this information

831
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,080
Susu is here .

832
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,380
Then let 's click

833
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,080
It has to be exciting .

834
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,219
I 'll order a cake

835
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:56,479
Yes , yes

836
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:58,479
Yeah , buddy

837
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,080
Enjoy

838
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:02,080
Do whatever you want

839
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,180
What should I do if I am hungry

840
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:05,120
Where click

841
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,180
Do you reimburse

842
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,080
Nonsense

843
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:09,219
Line

844
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,319
Why are you going ?

845
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,420
I was scared to death

846
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,559
You scared me to death

847
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,340
Where to go in the middle of the night

848
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,940
I went out for a stroll

849
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:45,440
Looking for Dr. Xu

850
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,299
Bring your keys

851
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:52,999
Call me if you need something .

852
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,840
It 's fine

853
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,340
Is it cold

854
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,039
Are you cold ?

855
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:13,539
I 'm not cold

856
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,400
I brought you some clothes

857
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,319
It 's pretty at night .

858
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,219
Do you think this place

859
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:23,180
Especially like that

860
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:25,360
The Hobbit World

861
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,360
Does it look like

862
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,860
So what am I ?

863
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,799
You here you are giant

864
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,299
Is it a villain ?

865
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,459
You are a giant everywhere

866
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:39,799
Roasting the fire with the giant

867
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:41,360
Did you prepare this ?

868
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:42,959
It wasn 't already there

869
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,340
I 've never seen it before

870
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,459
So many stars

871
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,440
There is still light pollution here

872
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,299
If you go further into the mountains

873
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,100
You can see the Milky Way

874
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:02,819
Then next time you can

875
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:04,059
Take me to the mountains to see the stars

876
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:05,539
Yes .

877
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,739
Then bring mom and dad with me

878
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:08,940
And my brother

879
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,600
Teasing me

880
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,400
None

881
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,799
How can I tease you ?

882
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,519
Let me clarify with you

883
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:17,400
Actually , this time

884
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,140
I 'm real

885
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,819
Really

886
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,340
Don 't want to

887
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,640
They were carrying oil bottles

888
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,059
I think it 's pretty good

889
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:24,840
I especially like it

890
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,799
This family atmosphere

891
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,920
Extremely lively

892
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,600
How does it feel

893
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,819
You 're still teasing me

894
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,499
No No

895
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,539
Really

896
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,999
What about your home ? How about your home

897
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:35,940
My home

898
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,759
Particularly polite

899
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:40,880
Welcome

900
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,819
How do you feel ?

901
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:47,180
Polite means

902
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:48,680
Distance

903
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,120
Politeness means

904
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:53,779
Cautious

905
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,160
Think about it from a different angle , right ?

906
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,059
What about that ?

907
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,840
You all avoided it at least

908
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,880
Say that to each other

909
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,680
Words that hurt the other person very much

910
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,019
Get closer to me

911
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:17,340
You gave me my coat

912
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,719
You seem cold to me

913
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:21,239
My scarf is pretty long

914
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,440
There will be a meteor shower today

915
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,440
True or false

916
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,819
I 've lived until now

917
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:36,840
I haven 't seen a shooting star yet

918
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,279
Really

919
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:37,700
Really

920
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,600
You can 't miss it .

921
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,400
Today is the Aurig meteor shower

922
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,140
I don 't see it

923
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,759
Don 't you see it ?

924
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,999
No , I was just looking over there

925
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,039
Over there , over there

926
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,279
I didn 't see it again

927
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:54,360
How can I

928
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,940
I 'll surround you later .

929
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,319
Because it kind of pulls at me

930
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,539
OK OK

931
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,459
Great

932
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:06,279
What are you doing

933
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,059
I made a wish in advance

934
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,380
I 'm afraid I 'll be too late .

935
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,219
OK OK

936
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,340
Don 't you think it 's a coincidence ?

937
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:14,380
Look at my birthday

938
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,440
Meteor shower again

939
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,419
I can make many wishes at the same time

940
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:20,779
Over there , over there

941
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:21,419
Did you see it over there

942
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,500
So big , so big

943
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,640
See No See No

944
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:24,419
So big

945
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,259
Come , come , come , come

946
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,040
It looks good on Mei Mei

947
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,819
It looks good

948
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,600
I really like this dress

949
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,160
Su Su Xiaoxu

950
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,219
You guys wait a minute

951
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,319
Where do you want to play ?

952
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,759
If appropriate

953
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,439
Let 's go together

954
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,120
Dr. Xiao Xu

955
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,200
I discussed it with Susu .

956
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:23,319
You guys play yours

957
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,160
I have arrangements with Uncle Li

958
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,000
The two of us

959
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,779
Yes No

960
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:29,560
OK

961
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,100
Then let 's go play

962
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,359
Don 't worry uncle and aunt

963
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,480
I will take good care of Susu

964
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,180
Don 't worry

965
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,279
Here 's a photo for you two

966
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:36,279
Leave a souvenir

967
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:37,600
Let 's go and have fun .

968
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:38,399
OK

969
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,560
What 's wrong with you

970
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,879
Didn 't we agree ?

971
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,120
Don 't follow others

972
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,680
Let 's play our own .

973
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,000
Here 's what I think

974
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,719
Usually , we treat Xiao Xu

975
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,060
Only in medicine

976
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,000
There is more communication

977
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,339
That 's right

978
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:55,640
Take this opportunity

979
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,379
perform  on him

980
00:35:56,379 --> 00:35:57,799
Further investigation

981
00:35:57,919 --> 00:35:59,739
Then don 't choose this time

982
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:00,680
Jianxiong

983
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:01,939
Jianxiong

984
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:03,819
Happy New Year Happy New Year

985
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:04,799
Director Wang Director Wang

Come on vacation too , right ?

990
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,939
We bring our grandchildren with us

991
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:11,640
It came together

992
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,960
This is a coincidence .

993
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,020
We are

994
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,960
I forgot to introduce it

995
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,560
This is my wife Wu Limei

996
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,799
Nice to meet you Nice to meet you

997
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
Sister - in - law , you , you , this is

00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,620
Mei Mei

999
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,399
I 'll say

1000
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,299
We should

1001
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,620
Control your diet

1002
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,460
You see , we 're all a little fat .

1003
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,980
Jianxiong

1004
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,319
At our age

1005
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:38,580
It 's a little fat , right ?

1006
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:40,299
Look at me too .

1007
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,540
Then let 's go first .

1008
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,460
Let 's talk later .

1009
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,859
OK OK OK

1010
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,719
Goodbye

1011
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,060
Goodbye Goodbye

1012
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:56,140
Mei Mei

1013
00:36:56,899 --> 00:36:58,419
I don 't know him that well either

1014
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,500
So I don 't think it 's necessary

1015
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Tell the Truth

1016
00:37:00,939 --> 00:37:01,819
Otherwise , explain it

1017
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:02,859
It 's troublesome .

1018
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:05,899
Be honest and explain

1019
00:37:05,899 --> 00:37:06,899
Strange trouble

1020
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:08,939
Is there a relationship ?

1021
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,419
I understand this person

1022
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:11,500
His mouth is very broken

1023
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,239
Didn 't you just say you didn 't understand ?

1024
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,120
Why now

1025
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,160
I understand it again

1026
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,899
What do you mean

1027
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:18,819
Do you think

1028
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,919
I am pregnant now

1029
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,899
It 's a shame .

1030
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,700
Do you think

1031
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,520
I am pregnant with your child

1032
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,160
This matter

1033
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,359
It 's hard to say

1034
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,000
Unspeakable

1035
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,859
Mei Mei , how can I think that ?

1036
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,200
This is how he passed by

1037
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,899
Let 's just say hello

1038
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:31,259
I think that 's what you think .

1039
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,700
And that 's what you always thought

1040
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:33,279
Finally today

1041
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:34,100
Fox 's tail is exposed

1042
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,640
I saw through you .

1043
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,640
Mei Mei You

1044
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,980
Don 't follow me

1045
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,799
Mom and Dad

1046
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:15,520
Mom and Dad

1047
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,140
Come after me quickly

1048
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,439
Let 's go

1049
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,939
Dad will take you somewhere else to play

1050
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:23,620
Go

1051
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,339
Be careful

1052
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:28,739
This little girl is so cute .

1053
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:41,919
This is too comfortable , right ?

1054
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,640
Let 's take a picture .

1055
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,660
Come

1056
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,460
Why are we red and green ?

1057
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:50,080
Red and green match .

1058
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:53,460
I want to see

1059
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,580
Those two photos just now

1060
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,180
OK

1061
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,399
Do you have one there

1062
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:57,739
There should be

1063
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,180
Wait a minute

1064
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,460
I thought it was me

1065
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:06,379
What do I say

1066
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:07,339
I seem to see you .

1067
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:08,520
Posing there

1068
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,219
OK OK

1069
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:12,120
OK , I 'll take pictures for you later

1070
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:13,739
OK

1071
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,399
I 'll take this picture later

1072
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:16,100
Give them

1073
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,020
Did you hear that

1074
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:21,600
That kid was running just now

1075
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,299
Calling Mom and Dad

1076
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:24,680
I can envy

1077
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,500
People who can call Mom and Dad

1078
00:39:27,379 --> 00:39:30,140
Mom and Dad and Mom and Dad

1079
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,899
The two names are completely different

1080
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,859
Anyway

1081
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,040
Maybe when I was young

1082
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,960
It should have been called that

1083
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,200
But I can 't remember .

1084
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:42,000
This combination in my memory

1085
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,879
It doesn 't appear

1086
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:55,540
This is a little too melodramatic .

1087
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,200
Right

1088
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,879
You don 't know how to pick it up .

1089
00:39:57,879 --> 00:39:59,120
No No No

1090
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,219
The atmosphere was quite good .

1091
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:01,279
Why am I saying this ?

1092
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:02,080
I am really

1093
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,200
Thank you for your hard work

1094
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:28,319
Am I right ?

1095
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,399
Isn 't that Uncle Li ?

1096
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,120
Yeah , what 's wrong

1097
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:32,640
Why is he alone ?

1098
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,739
What 's wrong with getting some air alone ?

1099
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:35,580
Not

1100
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,500
You you don 't understand

1101
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:39,980
You see

1102
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:41,739
Something happened

1103
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:43,239
No more

1104
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,419
I have to go back to see her

1105
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,020
What about me

1106
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:46,060
You solve it first

1107
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,200
This is the question before us

1108
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:48,319
OK

1109
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,319
Clothes Clothes

1110
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:51,120
You still envy our family

1111
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,080
Family atmosphere

1112
00:40:53,379 --> 00:40:53,980
Go quickly

1113
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,500
Clothes Clothes

1114
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,759
Sue , help me see it .

1115
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,460
Which photo is the best

1116
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:08,739
Whose family belongs to this

1117
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:10,500
A lonely single noble woman

1118
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:12,219
Going on vacation alone

1119
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,700
How nice it is to be alone

1120
00:41:14,779 --> 00:41:15,779
Still wonderful

1121
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,140
I support you

1122
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:18,980
Otherwise

1123
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,980
We divorced

1124
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,779
Roll

1125
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:21,859
Say something nice

1126
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:24,000
Mom

1127
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,339
The weather outside is very nice today

1128
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:26,000
You old couple

1129
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,259
Why didn 't you do crafts ?

1130
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:32,200
Do you think I am now

1131
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,960
Old , fat and ugly

1132
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,180
You

1133
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,859
You got a mirror here

1134
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:37,060
Do you want to take care of yourself

1135
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:37,980
Not Wu Limei

1136
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,500
Why do you think that ?

1137
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:40,359
Otherwise

1138
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:40,919
From now on

1139
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:42,040
We are called sisters

1140
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,040
I 'll call you sister

1141
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,080
You 're on the main road

1142
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Bring in two people at random

1143
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,919
You ask him who his sister is

1144
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:46,439
Who is my sister

1145
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:48,180
No one can answer .

1146
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,200
Just make it up .

1147
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,799
Not sincere at all

1148
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,680
I quarreled with Uncle Li

1149
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,200
You saw him

1150
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,680
What a pitiful person

1151
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,719
Alone

1152
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,719
Withered

1153
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,560
I met an acquaintance

1154
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,040
People pointed at my stomach and asked .

1155
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:07,480
What 's going on ?

1156
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,480
You know what he tells people

1157
00:42:09,879 --> 00:42:10,480
What to say

1158
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:12,359
He didn 't dare say I was pregnant

1159
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,480
He told others

1160
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,379
We 're old

1161
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,279
We are fat if we eat too much

1162
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:18,239
Too angry

1163
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:19,819
Are you angry or not ?

1164
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:20,719
I 'm furious

1165
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:22,160
What happened to your pregnancy

1166
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,520
Is it embarrassing ?

1167
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,319
That is

1168
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:26,980
But Mom

1169
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,859
I thought about it

1170
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:29,919
Although Uncle Li

1171
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:31,180
Not beautiful

1172
00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:32,660
But is it possible

1173
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,180
He just thought

1174
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,399
After all , this is our home

1175
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,120
My own business

1176
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,480
No need to talk to outsiders

1177
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
That 's so clear

1178
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,319
Very troublesome

1179
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:40,339
You don 't see him

1180
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:41,879
That cowardly look just now

1181
00:42:41,899 --> 00:42:42,439
I 'll tell you

1182
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,419
What 's wrong with pregnancy at my age

1183
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,160
My own womb

1184
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,239
I can 't decide on my own .

1185
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:49,600
And older

1186
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,799
This is a good feeling and a good health

1187
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:51,719
And pregnant

1188
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:53,359
Shouldn 't we be blessed

1189
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,799
Shouldn 't you be envied

1190
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,520
How does it become  when you get to him?

1191
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,839
It 's hard to say .

1192
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:58,879
Too much

1193
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,239
Not Uncle Li

1194
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,399
Can I call him Li Jianxiong

1195
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:02,319
because I 'm so angry

1196
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,399
Why is Li Jianxiong like this ?

1197
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:04,620
I 'm really mistaken

1198
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,680
I , I want to scold him well

1199
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:07,799
I 'm really too

1200
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:08,960
It makes me angry .

1201
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,680
Don 't play Gu Yunsu

1202
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:12,540
I can 't see it at all

1203
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,279
You 're angry

1204
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,000
I can see you gloating

1205
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:16,200
How is it possible

1206
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,359
How is it possible

1207
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,480
I don 't know you yet

1208
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,040
I heard about this resort

1209
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,819
The spa area is very comfortable

1210
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:25,960
Let 's go relax .

1211
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,580
Is it good ?

1212
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,239
Go , go , go , go

1213
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,120
I ask you

1214
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,120
Is this essential oil ?

1215
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:39,980
Yes

1216
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:41,879
Can this pregnant woman use it

1217
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,080
Available

1218
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,359
Don 't worry

1219
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:45,560
There is musk in it

1220
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:48,640
Do you think I am today

1221
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,200
I 'm not angry enough .

1222
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:51,839
All right , you can lie down quickly

1223
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:53,200
Let me help you

1224
00:43:57,419 --> 00:43:58,439
The pregnant woman lies on her side

1225
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,279
OK

1226
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,480
Feel each breath and each breath

1227
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,879
I think Li Jianxiong

1228
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:04,319
Is he menopausal ?

1229
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:06,719
This wasn 't the case before

1230
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:11,279
Find the strength that comes from within

1231
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:13,399
Accept yourself
