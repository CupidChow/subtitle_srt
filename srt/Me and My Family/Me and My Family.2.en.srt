Mom

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,759
I have something to talk to Sister Susu

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,619
One said

18
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,060

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,219
Sister Susu

22
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:09,700
What 's wrong

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,240
I want to give myself

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,080
Have a funeral

25
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:28,059
I don 't want people

26
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:30,020
When I saw my funeral

27
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:32,419
Motionless

28
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:33,999
Lying in a large coffin

29
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:38,520
I want

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,660
Let them see me healthy

31
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,839
Happy appearance

32
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,160
I think

33
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,779
Happily say goodbye to them

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,039
Can you help me record it

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,499
Cut it into my film

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,600
This way

37
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,180
The last one left in this world

38
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:03,999
About my picture

39
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,199
It won 't make people sad .

40
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:46,200
Gu Yunsu

41
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:47,640
Gu Yunsu

42
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,520
Why

43
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,879
You are whirling early in the morning

44
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,319
What are you doing

45
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,099
Did you mean it

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,159
I work

47
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,040
Work

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,760
Friday night

49
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,279
Which friend is speaking nonsense

50
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,599
I don 't want Qin Yuxuan anymore

51
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,839
I don 't want any work either

52
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,399
I don 't want anything .

53
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,020
After a weekend , I asked for it again

54
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,559
I have to go to work

55
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,719
Aren 't you going to Shanghai

56
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:19,520
Why don 't you get out ?

57
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,240
Get out , I 'll get out in the afternoon

58
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,040
Too much stuff

59
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,839
I 'll collect it later

60
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,119
During this time

61
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,759
Consider it ours

62
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,439
Breakup Cooling - off Period

63
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:31,100
All right

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
What about you

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,319
Experience it well

66
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,240
Work Life Without Me

67
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,759
Is it really what you want

68
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:40,879
Experience

69
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,360
I arranged these for you

70
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,199
Is it just that

71
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,480
You can 't accept

72
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,800
My hands are dirty

73
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,439
Refuel

74
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,920
Change it back before Friday

75
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:18,920
Look at this place

76
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,379

Come and I 'll send you

78
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,079
What does that mean ?

79
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,680
A parting gift

80
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,519
Didn 't you come to hand over the work ?

81
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,879
You 're Gu

82
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:44,420
Mr. Feng

83
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:45,519
I 'm Gu Yunsu

84
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,579

Come to my office

91
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
Follow personal procedures

92
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,340
That verbal resignation does not count .

93
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:58,439
Sister

94
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:59,360
Resignation Application

95
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,139
The boss has signed it .

00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,900
Fill in and remember to find a leader

97
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,780
Let me calculate it

98
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,600

104
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:25,900
Prudent and Humble

105
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
Work hard

106
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,259
It was the dinner last Friday

107
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,999
My behavior is a bit gaffe

108
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,199
It 's not a bit of a gaffe

109
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,480
Very gaffe

110
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,360
Special gaffe

111
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,600
The Mouth Hi Thing

112
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
I 've already reflected deeply

113
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,139
Listen to me

114
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:45,959
The company needs someone like me

115
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,280
I compete desperately in my business

116
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,119
I 'm like a wolfdog

117
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,199
But passion for career

118
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,119
I 'm like a licking dog

119
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,319
My loyalty to the company

120
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,400
Definitely a watchdog

121
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,999
I just want to stay in the company

122
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:55,959
For You

123
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,459
I want to stay again

124
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:00,199
In the list I received

125
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,840
Without you

126
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,220
If you stay

127
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,439
Where to put you

128
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,600
It 's not suitable .

129
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,240
You can take me

130
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,059
Place in any location

131
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,720
As long as I can stay with the company

132
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,139
You didn 't earn it yourself

133
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,119
Not even

134
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,240
You said it , right ?

135
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,079
Qin Yuxuan and your company

136
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,319
You are all you

137
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,499
You guys aren 't shit

138
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:22,480
Now I have to stay

139
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:23,400
Why

140
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,480
Because

141
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,499
I don 't accept it

142
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,619
I think even without Qin Yuxuan

143
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,559
I can also work in the workplace

144
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,160
Find my own place

145
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,459
Mr. Feng

146
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,420
Could you please

147
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,559
Give me another chance

148
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,980
I have a

149
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,220
Project called Shimmer

150
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:44,959
That girl , Tongtong

151
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,499
I 've been with her for over two years .

152
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:49,280
I want to give her an explanation

153
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,119
I have to give her an account

154
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:12,680
The boss called me over .

155
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,280
To make me

156
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,740
With the transformation of the content department

157
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,660
The project tonality you just mentioned

158
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,420
And what I want to do

159
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,680
Content category does not match

160
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,360
Let 's do this

161
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,600
I put you

162
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,879
Go to Mr. Wang 's group first

163
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,499
Director Su

164
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,400
You 're here to see Tong Tong , right ?

165
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:35,939
Why didn 't you enter the door ?

166
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,699
I 'm just gonna go in .

167
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,859
Tong Tong

168
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,099
Sister Susu , why are you here ?

169
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:48,339
I miss you

170
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:57,199
Sister Susu

171
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,040
Have you met some

172
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,260
Unpleasant things .

173
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
No

174
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,859
Why do you ask that

175
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,459
I 'm embarrassing for you .

176
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,260
It 's okay

177
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,260
It 's actually not that important .

178
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,180
Tong Tong

179
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:33,160
I 'm here today

Particularly important things

That 's who you want to invite

186
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:40,319
You want to put the list

00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,599

Will you tell me everything ?

189
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,120
OK

190
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,500
This little thing is really

191
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,319
You don 't believe it

192
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,559
Am I able to work ?

193
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,959
Not

194
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:46,939
You two are separated

195
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,059
You have no chance either .

196
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,239
Gonna go

197
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,920

Goodbye

199
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,400
I 'm back

200
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,760
Limei 's daughter

201
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,059
Dad

202
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,160
Come on , come on , Dad

203
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,920
What is this ? This is

204
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,900
First Prize

205
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,059
First place

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,219
You 're still good .

207
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,579
The child came first

208
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:15,699
Or are you better educated

209
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,880
Don 't you go to social activities today ?

210
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:19,479
Not going

211
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,300
I made a lion 's head

212
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,319
Come to wash your hands and eat

213
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:22,079
Don 't , don 't , don 't , don 't , Limei

214
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,579
It 's this every day

215
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:24,239
Let 's change

216
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,339
Let 's go out to eat today

217
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:25,900
Is it good ?

218
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,640
Is it okay to eat out

219
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,579
What do I want to eat ?

220
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,339
Steak Pasta

221
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,380
Good Steak Pasta

222
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,459
Change clothes Change clothes

223
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,459
Steak Pasta

224
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,380
Here 's another piece for you

225
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,819
OK

226
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:46,620
Mom

227
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,239
Let 's take a picture

228
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,140
OK

229
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,319
Attendant

230
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:50,859
Hello

231
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:51,300
Hello

232
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,459
Help us take a picture

233
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:53,140
OK

234
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,420
Mom

235
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:58,400
Not ready for another one

236
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,300
One more

237
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,579
Okay , thank you .

238
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:04,140
Thank you

239
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,620
You 're welcome

240
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,839
Just give me your camera

241
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,180
OK

242
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,699
Who are we looking at ?

243
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:09,140
First Come First

244
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,319
Mom

245
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,160
None

246
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,920
This is just

247
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,939
The unprepared one

248
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,020
Come on , a little more

249
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,280
Why aren 't you sleeping ?

250
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,739
Why did you drink it by yourself ?

251
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,380
Is Susu sleeping ?

252
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:50,920
Sleeping

253
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:52,319
I 'll drink one with you too

254
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,620
What kind of wine is this ? It tastes so bad

255
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,420
Does it taste bad

256
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,199
When we get married

257
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,500
You said it was a good wine

258
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,040
That

259
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:16,959
Yeah

260
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:20,099
Of course it was a good wine at that time

261
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,140
There was no money at that time

262
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,959
It 's good to be able to afford this

263
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:29,540
Kangqi

264
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,219
I want to discuss something with you

265
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:37,099
I still want to go to school

266
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,559
I studied and graduated from school

267
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,579
You can find one in the future

268
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:41,920
Decent work

269
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:45,180
Li Mei

270
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,719
We 're both starting three soon

271
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,120
What other books to read

272
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,520
Which school can request it

273
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,880
And you don 't know

274
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,760
This is now working outside

275
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,839
Extremely hard to find

276
00:13:59,640 --> 00:13:59,979
Yes No

277
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:00,900
You see me day by day

278
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,000
Exhausting

279
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:05,479
Do you remember

280
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,800
When you proposed to me

281
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,979
Did you say anything

282
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,219
You said you wanted to take me to Hangzhou

283
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:11,719
You said you wanted to take me to that place

284
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,339
A New Life

285
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,120
Do you remember

286
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,859
I remember it

287
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:15,979
I cashed it .

288
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,939
Then this room we live in now

289
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:19,400
House

290
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,339
Food and clothing

291
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:22,599
Aren 't we all new ?

292
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,219
Yes No

293
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,339
This is not what I want .

294
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,939
This wine still cannot be drunk

295
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:31,959
I 'm telling you this wine

296
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,719
I 'll get diarrhea if I drink any more .

297
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:34,859
I 'll ask Mineko later

298
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:36,699
Bring me two more cases of good wine

299
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,699
Can you drink it then ?

300
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:39,680
Don 't think about it .

301
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,640
Drink less this wine

302
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,699
Go to bed early

303
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:43,500
I 'll warm your bed .

304
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,800
All right

305
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,819
All right

306
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,079
Sleep Sleep

307
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:53,599
Kangqi

308
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,579
What about last night ?

309
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,160
I thought carefully

310
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
Wait a minute , right away

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,380
Brother

312
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,719
What 's wrong

313
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,059
Yes , I understand

314
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:06,059
Give up

315
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,900
Give up

316
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,300
Kangqi

317
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,959
You 're back

318
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:16,859
You sit

319
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,000
I want to talk to you

320
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,239
I have a bit of a headache from drinking today

321
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,319
Let 's talk tomorrow

322
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,359
You drank too much

323
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,319
I had nothing to do with a drink

324
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:32,160
Gu Kangqi

325
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,439
I don 't want to be a housewife .

326
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,199
How nice a housewife is

327
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,059
When you stay at home , you have money to spend

328
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:41,219
No matter how many people envy them , they can 't envy them

329
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:42,140
Where is it ?

330
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,260
Why did I stay at home ?

331
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,620
I am busy from morning till night

332
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,059
I never stopped for a moment

333
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:47,800
So

334
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,459
You are indispensable in this family

335
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:50,020
Right

336
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,900
Without your rear support

337
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:53,500
How do I fight on the front line

338
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,979
You can hire a babysitter behind you

339
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,140
Please invite your aunt

340
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,939
Can the nanny be like you ?

341
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,680
Don 't think I don 't know

342
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,699
What 's your plan

343
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,739
That 's what you want to do with housework

344
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:03,579
Trying to use Susu to trap me at home

345
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,140
Think of me as an old mother

346
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,459
No , you 're so funny

347
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,500
Who said you 're a mother ?

348
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:11,020
Mommy looks better than you

349
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,739
Are you young and beautiful ?

350
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,219
The figure is still so good

351
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,120
Okay , I see what you mean

352
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:18,540
This way

353
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,800
This weekend

354
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:22,339
I pushed off all my work .

355
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,620
I 'll accompany you and Susu

356
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:24,420
Tao Zi said

357
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,059
We have a hot spring near here

358
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,120
It happens that you bought that swimsuit last time

359
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,339
You haven 't worn it yet

360
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,420
That big backless

361
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,199
You said you put that on

362
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:32,660
I told you we should go to the hot springs

363
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,059
I 'm afraid someone will abduct you .

364
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,140
OK OK

365
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,540
I 'll be with you this weekend

366
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,300
Okay , don 't be angry

367
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,579
I really have to go .

368
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:41,640
Wait , wait for me

369
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,579
Walking

370
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,579
It 's too late

371
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,459
Kangqi

372
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,180
I still want to talk to you

373
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:54,020
I want to find a job

374
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:57,459
I promise I 'll talk for the last time

375
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:58,120
I finished chatting

376
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,020
Never again

377
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,540
Come well

378
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,660
Let me listen

379
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:05,900
You see

380
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,300
You said you would bring me to Hangzhou

381
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,380
Brought me to this place

382
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,439
A special new day

383
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,820
I believe it

384
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,360
But I feel a new day

385
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:26,600
It seems that you are the only one who sees it

386
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:29,080
I don 't see it

387
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,080
I do housework every day

388
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,600
Daily chores

389
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,799
I take care of you

390
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,880
Take Care of Susu

391
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,660
I 'm stuck

392
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,999
In these things

393
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,299
My world looks like

394
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,959
Our family is so big

395
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,180
I don 't see a new life

396
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:52,199
I don 't know what it looks like

397
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,259
I don 't know my

398
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,920
Where is self - worth

399
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,039
I 'd love to achieve it

400
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,439
But I can 't achieve it

401
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:08,439
My life is just you and Susu

402
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,439
especially you

403
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,219
Because you are me

404
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:14,759
Obtaining external information

405
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,039
All sources

406
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,400
I depend on you

407
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,759
My life is very monotonous

408
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,600
Very boring

409
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,199
Yesterday the day before yesterday and the day before yesterday

410
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,360
Exactly the same life

411
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,039
Nothing to hope for

412
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,160
I 'm breaking down

413
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,840
It 's really crashing

414
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,360
Kangqi

415
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,820
I 'm beginning to conscious

416
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,719
Unconsciously pleasing you

417
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,360
I started catering to you

418
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,479
I flattered you

419
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,600
But I don 't like me like that

420
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,439
I don 't like it at all

421
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:54,999
But I can 't help it

422
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,400
I don 't even know .

423
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,279
What is my meaning

424
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:08,820
I don 't even know my worth

425
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,320
Where should it be reflected

426
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,499
This is not what I want

427
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:14,959
That new life

428
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:15,840
Do you understand

429
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,199
Gu Kangqi

430
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,479
Possible

431
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,400
You don 't love me anymore

432
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,640
But I have to love myself

433
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:50,219
I have to love myself

434
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,420
I have to love myself

435
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,380
Give you a task

436
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:29,259
These invoices

437
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:30,739
Glue them all

438
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:31,660
Transfer to Finance

439
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,340
OK , no problem

440
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,039
Besides , I 'm at eleven o'clock

441
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,620
There is a meeting with the brand side

442
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,140
Is there anything I can do

443
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,499
Pour twenty cups of coffee

444
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,180
No problem

445
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,979
You need to rush by hand

446
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,299
Good hand rushing is fine

447
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,100
Page numbers are messed up .

448
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,620
Sister Ma , would you like a cup of coffee ?

449
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:12,860
Everyone who has tasted it says it is good

450
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,140
Xiao Su

451
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,039
Why are you making coffee now ?

452
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,380
You have to come in person

453
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:18,860
At least you used to be

454
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,259
Independent projects

455
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:23,140
The leader doesn 't like me .

456
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,299
It 's okay

457
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,680
I 'll treat it as a new experience

458
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,779
Live as an internship

459
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:30,180
It 's okay . Your attitude is quite good .

460
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,680
Sister

461
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,279
My project

462
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,340
I want to increase my budget

463
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,259
I have filled out the form

464
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:39,420
I 'll find you to stamp it later

465
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,219
Does it taste good

466
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
This cannot be approved

467
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:52,180
Why can 't it be approved

468
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,660
It 's not that I want to embarrass you .

469
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,100
What are you doing now

470
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,580
Working in Mr. Wang 's team

471
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,959
On this

472
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,560
It must be signed by Mr. Wang

473
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,580
I can only approve it .

474
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,400
Sister

475
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:02,739
Before this project

476
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,100
Mr. Qin has always led me to do it .

477
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,219
Now he 's gone

478
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,380
Please accommodate .

479
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,820
My project is particularly urgent

480
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,100
It will be filmed soon

481
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,939
Sister Ma

482
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,140
This trouble

483
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,279
Help me quickly approve it

484
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,140
Extremely anxious

485
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,039
All right

486
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:18,100
Thank you , Sister Ma

487
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:20,400
Sister You

488
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,499
Do you see it clearly

489
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:22,299
You signed it

490
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,759
She 's so anxious if she doesn 't say anything ?

491
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,499
As I said , I 'm very anxious .

492
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:26,860
You have to understand , too .

493
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,140
With your current situation in the company

494
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,180
You said if something goes wrong

495
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,039
I have to take the blame for you

496
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,840
There are old and young people here .

497
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,620
How dare I not be cautious

498
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,320
Eighty-seven

499
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,100
I haven 't got off work yet , my mother

500
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,279
Not

501
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,400
How do you walk

502
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,840
Silent

503
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,759
I 've been standing there for half a day .

504
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,199
Why are you so serious ?

505
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,539
You are blind

506
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:56,259
This is how I am

507
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,560
Is it like playing a game ?

508
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,239
So angry

509
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,060
Something must have happened

510
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:02,759
What to suffer

511
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,920
I don 't want to say anymore

512
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,759
I just recently found out

513
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,019
My popularity at the company

514
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,219
It 's worse than I thought

515
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:09,759
How utilitarian is that workplace

516
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,640
Go up and surrounded by good people

517
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,080
They should be happy now

518
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,680
It feels like beating a drowned dog .

519
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,199
You can 't keep thinking that .

520
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,959
Then you used to be with Lao Qin

521
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,039
Like a duck in water

522
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,880
More people are jealous of you

523
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,880
That eye looks

524
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,959
The new boss doesn 't like you

525
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,239
Why don 't you come here quickly and step more ?

526
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:28,160
I don 't understand you coming back either

527
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,560
Asking for trouble why

528
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,900
You also think I 'm in the company

529
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,860
With today 's achievement

530
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,979
Is it because of Qin Yuxuan

531
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,640
I 'm with you every day

532
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,560
Run content together

533
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,519
I don 't know how much you spell ?

534
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,920
But then again

535
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,019
If not

536
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,519
Lao Qin 's strong support

537
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,920
Our project is not possible either

538
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,920
Every time it goes so smoothly

539
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:47,680
Yes No

540
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,560
I heard you went to see me

541
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,439
What is it ?

542
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,120
Tongtong

543
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,279
I 'd like to add another shot

544
00:23:58,999 --> 00:23:59,920
Tong Tong

545
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:01,420
I remember she wasn 't

546
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,160
After successful matching

547
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,439
Is the shooting over ?

548
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:04,979
She

549
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,620
She 's relapsed now

550
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,719
Optimistically estimated for more than two months

551
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,959
That 's unfair

552
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:17,820
What a good child

553
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:19,100
Can you go

554
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,519
It must be possible

555
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,060
I heard you 're over there

556
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,039
Busy

557
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,439
I 'll definitely squeeze out this space for you

558
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,259
You are me in this company

559
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,959
The only friend

560
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:37,600
Mr. Wang

561
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:38,560
Come in

562
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,239
Please take a look at this

563
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:43,439
Can you sign it for me

564
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,959
What is this

565
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,560
This is what I 've been following for two years

566
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,320
One item

567
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,840
We need to increase the budget now

568
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,039
You signed it here

569
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,959
I can apply to the Finance Department

570
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,739
This is what you were before

571
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:53,840
Items in the group

572
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,719
Now you 're in our group

573
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,759
There are still  in our group

574
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,840
So many plans

575
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,719
Implementation cannot continue

576
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:00,900
You do this stuff

577
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,219
This is definitely not as good as those

578
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:04,900
Brand Customized Videos

579
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,999
More commercial value

580
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:08,479
But this thing you say

581
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:10,080
It is the history of our company

582
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,479
First time as a long video

583
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,759
Doing public welfare projects

584
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,999
As far as I know

585
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:14,799
Your project

586
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,880
Followed the film for two years

587
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:16,640
That should be

588
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,080
Accumulated a lot of materials

589
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,479
Just cut it out .

590
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:20,999
No additional funding is necessary

591
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:21,959
Continue shooting

592
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:22,519
Right

593
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,439
Wang is always like this

594
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,699
The boss is actually

595
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:27,080
Very supportive of this project

596
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,519
Boss Support

597
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,039
Why don 't you go find your boss ?

598
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,999
What are you looking for with me ?

599
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,239
You are my direct leader .

600
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,479
If I want to request a budget

601
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:36,479
I definitely have to find you .

602
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:37,120
Now that you know

603
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,360
I am your direct leader

604
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,320
If it 's good , you have to be obedient

605
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,560
I won 't let you do it

606
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,499
Don 't do it

607
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,959
Don 't have so much nonsense

608
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,360
Do you have a problem with me ?

609
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,799
Still have a problem with this project

610
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,779
Both

611
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,479
Then don 't you think

612
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:49,640
because of your personal likes and dislikes

613
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,080
Affect your judgment on your work

614
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,499
This behavior is very unprofessional

615
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,719
Gu Yunsu

616
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,840
Whether you are convinced or not

617
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,360
Since you still recognize me as a leader

618
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,600
Then stop talking nonsense

619
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,920
There are only two ways

620
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,799
Obey

621
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,439
Or leave

622
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,199
I 'll leave

623
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,320
Gu Yunsu , what do you mean ?

624
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,239
Gu Yunsu , what do you mean ?

625
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,080
You thought you were gone

626
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Our department is not good

627
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,600
Yes No

628
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,699
After I told you you were gone

629
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:11,100
Our department will be better

630
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,199
Listen up , everyone

631
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:13,239
Overtime this evening

632
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,039
Don 't go home

633
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,239
Mr. Wang

634
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,959
I really can 't work overtime today

635
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:17,840
I will ask for afternoon leave

636
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,880
I 'm going for a prenatal check - up

637
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,120
Did I approve it

638
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,239
The task I gave you

639
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,239
Is it done

640
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,479
You think you 're amazing when you 're pregnant

641
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:23,999
Yes No

642
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,979
You can get pregnant as long as you are a woman

643
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,380
Don 't be angry , Mr. Wang

644
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,759
I want to ask you something .

645
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:29,620
What happened

646
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,999
I went to the mountains last month , right ?

647
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:31,459
That 's right

648
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:32,880
Who do you think it 's none of your business

649
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,360
Which restaurant is there in the mountain area ?

650
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,560
Eating so much money

651
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,699
five thousand eight hundred ninety-four

652
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:37,340
How to eat

653
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,660
I don 't know about our company

654
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,959
There is such a good thing .

655
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:42,640
Let you  every month

656
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,759
Buy a luxury item

657
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,039
20,000 yuan

658
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:46,820
20,000 yuan

659
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:48,900
Let me tell you .

660
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,799
Take care of what should be taken care of

661
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:50,880
Don 't worry about things you shouldn 't worry about

662
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,600
What is your attitude

663
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:52,380
Give you a chance

664
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,920
Let you explain it

665
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,719
What is your attitude

666
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:54,600
Great leadership

667
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,340
They 're afraid of you

668
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:55,640
Because

669
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,759
They are old and young

670
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,880
Mortgage to raise children

671
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,459
I have enough to eat alone and the whole family will not be hungry

672
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:00,279
What am I afraid of you ?

673
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,799
And Sister Qin 's fake

674
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,739
You 'd better give her an approval

675
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:03,840
Otherwise , I will go to the labor arbitration office

676
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,799
I 'll sue you

677
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,439
If you violate the rules , it is illegal

678
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,959
You can work overtime if you want us to .

679
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,120
Did you pay for overtime ?

680
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,660
You threatened me , Gu Yunsu

681
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,680
You 're threatening me

682
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,519
Dear Colleagues

683
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,600
This person in the future

684
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,680
I ask you to go to the dinner room

685
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,519
It 's best not to go

686
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,999
We signed a labor contract

687
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,519
It 's not a deed of sale

688
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,820
You don 't have to talk to those people at the wine table

689
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,759
Accompanying drinks and laughing

690
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:21,660
Your invoices

691
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,880
I have taken pictures and sent them to my boss

692
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,959
You 'd better explain to him

693
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,499
But it is possible

694
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:25,519
You don 't need to explain

695
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,560
You are such a useless person

696
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,199
Stay in the company for such a long time

697
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,239
You 're not a boss 's relative

698
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,279
It doesn 't even make sense .

699
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,279
Gu Yunsu , you are slandering

700
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,519
You are completely defamatory

701
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,640
Do you know if you want to go ?

702
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,860
Page numbers are messed up

703
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,080
If it 's messy , it 's messy

704
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,719
You can 't reprint a copy , can you

705
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,439
You insist on letting me stay up late to sort it out for you

706
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,479
Are you perverted ?

707
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,120
This is all right

708
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,360
It 's no longer messy .

709
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,459
Gu Gu Yunsu

710
00:27:58,459 --> 00:27:59,860
I 'm your leader

711
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,140
Turn off your phone

712
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,699
Turn off your phone

713
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:03,279
Do not shoot

714
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:07,999
What do you mean by that ?

715
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,479
You sign the divorce agreement quickly

716
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,640
I 'm not talking about Wu Limei

717
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,100
Why are you messing with me ?

718
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,840
Your daughter doesn 't want it .

719
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,939
You divorced me

720
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,439
She doesn 't want me anymore

721
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,439
Do you like to sign it or not

722
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,640
I told you the court said

723
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,239
Automatic separation after one year of separation

724
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,239
Starting today

725
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,420
I won 't live in this home anymore

726
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,360
You you you

727
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,320
How old are you

728
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,360
You 're so naive you

729
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,259
You think you work outside

730
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:29,999
So easy to find

731
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,680
Do you think money is so easy to make ?

732
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:32,539
If money is easy to earn

733
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:33,840
I stay at home every day .

734
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,880
I 'm not going out either

735
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,039
Listen to me .

736
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,279
I 'm a little busy outside

737
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:38,920
I haven 't come back

738
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,199
But the money won 't come back

739
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:41,039
Why do we live without money

740
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:41,959
What to eat and drink

741
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,239
Start

742
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:43,959
You just don 't know

743
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,600
Society is so sinister , do you know ?

744
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,160
You 've been out of society for too long

745
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,900
You have no idea

746
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,400
How fierce is the competition outside

747
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:49,999
Did you know

748
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,920
Xing Wu Limei

749
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,820
You 're leaving today

750
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,699
I won 't stop you either

751
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,959
Go out for a walk , too

752
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:55,999
Think about my husband

753
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:56,640
Not outside either

754
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,400
So easy to find

755
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,959
Understand

756
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:03,080
Wu Limei , we 're not young , right ?

757
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,580
Can we

758
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,100
Don 't be so willful

759
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,719
How do you live if you go out now

760
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:07,239
Let me ask you

761
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,279
You 're wearing this

762
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,279
Contents of the box

763
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:09,779
Backpack

764
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,160
Which one I didn 't buy ?

765
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,539
What are you doing

766
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,640
I 'll give you my coat back

767
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,039
I owe the rest first

768
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,120
Get started , get started , get started , get started

769
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,299
Do you want me to get up ?

770
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:18,600
Jump from this

771
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,080
Have to go out

772
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,380
Where do you live when you leave ?

773
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,600
Do you have money ?

774
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:34,539
Stop flipping

775
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:35,759

Are you going out ?

00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:50,920
How many days will you stay ?

784
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,479
This dress is worth 500

785
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,160

00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,959
Do you think this room is OK

791
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,080

801
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:53,320

00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:29,840
Walk and sit

00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,120
Your daughter

00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:36,519

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,279

Woolf said

857
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:16,420
Life is like a tree

858
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,199
Leaves always land

859
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,100
But slowly falling down

860
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,180
But slowly falling down

861
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,999
The leaves were once carried by the wind

862
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Surrounded by light

863
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,799
Rotating

864
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,860
Flying

865
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,699

Will live a long , long life .

869
00:33:57,939 --> 00:33:58,739
Mom

870
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,299
You need to laugh a little more

871
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,939
You look pretty when you smile

872
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:07,739
When you find one

873
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,799
Handsome Dad

874
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:10,580
Then

875
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:13,699
If you still have a child

876
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,140
That 's me

877
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,039
I am

878
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,480
Look at your face

879
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,980
Remember  when the time comes

880
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,819
Tong Tong does not cry

881
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:22,000
Mom doesn 't cry

882
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,779
Happy Birthday

883
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,239
Happy Birthday

884
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,239
Happy Birthday

885
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,919
Happy Birthday

886
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:39,279
Uncle Chen

887
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,160
It 's not my birthday yet

888
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:44,560
You will be discharged from the hospital

889
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:46,960
Thinking

890
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,839
Celebrate your birthday early

891
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,759
Let uncles and aunts

892
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:53,180
Would you like a bite of your cake ?

893
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,560
Close your eyes and make a wish

894
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,640
I want to be like when I was a kid

895
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,600
Go surfing with my mother

896
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,279
OK

897
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:07,560
Mom takes you surfing

898
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:10,540
Come

899
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,919
Three Two One

Let 's take a picture together

903
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,339
Where 's Mom

904
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,379
Mom

905
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:36,719
Mom Mom

906
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,899
Mom is here

907
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:38,919
Mom is here

908
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:39,680
1

909
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,440
Let 's take another picture

910
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,040
Laugh a little happily , everyone

911
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,640
Tongtong , we love you

912
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,100
Tongtong 's departure

913
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,480
Telling many regrets of fate

914
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:06,620
But it also reminds me of love

915
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,739
Is the only meaning of life

916
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:12,460
Thank you for being there .

917
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,040
My short life

918
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,839
What about this film

919
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,640
That 's why I insist

920
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,040
Reasons for staying

921
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,040
It 's now done

922
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:49,759
I have no regrets either

923
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,580
Resignation Application

924
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:55,279
I 've handed it over to the personnel department

925
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,520
Work for this handover

926
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,759
The handover is completed .

927
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,279
Just before leaving

928
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,879
Still a little nervous

929
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:03,120
Because

930
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,660
Mr. Wang definitely won 't schedule the broadcast

931
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:07,879
But I think

932
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,819
Don 't worry

933
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,199
Give me this film

934
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:14,980
Although it doesn 't matter what I want to do

935
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,879
Content direction is inconsistent

936
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,919
But it touched me

937
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,379
I believe it will

938
00:37:22,379 --> 00:37:23,460
Impress more people

939
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,359
I will do my best

940
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:28,199
Let more people see it

941
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,279
Thank you

942
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:37,239
I really don 't plan to stay any longer

943
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:40,359
I 'm a little tired from doing it

944
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,080
I want to rest for a while

945
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,120
Working

946
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:45,799
Sometimes other than money

947
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,600
We should find something else

948
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,239
But other times

949
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:50,020
Money

950
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,339
That 's the whole point

951
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,299
Director Wu , my resume

952
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:54,719

960
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:22,919

It 's okay , you tell me

969
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,859
Then go back and think about it first

970
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,339
Come to me when you think about it .

971
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:00,919

00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,299
Nana Line

974
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,299
Then walk slowly

975
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,060
Come to me when you think about it .

976
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,859
All right , all right

977
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,540
I 'm a single mother

978
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,680
I have to feed myself

979
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,339
With my daughter

980
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,540
I want to do my best

981
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,859
Bring my daughter to me

982
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:02,779
Live with me

983
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,399
I have no way out

984
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,180
No way out is my specialty

985
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,339
My trait

986
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,319
My biggest strength

987
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:16,460
It 's also my disadvantage

988
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:30,500
Try it for you

989
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,799
Thank you

990
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,699
I 've listened to Wu Limei since I was a child

991
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:47,520
Talking about dreams

992
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,020
But later

993
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,859
She started talking about money

994
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,919
At that time , I always felt

995
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,160
It 's cheesy to talk about money

996
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,259
I learned later

997
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,480
That cheesiness is in the bowl

998
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,040
Add the confidence of an egg

999
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,899
She wants it too

1000
00:41:02,899 --> 00:41:04,600
Proof of living with me

1001
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:06,460
You can do it

1002
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:10,259
That year

1003
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,000
My mother is also twenty-eight years old

1004
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:16,000
Despite our choice

1005
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,940
Distinct

1006
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:19,259
But I can 't tell where it is

1007
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,000
We are just a little similar

1008
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,080
Probably because

1009
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,919
What we do about our lives

1010
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,279
Sure enough

1011
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,399
Doctor

1012
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:34,500
Am I pregnant or not ?

1013
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,739
None

1014
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:40,500
The road is still long

1015
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:44,060
Congratulations on the miss

1016
00:41:56,859 --> 00:41:57,859
The two of us

1017
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,419
That 's it

1018
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,980
Just

1019
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,640
That 's it

1020
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:15,620
Gu Yunsu

1021
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:20,040
Me

1022
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,640
I really like you

1023
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,299
I know

1024
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:27,299
You don 't have to like it in the future

1025
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,540
I

1026
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,960
My young talent

1027
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,640
I have a bright future

1028
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,879
I go to bigger cities

1029
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:40,080
There are better jobs

1030
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,060
After I arrived in Shanghai

1031
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,680
More and more beautiful girls

1032
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,440
Like me

1033
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,120
What about you

1034
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,839
Boss , you 're not young .

1035
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,440
You 're in ruins

1036
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,000
What else do I like about you ?

1037
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,359
I 'm in trouble

1038
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,879
You 're right

1039
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:57,719
It 's your lips this time .

1040
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:58,960
No longer falling behind

1041
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,160
I bluffed

1042
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,859
I understand

1043
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,279
Before I

1044
00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:15,960
It 's always bluffing

1045
00:43:28,259 --> 00:43:29,060
I can 't figure it out

1046
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,160
What do you think we

1047
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,060
We have come to this point

1048
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:45,060
Probably because

1049
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,259
That little love between us

1050
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:48,799
It 's not enough .

1051
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:50,580
It 's enough in Hangzhou

1052
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:52,520
It 's not enough to go to Shanghai

1053
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,140
Yes

1054
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,279
Not enough

1055
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,359
Although

1056
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,040
Hangzhou is not far from Shanghai

1057
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,319
But I arrived in Shanghai

1058
00:44:05,799 --> 00:44:07,000
You are all I have .

1059
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,120
Just a little bit

1060
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:21,040
Almost

1061
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,440
The time for my move is set

1062
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,440
Next Monday

1063
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:38,859
I drive with the moving company

1064
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:39,520
Go Together

1065
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,520
OK

1066
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,080
What about the house ? It 's due next week

1067
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:45,899
Do you think I want it ?

1068
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,759
Help you renew your lease for a period of time

1069
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:48,839
No No No No

1070
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:50,480
No , really no

1071
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:55,839
What are you going to do ?

1072
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,219
I 'll leave now

1073
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,279
What about you

1074
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,359
Both people and money are completely empty

1075
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,460
Don 't talk about lovelorn and unemployment

1076
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,359
And without me as a free landlord

1077
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:12,520
Private vehicle

1078
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,160
Long - term meal card

1079
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,759
I 'm really worried that you can 't think about it .

1080
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,640
Do something extreme

1081
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,399
I decided

1082
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,140
I 'm going home to my mom

1083
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,899
Didn 't you two just finish your fight ?
