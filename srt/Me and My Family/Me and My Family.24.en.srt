00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,660
Zaizai

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,740
What 's wrong with you

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,840
Let 's not eat this , okay ?

I 'm going down

7
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,800
What to eat

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,699
I 'm looking for Mom

00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,859

Are you from this community ?

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,460
Yeah

17
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:44,619
There is one thing I want to do

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,180
Please help me

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,579
I 'm going to find my mother

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,299
Is it comfortable

21
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:54,460
Smile

22
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:59,920
Grandma , you 're amazing

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,539
Why does the child come into your hands

24
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:02,820
I won 't cry anymore

25
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,000
Teach me quickly

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,500
No No

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,539
I 'm still two or three weeks away .

28
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:07,380
Maybe I am .

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,700
Very pleasant

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,180
The kids don 't cry when they see me

31
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,579
This is a bit hard to learn

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,020
That 's amazing

33
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:15,100
Let me tell you

34
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,759
Home is Workplace

35
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,039
We stay - at - home moms

36
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,699
Who doesn 't have two brushes yet

37
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,399
Yes Yes Yes

38
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:22,259
Seven times 24 hours a day

39
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,399
Professional needs to be strong

40
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:24,460
You can 't be lazy .

41
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,100
Yeah , let me tell you

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,499
Husband equals leader

43
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:28,779
My mother - in - law is a colleague

44
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:30,740
Children are project achievements

45
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,259
You said if you wanted luck

46
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,020
The company is thriving .

47
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,380
This is bad luck .

48
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,839
It 's just a fight .

49
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,419
You have suffered .

50
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:39,940
But

51
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,440
What about us

52
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,580
I 'm lucky .

53
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,039
Right

54
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,119
Look at those

55
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:43,979
Dual - income families

56
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,039
They simply

57
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,100
No such condition

58
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,520
Able to take care of children at home

59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,339
That is

60
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:49,619
Think more of the best .

61
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,399
But to be honest

62
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:52,539
This is full - time

63
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,160
You may not have a good life .

64
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:55,259
When I was young

65
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,940
I 've been at home for more than ten years .

66
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,059
Quite a failure

67
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,139
What happened to you ?

68
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,339
My husband has two hearts

69
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
Did your in - laws treat you badly

70
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:07,259
Every family has a difficult scripture

71
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,100
Right

72
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,979
It 's inconvenient not to talk about it .

73
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,580
Thank you so much for today

74
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,759
Eat more , eat more

75
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,139
Thank you thank you

76
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,059
Thank you very much , thank you

77
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,160
You 're so nice

78
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,319
My guy still thinks of me

79
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,040
Don 't clean up the yellow - faced woman

80
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,220
How can I care ?

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,139
Originally

82
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,100
He was the one who kept me at home full time .

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,240
Right now , I 'm not working .

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,040
No revenue

85
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,559
I don 't understand him yet

86
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,079
Traveling abroad with hard work

87
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,559
This day with your palm up

88
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,420
It 's not a taste .

89
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,340
Can you reflect the above ?

90
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,100
Let the above consider it again

91
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:10,980
I promise

92
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,300
Overcome all difficulties and obstacles

93
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,240
I 'm leading everyone in this quarter

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,879
Guarantee achievement of performance indicators

95
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:18,939
Jianxiong

96
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,959
Performance of abolished staff

97
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,160
It is also your performance indicator

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,300
Although

99
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
You are a formally compiled old man

100
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,480
But lately

101
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
It really delayed a lot of work

102
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:31,800
The leader above

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,759
I 'm not satisfied with your performance either

104
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,540
Your

105
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,400
Job Transfer

106
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:38,040
It 's not that I haven 't considered it

107
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,079
I 'm trying to protect

108
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,879
I have to give it to you again

109
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,959
A chance to re - prove yourself

110
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,720
I am

111
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,160
You know those subordinates they

112
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,319
In fact , it is also Jianxiong

113
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,519
Know how to choose

114
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,559
What are you doing this this

115
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,160
What time is it and still not sleeping

116
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:30,780
Who is an elderly mother ?

117
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,920
Troubling yourself like this

118
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Hurry , hurry , hurry

119
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,220
Come , come , come , get up , get up , get up

120
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,540
When he lay down

121
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,280
Everyone is quiet

122
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,280
Come in

123
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,160
Master , please ask me

124
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,879
Please sit down , please sit down

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,600
Sledgehammer

126
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:39,720
I came to see you today

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,300
I want to

128
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,079
Master

129
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,499
I 'm getting word out there .

130
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,639
The unit is to be trimmed

131
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,180
We contract workers

132
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,780
That 's why

133
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,780
It 's me

134
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,300
Master

135
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,459
I 've been here for seven years .

136
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,720
Since I came

137
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,939
I 'll follow you

138
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,280
In my heart

139
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,300
Then you are my master

140
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,600
Being a man and doing things

141
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:20,619
You taught me step by step

142
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,059
Master , I can 't bear it .

143
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,740
I don 't tell you the truth

144
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,939
Since beating my wife

145
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:31,900
After giving birth

146
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,420
Never worked again

147
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,420
Our family is big and small

148
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,680
All expenses inside and out

149
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,020
It depends on my salary

150
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,579
If I don 't have another job

151
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,859
Our family has to be separated .

152
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,500
I understand your situation .

153
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,760
But then again

154
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:03,000
Companies also have their difficulties

155
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:06,439
I understand that too

156
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:10,040
You are also under pressure

157
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,640
It 's not easy for you either

158
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,920
Can you call me over

159
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:14,959
Indicate that you have already

160
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,160
Apply for me

161
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,680
It 's okay , Master

162
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,479
In my heart

163
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,180
You will always be my master

164
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,520
Even if I 'm not here

165
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,500
I celebrate the holidays

166
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,140
I will definitely go see your master

167
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,800
Thank you , Master

168
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:37,520
Zaizai is asleep

169
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,400
Sleeping

170
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,579
I 'll take a shower .

171
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:42,359
Sweating

172
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,359
No , no , no , no

173
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,079
Come , come , come , come

174
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,719
Talk

175
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,579
Why came back so late

176
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:57,239
This

177
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,880
Unit This

178
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:01,800
Just under

179
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,479
You want to talk to me about something

180
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,719
I

181
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,059
What are you talking about ?

182
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,280
So much sweat

183
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,760
Just walk and talk

184
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,079
Chatting makes my legs weak

185
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,479
I want to ask .

186
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,300
In your organization

187
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,040
Is there something going on

188
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,920
Why don 't you tell me ?

189
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,160
It 's okay , Mei Mei

190
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,900
Things in the company

191
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,400
I 'll take care of it

192
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,439
One cub

193
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:34,959
A baby in a belly

194
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,439
That 's enough for you .

195
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,739
There is no need for you to

196
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,000
Follow this heart .

197
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:40,819
Not

198
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,540
I really need to take a shower

199
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:43,239
Uncomfortable

200
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,479
Mei Mei

201
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,739
There are too many things happening at work recently

202
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,400
That leave is really hard to ask for

203
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,479
So what about bringing Zai Zai ?

204
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,239
I can 't really help

205
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,979
I 'm very anxious

206
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:15,160
It 's okay . Don 't worry .

207
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,120
We are here

208
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,819
When you are sick

209
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:20,520
I asked a lot of leave .

210
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,079
Is it time to take less time off

211
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,699
Thank you for your hard work and Susu

212
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:26,040
Our own children

213
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,459
Don 't be welcome if you are afraid of anything .

214
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,260
Alright , Mei Mei

215
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:31,040
I was just thinking

216
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,439
Not

217
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:32,959
I said you should go to bed early

218
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,219
There will be a prenatal check - up tomorrow morning

219
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,620
You have to take your baby when you come back

220
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,420
That 's enough to tire you .

221
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,140
Forget it

222
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:41,260
It 's fine

223
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,500
Thanks for your hard work .

224
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:46,180
I

225
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,859
I can 't help it either

226
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:48,680
You can 't talk about me either

227
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,000
It doesn 't hurt when you speak while standing

228
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,339
I know everyone

229
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:07,300
I heard it recently

230
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,339
Some news .

231
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:10,660
The company requires

232
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,579
Dismissal of contract workers

233
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:16,760
Gather everyone today

234
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,699
I actually wanted to give it to everyone

235
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:19,979
Take a reassurance

236
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,739
This rumor

237
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,500
It 's true

238
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:26,959
I 'm here

239
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,199
Let me express my opinion to everyone

240
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,300
I don 't care about other groups

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,819
In our group

242
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,979
I don 't want to cut any of them

243
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:37,300
Of course

244
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,540
I 'm just a

245
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,699
Small middle layer

246
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:42,020
People speak quietly

247
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,040
But there is a chance

248
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,059
I don 't want to give up .

249
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,900
So I 'm here now

250
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,500
also drafted a

251
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,459
Performance Pay Scheme

252
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,020
Above Salary

253
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,979
You may be wronged a little

254
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:03,260
That is , we must survive first

255
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:04,859
After surviving

256
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:05,839
Let 's go slowly

257
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,040
Improving quality of life

258
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,020
That

259
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,300
Let 's go through it first

260
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:12,699
Thank you , Boss

261
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,920
If

262
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:15,439
If you don 't have any comments

263
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,859
You just sign it

264
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,319
I can hold this .

265
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:19,380
Contact with leaders

266
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:21,459
No No

267
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:22,979
Thank you , Master

268
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,420
Thank you , leader

269
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,140
That day Wu Liju

270
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,380
Call and say

271
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:34,059
That brother - in - law 's illness .

272
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:35,180
Much better now

273
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:37,559
She said she was going to take Zai Zai in two days .

274
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,620
I took it back .

275
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:42,859
Zaizai is going back to find Grandma .

276
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,099
OK OK

277
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,479
Zaizai

278
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,059
You 're going back to see Grandma

279
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:48,020
Are you happy ?

280
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:49,339
I 'm very happy .

281
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:51,979
Uncle

282
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:52,839
I think we should

283
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:53,939
Open a bottle of wine to celebrate

284
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,939
OK OK

285
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:57,380
Li Jianxiong , sit down

286
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:00,180
Why

287
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,199
A little happy

288
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,559
It 's too ruthless

289
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,300
I 'm here .

290
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,719
Been here for so many days

291
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:05,979
I think

292
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:07,020
If Zaizai goes

293
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,459
The house will be quiet for a while

294
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,199
I 'm gonna feel hard .

295
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:10,599
It 's fine

296
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,839
Let him come to play with you often

297
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,260
Zaizai

298
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:16,219
Zaizai

299
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,979
If you leave

300
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:19,339
Aunt will miss you .

301
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:21,900
What 's wrong

302
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,520
What 's wrong ? How does Zaizai feel ?

303
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,099
I feel a little wronged .

304
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,739
He brought me food .

305
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,459
Is it good to eat Susu

306
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:47,059
Delicious

307
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,040
It 's delicious

308
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,839
Raised high

309
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:51,359
Flying

310
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:53,000
Susu , you 're flying

311
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,599
I hope

312
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,140
Mom , Dad and Me

313
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,120
Together Forever

314
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:07,479
Mom

315
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,559
Mom , don 't go

316
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,959
Mom

317
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,120
Susu

318
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,359
Mom will come back to see you later

319
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,300
Mom doesn 't want me anymore

320
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,620
Inseparable

321
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,239
Never leave

322
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,540
Inseparable

323
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,040
Make it clear to your father

324
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,900
You tell the truth

325
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:34,479
After that , mom will take you away

326
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,839
Is it Mom

327
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,020
If you go to the street to beg for food

328
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,800
You 'll follow me too

329
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,319
Who are you with ? Your last name is Gu

330
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,059
You have to be with me

331
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:42,079
Don 't be afraid . You 've thought it out .

332
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,280
Susu , please think about it .

333
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,459
Wake up quickly

334
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:45,280
What are you thinking

335
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,040
You have to be with me

336
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,979
Think about it after you think about it

337
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:50,180
Susu , sober up

338
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,180
Gu Yunsu

339
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,779
Don 't fear

340
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,239
Don 't blame yourself

341
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
None of this is your fault

342
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,180
You have to believe

343
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,820
Mom and Dad will always love you

344
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:54,680
Don 't be afraid

345
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,259
Zaizai

346
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,219
I 'll give you a formal

347
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,539
Tell me about myself

348
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,600
I 'm your big aunt

349
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,920
That 's your mother 's sister

350
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,820
We all like you very much

351
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,499
Your mother often sends me messages

352
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,340
Said she missed you very much

353
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,719
Actually , when I was a kid

354
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,939
I can 't figure it out .

355
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,979
Why the people I love

356
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:35,560
Not daily

357
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,019
Everyone is by my side

358
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,380
But I actually understand now

359
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,580
Adults

360
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:46,060
There are many involuntary things

361
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,580
Not with you

362
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,219
Doesn 't mean Mom and Dad don 't love you

363
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,539
Everyone loves you very much

364
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,299
Because of Zaizai

365
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,759
It 's the world I 've seen

366
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:01,499
The cutest and cutest child

367
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,219
We love you

368
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:06,160
Because you are you

369
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,959
No need to take snacks

370
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,239
To please us

371
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:11,959
Unwanted

372
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,600
Don 't be afraid of making mistakes .

373
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,979
You 're not wrong

374
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,279
Even if you do it wrong

375
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,519
And no one will blame you .

376
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,039
These days

377
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,560
I 'm really giving you trouble .

378
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,420
Thanks for your hard work , Jianxiong

379
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:45,600
None

380
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,039
This family doesn 't speak two languages

381
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,580
Yes

382
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,640
What 's wrong

383
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,880
Just look for me .

384
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,680
Don 't be too tired yourself .

385
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,759
Although you can do it

386
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,600
Don 't be too tired .

387
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,160
We 're old enough , right ?

388
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,279
You still worry about me here

389
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,180
Look at you

390
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,239
Get it done

391
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,080
No problem , don 't worry

392
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,939
This cub

393
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:05,019
It 's really cute

394
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,459
You see , he 's here with us

395
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:07,519
Stayed for two weeks

396
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,039
Children in this yard

397
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,739
They all like him

398
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,840
Yes

399
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,580
You say we are leaving now

400
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,160
I 'm a little reluctant to part with it

401
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,779
What are you doing ?

402
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,739
Susu

403
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,880
Why didn 't Zaizaizai come ?

404
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:19,600
Playing

405
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,640
Having a good time

406
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,400
You don 't want to leave .

407
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,199
That is

408
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,400
Aunt

409
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,620
I sent a

410
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,880
That manual is for you

411
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,279
How to make Zai Zai laugh

412
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:29,920
During this time

413
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,439
Our family also summarized

414
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,979
Some Little Experiences and Small Methods

415
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:34,860
This is all Susu She

416
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,459
No No

417
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:37,160
Su Su is just good .

418
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,400
He 's always the most considerate , right ?

419
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,199
Aunt , please say something more .

420
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,400
In the future

421
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,479
Don 't argue with your mother

422
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:46,039
Don 't worry , Aunt

423
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,439
We don 't have to argue now

424
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,439
We 're done with everything we should argue .

425
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,439
There 's nothing to argue about

426
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,279
That line that line

427
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,219
Then I 'm relieved

428
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,680
I 'll bring him over .

429
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,199
Right , call Zaizai over .

430
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,140
Let 's go , let 's go , Zai Zai

431
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,820
Anyway , then

432
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,539
Just call us anytime

433
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:58,779
Zaizai is home

434
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,860
Go back to see my parents , Zaizai

435
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,160
Hurry , hurry , hurry

436
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,880
Aunt Zaizai is very thoughtful

437
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,999
Know more

438
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:11,239
Mom and Dad are not around

439
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,779
Causes insecurity

440
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,279
I always feel like I

441
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,959
You will be abandoned by your adults at any time

442
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,019
Every time he is timid

443
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,799
When you take the initiative to please an adult

444
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,180
It 's insecurity

445
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,219
When causing trouble

446
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:28,979
Zaizai

447
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:32,120
Grandma is sorry for you

448
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,100
Grandma misses you .

449
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,060
Go

450
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,439
We 're going home

451
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,759
OK

452
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:08,580
Come

453
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:14,840
You see

454
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:17,299
As soon as Zaizai leaves

455
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:19,219
This house is quiet for a while .

456
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,100
I 'm not used to it .

457
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,180
Li Jianxiong

458
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,019
When Zaizai came

459
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:31,100
Although it 's not particularly large .

460
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:32,680
But during this time

461
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,739
I thought about it

462
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,140
I decide .

463
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,519
After giving birth

464
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,739
I still have to find a job

465
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:40,499
Mei Mei

466
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,620
I 'm worried

467
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,499
Look at your age after all

468
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,820
After the child is born

469
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,900
Definite recovery time

470
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,939
Longer

471
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,779
I have to take care of children in the future

472
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,459
Then go back to work

473
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:52,140
Will that be

474
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,459
This body can 't handle it

475
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,219
I pick easy work

476
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:57,900
It doesn 't matter how much salary is

477
00:23:58,219 --> 00:23:58,999
I mainly

478
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:00,219
Can 't derail from society

479
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,880
I remember the last time

480
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:04,900
That you learned from

481
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,299
When the publisher resigns

482
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,100
You said

483
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:09,739
Husband and Child

484
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:10,939
A good thing

485
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:11,779
Right

486
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,699
Then this time and that time

487
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:15,739
I figured it out now

488
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:16,779
This is not a taste

489
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,259
What a bad taste ?

490
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,820
You , you , you , talk about me , me

491
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,180
Let me help you analyze it

492
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,039
Everything is not a taste

493
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,479
Emotionally

494
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:28,279
In life and interpersonal relationships

495
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,880
Where Where

496
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,160
Everyone feels bad

497
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,719
And they said it

498
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,999
A lot of men

499
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:35,080
This wife is pregnant

500
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,160
He cheated

501
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,420
Find a mistress

502
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:38,999
Odds are very high

503
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,199
Mei Mei , how dare I ?

504
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,039
And look at me

505
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,560
What age am I ?

506
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,160
You

507
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,580
The tender grass is not too old for the cow

508
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,499
Too much .

509
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,600
And I 'll tell you something

510
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,640
Terrible Things

511
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,400
I had a nightmare last night

512
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,880
I dreamed of a tulip

513
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,479
It floated to our house

514
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,840
That floats to the living room

515
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,039
Floating to the study

516
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,080
Storage room

517
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,160
It floats everywhere

518
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,820
Then this window door is

519
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,840
Open

520
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,279
And then you 're gone

521
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,680
How scary it is

522
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,420
So they said

523
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,039
Becoming a housewife

524
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,120
is the easiest

525
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,519
A way to beat a chicken and an egg

526
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,799
Is it scary ?

527
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,779
You , you drink some water

528
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,719
I don 't want water

529
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,719
I drink less water at night

530
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Eye swelling easily

531
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,239
I 'm afraid you 're thirsty , you

532
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,979
Li Jianxiong

533
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,459
Are you going out

534
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:24,959
Recently

535
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,100
Not always busy

536
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,120
Sledgehammer 's contract renewal ?

537
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,219
I made an appointment with a client in the evening

538
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,120
Have a meal together

539
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,279
Offset Results

540
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,560
Then you are not allowed to bring any gifts

541
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,400
Something

542
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:35,160
No

543
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,759
They are all old customers and acquaintances

544
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,799
Isn 't that asking for help ?

545
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,840
Why don 't you give me a gift ?

546
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,400
Mei Mei

547
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,039
Actually , the most important thing right now

548
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,920
You helped me choose a set

549
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,840
Appropriate clothes

550
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,880
I just want it

551
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,860
It should be a little tight .

552
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,279
To show off your figure

553
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:53,160
Then what about this activity ?

554
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,719
Where are you going to eat ?

555
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,479
Washington Family

556
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,900
Go to Washington

557
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,759
Have a meal

558
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,560
You need to move conveniently

559
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,320
This is the dress code

560
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,160
Is it so high

561
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
You don 't know , Mei Mei

562
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,719
Nowadays , middle - aged men meet each other

563
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,920
Comparing with each other

564
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,759
Look , Mei Mei

565
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,680
My current figure

566
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,560
It 's still fine .

567
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,699
There is no stomach either

568
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,699
He 's quite straight , too .

569
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:16,199
Not bad Not bad

570
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,640
This is because Mei Mei took good care of it .

571
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,120
I want this in front of them

572
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,999
Offensive

573
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,160
There 's also a wine table entertainment .

574
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,779
Doesn 't that fly up and down ?

575
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:26,120
Want

576
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,180
It 's scary to fly up and down

577
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,039
All right

578
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:29,880
This

579
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,580
This This

580
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,539
Is this dress

581
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:32,999
Suitable for flying up and down

582
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,259
This is quite tight .

583
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,759
Jeans then

584
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:37,999
Look younger , right ?

585
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,640
Don 't you refuse to accept old age ? Come on

586
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,199
Meimei has a good eye

587
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,860
I 'll look in the mirror .

588
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,239
Mei Mei

589
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:51,799
Your number

590
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:52,360
That he did

591
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,539
They rushed me

592
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,519
Let me see

593
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,499
Mom

594
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:03,340
Uncle Li doesn 't come back for dinner today

595
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:05,739
What 's going on with him lately

596
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,939
What are you doing ?

597
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,499
Is it not the end of the year ?

598
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
The company is busy

599
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,680
All kinds of entertainment and so on

600
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,299
You see how busy he was before

601
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:15,439
Will cook for you too

602
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:18,120
What 's going on recently

603
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,400
I saw him today

604
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,219
It seems to be there

605
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,080
Scratching your own hair

606
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,479
Whatever you mean

607
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,320
What do you want to say

608
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
You just say it

609
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,120
No No No

610
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,039
Are you overworried ?

611
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,279
I just said it casually

612
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,199
I 'm curious

613
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:29,959
I think he has recently

614
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:30,999
There is a little change

615
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:31,719
You know that

616
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,719
Do you want to eat Sichuan food

617
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,039
OK

618
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,160
Let 's stop cooking

619
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:43,600
Line

620
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,900
It happens that my cooking is not delicious .

621
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,680
Which restaurant to eat

622
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,799
Washington Family

623
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:52,860
You two

624
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,120
Did I hear it wrong ?

625
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,279
Or

Is there any private room reserved by Mr. Li

632
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,479
Sorry , no

633
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,560
Does this store have a chain store

634
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,299
We are the only one in Hangzhou

635
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:11,999
Ms.

636
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,959
Then this is the place

637
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,439
Why don 't you see this

638
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:18,120
Go to the rest area for a rest first

639
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,999

Thank you .

644
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,840

Wait here

646
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,239
Don 't answer the phone

647
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,120
I think Uncle Li may be busy

648
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,039
I didn 't look at my phone

649
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:43,719
Mom

650
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,120
Is there anything in his game

651
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,999
Someone you know

652
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:46,620
You can give them

653
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,420
Make a phone call

654
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:49,719
Mom , are you hungry ?

655
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,600
This twist is delicious

656
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,199
Don 't eat , don 't eat

657
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,439
You can 't be hungry

658
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:55,680
Hi

659
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,060
Sledgehammer

660
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,360
Hello Hello

661
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,060
I am Wu Limei

662
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:03,580
Sledgehammer just told me

663
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,999
Said he led them .

664
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:05,959
Hit the table

665
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:06,759
Why

666
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:08,360
For a contract worker

667
00:30:08,939 --> 00:30:09,680
Results

668
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,479
One is missing

669
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,900
Results of salary reduction and level adjustment

670
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,759
You said he was such a big thing

671
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,680
Why didn 't you tell me ?

672
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,439
Uncle Li is a good person .

673
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,799
He has a soft heart

674
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:21,519
He won 't do it

675
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,600
He felt uncomfortable .

676
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,019
But he 's afraid he told you .

677
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,199
You feel uncomfortable .

678
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:25,739
Right

679
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,080
Then you talk about dinner

680
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,439
Why won 't he tell me the truth

681
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,080
He told me the truth what happened

682
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,199
Check him out for me

683
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:38,279
How can I find him ?

684
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,519
We are the same account

685
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:42,759
Farewell

686
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:43,979
I think between you two

687
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:44,880
Focus on one trust

688
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,140
What trust to trust

689
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:46,880
I trust him

690
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,080
Does he trust me

691
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,600
If he trusts me

692
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,999
Why did he lie to me

693
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,039
Come , give it to me

694
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:54,279
You 're right

695
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,219
Location

696
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,320
He 's here

697
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:04,279
What is this place

698
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,239
Here

699
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,680
A building

700
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,080
Will you go

701
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,479
Take a look

702
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,140
Go

703
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,680
Don 't think wildly .

704
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,080
It 's a commercial building

705
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:18,959
I 'm sorry , Master

706
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,259
Let me change that position .

707
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:20,920
Change address , right ?

708
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,279
Yes Yes Yes

709
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,560
Let me change my address

710
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,039
OK

711
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:27,920
Moved

712
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,039
Move , move , move , mom

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,600
Moved

714
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,239
Gone

715
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,680
Where did you go

716
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,100
Let me take a look .

717
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,920
This is the direction

718
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,880
Maybe he went home

719
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,719
What 's wrong

720
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,999
Go back

721
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:46,039
I 'm sorry , Master

722
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,039
Don 't change Don 't change

723
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,340
Yes , it 's just the same

724
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,439
That address ?

725
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,680
Li Yan

726
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,120
Did you have enough food at school ?

727
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,640
Would you like to eat more ?

728
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,519
Don 't eat

729
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,320
Where have you been ?

730
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,100
The phone is not answered

731
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,600
Do not startle the snake

732
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,400
Didn 't you answer the phone either ?

733
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,660
I 'm sorry , Mei Mei

734
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,420
Me I talk to clients

735
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,680
I forgot to look at my phone

736
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:17,959
Have you eaten this meal ?

737
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,439
I 've eaten

738
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,680
I didn 't eat enough , Uncle

739
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,799

740
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:24,799

Thank you Uncle Li Yan

743
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,979
You should eat a little too

744
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:29,719
Don 't eat

745
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,560
Li Yan is back

746
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,519
Why

747
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,039
Staring makes people panic

748
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,999
How do you know I 'm watching you

749
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,279
I saw it all

750
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,799
Visual ability of normal people

751
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,640
That 's it

752
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,120
I want to ask you .

753
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,100
You said this man

754
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,600
Is he in his genes

755
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,779
Everyone takes that

756
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,199
Elements of nature to lie

757
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,360
Lying is innate

758
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,239
It 's not just for men

759
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,239
Women also

760
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:06,239
You 're right

761
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,759
You said if it was now

762
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,160
I want to know a person 's behavior

763
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,279
Is he bad or not

764
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,600
And then I happened to

765
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,519
I have a chance

766
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,039
You can look through his mobile phone

767
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400

768
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:22,699
I look like

769
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:24,239
The kind of experienced person ?

770
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,400
Also

771
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,779

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,380
This is fine

782
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,299
Do you know this person

783
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,699
What about this

784
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:51,199
I don 't know this

785
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,279
Look at this

786
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,840
Going to see her on Monday

787
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,640
And asked her to change her avatar

788
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,799
I 'll check out other software

789
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,080
Let me look at Meituan Takeaway

790
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,420
Yes Yes Yes

791
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,580
Take a look at his takeaway

792
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,880
This is not our home address

793
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:17,160
You see

794
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,980
Tulip

795
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,960
That 's right

796
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,540
Tomorrow is Monday , right ?

797
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:24,879
What 's going on

798
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,060
Past Point

799
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,180
What are you doing

800
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:49,060
Go together

801
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,899
Bad road

802
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,520
Shun

803
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,379
How do you know the way ?

804
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,259
I know

805
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,040
He 's my dad

806
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,819
I have to figure it out

807
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:02,779
Wear it

808
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:05,779
Have you watched too many TV series ?

809
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,739
My dad used to be a cop

810
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,339
Okay , then you can wear this

811
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,379
Right for you

812
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,339
I don 't wear this

813
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,680
Who is it ?

814
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:38,680
It 's Li Jianxiong

815
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,040
Wait a moment

816
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,080
Coming

817
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:50,859
Coming

818
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,719
What should I bring ?

819
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,500
Mom

820
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,040
Li Yan

821
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,520
Why are you here ?

822
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,399
I have something to do with your father

823
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,960
Why are you dressed like this ?

824
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:07,399
What the hell are you doing

825
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,160
Gu Yunsu dressed me up

826
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,180
She 's here too .

827
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,299
Gu Yunsu

828
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,319
Mom

829
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,640
Mom

830
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:35,919
Mei Mei

831
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,239
Mei Mei

832
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:37,859
Mei

833
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,640
Mei Mei

834
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,080
Mei Mei

835
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:46,739
Mei

836
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,239
You and your mother

837
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,379
Runaway from home

838
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,279
Room Service

839
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,440
Hello Room Service

840
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:23,719
Not required

841
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,660
You 're angry with Uncle Li

842
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,879
It 's not like you 're mad at me

843
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,020
Why didn 't you tell me ?

844
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,000
Where do you live

845
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,520
Didn 't I tell you

846
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,719
How else did you get here

847
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,560
Did you betray me

848
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,399
Oh my god

849
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,000
Come , come , come , come

850
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,779
Fried rice cake with green vegetables for you

851
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,140
Oh my god

852
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,359
Oh my god

853
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:55,940
Wu Limei , leave us

854
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,580
How are you doing this ?

855
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,600
That 's great .

856
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,020
I 've never seen it in my life

857
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,000
Such a big room

858
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,660
We also got red wine .

859
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,859
I forgot I was pregnant

860
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,259
I can 't smell it yet

861
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,180
Mom , I 'll tell you the truth

862
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:10,560
You are like this

863
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,980
A little bit of that

864
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:13,580
Adolescent rebellious girl

865
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,199
That 's exciting

866
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:15,379
Yeah

867
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:17,359
Where is my Uncle Li about this ?

868
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,779
It 's a little confused

869
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,540
But this is not the case .

870
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,699
Every ex - husband and ex - wife with children

871
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:23,399
Inevitable

872
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:24,600
Contact and call

873
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,440
We met .

874
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,580
Aren 't you the same as my father ?

875
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,140
If Uncle Li is really angry ,

876
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,180
That 's not running away from home .

877
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,339
It 's time for him to go up the mountain and shave his hair

878
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,140
You can 't just let state officials set fire

879
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,319
People are not allowed to light the lamp

880
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,299
I am open and open

881
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:35,660
I have a clear conscience , okay

882
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:37,160
He doesn 't say a word of truth .

883
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:38,640
Live without telling the truth

884
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,739
What 's your life ?

885
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:41,219
The days are beyond .

886
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,140
This childhood nightmare is back

887
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,640
Then let me make a statement first

888
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,199
Mom

889
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:46,500
You and I

890
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:48,680
Mom , you and me

891
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,899
What are you doing ?

892
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:51,699
It has something to do with you .

893
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:54,160
Either I just think

894
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,060
Uncle Li , he definitely didn 't mean it .

895
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:56,699
He

896
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,680
He just doesn 't know

897
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,699
How should I explain it to you

898
00:38:58,699 --> 00:38:59,680
He 's a little afraid of you

899
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,540
I understand

900
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:01,600
Gu Yunsu

901
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,580
You 're here today to be a lobbyist

902
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:05,399
No

903
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:06,680
Not useful either

904
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,339
I did come to be a sleeper .

905
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:09,560
I really want to sleep here tonight

906
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:11,199
I couldn 't walk when I came in

907
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,960
Mom , I 'll accompany you tonight

908
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,600
No No

909
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,540
Don 't bother .

910
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
I want to be alone now

911
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:17,759
I want to be with Jing Jing .

912
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:18,779
This room is so big

913
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:19,819
You live alone , right ?

914
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:21,040
This is a waste

915
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,080
Three thousand , right ?

916
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:23,899
Six thousand

917
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,259
How many

918
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,379
What happened to 6,000 ?

919
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,759
Six thousand and one night

920
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:29,040
Come here

921
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,960
You 're crazy

922
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,899
You can 't live .

923
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,460
Six thousand dollars for you

924
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,040
You stay calm down all night

925
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,520
You wouldn 't have spent so much money

926
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,219
What 's wrong

927
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,819
I 'm not good .

928
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:41,440
You still make me think about saving money

929
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,859
I want a moment , but I don 't want a lifetime

930
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:44,620
Can 't I

931
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,020
Okay , okay , don 't be angry

932
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,500
You sit

933
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:48,660
I don 't want you to spend money

934
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,859
Six thousand

935
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,759
What 's wrong

936
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:52,919
You haven 't seen the world before

937
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,540
Line

938
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,480
It 's like having no money

939
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:56,100
You live , you live

940
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,239
I 'll look for Luo Jingjing

941
00:39:57,339 --> 00:39:58,140
She has a lot of them

942
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,560
Membership card of high - end hotel

943
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,719
I can save a little bit , right ?

944
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,100
Why don 't you stay all day ?

945
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,399
Looking at someone else in a mirror

946
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,319
Gu Yunsu

947
00:40:05,379 --> 00:40:06,379
Think for yourself

948
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:07,540
That time when you were a carer

949
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:09,279
You spent so much money

950
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:10,600
I bought one of those green skirts

951
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,399
Ugly as hell

952
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,600
When you spend your own money

953
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,680
Why didn 't you stop me ?

954
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,600
You can pay

955
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,839
Am I guilty of spending money

956
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,040
I was

957
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,980
I spent on impulse

958
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,120
Who is it ?

959
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:20,879
Then you affected my emotions .

960
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,359
Of course I spent it impulsively

961
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:23,399
This is called upper beam error

962
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:24,739
That 's why the lower beam is crooked

963
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:26,239
You should reflect on yourself

964
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,899
I finally understand .

965
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,500
Gu Yunsu

966
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,980
You grew up

967
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,199
No matter what I do to you

968
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,480
You have always been

969
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,799
Elbow turned out

970
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,540
It 's okay

971
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:42,759
Doesn 't matter

972
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,620
Why the upper beam is not straight and the lower beam is crooked

973
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,339
Whatever you want

974
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,879
Why are you happy ?

975
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:47,640
I 'm okay

976
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:49,140
Mom Mom

977
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,560
I was wrong

978
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,779
Oh , my God

979
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:53,859
This is too comfortable . This sofa

980
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,239
Mom , it 's not like you don 't know .

981
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,120
This is how I am

982
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,640
Right

983
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,100
I have a nerve shunt problem

984
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,779
I often

985
00:41:03,399 --> 00:41:04,719
There 's nothing going on in my head

986
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,060
But my mouth beeps .

987
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:07,180
I just jump out

988
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,580
All right , I 'm gonna say anything .

989
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:10,060
Although I often say

990
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,759
You are a love brain

991
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,399
But some believe in the truth

992
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:13,859
Some people believe in money

993
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,339
You believe in love

994
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,940
You 're just better than others

995
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,739
Be Romantic

996
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,100
What 's wrong with you ?

997
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,020
I just thought

998
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:22,680
What about you and Uncle Li this time

999
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,960
The misunderstanding is really too big

1000
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:25,739
When you calm down

1001
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,100
We still need to find an opportunity

1002
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,520
Have a good chat with him

1003
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:30,660
My heart is in confusion now

1004
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,600
I don 't know what to talk about .

1005
00:41:40,419 --> 00:41:41,980
It 's not easy for me to live

1006
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,020
I was at the front desk just now

1007
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,080
When paying the bill

1008
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,100
Pay 6,000 yuan a night

1009
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,060
This is too hard

1010
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,940
I think

1011
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,859
All right , all right

1012
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,480
OK

1013
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,100
It 's okay . I decided .

1014
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,779
I 'm staying here tonight

1015
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:01,040
What 's wrong with my own money

1016
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,980
I can 't spend it

1017
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,299
I can 't decide anymore

1018
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:04,500
Yes , yes , you 're right

1019
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:05,980
Stay as long as you like

1020
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,440
All right

1021
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,899
All right

1022
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:11,980
That

1023
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:14,500
I 'll accompany you to watch the drama later

1024
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,299
Is it good ?

1025
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,319
I 'll sleep on the sofa at night and I 'll accompany you

1026
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:18,560
What time do you want to see tonight

1027
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,299
See some points

1028
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:20,080
Is it okay ?

1029
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,819
I spend my money

1030
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:22,719
I enjoy it alone

1031
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,100
If you want to live here , you 'll share it equally

1032
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,080
Don 't you provoke me ?

1033
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,699
How can I share it with you ?

1034
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:29,379
Don 't have any money

1035
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:30,699
You 're ready to go after delivering the rice cakes

1036
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,259
You are so ruthless

1037
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,620
Mom

1038
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,540
You have a place to go

1039
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,799
Is your mother in a good mood ?

1040
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,500
OK

1041
00:42:57,859 --> 00:42:58,500
Have you heard of it

1042
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,779
Are there five stages of grief

1043
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:01,980
Where is she now

1044
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,120
In the first two phases

1045
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,000
That 's the one

1046
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:06,199
Denial and Fury

1047
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:07,219
Jump back and forth

1048
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,600
No logic

1049
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,699
Indiscriminate bombing

1050
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:11,000
You were accidentally injured

1051
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,699
This is unreasonable

1052
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:15,560
Let you take a shot for me . Look at this

1053
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,299
OK

1054
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:18,379
It 's not very deep

1055
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:20,259
I didn 't expect it either

1056
00:43:20,259 --> 00:43:21,660
You said this goal ?

1057
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,980
It 's not me this time .

1058
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,620
It 's You

1059
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,580
Who would have thought that

1060
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,239
Yeah

1061
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:28,100
Feng Shui turns around .

1062
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:30,580
Susu

1063
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,960
I 'm gonna go up and find her

1064
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,419
I want

1065
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,140
Explain it to her in person .

1066
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,919
Uncle , don 't go up

1067
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,219
Don 't go up there .

1068
00:43:37,399 --> 00:43:38,299
She is angry

1069
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:39,839
If you go now , you will give people their heads away

1070
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,020
Slow down

1071
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,600
Calm down and talk about this matter

1072
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,940
Walk , walk , walk , go home , go home

1073
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:48,839
No

1074
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,419
Mei Mei is alone

1075
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,339
It 's up there

1076
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:52,680
Don 't worry

1077
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,640
I just talked to the front desk

1078
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,219
I told you .

1079
00:43:54,219 --> 00:43:55,219
I said in that room

1080
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:56,180
A pregnant woman lives

1081
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:57,620
If there is any problem

1082
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,580
Just in case

1083
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,020
Right

1084
00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:00,279
Call us

1085
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:01,160
Second call ambulance

1086
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,680
Yes , everything is arranged . Let 's go .

1087
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,339
I 've told you you believe me

1088
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:05,379
Trust me and go

1089
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:06,180
Walk
