1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,080
Goodbye Teacher

2
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:18,479
Goodbye , students

3
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,360
What 's wrong

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,219
Have you heard about Wenwen ?

5
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,579
Is she sick ?

6
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:30,579
For three consecutive days

7
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:31,719
They didn 't come to school .

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,879
Not

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,680
She can 't come .

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,099
Why

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,259
My mother told me yesterday

12
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:39,460
Yin Wenwen 's parents

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,279
Divorced

14
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:41,279
I don 't want her .

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,020
Send her

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,400
Home of Grandparents in the Countryside

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,739
Never come back

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,220
Dropping out is done

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,080
Why don 't you want her ?

20
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,800
Her father married another aunt

21
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,080
Her mother married another uncle

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,300
Have a new family

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,099
Of course there are new kids .

24
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:59,200
I definitely don 't want her old one

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,160
It turns out the child is also

26
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:05,040
New value

27
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,599
Old Devaluation

28
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,559
My dad said that people like the new and hate the old .

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,700
Being a child is too hard

30
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:45,519
For countless nights

31
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,619
I think I 'm useless

32
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,179
Delicious and lazy

33
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,660
Too ambitious

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,919
Just

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,579
And a little talent

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,560
I 'm always tempted

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,780
I thought I 'd persist

38
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,839
You can get

39
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,339
Everything I dreamed of

40
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,880
Mei Mei , what are you looking for ?

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,579
You You

42
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:13,100
You you sit down and you tell me

43
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,060
I 'll help you find it .

44
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,480
You give me you give me

45
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,440
Are you looking for something here ?

46
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,239
This is her painting of me before

47
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,399
When I was young

48
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,839
Diary written when I was a child

49
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,299
Be more obedient then

50
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:04,200
How nice you are

51
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:10,540
This is a poem she wrote to me

52
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,299
I was five years old

53
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,299
You can write poetry at the age of five

54
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,700
I was still in kindergarten at that time .

55
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,899
Jianxiong you

56
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,239
You read it to me

57
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,440
Good

58
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,039
I 'm in the sky

59
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,099
Pick Mom

60
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,639
You said a little child

61
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,620
It would be nice if she hadn 't grown up much

62
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:05,979
It 's always been like this

63
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,260
My next reincarnation

64
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,920
I don 't want to be a woman either

65
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:18,279
I don 't think it 's easy to be a mother

66
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,760
How much Susu loves you

67
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,159
She doesn 't want me

68
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,099
Mom , mom , don 't go

69
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:37,000
Mom

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,899
Mom

71
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,060
Susu

72
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,420
Do you want to go with your mother ?

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,539
I don 't want it

74
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:46,740
I want to talk to Dad

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,479
Why is it so difficult to be a human ?

76
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,360
Li Jianxiong

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,579
Dad won 't come back ?

78
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,159
Did he call you ?

79
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,320
Not typed

80
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,420
How do you know ?

81
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,519
I just know

82
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,320
Good smell

83
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,120
Dad has been for several days

84
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,620
Don 't go home for dinner

85
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,579
He was sleeping at school

86
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,680
I was sleeping when he came back

87
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:26,880
It was very difficult for me to even meet him .

88
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,260
Not like other dads

89
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,979
Students go to and from school

90
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,260
Father picks up and drops off

91
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,159
I think I 'm a father

92
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,219
It 's going to be laid off

93
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,680
Su Su ah

94
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,219
Eat quickly

95
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,479
After eating

96
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,079
Mom just wants to talk to you .

97
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,219
What happened to Dad

98
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:46,620
What 's going on ?

99
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,920
I 'm having trouble recently .

100
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,180
How about Lao Li

101
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,219
Let Lao Li help you

102
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,219
Lao Li can 't

103
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:54,159
No problem No problem

104
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,899
I will try my best

105
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,039
This is

106
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:02,700
You are away from home every day

107
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,279
Just fooling around with these two people .

108
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,159
How can you fool around ?

109
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:06,779
Let me tell you

110
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,779
This is Uncle Li

111
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:08,820
That 's Uncle Zhang

112
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,539
Give birth to a daughter

113
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:11,599
Like Mom

114
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:13,440
Hello kids

115
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
What 's Good

116
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:15,380
Smoked to death

117
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:20,459
Lao Li , let 's leave first

118
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:21,219
Let 's have a meal before leaving .

119
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:22,779
You know the last two days .

120
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:23,839
Impossible in Hangzhou

121
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:25,839
What 's wrong with that

122
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,920
We have a telephone .

123
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,779
Go home quickly

124
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:28,579
Our night

125
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:29,339
Good Evening Call

126
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,159
Telephone at night

127
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:30,779
Night Night

128
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,260
Slow down

129
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,399
Look at you

130
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,719
The older you are , the more you look like your mother

131
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,159
Do you know

132
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,440
My mom wants to divorce you

133
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,420
Yes

134
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,060
I heard her say anyway

135
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,959
You know why don 't you go home quickly

136
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,099
That 's your mother 's

137
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,659
Have a good taste

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,260
She can 't leave me

139
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,740
If you wait for your wife any longer , you will be gone

140
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,599
That 's even more impossible

141
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,659
Isn 't there you ?

142
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,440
Yes No

143
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,459
Inseparable

144
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,899
You think beautifully

145
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:07,260
Su Su ah

146
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:09,599
I 've been thinking for a long time

147
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,200
Still decided to divorce your dad

148
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,940
But don 't worry

149
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:16,760
Mom and Dad are just separated

150
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,839
But we will always be yours

151
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,639
Mom and Dad

152
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,899
I 'll always love you

153
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:22,219
I don 't believe it

154
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,459
No

155
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,459
Susu

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,560
I must

157
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,800
Divorced your father

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,180
I decided

159
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,579
If I don 't divorce your father

160
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:40,139
I 'll be very unhappy

161
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,520
But get married

162
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,160
Isn 't it a lifetime ?

163
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,619
I 'll be your mother

164
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,160
It 's a lifetime thing

165
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,759
But I 'm someone else 's wife

166
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,700
not necessarily

167
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,759
What about love

168
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,859
It takes a lifetime to love yourself

169
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,140
Falling in love is not necessarily necessary

170
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:11,900
Susu

171
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,599
After my parents divorced

172
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:17,900
Who do you want to follow ?

173
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:22,619
My dad

174
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,359
Then Mom will be reluctant to part with it .

175
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,099
Susu

176
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:32,540
Didn 't you just say

177
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,999
Your father doesn 't stay home every day

178
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,020
He doesn 't care about you either

179
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,540
Do you dislike him ?

180
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:40,800
I want you to follow me

181
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,359
I want to talk to my dad

182
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
What if your mother doesn 't want to leave you ?

183
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,680
Then you can 't part with me

184
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,959
Don 't get divorced

185
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:53,879
Line

186
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,219
Clever

187
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,599
Follow Me

188
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,940
Don 't be happy

189
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,499
What if she agrees

190
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,200
Cannot

191
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,160
How can I agree ?

192
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,060
Your mother 's heart is like a mirror

193
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,839
Without her

194
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,420
Who will take care of us

195
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:09,219
Yes No

196
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:10,560
Even if she could abandon me

197
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,099
Can she rest assured of you ?

198
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,140
Impossible

199
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,400
I 've already asked her .

200
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,420
She said

201
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,499
Women need to find

202
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,060
Your own life value

203
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,900
If I don 't get a divorce

204
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:22,979
I want to live my life

205
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:24,259
Stuck in this home

206
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,079
I want my whole life

207
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,140
Take care of you and Dad

208
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,400
I can 't go anywhere

209
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,859
Do you think that 's good ?

210
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,339
OK

211
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:34,800
As long as we are together

212
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:38,140
That 's not good for me

213
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,160
Don 't sigh

214
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,560
What are your future plans

215
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,660
Hide again and slow down again

216
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,540
Just know how to hide slowly

217
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,859
There 's no promise at all

218
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,780
My daughter is actually like this

219
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,800
Where are your mother and I ?

220
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,979
Nothing serious

221
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,119
Your mother is angry with me

222
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:20,420
She doesn 't have the courage

223
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,759
What is boldness

224
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:22,660
Just don 't

225
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:26,900
I don 't want you

226
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:29,800
What if she does ?

227
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:33,700
I don 't want to be your old kid

228
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:34,900
What old kid

229
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,499
Happy Birthday Susu

230
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,520
This is my gift for you

231
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,300
Happy Birthday Susu

232
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,060
Thank you

233
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,259
Thank you

234
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,200
Happy Birthday Susu

235
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,959
Thank you

236
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,379
How is your mother today

237
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:48,700
Didn 't come to pick you up .

238
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,119
Probably preparing it for me

239
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,339
Birthday Surprise

240
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,999
Then come back from vacation

241
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:53,940
You have to tell me

242
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,700
That 's for sure .

243
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,339
Mom and Dad , I 'm back

244
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:09,140
I don 't want Gu Yunsu either

245
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,099
I don 't want it anymore

246
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:10,640
You are day by day

247
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,959
What are you crazy ?

248
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,579
I 'll tell you Wu Limei

249
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:14,599
If you want to go , you will go

250
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,800
Gu Yunsu can 't follow you .

251
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,900
Her surname is Gu , understand ?

252
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,859
Why are you taking my stuff ?

253
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:20,739
I don 't want any more , okay

254
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,200
No more

255
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,320
Mom , don 't go

256
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,300
Mom , don 't go

257
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,900
Mom

258
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,420
Mom

259
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,239
Mom , don 't go

260
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,020
Susu

261
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,060
Mom will come back to see you later

262
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,320
Mom doesn 't want me anymore

263
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,499
Don 't cry ! Don 't cry

264
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,300
Dad will cook you something to eat

265
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,859
Is it good ?

266
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:35,459
What is that ?

267
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:39,259
Nothing

268
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:15,800
Su Su ah

269
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,400
Uncle , I won 't go back tonight .

270
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:18,099
Not

271
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:19,800
Your mother just lost a lot of blood .

272
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,619
What should I do

273
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,920
It 's not a hospital .

274
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,040
What do you do

275
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,979
You have to call 120 to send it to the hospital

276
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,700
Which hospital

277
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,420
Send me your address

278
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,160
I 'll go now

279
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,759
What is her situation now ?

280
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,660
Is she conscious

281
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,300
How about

282
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,459
The bleeding has stopped

283
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,400
Tell me the general situation

284
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:38,400
She 's at home

285
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
She said she was tired

286
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:40,560
She said she wanted to sleep

287
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,339
I let her sleep

288
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,440
As a result , there was a lot of blood .

289
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,900
The patient is 48 years old

290
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
Currently 18 weeks

291
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,599
History of hypertension at ordinary times

292
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,280
But this daily blood pressure

293
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,499
All controls are better

294
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:51,099
Two weeks ago

295
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,499
There is a little bleeding from the vagina

296
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,999
Her placenta is low

297
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,719
This bleeding

298
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,940
Is it related to that ?

299
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,440
Is there any blood and urine test sheet available

300
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,200
I need a reference

301
00:14:58,979 --> 00:14:59,879
That was all before

302
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,140
In the filed hospital

303
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,619
Can you check it now ?

304
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:03,859
Does your mobile phone take a picture and leave the bottom of it

305
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:04,459
Yes Yes Yes

306
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:05,540
I 'll look for it .

307
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:06,660
Her unusual data

308
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,599
I have them here

309
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,560
Do you want to take a look ?

310
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,540
Needless to say value

311
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,140
Value

312
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,479
The one with exception is that

313
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:22,619
Eosinophilic Cell Ratio

314
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:23,140
Zero point three

315
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,479
Then neutrophil number

316
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:24,940
1.23

317
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,300
Hemoglobin 80

318
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,540
Monocyte ratio 9.3

319
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,499
Lymphocyte ratio is

320
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:29,499
Fifty-eight point four

321
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:30,800
Cell ratio of neutrophils

322
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,440
Thirty-one seven

323
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,379
Eosinophil number

324
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:33,200
Zero point zero one

325
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:33,920
That 's all

326
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,900
Exception

327
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,200
There should be no big problem

328
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:38,180
You wait here

329
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,459
I took her for an ultrasound .

330
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:40,700
Look at the condition of the fetus in the abdomen

331
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,400
Can 't we follow ?

332
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,420
Family members cannot enter

333
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,759
Don 't worry , it 's okay .

334
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,099
Then we 're here .

335
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:47,900
Yes Yes Yes

336
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,200
Uncle

337
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,060
My mother is doing this because of me

338
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,259
Are you angry with me

339
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,719
After I left

340
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,499
What does my mother do at home

341
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:02,700
How did this happen ?

342
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:12,499
Why don 't you go watch some TV

343
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,140
I broke her heart

344
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:20,959
I know

345
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,239
What I said this time

346
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,859
It 's really too heavy

347
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,259
It 's my fault

348
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,920
I don 't even know my mom

349
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,759
What else do I write in a diary

350
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,520
I haven 't seen it .

351
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,739
You two mother and daughter are

352
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:37,099
It 's so similar

353
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,379
In fact , in each other 's hearts

354
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,400
Both pretend to be each other

355
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:41,540
The mouth is unforgiving

356
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,320
You said mom

357
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,599
How can I not love you ?

358
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:45,680
In her heart

359
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:46,900
Most Protective

360
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,560
I love you the most

361
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,459
Do you remember when you were young ?

362
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:55,900
You wrote her a poem

363
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:58,440
Mom

364
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,599
You are number one every day

365
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,099
What 's the first place ?

366
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,800
Pick me up at kindergarten

367
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,900
Because

368
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,979
I want to  every day

369
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:08,800
First to see Su Su

370
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:11,200
I also want to be the first to see you .

371
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,940
That 's right

372
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,959
That 's why we 're all first .

373
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:14,640
Yes

374
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,059
What 's wrong

375
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:18,400
I want to give you a gift

376
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,900
You want to send me a gift

377
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:21,200
What gift

378
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,319
Take it out

379
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,900
Let me see

380
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,519
What 's wrong

381
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,860
Isn 't this for me ?

382
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,340
Let me read it to you

383
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,739
Okay , then you read it to me

384
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:31,559
Keep your ears up and listen carefully

385
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,299
I want to listen carefully

386
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,279
You keep asking me

387
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,100
What did you do before birth

388
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,299
I pick my mother in the sky

389
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,799
I saw you

390
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,200
I think you are particularly nice

391
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,200
I want to be your daughter

392
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,759
I don 't think I have this luck .

393
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,920
I didn 't expect

394
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,600
Day 2

395
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,900
I was born in your belly

396
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,059
Do you like this gift

397
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,239
I like it

398
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,440
I 'm telling you there are many children in the sky

399
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,259
I want to be your daughter

400
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:04,739
Then they all want to be my daughter

401
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:06,299
How did you win ?

402
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:09,160
I exchanged it with a star

403
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,860
You traded me for stars

404
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,539
Susu

405
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,400
Thank you

406
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,999

It 's so good .

409
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:26,999
I scribbled it out

410
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:27,680
I didn 't expect

411
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,360
You scribbled it out

412
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:31,539
Why are you so powerful ?

413
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,100
Let 's go

414
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,779
I 'll go here .

415
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:36,700
You go here

416
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:37,799
No need to help me

417
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,440
Don 't I need to help you ?

418
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,440
You 're so good

419
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,759
Just hold me .

420
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,660
OK

421
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:44,660
Susu

422
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,200
What would you like to eat tonight

423
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,700
I want to eat this evening

424
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,299
Shredded potatoes and edamame

425
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:51,420
Shredded Potatoes

426
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,400
Very specific

427
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,140
OK , no problem

428
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,180
Then I 'll do it for you today

429
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,959
Are shredded potatoes and edamame good ?

430
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,420
Let 's wait for Dad together

431
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,459
Come back for dinner

432
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:00,180
Is it good ?

433
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,819
b - ultrasound shows live fetus

434
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:03,959
The baby is fine .

435
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:05,640
Bleeding is mainly caused by

436
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,959
Effects of Mood Swings

437
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,140
Prescribed some fetal drugs

438
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:10,200
Pregnant and high blood pressure at this age

439
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,360
You must pay attention

440
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:12,400
It 's a good mood to stabilize

441
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:13,959
Thank you , doctor .

442
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:14,759
Thank you . It 's okay .

443
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,900
I always thought that

444
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,299
Thoughtful Meimei

445
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,059
The person who cares about Mei Mei the most is me

446
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,940
Now I know

447
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,140
Compared to Susu

448
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,999
I 'm a long way off

449
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,400
Susu

450
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:44,200
Born you

451
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,100
is the bravest thing I have ever done

452
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,039
Until now

453
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,279
I never regret it .

454
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,999
Then get better quickly

455
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,059
After all , you are a mother

456
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,719
I use the stars in the sky

457
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,999
Exchanged

458
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,700
Uncle that

459
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,600
I said hello to Dr. Xu

460
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,640
Take care of my mom later

461
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,160
Go through the hospital formalities

462
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:25,940
OK

463
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,539
Susu , will you accompany me ?

464
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:34,880
As long as you need it

465
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,620
I 'll be with you

466
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,959
Poems to my daughter

467
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,380
You are not my hope

468
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,239
No

469
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:05,319
You are your own hope

470
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
My dreams that didn 't come true

471
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,739
Still mine

472
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:16,779
Nothing to do with you

473
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,680
Just let them have nothing to do with you

474
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:24,420
Why don 't you have a whole new dream

475
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,180
I don 't have to be in that dream

476
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,360
I am a piece

477
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,219
Things that are aging

478
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:36,420
Still not ready

479
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,019
My life is dedicated to you

480
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,180
This is my stubbornness

481
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,499
However

482
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,239
I love you

483
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,279
My child

484
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:49,340
I love you

485
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,019
But I love you

486
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,660
My child

487
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:07,259
I love you

488
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,180
That 's all

489
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,600
What is it doing

490
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:40,259
Hungry

491
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:43,200
Is it fragrant ?

492
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,019
Fragrance

493
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,080
What about this

494
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:48,299
It 's my Auntie Wu .

495
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,959
Herbal diet prepared to protect fetus and tonify body

496
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:51,979
Can 't eat

497
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:52,819
Why

498
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:54,900
There are many on the road

499
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,140
Selling steamed buns and snacks

500
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,180
Eat whatever you like

501
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,739
All right

502
00:23:57,739 --> 00:23:58,380
No money

503
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,440
I 'll transfer it to you

504
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,039
OK

505
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,759
Li Yan

506
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,640
You , you understand .

507
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,660
This is Aunt Wu

508
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,880
In the stomach

509
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,840
It 's my son

510
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
What about me

511
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:22,080
Special time

512
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,479
I 'm a senior year in high school

513
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,319
Yes

514
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:25,979
Special and Special

515
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,900
But a special time for men

516
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,340
Need to be sharpened

517
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,440
Women 's Special Times

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,239
Need care

519
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,039
You understand

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,880
Big boy

Then I 'll wait for you to get old .

523
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,620
What are you waiting for me to do ?

524
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:41,380
You 're abusing me , right ?

525
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:41,840
Not

526
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,239
Didn 't you say sharpening ?

527
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,200
Good , good , boy

Let me tell you .

533
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,940
What 's in here

534
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:56,039
There are many herbs for nourishing yin

535
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,319
Eat as much as you want

536
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,700
That

537
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,979
I 'm late I

00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,380
Remember to wash your hands

539
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:06,279
Gone

540
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,239
A little tender

541
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:16,979
Uncle Gu

542
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,259
Isn 't this little Li Yan ?

543
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,279
Have breakfast here

544
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,239
I bought breakfast and I 'll leave .

545
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,739
Don 't Don 't

546
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:23,440
Eat this from me

547
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,080
No

548
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,840
It 's okay , it 's okay

549
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,519
I 'm talking to you .

550
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,380
You stopped

551
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,420
Don 't they all ignore me

552
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,140
Yes No

553
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:31,680
It 's not me . It 's not concerned .

554
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,840
Is this the situation in your family ?

555
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,860
Right

556
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,799
I asked my daughter

557
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,400
My daughter doesn 't like to talk to me either

558
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,900
Does this really happen ?

559
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,080
Our Home

560
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,700
Home doesn 't look like home anymore

561
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Then I 'll treat you to eat

00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,340

You Gu Shushuai

566
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,719
There is no shortage of girls around us

567
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,799
What is your uncle Gu missing ?

568
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,440
Did you know

569
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:56,680
It 's true love

570
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:58,900
True Love Understand

571
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,880
Xiao Li Yan

572
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:00,979
Are you in love ?

573
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,340
Do you have a girlfriend ?

574
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:03,559
None

575
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:04,279
You 're not in love

576
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:04,999
How do you know

577
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,600
Which is your impulse ?

578
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,959
Which one do you really like

579
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:08,580
Which is that

580
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,860
Unforgettable love

581
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,640
That 's the guy

582
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:13,499
Like a boat

583
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:14,400
I like to hang around here

584
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:16,360
But he also needs this harbor

585
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:17,180
Right

586
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,700
He has to stop sometime .

587
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:20,539
You need to be

588
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,860
This man 's harbor

589
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,239
You 're a woman .

590
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,920
This is done

591
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,739
Who am I talking about

592
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:27,100
It 's you , Aunt Wu

593
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,900
Don 't just listen to me

594
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,499
Tell me

595
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:32,940
Didn 't I just say something ?

596
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,680
Home

597
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,979
What happens now

598
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,920
You want me to tell me

599
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:39,660
What about the harbor you mentioned ?

600
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,140
Only offshore

601
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,340
There are only wind and waves in the distant sea

602
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:45,059
It doesn 't mean a few things .

603
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:45,600
That is

604
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:47,580
You , your father and Aunt Wu

605
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,200
We have trouble

606
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:49,019
Of course

607
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,059
Yes , yes , this is a big wind

608
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,279
It must be a strong wind

609
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,200
Look what I said .

610
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,959
Don 't you think they are too

611
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:57,539
Inappropriate

612
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,660
I think

613
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,759
No , tell me more .

614
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,940
Tell me more about them

615
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,539
Uncle , my school is here

616
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,539
Just pull over

617
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,100
It wasn 't you just

618
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,799
Not

619
00:27:05,979 --> 00:27:06,499
Not

620
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,660
Talk to me for a while .

621
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,360
I 'm late . I want to

622
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,160
Not

623
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,840
It 's not that you eat others ' short mouth

624
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,880
Stop , stop , stop .

625
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,999
You just say you go and go .

626
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,900
Let 's talk later

627
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,219
Uncle

628
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,539
Aunt Wu

629
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:20,459
Still recovering in the hospital

630
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:22,519
Where are you still in the hospital

631
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:24,860
This

632
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,259
Meran Meran Meran

633
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:28,979
I love you

634
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:32,819
You 're like a plum blossom .

635
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,580
When I think of Mei Mei , I think of you

636
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,299
Your takeaway

637
00:27:58,299 --> 00:27:59,519
OK , OK , thank you

638
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,200
Su Su ah

639
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,039
I 'll leave right now

640
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,160
Bring lunch to Mei Mei

641
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,400
Tell her not to worry .

642
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,680
I asked you to buy a dress

643
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,840
Dress up

644
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,380
Don 't let others misunderstand that you are pregnant

645
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,660
What do you think

646
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,479
Dressed like this

647
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,700
You don 't feel yourself

648
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,739
Did you play a bit ?

649
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:41,799
Say the truth

650
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,940
I walked around the mall

651
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,660
This is definitely not the most excessive

652
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,580
And you 're wearing this

653
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,940
Take a walk around the hospital

654
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,059
I have a future

655
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:51,940
A Rising Screenwriter

656
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:53,380
Now it is wasted into one

657
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:55,400
Free full - time carer

658
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,259
I sacrificed career

659
00:28:57,259 --> 00:28:58,160
Free and free

660
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,900
I don 't want it either

661
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:00,259
I 'll wear a nice dress

662
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:00,900
What 's wrong

663
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,360
That about your script

664
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,559
I have a clear conscience

665
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:06,360
I think as a writer

666
00:29:06,499 --> 00:29:07,999
She should be dignified

667
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,559
You shouldn 't be left to others

668
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,940
I 'm your mother

669
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,900
I 'm defending you

670
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,459
Then you should have a guilty conscience

671
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:14,059
In this case

672
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:15,660
When you say those hurtful words in the future

673
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,620
You can live your head

674
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,140
Row Row Row

675
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,900
This dress

676
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,219
I 'll report it for you , okay ?

677
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:27,319
You told me earlier

678
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,299
I was looking at another article

679
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,459
That one is a bit expensive

680
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,559
This one is fine

681
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:33,719
Give me a month 's rent .

682
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:34,700
I lost my head

683
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,259
One month 's rent .

684
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,759
If you ask about clothes , it will answer or not

685
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,620
Is it worthy ?

686
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,499
It can 't speak

687
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:40,360
I asked why

688
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,620
Does it care about me

689
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,700
You 're not a

690
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,360
People who make money

691
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,759
Do you understand ?

692
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:46,019
You spend money blindly

693
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:47,499
Money falls from the sky

694
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:48,880
I could have earned money .

695
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,100
But you spend money

696
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,559
You need to use your brain

697
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,819
Dr. Xu

698
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,600
Dr. Xu

699
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,160
Dr. Xiao Xu

700
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:01,239
Aunt Wu

701
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,160
Hello

702
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:05,299
Your caregiver dresses very grandly

703
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,360
Her approach to work

704
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,620
Usually more serious

705
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:11,680
How about

706
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,860
Are you used to it on the first day of admission ?

707
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:14,900
It doesn 't matter if you are used to it or not

708
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,860
The reason I moved in is

709
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,160
Save him

710
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,620
You must relax .

711
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,219
Excessive tension and anxiety

712
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:21,840
will increase

713
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,120
Possibility of uterine contractions

714
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,499
This can cause uterine bleeding

715
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:27,039
Also , you must reduce your activity

716
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,279
Try not to do some

717
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,259
Activity to increase negative pressure

718
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:30,700
It 's okay to shout .

719
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:34,059
Definitely

720
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:37,459
Have a good rest

721
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:38,319
Leave it to us

722
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,620
Thank you thank you

723
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,160
Check it out

724
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,200
Bed 33 next door

725
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,080
OK , Dr. Xu

726
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:54,600
What 's wrong

727
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:12,979
Are you used to the first day of work ?

728
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:14,580
Dr. Xu

729
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,999
Are you used to it ?

730
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,180
Don 't we all get used to it ?

731
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,819
As long as my mom

732
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:19,059
As long as you can get better

733
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
Auntie is fine

734
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,200
Maintain a good mood

735
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,180
Pregnant women avoid emotional ups and downs

736
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:24,759
Yes

737
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:26,140
My temper

738
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,580
You should also restrain yourself

739
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,580
Waiting for someone

740
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:35,140
Helping my employer settle a new love

741
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,140
Dealing with old love

742
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,039
You have a wide range of work .

743
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:38,840
No

744
00:31:39,219 --> 00:31:39,700
Then you do your job first

745
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,840
You too

746
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,380
What about people

747
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,400
Doctor

748
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,700
Found Susu

749
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,640
Why are you dressed like this ?

750
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,840
Is Dad surprised

751
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:00,580
Surprise

752
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,400
Where is your mother ?

753
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,940
This is obstetrics

754
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,739
My mom is in gynecology

755
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:04,979
I 'm afraid you 're going wrong .

756
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:06,739
Not here .

757
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:08,920
You 're dressed like this

758
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,180
I thought it was psychiatric .

759
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:10,900
You 're so humorous

760
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,739
Why are you here ?

761
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:12,840
I 'll pick you up .

762
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,999
This is not that person

763
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:15,979
Isn 't that Nobita ?

764
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,200
It 's not wrong .

765
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,900
Try this

766
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,759
Let 's simmer all night .

767
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:27,140
See if it suits your taste

768
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,979
Delicious

769
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,140
If it tastes good , drink more .

770
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,140
We can handle enough

771
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,499
Then you can 't eat too much .

772
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,180
It 's too late to lose weight

773
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,999
What did you lose ?

774
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:40,120
The most important thing for you now

775
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,299
It is to keep your body well .

776
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:43,499
And you 're afraid of being fatter

777
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,900
You look good even when you are fat

778
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,940
Don 't tease you

779
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:47,080
I 'm 50 pounds weight

780
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,739
Does it look good ?

781
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:49,940
You won 't dislike me at that time

782
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:50,799
What are you saying ?

783
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,100
I 'm not Gu Kangqi

784
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:53,499
You 're crazy

785
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:54,640
What do you think he 's doing ?

786
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,180
Is it comparable

787
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,519
Mei Mei , you

788
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,999
You really gained 50 pounds

789
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,420

790
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,299
You 're going to gain 100 pounds .

791
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:04,580

Can you

794
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,940
Don 't talk so well

795
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,979
Why ?

796
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,499
Hello

798
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:18,160
My surname is Li

00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,819

Same Same

807
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,779
Li Jianxiong

808
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,539
I feel a little nauseous

809
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:31,539
Accompany me to the toilet

810
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,239
OK

811
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:34,940
Come

812
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,360
What 's going on

813
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,539
This food is a little greasy , isn 't it ?

814
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,239
I think so

815
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,799
You 're a little greasy

816
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,539
What are you flattering ?

817
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,940
I 'm doing public relations for you .

818
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,519
In this way

819
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,200
Your Days Here

820
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
You can be more comfortable .

821
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:57,200
How comfortable it is

822
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,140
They 're saying bad things about me behind my back

823
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:00,580
What did you say ?

824
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:01,999
I 'm old .

825
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:03,360
I just called you uncle

826
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,140
You didn 't hear

827
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,900
Yes Yes Yes

828
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,700
You said everyone is pregnant

829
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,019
We should understand each other 's difficulties

830
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:12,499
That 's right

831
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:13,080
Right

832
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,640
How can they talk like this ?

833
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,439
I talk to them

834
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,239
You come back

835
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,839
Li Jianxiong , let me tell you

836
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:22,580
You are here

837
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:24,540
You don 't need to play a social butterfly

838
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,279
We don 't need it at home

839
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:27,299
Go

840
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,819
Where are we going ?

841
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:35,580
Hurry , hurry , hurry

842
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:36,640
Go straight

843
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:37,839
Hurry up

844
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:40,379
I 'm wearing heels

845
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,140
Slow down if you can 't walk fast

846
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:43,339
Is this the way to go

847
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:47,100
Wrong .

848
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:47,819
It wasn 't there just now

849
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,700
Did you come here ?

850
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:49,919
You bring

851
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,000
Take me around here

852
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,239
Who takes you around ?

853
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,100
Hospitals all look the same

854
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,879
You haven 't been here for too long

855
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,939
What kind of food are you cooking ?

856
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,140
What ingredients are used ?

857
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,739
Overnight

858
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:00,580
How to do it

859
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,379
If you want to say I give it to your mother

860
00:35:02,379 --> 00:35:03,160
Prepare this food

861
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,439
Your mother is now Queen Mother Lafayette

862
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:10,600
We need to protect it .

863
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,319
But you don 't have to question me

864
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,580
I gave a silver needle to my hair

865
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,799
Try one dish at a time

866
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:15,600
Is it poisonous or not

867
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,140
That 's not necessary

868
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,200
I 'm not a eunuch either

869
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,899
But don 't blame me for not reminding you .

870
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:20,640
My mother is very precious now

871
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,239
Many things

872
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,700
She can 't eat or touch

873
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:24,060
In case something goes wrong with her

874
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:24,939
You 're done

875
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,799
What 's wrong with your mother

876
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:27,160
I 'm in charge for the rest of my life

877
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:28,799
Who are you ?

878
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:30,540
Is it your turn ? You care about her

879
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,040
Who are you talking about me ?

880
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:33,799
Let me tell you

881
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,180
I 'm first in line

882
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,480
I 've never left if I 'm not .

883
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,480
The most appropriate person is me

884
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,899
I see it

885
00:35:40,899 --> 00:35:42,120
You don 't want me to see your mom

886
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,500
Right

887
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,660
Take me around here

888
00:35:45,299 --> 00:35:46,379
Don 't blame me for not reminding you .

889
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:46,960
We 'll both soon

890
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,939
It 's reunited .

891
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:49,859
You

892
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,140
I 've spent so many years looking out there

893
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:53,980
What am I doing

894
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,899
I am cultivating .

895
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,899
I 'm preparing for this moment .

896
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:00,580
I 'm your real father

897
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,759
Do you want me to beg you ?

898
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,200
Can 't you let me see your mother ?

899
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,259
Let me tell you

900
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:06,839
I went

901
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,259
Take your mother into your arms

902
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:09,799
I 'll give you a perfect home

903
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:11,839
I 'm telling you what I did to your mom this time

904
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,359
It must be a tortoise in the water tank

905
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:13,879
Easily accessible

906
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,339
Did you eat something bad ?

907
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,460
Dad , why are you

908
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,980
You keep talking nonsense .

909
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,620
You 're like crazy

910
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,919
Really

911
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:22,640
Am I sick

912
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:23,359
Sick

913
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:24,879
Is this the way to go

914
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,180
Hurry up

915
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,180
I really don 't want to eat it . I won 't eat it

916
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,819
Take a bite

917
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:32,580
I can 't eat it

918
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:33,939
Taste

919
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:34,879
I can 't eat , I can 't eat

920
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:37,100
Can 't eat anything

921
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,040
It 's delicious

922
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,180
This can you try this

923
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:44,879
I can 't eat it .

924
00:36:44,899 --> 00:36:46,000
I don 't want to eat it

925
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,100
What am I doing ?

926
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:49,379
I have that on me

927
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:50,000
The smell of cigarette oil

928
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,239
I just made it for you

929
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,939
So I didn 't have time to change clothes

930
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:54,580
No , no , no , the food is very beautiful

931
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
Good job too

932
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
It 's not human

933
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,719
That must be human .

934
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,259
Otherwise , you can

935
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,140
So determined

936
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,219
I must have hurt you

937
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,620
On the surface

938
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:04,859
Five people and six people

939
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,600
You said this Nobita

940
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,700
Maybe I 'm doing something bad in my heart

941
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:09,600
Stop it

942
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:11,100
Li Jianxiong is very good .

943
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,819
What happened to Li Jianxiong

944
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:13,439
Isn 't he fine ?

945
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,680
Don 't tell him , stop , stop , stop , stop

946
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,520
My

947
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:17,680
This is really

948
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,500
Don 't talk , don 't talk

949
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,460
Don 't talk about this or this .

950
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,540
Don 't talk about it

951
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:23,500
You don 't want to eat it , right ?

952
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,439
I don 't eat it

953
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,640
You see

954
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,580
Look at my clothes

955
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,779
Remember ?

956
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:30,000
This dress

957
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,460
Wear when proposing

958
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:41,180
How fast it is

959
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,399
This girl is so old .

960
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:43,899
This is us .

961
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:46,520
Wealth of Emotion

962
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,399
You 're so big

963
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,339
This dress is not good .

964
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:51,200
Who bought it for you ?

965
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:52,120
My mother

966
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,200
Didn 't you pay ?

967
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,319
Don 't tell me it 's quite experienced .

968
00:37:57,739 --> 00:37:58,120
Right

969
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,540
Look at this material

970
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,859
This match with this color

971
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:02,640
This is a show style

972
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,279
Right

973
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:05,040
Most people really don 't dare to match it like this

974
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,339
It 's really nice .

975
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,799
Such a big girl

976
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,219
I gave birth to it and raised it

977
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,379
Except for artificial conception

978
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:12,100
Not falling

979
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,000
You fall behind every step

980
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,259
My foot is misstepped

981
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,439
Such a big girl

982
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:16,640
That 's your luck

983
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,899
You are nothing but good luck

984
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:20,100
Yes

985
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,379
That 's right

986
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,040
I often blame myself

987
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,899
It shouldn 't be

988
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,879
I didn 't leave you behind

989
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:46,879
Why are we clearly in love

990
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,700
We still have to separate in the end

991
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,319
Your father 's gonna sing here

992
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,060
He 's watching you .

993
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,819
How much love is there

994
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:05,000
You can do it again

995
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,239
How many people are there

996
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,660
Affectionate

997
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:16,219
What did you do in your previous life ?

998
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,460
The old song is still good

999
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,560
People are old relatives

1000
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:27,859
Daughter

1001
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,819
You said your father was almost fifty

1002
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:31,259
I realized this .

1003
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Is it too late

1004
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:34,879
Not later

1005
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,560
Look , your mother is beautiful

1006
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,819
Right , this flower is still blooming

1007
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:42,160
Intellectual and generous

1008
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,640
Family Responsibility

1009
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,620
Gu Kangqi , have you lost your memory ?

1010
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,460
We are divorced

1011
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,719
I 'm married

1012
00:39:48,899 --> 00:39:50,700
I have a husband named Li Jianxiong

1013
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,660
Is it true

1014
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,259
Nobita

1015
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,020
It 's hard to tell if this is true .

1016
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,339
I know all about you two .

1017
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:00,120
The relationship between you two is over .

1018
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,319
I won 't tell you anymore

1019
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,560
I died while accompanying my mother for surgery

1020
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,719
What surgery is it ?

1021
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:08,419
People flow

1022
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:09,700
What are you talking about ?

1023
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:11,719
Mei Mei , calm down too .

1024
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:12,520
Calm down . What calm down ?

1025
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,520
Compare your heart with your heart

1026
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,700
Can I calm down

1027
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,480
How

1028
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,859
Calm down and show me .

1029
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,319
You all do this to me

1030
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,859
Is there a way to live this life ?

1031
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:24,560
You 're just too strong

1032
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,660
Don 't you hurt yourself ?

1033
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,460
Is there something in my heart ?

1034
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:30,719
Is it difficult ?

1035
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:32,500
Let me tell the truth

1036
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:36,660
This little Li Yan told me .

1037
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,100
Say that your home is stormy

1038
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:40,180
There is a conflict

1039
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:41,640
But tell him or not

1040
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,100
It 's okay

1041
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,460
It 's a matter of time .

1042
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,120
I have to show up for this big thing

1043
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:46,739
Right

1044
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:48,259
I have to stand by your side

1045
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:51,819
Mom

1046
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:54,259
Do you have to go with your ex - husband

1047
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:55,259
Say something

1048
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,719
I 'm a little dizzy right now

1049
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,859
I don 't know where to start .

1050
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,299
What 's wrong ? What 's wrong with my head

1051
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,140
Let me see

1052
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:02,620
What 's wrong with my head ?

1053
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,239
You 're angry

1054
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,560
Stop talking .

1055
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,620
Come and rest

1056
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,120
Rest

1057
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,239
Come put this here

1058
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,000
Why don 't you lie down for a while ?

1059
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,480
No

1060
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,020
That 's what you do

1061
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,419
Line

1062
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,359
Good

1063
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,239
Your mother is fine .

1064
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:18,020
Don 't move and let your mother have a good rest

1065
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:19,299
I 'll come back tomorrow

1066
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:20,160
You 're still here

1067
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,700
It 's okay . Come on

1068
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,620
Come if you want

1069
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,140
This

1070
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
Of course I would like to come .

1071
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,100
I can come every day .

1072
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,899
Tell me what you want to eat

1073
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,960
I can 't figure it out right now

1074
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:42,520
You can recall memories

1075
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,339
Go back and figure it out

1076
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:44,960
Line

1077
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,520
Let me think about it .

1078
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,719
Okay , okay , okay

1079
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:00,719
Drink water

1080
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:04,500
Where are you doing this ?

1081
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,239
You said your mom could see it

1082
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,520
Did I buy this from outside ?

1083
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,680
Is my mother blind ?

1084
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,060
I 'm embarrassed to say

1085
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,819
I just want your mom to eat better .

1086
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,180
Line

1087
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,859
I 'll change another one tomorrow

1088
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,100
Don 't change it .

1089
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,520
Let me tell you

1090
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,460
Don 't worry .

1091
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,339
What are your virtues

1092
00:42:33,339 --> 00:42:34,700
My mother knows it very well

1093
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,700
It doesn 't matter what virtue I do

1094
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:38,259
As long as your mom likes it

1095
00:42:38,899 --> 00:42:39,899
This woman

1096
00:42:39,899 --> 00:42:40,700
If you want

1097
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,560
Once the atmosphere arrives

1098
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,319
She was happy when she lied to herself

1099
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:44,859
My mother is different

1100
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:45,560
Her love brain

1101
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,560
It was sold online early

1102
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,439
Really

1103
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,299
Your mother is different from before

1104
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:50,819
It 's a bit like that

1105
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,160
The unattainable flower of the mountain

1106
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,080
That temperament .

1107
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,460
Don 't climb if you know it 's unattainable

1108
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,500
The most important thing is to have a self - aware father

1109
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,540
The Higher Is Unattainable

1110
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,919
The more I 'm eager to try

1111
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,000
Your father is sixty years old

1112
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,480
We still have to climb Mount Everest

1113
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,660
Don 't be arrogant .

1114
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,919
Don 't come

1115
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:06,859
Your mother asked me to come

1116
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,620
I have to come tomorrow

1117
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:10,299
I 'll be back the day after tomorrow

1118
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:11,580
The day after tomorrow The day after tomorrow

1119
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,620
I come every day

1120
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,259
I want to come a few times a day

1121
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,520
I 'll just come a few times

1122
00:43:16,439 --> 00:43:17,859
Dad , how about this ?

1123
00:43:17,899 --> 00:43:19,100
You can accompany the bed .

1124
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:19,859
You you you

1125
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,359
You wear my clothes and accompany you in bed

1126
00:43:21,759 --> 00:43:22,620
Why didn 't I think of it

1127
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,160
I 'll ask

1128
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:24,520
Come on , you

1129
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,100
You really take it seriously

1130
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:27,060
Don 't come

1131
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,319
My father said you were the flower of the mountains

1132
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:38,540
Identifying goods

1133
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,359
Easy to cheat

1134
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:43,120
Kaoling Flower or Kaoling Green Tea

1135
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,460
Both of us know best

1136
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:46,859
You 're not happy yet

1137
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,520
I 'm afraid you 'll get burned .

1138
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,640
Can you always remember

1139
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,919
Your current identity

1140
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,680
You are now a

1141
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,700
There is a pregnant married woman

1142
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,500
Are you okay

1143
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,520
Don 't worry

1144
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,620
The matter of getting burned

1145
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,419
For me

1146
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,060
Is completely impossible

1147
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:06,660
But I 'm going to

1148
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,859
Let him play with fire and burn himself

1149
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:09,480
What

1150
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,060
WHAH WHAH

1151
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:11,759
From small to large

1152
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:13,219
Did he cook you a meal

1153
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:14,580
All the Day

1154
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,919
With the slogan of making money from milk powder

1155
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,100
Fooling around outside

1156
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:19,419
Now I want to go back to find it .

1157
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,000
We have to give him a chance

1158
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:27,439
What do others think ?

1159
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:29,680
I 'm envious

1160
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,540
Being older to have a baby

1161
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,859
Half the head of a dwarf .

1162
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:36,140
I 'm gonna show those people a good look .

1163
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,480
What does it mean to get more popular as you get older
