1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,220
Please ask the groom

2
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,101
Will marry this beautiful lady

3
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:20,900
Wife

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,281
I do

5
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,141
Then we congratulate the two newcomers

6
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:27,260
Tie the Knot

7
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,080
Take a look

8
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:34,420
You said our boss

9
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,381
Popularity of this video

10
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:36,661
It still hasn 't come down .

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,261
Yeah

12
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:39,221
When you come here , you will put yourself

13
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:40,321
The office is closed

14
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:41,520
Call if you need anything .

15
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,120
Send WeChat

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,161
I can 't see anyone either

17
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,101
For a while , in my opinion

18
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:46,441
I can 't slow down .

19
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,400
You say

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,161
Why did he fight with others

21
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:50,840
Who are you looking for ?

22
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,041
Let me find Li Jianxiong

23
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,360
Looking for our boss

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,561
What is it ?

25
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:56,761
Your boss

26
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,281
Where is your boss

27
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,080
Where is it

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,881
Wait a minute

29
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,360
This this this

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,701
Isn 't this the guy in the video ?

31
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:05,300
You 're not allowed to make trouble .

32
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,221
I 'll just buy something

33
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,640
Look at your leaders

34
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:10,520
Don 't watch this video , right ?

35
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,721
I have nothing to do .

36
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,240
Wait a moment

37
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
I 'll call to confirm

38
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:22,920
Do you want tea ?

39
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,881
I don 't like tea

40
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:25,481
Just have coffee

41
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,721
None

42
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,701
What is this ?

43
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:29,520
Instant

44
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:30,761
Tea

45
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Drink instant tea

46
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,340
None

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
I drink whatever you drink

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,601
Boiling water is here

49
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:39,680
You can pour it yourself

50
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,481
You still expect me to entertain you

51
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,340
Bastard

52
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,481
I didn 't scold you

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,740
I got you two bastards .

54
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,441
This will make up for you

55
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,620
You little weak body

56
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,680
Take care of others

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,001
I 'm here this time

58
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,561
Because of me and Li Mei

59
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,041
I specifically talked to you

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,520
Apologize

61
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:07,321
I 'm gone

62
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,400
I don 't want you to come back

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,781
Don 't do not need

64
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:11,920
Unnecessary

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,441
What can you two do ?

66
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:14,761
Nothing happened to you two

67
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:16,601
We have more people .

68
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:18,441
Shall I tell you one by one

69
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,080
It 's just me poaching you .

70
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,620
Don 't I deserve to apologize to you

71
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,441
I really don 't need to tell you .

72
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,241
At best , we 're even .

73
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,301
Those jokes you made back then

74
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,840
I didn 't miss it .

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,441
What are you talking about ?

76
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,441
What does it mean

77
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:43,400
How did this happen ?

78
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,600
Isn 't it good before ?

79
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,561
Why are you giving away your home ?

80
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:54,001
When you were in the karaoke box

81
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:55,881
Crying like pear blossoms bring rain

82
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,640
Beating your chest and feet

83
00:04:57,801 --> 00:04:59,861
So it was you who let us both

84
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,241
Where is the unknown divorce ?

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,520
It 's you behind the scenes .

86
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,080
Mei Mei divorces you

87
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:07,160
That 's because you broke her heart

88
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,960
We wanted to buffer .

89
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,001
I rushed back

90
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,080
You abducted her

91
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,160
You have no idea

92
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,681
How many chances did Mei Mei give you

93
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:14,881
You 're the one I died alone

94
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,681
Culprit

95
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,580
In Mei Mei 's heart

96
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,861
You 've broken her .

97
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:19,160
You and Li Mei

98
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,040
You two bastards look at mung beans

99
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
When did we meet our eyes

100
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:23,580
Don 't imagine this .

101
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:25,280
When you two got divorced

102
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,480
We don 't know each other at all

103
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,821
We came together later

104
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,621
Those were many years

105
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,640
What happens in the future

106
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,561
I believe that

107
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,621
I 'm by Li Mei

108
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,600
She can 't have a crush on you

109
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,480
Why is it impossible ?

110
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:35,960
Are you as romantic as I am

111
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:37,921
Do you have my romantic passion

112
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,201
If you have it , I will do it .

113
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:40,040
Is it as handsome as I am

114
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,441
Are you my size to fight ?

115
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,840
I pressed you against the ground and rubbed you

116
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,080
If it weren 't for

117
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,400
I was seriously injured because of the police .

118
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,001
You can still stand here today

119
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:47,801
Apologize to me

120
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,881
If it wasn 't for this gut , I 'd cut it off

121
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,501
Let me tell you

122
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,761
Can you withstand my three moves ?

123
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,720
It seems that I didn 't convince you that day

124
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,381
What 's going on ?

125
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,421
What are you doing ? Come , come , come

126
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,460
Let 's make a gesture

127
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,681
Come , come , come , come

128
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,761
Come

129
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,681
Come

130
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,640
Be careful if I flick my crotch and push my elbow .

131
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,921
Nobita , let me tell you .

132
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,561
A man can flex and stretch

133
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,001
That 's right

134
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:20,761
I came here to apologize to you .

135
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:22,301
I told you already .

136
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:24,121
We 're even .

137
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:25,040
No apology required

138
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,881
So what are we doing here ?

139
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,100
You must

140
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,640
If you want to do something

141
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,280
You

142
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:39,400
Let 's play with me

143
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,400
That video on the Internet in the past two days

144
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:50,340
I guess everyone has seen it .

145
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:53,121
Brawl

146
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,421
What exactly happened ?

147
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,100
We give it to everyone

148
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,561
Explain this matter

149
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,840
The client is Mr. Gu

150
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,160
He came to us specifically

151
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,681
I want to tell everyone about it

152
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:08,100
Explain it clearly .

153
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,681
Your leaders are very serious about this matter

154
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,400
We happened to be in the hospital

155
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:23,080
All of a sudden , a few people barged in

156
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:25,241
Medical trouble , right ?

157
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,501
Instantly messed up

158
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,121
Yes

159
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,241
This mess

160
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,801
Your leader , right ?

161
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,921
Been a policeman

162
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:32,960
He is responsible

163
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,201
Rushed in

164
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:36,181
I

165
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:37,921
I rushed in too

166
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:39,741
But neither of us knew anyone .

167
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:40,361
Right

168
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,301
That atmosphere

169
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,501
How can I take care of it ?

170
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
I took him

171
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,361
Think it 's the troublemaker

172
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,540
Come up

173
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,241
He thinks I 'm a troublemaker .

174
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:49,520
The two of us just chattered

175
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,220
A meal there

176
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,681
There you go and go .

177
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:52,761
No one will give way to anyone

178
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:53,600
What are you doing

179
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,681
What are you doing

180
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:55,840
You

181
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,960
No Competition , No Deal

182
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,241
It 's a coincidence , right ?

183
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,801
We can 't make a deal without fighting , right ?

184
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,241
They are all courageous .

185
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,561
This is what happened

186
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,681
Everyone , stop messing around

187
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,780
It 's a blind suspicion

188
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:11,761
Listen to the leader

189
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:14,001
Rumors stop with wise men

190
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:15,280
If

191
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,361
Everyone 's thoughts on us

192
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:17,761
Courageous Acts

193
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,840
Words of agreement

194
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:21,561
Willing to communicate with colleagues around you

195
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:22,561
Share with friends

196

Well , we also welcome it

A formal expression of thank you

203
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,701
Last time after you said the suspension

204
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,521
I didn 't bother you .

205
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,161
I think you may be too busy here

206
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:45,240
In short

207
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,801
I 'm half footed

208
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,641
Newcomers who haven 't even stepped into the circle

209
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,021
You took so much effort before

210
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:50,840
Project Advancement

211
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,000
Really sorry for troubling you

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
No matter what , this is me

It will be sold to another company

215
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,661
Don 't do it

216
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,161
I called you last time

217
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:02,880
Say suspended

218
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,080
That doesn 't mean I quit .

219
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,980
And your mother

220
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,561
Teacher Wu also called me

221
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:07,360
I understand

222
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,541
I 'm thinking about a

223
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,281
The best of both worlds

224
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,100
I find it hard to have

225
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,561
The best of both worlds

226
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,181
My mom still knows me

227
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:14,840
She knows

228
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,620
I can 't change it

229
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,061
The way you want it

230
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,021
At that time

231
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:19,960
I agreed to all kinds of conditions

232
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,041
It 's actually because I 'm short of money

233
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,860
Not

234
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,000
Susu

235
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,141
You tell me the truth

236
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:27,880
Have you signed up ?

237
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,880
It 's soon

238
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,641
If you don 't sign a contract , you will not count .

239
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,561
You put your heart in your stomach

240
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:39,061
This item

241
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,120
Our company will definitely shoot it

242
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,600
Listen to my sister

243
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,500

I will also start

247
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,360
In my private resources

248
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,561
Add heat to you

249
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,480
What if it became popular

250
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:54,161
I didn 't quite understand

251
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,681
Write it out and post it online

252
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:57,801
It 's on fire and then what happens

253
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:59,240
Then there may be heat

254
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,921
Is it popular ?

255
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,201
Just leave it alone

256
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:04,561
You have to believe me

257
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:07,260
We have to do this project together

258
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:19,500
Come on

259
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,460
Go

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,860
Wait a minute , wait a minute

Wait a minute

262
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:28,840
Can 't leak electricity ?

263
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,301
No leakage

264
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:30,380
You rest assured , you rest assured

265
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,100
Let 's start .

Wait a minute , wait a minute

267
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:32,620
That means just in case

268
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,500
If he faints

269
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,620
Is there anything like this

270
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,860
Rescue Measures

271
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,421
Rest assured

272
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:37,580
You are now in the hospital

273
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,661
It 's about ten percent now

274
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,220
No feeling

275
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,061
Gaga Gaga

276
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,021
You can continue , right ?

277
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,301
Don 't you feel it

278
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,181

279
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,941

It 's interesting

283
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:08,401
Who invented this

284
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,260
This is fun

285
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:10,480

00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:13,740
It can be played without pain

289
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
About 50 %

290
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,521
It can be played without pain

291
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:16,781
Good to 50

292
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,541
50 %

293
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,541

This doesn 't work This doesn 't work

301
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,141
Are you okay

302
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,401
Nurse

303
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,141
No problem

304
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,901
Doctor Stretcher

305
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,921

Head Attention 80

307
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:47,860
Be careful

308
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,360
Eighty

309
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,561
I did it for Mei Mei

310
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:50,821
Is it born ?

311
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:51,941
Is it born yet

312
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,080
Now it 's equivalent to all fingers open

313
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,661

314
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,281
Mom

315
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,281
Zhou Zimeng chatted with me

316
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:02,061
She felt

317
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:03,960
Mine can

318
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,980
Published online

319
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,500
Then serialize into a novel

320
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
What do you think ?

321
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,021
I think it 's good .

322
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:13,281
Nowadays , many print media have internet .

323
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,181
I think the style of your novel

324
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,260
Ideal for online publication

325
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,021
If there are more people watching it

326
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,441
At that time , those film and television companies

327
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,281
Black

328
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,421

Li Dao Mo Dao and so on

330
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:27,620
I 'm looking for a TV series

331
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:29,441
Then just eat the hot food and drink the spicy food

332
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:32,380
I think it 's promising

333
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,260
Do you think it 's reliable

334
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:34,500
You wait .

00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:27,661
With tears in your eyes

364
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,421
I 'm already very touched .

391
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:28,840
Be careful

392
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:30,281
Where is it

393
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:31,480
There must be a fire

394
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:32,281
Home

395
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,521
Get home

396
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:36,281
Change shoes

397
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:39,401
Gu Yunsu

398
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:40,681
Come and help your father .

399
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,240
Such a strong wine smell .

400
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:43,161
What 's wrong

401
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,161
I sent Nobita back .

402
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:52,860

Help your father up

407
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,801
Get on the sofa quickly

408
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:01,561
Tell the boss to settle the bill

409
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:03,100
What 's going on , you guys

410
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:04,880
Don 't help him

411
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:05,960
Let him lie on the ground

412
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:08,080
It 's annoying how old you are

413
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,240
How did they get together

414
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,821
They went to a bistro to have a skewer

415
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:13,441
Drink too much

416
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:16,000
Is Erguotou OK

417
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:17,000

OK

421
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,720
We drink this there

422
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,840
It 's like drinking water

423
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:29,161
Still stopping

424
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,201
Full

425
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,720
I like you like this

426
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:32,521

427
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,041
No , I can change some beer for you .

428
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,880
Don 't compete

429
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,740
Don 't talk so much .

I see you are getting more and more pleasing to my eyes

432
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,161
I think you 're comfortable too

433
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:56,480
I told you that I liked you

434
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,201
I like you too

435
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,561
I 'll have another drink with you

436
00:15:58,561 --> 00:15:59,401
How to drink Lai Lai

437
00:15:59,401 --> 00:15:59,840
Come and drink

438
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,240

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,901
Come on

440
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:02,921
One box

441
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:03,801
Bring it all over , bring it all over here

442
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:04,600
One box

443
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,781
There 's no wine here

444
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:07,541
Drinking alcohol is bloody

445
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,541
Aren 't we just

446
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,260
Can 't you make a deal without drinking ?

447
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,301
Drink it for me

448
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:17,821
Drink

449
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:18,860
A wife

450
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,301
Picking up a daughter for nothing

451
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,260
I 'm going to be a dad again

452
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,141
OK

453
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:28,860

Put this plate in .

455
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,781
They 're both so drunk

456
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,860
I definitely can 't go back .

457
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,561
OK

458
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:35,161
Drink

459
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:41,421
Family members call you

460
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:42,460
Serve me wine , serve me wine

461
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,120
Connection

462
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,921
Serve wine

463
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:45,080
Connect

464
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,720
Hello Dad

465
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:49,080
Where are you ?

466
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:50,661
Li Yan

467
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,141
Dry

468
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:55,100
Nobita

469
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,220
Nobita , are you okay ?

470
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:00,600
I

471
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:02,360
To support or not to support

472
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,201
Help , help , I 'm really impressed .

No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no

478
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:14,701
Do you vomit or not

479
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,401
Don 't vomit if nothing happens

480
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,401
You get on the sofa

481
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,121
Slow down

482
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,040
My God

483
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,361
Smoking

484
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,520
You still smoke you

485
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,201
Coffee

486
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,520
Tea

487
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Which one do you like

488
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:33,581
What

489
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,020
Coffee

490
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:36,161
Refreshing

491
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,381
Tea

492
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,381
Health Care

493
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,381
I won 't be romantic

494
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,601
I don 't understand either

495
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,320
Passionate Romance

496
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,641
Am I fashionable

497
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:53,681
I am not fashionable

498
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,560
Can I dance ?

499
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,320
Does not jump

500
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,800
When you two are together

501
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:05,401
Love to death

502
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,540
Then you 're with me

503
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:10,040
It is a picture

504
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:14,280
Security

505
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,300
Solid

506
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,361
Two ages plus one

507
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:39,361
Old men over 100 years old

508
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,560
For you

509
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:43,040
Big fight

510
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,841
Drunk for you

511
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,441
I said Wu Limei

512
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:49,921
I didn 't expect your age

513
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,980
Still recruiting like this

514
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,040
Speak your heart

515
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,201
Get out of my heart

516
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:54,740
Is it in your heart

517
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,921
A little bit happy

518
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:59,040
What about vanity

519
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,240
Yes , satisfied

520
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,720
But these two are really annoying .

521
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,401
Do you know

522
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,361
Those two boats under your feet

523
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,240
You can step steadily

524
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,441
First

525
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,581
I have no feet on two boats

526
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:19,601
second

527
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,701
Even if I have a day

528
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:23,881
I accidentally stepped on

529
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,260
That 's also because of me

530
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,520
Genetic Problems

531
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,260
You mean we two

532
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:41,101
Isn 't it a bit

533
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:45,881
Slag

534
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,540
Are you two scumbags or not

535
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,401
Why do you have to find me to judge ?

536
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,300
Looking for a chat with me

537
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,441
Why are you looking for

538
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:57,540
Don 't you know that in your heart

539
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,621
I 'm telling you this .

540
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:00,121
If you have academic status

541
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:01,020
You cannot be rated as an academician

542
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,341
You were born at the wrong time

543
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,641
Jingjing tells the truth

544
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:05,960
You have such a talent .

545
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,220
God gave it

546
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:09,020
That 's the grandfather 's reward

547
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,820
Chasing and Feeding

548
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:11,020
Let me say it

549
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,460
You two just relax .

550
00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:13,861
There is no woman who has never been a scum of anyone else

551
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:15,101
This life is incomplete

552
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:16,820
This has been experienced before

553
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,141
It 's complete

554
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:19,500
I want to find relief now

555
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:20,941
Jingjing

556
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:22,201
My financial situation

557
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:22,861
You know that

558
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:23,760
This meal today

559
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,500
My mother and I will invite you equally

560
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,701
Isn 't that sincere enough ?

561
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:27,861
Give me a move quickly

562
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,621
It depends on the relationship between you two .

563
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:32,421
How to talk

564
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:34,101
It 's a careful conversation

565
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:35,460
Or just talk

566
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,941
What 's the difference ?

567
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:37,780
Talk carefully

568
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:39,540
Do whatever your heart thinks

569
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,581
I can 't help a little

570
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,820
I say I like to eat hairy belly

571
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,980
But my heart said it again

572
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:48,701
I have been eating this yellow throat for many years .

573
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:49,861
This tastes good too

574
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:53,020
I think I should be full after one plate .

575
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:54,480
But my heart feels

576
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,661
The other plate slips a little bit

577
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:56,921
It seems pretty good .

578
00:20:58,921 --> 00:20:59,621
You two

579
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:00,581
Talent is not low .

580
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:01,881
Really

581
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:03,621
But

582
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,941
I think the more this time

583
00:21:04,941 --> 00:21:05,560
Up and down

584
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,740
When I 'm more confused

585
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,020
It 's time to get into your mind

586
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,300
It 's much easier to talk with your brain

587
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:11,901
Who and how to talk to

588
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:13,701
Just make a list

589
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,460
How to list

590
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,341
What table is listed

591
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,381
Make a list of men 's strengths and weaknesses

592
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:20,181
Add one point to the advantages

593
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:22,220
Let 's reduce one point for the shortcomings

594
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,820
Finally

595
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,780
Look at a total score

596
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:25,141
Who has the highest score

597
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:26,381
Whoever I 'm with

598
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:27,621
Steady profit without loss

599
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,260
And a little suggestion

600
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,641
Newbies like you two

601
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,101
It 's best to cut the gordian knot with a quick knife

602
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:08,641
I

603
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:10,121
This

604
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,581
OK

605
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:14,141
Come in

606
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,701
No , that 's not what I meant .

607
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,540
No , no , no , that 's what I meant

608
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,740
Come in and let 's talk

609
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,960
No , no , no

610
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,760
Come in as soon as I let you in

611
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,500
Hurry

612
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,421
I already told you .

613
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:30,540
Just stop taking things

614
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,220
You

615
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:33,621
What are you holding on to ?

616
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:34,341
Gu Kangqi

617
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,960
I also asked myself

618
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,141
What am I holding on ?

619
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,421
I come to you every day

620
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:41,740
Is my greatest hope

621
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,901
Happiest Thing

622
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:44,800
I keep telling myself again

623
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,820
This is the last time

624
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,341
But I don 't know why

625
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,820
The cat came over for no reason .

626
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,081
I 'm probably trying

627
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,820
Let 's dip into your family 's flavor

628
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:57,701
Every time Susu invites me in

629
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,941
I really thought it was

630
00:22:58,941 --> 00:22:59,941
He 's in his own house

631
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:01,020
Just the three of us here

632
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,000
The Little Family

633
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,421
That warmth and energy

634
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,641
I am

635
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,101
I 'm willing to lie to myself .

636
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,300
But I know it 's a dream .

637
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,300
Gave me a chance

638
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,800
I have this time .

639
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:17,201
Why did I go ?

640
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,720
I want to get away from home

641
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,141
That little shit at this time

642
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:21,441
Used to cook for you .

643
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,300
Chat with you

644
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,081
This is our own home

645
00:23:24,081 --> 00:23:25,220
It 's built

646
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,220
None

647
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:29,901
Impossible

648
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:36,500
I 'm jealous and jealous now

649
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,581
Regret

650
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:45,621
This last time

651
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,161
To sign again

652
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:05,480
Take a look

653
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:21,740
I met you at nineteen

654
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:23,060
For this matter

655
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,381
I don 't regret it at all

656
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,941
I never regret it

657
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,220
Sometimes

658
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:31,260
I remember when I was young

659
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,101
You take me on a motorcycle

660
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:36,201
Inside the tunnel

661
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,260
I feel like we are

662
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:41,901
I feel like I can fly

663
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,421
At that time , I thought

664
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,220
If you keep riding like this

665
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,421
It keeps flying like this

666
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:54,581
How happy that is

667
00:25:04,621 --> 00:25:06,101
It 's better to be young

668
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,621
Envy

669
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,941
Really envious

670
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:13,500
But it 's nothing right now

671
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:16,621
We 're too young anyway

672
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,941
People are also satisfied

673
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:20,960
So this

674
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,861
Thank you very much , Gu Kangqi

675
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:26,701
Falling in love is beautiful

676
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:29,141
It 's really beautiful to think about it

677
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:58,181
After our divorce

678
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:03,060
Actually , I hope you do well .

679
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,101
People have feelings after all .

680
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:09,101
But I 'm thinking

681
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,441
You better be better than me

682
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:12,540
That 's a little bit short

683
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,260
This gives me a mental balance

684
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,901
But that day

685
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,421
I 'm in the hospital

686
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:22,020
I saw you sick

687
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,500
Susu stayed with me

688
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,820
I was thinking that day

689
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:31,901
I hope you live better than me

690
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,780
I hope you don 't get sick

691
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,980
Live happily every day

692
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:42,101
I feel at ease

693
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,520
I thought .

694
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,460
To make more money

695
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,841
We can

696
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,621
You can get better and better

697
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,300
Living

698
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,101
I gave my home away .

699
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:10,381
How much love can be done again

700
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,661
How many people are worth waiting for

701
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:17,460
Come back when you know how to cherish it

702
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,901
But I don 't know that love

703
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,441
In this life

704
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:23,780
A lot of regrets

705
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,861
Once owned

706
00:27:27,701 --> 00:27:28,720
This is what it is

707
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,881
One thing that pokes my heart in particular

708
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,780
The saying goes

709
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,460
Clothes are not as good as newcomers

710
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:38,881
People are always nostalgic

711
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,841
Because that means security

712
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:42,861
Peace

713
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,341
I also witnessed myself

714
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:47,081
Total time invested

715
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:47,861
and energy

716
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:51,000
It 's not so much nostalgia

717
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,421
It might as well be

718
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,381
I miss my old self

719
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:58,101
Sometimes these two days

720
00:27:58,101 --> 00:27:59,581
I suddenly thought of you

721
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:02,560
I put these words out of nowhere

722
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,701
I just wrote it on paper

723
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:18,361
Last

724
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,201
Did you write to him ?

725
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,280
These are

726
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,460
When I think of you

727
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,901
Words that suddenly pop up

728
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:51,820
Memena

729
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,260
I 'll tell you the bottom as well .

730
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,980
Actually , for the past two days

731
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,581
My heart is always panicked

732
00:28:58,941 --> 00:28:59,760
I 'm afraid

733
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:02,060
You 're just because I 'm honest and considerate

734
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,480
Married me

735
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,681
What I fear most is

736
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:07,861
There is no love between us

737
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:11,141
You are stupid

738
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,641
If I didn 't love you

739
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:13,800
I 'd take that big risk

740
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,621
Have a baby

741
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:16,740
I 'm out of my mind

742
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,240
I have one more fear

743
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:20,740
You can 't compare to Lao Gu in your heart

744
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:22,381
Because after all , between you and Lao Gu

745
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:24,220
You still have a Susu

746
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:26,300
Tell the truth

747
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:28,460
It 's impossible without love

748
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,861
But this love meets marriage

749
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,980
Then I can 't bear it .

750
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,220
It broke up

751
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:35,220
Actually , I live with you

752
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:36,820
I just learned something

753
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:38,760
What about this husband and wife ?

754
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,300
Suitability and alignment are the most important

755
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,601
I know clearly now

756
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:43,581
Know one thing

757
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
I am Wu Limei

758
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,581
Only with you , Li Jianxiong

759
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:47,720
Then there will be one

760
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,701
Happy Mei Mei

761
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,060
Happy Mei Mei

762
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,181
and healthy Mei Mei

763
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,861
Do you think I 'm right

764
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:02,780
You say compare

765
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,260
Are you from Lao Gu ?

766
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,661
You also have one

767
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:08,901
List of Advantages and Disadvantages

768
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:10,500
Yes .

769
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,941
I can show you

770
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:22,181
This is gone

771
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,780
None

772
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:26,980
Then

773
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,581
I 'm the one who crushes him .

774
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,540
Then you feel relieved .

775
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:34,240
I 'm relieved

776
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:35,500
Rest at ease

777
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,540
Anan Anan

778
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,820
Do you still smoke ?

779
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,740
Uncle Li 's dish today is delicious

780
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,661
This ginger is still old and spicy

781
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,361
Why don 't you talk less ?

782
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:54,181
You 'll be choked

783
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,941
I know Susu has a strong taste

784
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:59,000
Some more seasoning is added

785
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:00,740
Thank you Uncle Li

786
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,720
The heavy taste needs to be changed

787
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,861
It 's changing

788
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:04,820
No

789
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,181
Then hurry up

790
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,740
Otherwise , you can 't eat and walk around .

791
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,341
Don 't think I 'm heavy .

792
00:31:10,341 --> 00:31:11,581
Didn 't I inherit you ?

793
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:13,161
I have now changed to

794
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:14,300
Eat a light diet

795
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,820
Light diet

796
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
Prolong Life

797
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,181
Light and good

798
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,941
Lai Mei Mei

799
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:20,081
Eat more of this light food

800
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:20,661
OK

801
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,621
You eat more

802
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,820
What are you doing , Li Jianxiong

803
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:39,841
I have to write you one too

804
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,661
Coming and going

805
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,081
Then I 'd like to see

806
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:47,060
Write something ?

807
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,401
When did I scold a bitch ?

808
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:54,740
It 's the first time we met

809
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:56,441
Didn 't you drop the plate again ?

810
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,121
Are you smashing bowls again ?

811
00:32:57,121 --> 00:32:57,500
That

812
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,020
Isn 't that for divorce ?

813
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,740
Yes , whatever it takes to divorce

814
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,081
And you

815
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,861
What 's wrong with being ruthless

816
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,101
You rejected me .

817
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,901
Twice

818
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:11,040
Jianxiong

819
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,960
I think some words

820
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,820
I still have to tell you in person

821
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,141
Okay , then you tell me .

822
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,260
I think we will

823
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:26,220
Don 't contact us again .

824
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,240
Hello Hello

825

That

826
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,621
Is Li Jianxiong operating inside ?

827
00:33:53,621 --> 00:33:54,121
Yes

828
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,381
You are

829
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:57,460
Emergency Contact

830
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:00,540

831
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,701
I think so .

832
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:03,020
My name is Wu Limei

833
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,800

835
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,701
Female Friends

836
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,401
It may not be necessary

837
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:14,861
Further development

838
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,060
What does it mean

839
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:17,420
Where is he injured

840
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,581
He He

841
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,860
He was injured

842
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,340
What I can 't say

843
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,181
Where is the injury ?

844
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:23,621
Is there anything to say ?

845
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,581
Where is it hurt

846
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:26,541
Where ?

847
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:27,461
Right there

848
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,260
We 'll wait for the results later

849
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:38,181
OK

850
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,501
This will have to wait and see

851
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,461
How is the doctor ?

852
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,981
The operation went smoothly

853
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,400
Does the patient have a child

854
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:48,260
Yes

855
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:49,740
That 's fine

856
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:51,141
Less regret

857
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,981
Prepare yourself

858
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,061
Brother Li

859
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:08,061
Brother Li

860
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:09,420
You 're awake

861
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:10,860
How is it feeling

862
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:12,141
What Doctors Say

863
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,541
I told you

864
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:15,101
You won 't listen when you ask you to take a vacation

865
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:16,041
Your recent status

866
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,220
Can you call the police ?

867
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,621
What Doctors Say

868
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,981
Doctor

869
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:22,380
Neither did the doctor

870
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:25,981
What are you doing here

871
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:30,820
Then I 'll ask the doctor what he says .

872
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,161
If it 's okay , you can go .

873
00:35:36,161 --> 00:35:37,141
I ran all the way

874
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:40,240
A store selling gold and silver jewellery

875
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,800
None

876
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:41,940
I

877
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:43,940
I made up this

878
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:45,641
Let 's make do with it

879
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:50,681
Jianxiong

880
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,481
Will you marry me

881
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,661
I don 't need you to pity me

882
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,220
I just want to pity you

883
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:03,001
You become what you are today

884
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:04,780
Aren 't you worthy of my pity ?

885
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:06,720
It 's all because of me

886
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:08,181
I 'm timid

887
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:09,141
Looking forward and looking back

888
00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:11,220
That 's why you became this

889
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,981
This situation is not your fault

890
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:15,300
No need to feel guilty

891
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,860
It 's not necessary

892
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,220
I have to take this responsibility

893
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,720
Why do you wrong yourself ?

894
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:24,740
Jianxiong

895
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:26,701
Listen to me

896
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:29,021
In fact

897
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,461
When we met not long ago

898
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,380
I really want to be with you .

899
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,420
Really

900
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:38,900
What did I say later

901
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:41,161
We keep our distance

902
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,181
That 's wronging myself

903
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,581
I wronged myself for Su Su

904
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,181
I also wronged you

905
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,280
I want to take care of you

906
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,621
I want to be responsible for you

907
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:56,220
I just want to pity you

908
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,061
What happened ?

909
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:02,141
Jianxiong , we 'll be together in the future

910
00:37:02,141 --> 00:37:03,860
Whether it is to tide over the difficulties

911
00:37:04,061 --> 00:37:05,521
It 's better to be happy

912
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:07,101
As long as the two of us are together

913
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,021
Everything is fine

914
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:09,720
I even want to give you one

915
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,121
Well , maybe it won 't be born .

916
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:17,181
But it 's okay

917
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:20,380
It 's enough for us to love each other

918
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,501
I want to love you honestly

919
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:26,820
Will you marry me

920
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:49,081
I put it on my body every day

921
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:51,320
Just waiting for this day

922
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:05,820
How 's it going now

923
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:06,860
How does it feel

924
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,121
No feeling

925
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:10,260
No feeling

926
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:14,780
It 's okay if you don 't feel it .

927
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,641
What do you mean by picking and searching ?

928
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:21,840
Where did I pick ?

929
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,021
How do you think anyone

930
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:24,021
Weave a circle with straw

931
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:25,501
When the ring proposes

932
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,641
Xing Xing Xing Li Jianxiong

933
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,161
Write slowly

934
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,161
I 'll sit down and listen to you .

935
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,541
What else

936
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:36,101
Write it

937
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,561
The Most Poisonous Woman 's Heart

938
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:39,280
Why

939
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,021
When did I

940
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:41,061
The most poisonous woman 's heart

941
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:42,541
As soon as I recover

942
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,001
You 've disappeared again

943
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:45,340
The oath made

944
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,681
I don 't count the marriage proposals .

945
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,260
I didn 't break my word either

946
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:51,740
Right

947
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,141
Look , I said I 'd marry you

948
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:54,181
Did I marry you ?

949
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:55,380
I 'm not only married to you

950
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,541
I had a baby with you .

951
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:57,840
Everything I said

952
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,981
I 've done it .

953
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:00,300
I 'm just late .

954
00:39:00,661 --> 00:39:02,621
That 's not a little too late

955
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,440
If you really feel sorry for me

956
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:06,081
I was injured and hospitalized

957
00:39:06,081 --> 00:39:07,740
You shouldn 't have messed with me

958
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,561
If it weren 't for the original

959
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:09,981
The marriage you proposed to me

960
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:11,420
I miss you

961
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,581
So many years ?

962
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:13,461
Then tell me

963
00:39:13,581 --> 00:39:14,601
You won 't marry me

964
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:15,740
Who are you married to

965
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:18,400
Who do you want to marry

966
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,141
Tell me and listen

967
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,481
Tell me about it

968
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,021
How is it possible

969
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:27,181
Mei Mei is the best

970
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:27,981
We Mei Mei

00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,581

For the best

973
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:32,061
