1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,440
How to say

2
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:24,960
What to say

3
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,559
Let 's get back together

4
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,239
Doctor

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,040
How do you say this

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,879
Test first

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,279
That means it 's not necessarily true .

8
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:03,959
Test first

9
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,359
All right

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,059
Thank you

11
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:25,240
See the results after an hour

12
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,499
Take the result after an hour

13
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,820
One hour

14
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:29,659
Yes

15
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,559
Can I pay for an expedited fee

16
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:33,659
Not allowed

17
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,200
Qin Yuxuan Wan Yan

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,900
Anything is fine

19
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:41,900
Listen to you this time

20
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,380
What if I say

21
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,700
Nothing to say

22
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,400
We 've broken up anyway

23
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:54,499
How

24
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:56,540
Why are we talking about breaking up again ?

25
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,240
If we do break up

26
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,820
It won 't be here , okay ?

27
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,980
I still hope you can

28
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,019
Think about it seriously

29
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,120
About going to Shanghai with me

30
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,700
That

31
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,540
Where 's the child

32
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,579
If you really want to

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,660
Gu Yunsu

34
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,700
You didn 't mean it , did you ?

35
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:21,880
To keep me here

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,619
You didn 't mean it , did you ?

37
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,619
To take me away

38
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:25,040
This kind of thing

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,760
I did it by myself

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,119
Is useless

41
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,000
What do you want to express

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,720
Is it okay if I don 't say anything ?

43
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,419
What do you want to say

44
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,119
After saying that , it 's noisy again

45
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:29,780
See

46
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,859
You started it first .

47
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,060
You started it first

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,619
You must make a noise

49
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,859
I didn 't want to argue , but you argued first

50
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,179
Then I 'm disturbing you without being left behind .

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,940
I think we 're at our age

52
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:44,220
Can be pregnant

53
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:46,060
Something I 'm proud of

54
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:47,700
I think it 's luck

55
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,139
If you have to give birth

56
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:51,600
Yes

57
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,299
Yes

58
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:52,980
Yes

59
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,139
What does it mean ?

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,980
Qin Yuxuan , let me tell you .

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,700
Even if I want to give birth today

62
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:58,899
How to give birth or not

63
00:02:58,899 --> 00:02:59,859
It 's my own business

64
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:01,019
I can make my own decisions

65
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:01,700
It 's not your turn

66
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,579
Tell me if you can

67
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,260
Didn 't you just ask me ?

68
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,160
Are you crazy

69
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,060
You said it yourself

70
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,540
You 're not asking me

71
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,500
You 're sitting there and suddenly saying

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,720
Yes what can you do

73
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,100
Don 't be strange with me

74
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:12,100
Let 's stop arguing

75
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,980
I 'll go smoke a cigarette , okay

76
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,660
I 'll go too

77
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,839
You can 't smoke you 're pregnant

78
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,780
Whether you are pregnant or not is not sure

79
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:16,739
Then I won 't go .

80
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:17,760
Then I don 't have a cigarette

81
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,419
You insist on connecting with an international department

82
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,540
This is higher than ordinary outpatient fees

83
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,780
Three times more expensive

84
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,700
How many people are in general outpatient clinics ?

85
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:27,540
Didn 't I fear you suffer ?

86
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,419
People say this hospital

87
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,339
Feng Shui is very good

88
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:30,859
Really

89
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,179
There are many pregnant women admitted

90
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:33,820
Pregnancy is everywhere

91
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,019
Even this chair

92
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,299
You touch lightly

93
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,780
Everyone can receive good pregnancy

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,619
I think you 're now

95
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:41,820
Becoming more and more superstitious

96
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,880
What 's going on with you

97
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,380
Conditioned You You

98
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:44,859
Murder

99
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,079
I conditioned

100
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,959
Pregnancy

101
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,380
Then a good mood is the most important thing .

102
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:54,700
You 're the best

103
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,060
You 're not bad either

104
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,179
You 're not bad either

105
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,359
Not interesting

106
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,320
Qin Yuxuan

107
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:03,160
I decided

108
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,119
I want to stay in Hangzhou

109
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,679
You decided so many times

110
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:08,480
I 'm real this time

111
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,060
This is angry words

112
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,200
This is not angry words

113
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,040
I want to stay in Hangzhou

114
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,119
There is no home for me in Shanghai

115
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,959
This is my home

116
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,919
I 'm not yours

117
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,160
You are not you are not

118
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,799
Breakup

119
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,839
This time it 's true

120
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,979
Wu Limei

121
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,360
Please visit Clinic No. 5

122
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,659
Wu Limei

123
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,260
Please visit Clinic No. 5

124
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:33,700
Wu Limei

125
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,019
Please visit Clinic No. 5

126
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,039
Ma Gu Yunsu

127
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:41,440
You are pregnant

128
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:55,880
Months

129
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,240
Was it an accident ?

130
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,599
Why are you so careless ?

131
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,920
Are you preparing for pregnancy specifically ?

132
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,800
Forget it , I don 't want to hear it

133
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,760
Don 't tell me

134
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,760
What are the plans ?

135
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,120
I 'm ready to take it

136
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,320
Figured it out

137
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,920
The kind that doesn 't go back on his words and doesn 't complain

138
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,120
Forget it , I don 't want to talk to you

139
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,159
Aunt Wu

140
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,719
Your daughter 's report results

141
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,560
You said you were such a big thing

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,039
Why are you

143
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,839
You can 't discuss it with me

144
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,079
You 've said everything .

145
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,360
How can I discuss it with you ?

146
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,839
Do you

147
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,200
You should congratulate me first .

148
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,320
I 'm not happy .

149
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
I can 't say anything .

150
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:40,860
Let me congratulate you first .

151
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,959
No , I 'm unmarried

152
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,639
Don 't want to get pregnant first

153
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,479
We broke up

154
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,440
Then I 'll make a statement .

155
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,519
If you are pregnant

156
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,760
I still support you

157
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,620
Then I will also make a statement

158
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,599
Now you have a son when you are old

159
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:52,639
I am totally opposed

160
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Gu Yunsu

161
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,079
You 're twenty-eight now

162
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,560
I did not urge marriage or childbearing

163
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:58,320
As a mother , I 'm okay .

164
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:00,240
I 'm pregnant , I 'm older

165
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,599
What does it have to do with you

166
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:02,599
Why are you upset ?

167
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,599
It 's not just you .

168
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:04,039
Doing things

169
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,260
You 've never been reliable

170
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,320
Are you reliable

171
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,339
You 've broken up

172
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,279
I also came for pregnancy test

173
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,320
Do you think this is reliable ?

174
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,800
I

175
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,899
I 'm better than your old house on fire

176
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:12,959
So what are you doing ?

177
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,620
It 's waste recycling

178
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,800
Turn waste into treasure

179
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:18,560
Is it funny

180
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,839
Someone else is pregnant

181
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,320
There 's a treasure in that belly

182
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,620
You are pregnant at your age

183
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,839
That 's Ray in your stomach

184
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,120
It can blow you up at any time

185
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,060
Blow You Up

186
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,560
Otherwise , family members will take it out

187
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,479
Calm down

188
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,200
Not good

189
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,479
Sorry , Uncle Li

190
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:37,159
I

191
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,620
Actually , I 'm not aiming at you

192
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,740
It 's okay , I understand .

193
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,000
Hello , Auntie , I 'm Qin Yuxuan

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,240
That 's what you just said

195
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,039

And aesthetic consciousness

221
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,239

Mr. Feng

239
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,479
Do you want to say a few words to everyone ?

240
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,219
Then I 'll briefly talk about it

241
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:43,719
Until this Friday

00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,599
Sorry for stomachache

Xiao Qin

253
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,119
It 's not enough for you to go alone

254
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,219
You have to take it away

255
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:18,359
One of our generals

256
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,560
Make a digression

Right , right , right , right here

261
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,660
Is it better

262
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,459
Li Jianxiong

263
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:42,140
I 'll ask you a question

264
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,640
What do you think about this world

265
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:46,499
Is there any parallel space and space

266
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:47,540
What does it mean

267
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,599
In another world

268
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,359
There 's another you

269
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,599
Maybe a big boss

270
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,280
Could be a big star

271
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,280
Driving a luxury car

272
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,719
Living in a villa

273
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,820
Beautiful women like clouds

274
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,599
Do you find it particularly exciting ?

275
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,560
What are you laughing at ?

276
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,040
I really miss it

277
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,800
Is there you in that world

278
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,920
That 's hard to say

279
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:18,719
It may not be possible to meet us

280
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:23,839
What 's the meaning of that

281
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,879
I still think

282
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,920
This world is good

283
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,680
Is it true or not ?

284
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,599
Really

285
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,780
Li Jianxiong

286
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:39,259
Let me tell you something

287
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,859
In this world

288
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,359
I think

289
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,820
You are the best person for me

290
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:49,940
Really

291
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,300
I keep trying

292
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,499
When did it happen

293
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,020
Not long ago

294
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,540
I resigned at the beginning of the month

295
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:23,420
That

296
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,780
When did the contact start ?

297
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,579
More than two months

298
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,420
Less than three months

299
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:30,739
Two or three months

300
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,440
Qin Yuxuan , you are really awesome

301
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,300
Hello , you 're a cheater .

302
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,660
Waterproof

303
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,499
Susu

304
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,140
You are with me

305
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,499
Going to Shanghai

306
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:46,579
What 's wrong with it

307
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:48,499
Think

308
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,700
More than double salary , right ?

309
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,780
When you get there

310
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,420
Projects you touched

311
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,619
All the best

312
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:56,060
Most Popular Type

313
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,979
That network grows

314
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:59,079
That would be a qualitative leap

315
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,060
And within a few years

316
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,859
Your Resume

317
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:01,520
And your ability

318
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,420
That 's better than you .

319
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:04,259
Stand here and shoot a short video

320
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:04,859
It 's much better , right ?

321
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:06,140
Did you ask me if I wanted it ?

322
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Have you ever considered me

323
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:09,739
What about my life

324
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:10,700
What about my job

325
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,520
I don 't want it anymore

326
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,119
None of this matters , right

327
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:13,780
Susu

328
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,359
Why can 't you follow me ?

329
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,359
Let 's discuss it .

330
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,119
Why

331
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:19,140
Susu , calm down

332
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:20,300
You know

333
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,060
I 'll transfer you with me

334
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,040
I 've been talking to people for a long time .

335
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,300
That 's what I got .

336
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,619
We can 't be ignorant

337
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:26,879
Right

338
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,280
I don 't know what 's good or what 's wrong and

339
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,020
Qin Yuxuan

340
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,180
Why are you talking like that ?

341
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,920
I don 't know good or bad

342
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,859
I 'm not calm enough

343
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:33,579
Do you know what this is ?

344
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:34,640
Issue Notice

345
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:36,859
I am human

346
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,979
I 'm a thoughtful person

347
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:39,219
People with their own opinions

348
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,140
I 'm a real person

349
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,619
I 'm not a

350
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,479
What is your luggage

351
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:42,200
Where do you want to check it to

352
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,940
Where to consign

353
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,900
You 're so interesting

354
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,900
I don 't know good or bad

355
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,940
Not Susu

356
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,959
You , you , what you said

357
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,099
It 's a little heavy

358
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,800
I know I didn 't tell you .

359
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,479
It 's my fault

360
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:51,879
But I want everything

361
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,459
I 'll tell you when it 's settled .

362
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:53,979
It 's because it 's not set .

363
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,140
Does it have to be settled before we can say it ?

364
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:57,180
Then shall we get married ?

365
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,060
Is this settled ?

366
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,859
We haven 't decided .

367
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,900
You can 't talk about love anymore

368
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:02,820
Yes

369
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,800
You 're with me

370
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,020
You and I will go to Shanghai

371
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,780
It 's all good and no harm .

372
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,660
Let me tell you

373
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,619
If you don 't go to Shanghai with me

374
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:11,979
You are sick

375
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,940
Are you sick

376
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,619
What is my problem

377
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:15,060
I have no problem .

378
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,060
You have a big problem

379
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,940
What is my problem ?

380
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:18,140
Let me tell you this

381
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,379
This matter of falling in love

382
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:20,499
Is it my pleasure ?

383
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:21,140
Talk

384
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,219
Going to Shanghai is the same

385
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:23,660
I 'm happy . Do you understand ?

386
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,579
I understand .

387
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,099
I will choose if you choose

388
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,079
Went to Shanghai with me

389
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:29,400
Right

390
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,140
These are the best choices , right ?

391
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:32,540
What can we discuss ?

392
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,979
I don 't understand your argument

393
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:34,400
Let 's stop fighting

394
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:34,940
Let 's stop fighting

395
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,579
Can we stop fighting ?

396
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,660
A colleague will come up later

397
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,820
It 's bad for colleagues to come up

398
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,200
Right

399
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,619
Stop arguing

400
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:39,160
I really want to

401
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,820
Make them visible

402
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,739
No , I stopped them all

403
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:41,499
They won 't see it

404
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:42,099
Be good , good , good , good , good , good .

405
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:42,739
Can you stop

406
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,719
What are you pretending to be ?

407
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,540
You clearly

408
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:51,859
You clearly understand

409
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:52,739
What am I talking about

410
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,379
You know what I want .

411
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:56,099
Just pretend you don 't understand .

412
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:56,820
Is it interesting

413
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:59,420
Playing a rogue to coax me

414
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,540
You use these tricks every time

415
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:03,739
Because you don 't want to communicate with me

416
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:05,099
You 're too lazy to communicate with me .

417
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,820
Do you think you 're coaxing me ?

418
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,859
Save time and effort

419
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:09,379
Am I right

420
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,759
What breaks the sunset

421
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,859
Hangzhou is quite beautiful

422
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,440
I 'm working with everyone .

423
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440

I know I actually

425
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,999

426
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,599

428
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,040

429
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Tolerance and care for me

430
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,959
I 'll do it first , okay

431
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:02,959

Call the wind and call the rain to succeed

459
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,380
One of our own

461

Yes

470
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,120
I said

Everyone , drink slowly

476
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:30,799

478
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,819
I can 't figure it out

479

I just don 't understand .

480
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:37,499
Mr. Qin

481
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,180
Are you afraid of leaking the news

482
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,080
Are you afraid that your future is uncertain

483
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,180
You you didn 't tell

00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,059
Your subordinate Gu Yunsu

485
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:43,940
I can understand

486
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:44,779
But you are

487
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:45,539
For what reason

488
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,160
You don 't follow your

489
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,180

490
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,299

What are you doing

496
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,299
What are you doing

497
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:01,900
You 're crazy I 'm crazy

498
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,019
I 'm crazy I 'm crazy

499
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:04,539
Why

500
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,499
I know you 're angry right now

501
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,019
You can 't listen to many words

502
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:11,640
But I have to

503
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,739
I 'll explain it to you again

504
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,739
Why do I

505
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,019
I haven 't told you for so long

506
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,380
It 's because I want everything

507
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,539
When everything is arranged

508
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:18,319
I 'll tell you again

509
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,559
because I thought you 'd be happy

510
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,019
I guess you 'll be happy

511
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:22,080
Because it 's a good thing

512
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,180
Is this a good thing

513
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,900
I just want to know

514
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,299
I 'm not leaving today

515
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,600
Will it shake you

516
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,680
Yes , of course it will be shaken .

517
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,019
You waver but you still go

518
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,620
This is a good thing

519
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:34,059
If you don 't believe me , ask the people inside .

520
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:34,860
Who doesn 't want to go

521
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,279
Which is not

522
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,380
I sharpened my head and wanted to go

523
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,180
Then you 're with them .

524
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,059
Why are you talking to me ?

525
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,180
I love you

526
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,279
Why do you want to go with them

527
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,140
Together

528
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,019
You don 't love me

529
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,499
You love yourself

530
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:25,999
I like you

531
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:28,420
It 's because you 're ambitious .

532
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,180
So both of us

533
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,120
Don 't suffer anymore

534
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,059
You should have gone

535
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,259
I shouldn 't have thought

536
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:36,360
Put an aspirant

537
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,700
Become a love brain

538
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,239
Maybe you like that

539
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,140
I don 't like it .

540
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:41,940
You should go

541
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:43,620
I wish you high flying

542
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,059
You go , really

543
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:53,059
All of you have planned

544
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,259
Your Future

545
00:20:57,499 --> 00:20:59,100
But I think your future

546
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,539
I 'm not in it

547
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:05,200
If you had me

548
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,259
You should ask me

549
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:09,959
I think you should ask me

550
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,819
Because I have no idea

551
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:14,799
Where are you going

552
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,979
What are you doing

553
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,779
I was only informed

554
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,420
Did you know

555
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,459
You are all very smart

556
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:23,759
Particularly awake

557
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,299
Especially know what you want to do

558
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,080
You all live better than I understand

559
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,979
It 's like I 'm a fool

560
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,360
I don 't understand anything

561
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,340
I don 't appreciate it yet

562
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,620
I 'm so ignorant I

563
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,799
You are willing to do so

564
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,180
I have planned my life

565
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:41,620
I 'll tell you

566
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,259
You people are all the same

567
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,819
You 're all self - righteous

568
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,620
Clever

569
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:48,499
You 're all good for me

570
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:50,140
This is good

571
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,620
I just don 't want it

572
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:58,959
I

573
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,940
No more

574
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,039

575
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,539
I want to give everyone

576
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,019
A toast

577
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,479
I know our company

578
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,539
No Office Romance

579
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:41,580
I

580
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,739
Breaking the law and discipline for three years

581
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:45,680
My fault

582
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,900
Sorry

583
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,860
I 'm sorry everyone

584
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,739
Usually , I often shout .

585
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:51,880
I have today 's results

586
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,979
It 's because I try hard

587
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:53,739
But

588
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,479
But I know

589
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,779
I 've also taken advantage of President Qin .

590
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:03,180
So you 're privately

591
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,059
You scolded me as a connected household

592
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:06,019
Look down on me

593
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,539
Your scolding is right

594
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:09,180
I am indeed a related user

595
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:12,380
I 'm sorry

596
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:20,819
Second cup

597
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:23,979
I respect President Qin

598
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:25,059
Qin Yuxuan

599
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:32,900
Thank you for so many years

600
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,779
Shelter me from wind and rain

601
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:36,420
Escort

602
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,539
Thank you

603
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:41,700
Without you

604
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,100
I probably can 't do it either

605
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,739
The position of Team Leader

606
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,959
Even if I think

607
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,819
I 'm actually doing pretty good .

608
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
So ?

609
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,920
This superior - subordinate relationship

610
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,719
Don 't turn into a love relationship

611
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:53,700
Easily deformed

612
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:55,120
For example

613
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,900
I can 't get it

614
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,219
His minimum respect

615
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,180
And the respect you all have for me

616
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,580
From now on

617
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,340
I don 't want this guy

618
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,940
Look down on me

619
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,620
And I don 't want you all

620
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:21,940
Look down on me

621
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,700
So I 'm here to announce

622
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,940
Qin Yuxuan

623
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,180
I don 't want it .

624
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,440
Say it again

625
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,259
Qin Yuxuan

626
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:35,259
I don 't want it .

627
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,959
I don 't want the team leader either

628
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,700
I didn 't earn it myself

629
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,279
I don 't want any of them .

630
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,380
Mom

631
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:17,940
What did you take with you ?

632
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:19,860
Photo

633
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:21,420
Poems you wrote as a child

634
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,380
Paintings and some handwork

635
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,759
You have all your toys with you

636
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:27,019
You 're almost out of the house .

637
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,660
Can you

638
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,380
Put yourself high

639
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,739
Put it aside

640
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,580
Food and clothing

641
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,739
It 's not more important than backbone .

642
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:34,900
You 're still young

643
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,700
You 'll understand when you grow up

644
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:39,860
Eat people with a short mouth and take others with a soft hand

645
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:41,100
I didn 't earn it .

646
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:42,100
Don 't want it .

647
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,880
You can earn more money

648
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:46,539
You can buy things again

649
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,080
Don 't underestimate this box

650
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,940
Something that carries memories

651
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
If it 's gone

652
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,499
Then the route is really broken .

653
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,059
Mom , you 've come from a long way .

654
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:57,819
I don 't know

655
00:25:57,979 --> 00:25:59,580
Your path is broken anyway

656
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,620
Wait a minute , wait a minute

657
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:06,819
Master , wait a minute , wait a minute

658
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:11,580
Mom

659
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:13,660
Help a taxi

660
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,779
What a waste of money for taxis

661
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,019
It 's fine

662
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,620
I brought you some

663
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,700
Useful possessions

664
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,620
A lot of them .

665
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,420
Rich

666
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,459
You can hold a taxi

667
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,360
Let 's go

668
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:41,200
Thank you , Susu

669
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,840
Mom

670
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,140
When is your next time

671
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,999
Come back to see me

672
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:58,340
Next time

673
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,080
Wait for me and your dad

674
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,200
All the formalities are completed

675
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,519
How long will it take ?

676
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:04,880
Didn 't you tell me

677
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,640
Do you have to follow your father

678
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,479
I thought

679
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,360
Why do you think

680
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,559
Nothing

681
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,340
I just don 't understand why you

682
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,680
I insist on divorcing my dad

683
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:21,640
Susu , you 're still young

684
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,719
Many things

685
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,680
I told you you didn 't understand .

686
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,680
You have to say it even if I don 't understand it

687
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,259
The car is here

688
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,719
Master , I put my stuff in front .

689
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:40,539
Susu gets on the bus

690
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,559
It 's fine

691
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,160
I went home after I saw you off

692
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,640
All the cars were taken

693
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,200
Two steps away from home

694
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,759
Be stubborn , you

695
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,039
So you 're home

696
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,080
Give me a call .

697
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:53,039
It still rings three times

698
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,160
Ring three times to save money

699
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,759
Be careful on the road

700
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,819
Mom

701
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,559
Help me

702
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,259
Save this

703
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:23,779
I don 't know what to do

704
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,580
Losing direction and interest in life

705
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,299
Can 't get any motivation

706
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:29,319
Me who escaped

707
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,200
Those backlog in

708
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,680
Little disappointments in life

709
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,979
Those that I don 't even want to mention again

710
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:35,680
Unsatisfactory

711
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,719
Mom

712
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,039
I know life is hard

713
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,719
Everyone has endless sufferings

714
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,860
I know that too

715
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:47,259
Real world and fairy life

716
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,259
Completely different

717
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,900
I know all this

718
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,080
But I 'm just too tired

719
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,600
I don 't want to face it yet

720
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,979
So a heavy life

721
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
Can I still

722
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,019
Be your child again

723
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,759
What are you running for , Susu

724
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,799
What 's wrong

725
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:15,499
I still want to be with you

726
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,860
Can you take me with you

727
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,239
I don 't think I can go home .

728
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,299
I am twenty-eight years old this year

729
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,900
I can 't be anyone 's child

730
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,459
Not a qualified adult either .

731
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:19,620
Life is messed up by myself

732
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,620
No wonder who

733
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,019
Hello

734
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:26,340
Is there any reservation here ?

735
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,420
Hello , do you have an appointment

736
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:29,340
Which private room do you have

737
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:30,739
Sorry

738
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:31,979
Our children are not allowed to enter

739
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:34,259
Ms.

740
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:39,819
Pay attention to private rooms

741
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,100
Two uninvited guests came

742
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,059
Miss , please

743
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,459
Can you look after the child for me ?

744
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,059

Everyone is all together today

I must talk to everyone

761
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,239

You don 't say anything .

926
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,120

Ask yourself

934
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,700
The two months I 've been gone

935
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,219
Have you ever managed Gu Yunsu ?

936
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:57,140
Every morning

Has the homework been handed in on time

939
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:00,540
Do you know

940
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:01,580
Have you asked

941
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,339
Do you think you

942
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:03,620
You give her some pocket money

943
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,560
You deserve to be a father

944
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,339
You don 't deserve it .

945
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,379
Be a good father

946
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,779
Children need companionship

947
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,879
Can you give it ?

948
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:09,580
You can 't give it .

949
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:10,180
You remember

You 've been gone for two months

951
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:11,680
These two months

952
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,379
Are you looking for a job

953
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:12,919
Still making money

954
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:13,939
You still stayed with her

955
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,140
You didn 't do anything

956
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:18,040
Why don 't I deserve to be a father ?

957
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,719
Let me ask you

958
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,879
Why am I unworthy ?

959
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,480

960
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,239
I want to accompany her too

961
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,299
Who will accompany you ?

962
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,600
If I accompany you , I have to lose money .

00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,520
I 'll accompany you

964
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,339

Who makes money ?

967
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,739
I don 't make money

968
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:31,219
What do you eat
