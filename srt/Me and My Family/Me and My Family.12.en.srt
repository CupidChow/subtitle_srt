1
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,901
Please close your eyes when it 's dark

2
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:20,180
Campaign for Monitor Starts

3
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,121
Raise your hand if you vote for Lao Yuan

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,161
Three Two Put One Hand Down

5
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,120
Please raise your hand if you vote for Xiaogu

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,180
Three Two Put One Hand Down

7
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:45,801
Open your eyes at dawn

8
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,701
Who

9
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,441
Who is the monitor

10
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,600
Who is it ?

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,640
Who is

12
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:53,540
Close your eyes at all times

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,261
Ladies follow the rules of the game very well

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,061
Who is it ?

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,341
What are you looking at me ?

16
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:00,500
Do I look like a person with my eyes open

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,481
It 's not that there 's no host

18
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:03,780
Who knows who voted for whom ?

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,320
Yeah , no one saw it

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:05,941
Yeah

21
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,581
This

22
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:08,180
I know I thought of it

23
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:09,441
Let 's get a mobile phone

24
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:10,540
Record a video there

25
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,341
Watch the video when the time comes

26
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,460
Don 't you know who it is ?

27
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,960
Learn to be smart , learn to be smart

28
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,760
Come , come , come , come

29
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:15,620
Wait a minute

30
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:17,661
Are you sick ?

31
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,340
It 's better to open your eyes .

32
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:21,060
I don 't want to play with you anymore

33
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:51,560
Come in and have a look

34
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:54,780
As expected of Mr. Luo

35
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:55,940
Take me to see each time

36
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,921
Different men

37
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:58,440
Or show me different industries

38
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:00,000
You You

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,220
What did the last store sell ?

40
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,720
Camping equipment

41
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,981
Yes , yes , what about that store ?

42
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:04,660
Quit

43
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:06,280
I went out early

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,120
How long did you have

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,421
Don 't pay attention to my career anymore

46
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:09,780
What do I call this

47
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,541
Timely Stop Loss

48
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,521
Break when it breaks

49
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:14,981
Don 't be affected by these

50
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,521
Sunk costs are stuck

51
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,581
Your philosophy of life

52
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:19,560
Only for those

53
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,900
People with their own capital

54
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,301
What do you like

55
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,601
Remember it in silence

56
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
I don 't want it if you give it to me .

57
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,741
I can hardly feed myself

58
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:29,021
That 's true

59
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:31,521
Coffee

60
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:35,560
So fast

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,741
Try it when you are prepared .

62
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:39,301
Go ahead and do your work

63
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:39,761
OK

64
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,840
Delicious

65
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:47,421
Sure enough

66
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,440
Serious men are the most attractive

67
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,361
How about

68
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,581
Coffee is pretty good

69
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:58,120
I 'm asking you how he is

70
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,141
As long as you like it

71
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,981
I 'm afraid you 'll be boring as a caregiver

72
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:03,981
Find you some condiments for life

73
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:05,460
You don 't have to

74
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,880
Save it for yourself .

75
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,560
Don 't tell me that Qin Yuxuan

76
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,541
I still remember it

77
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,321
He is to me

78
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:11,421
It 's a thing of the past .

79
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,741
That 's in the past tense

80
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,741
You should open your heart

81
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:15,460
Open yourself

82
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,201
Look around this

83
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:16,981
A Beautiful World

84
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:19,261
Then look for the next prey

85
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,220
For you

86
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,321
Love is hunting

87
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,500
But for me

88
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,921
Love still has to be moving

89
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,680
Heartbeat is uncertain

90
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,260
Once you understand better

91
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,180
You will find that

92
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:31,380
What you like

93
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,260
Just the man you think he is

94
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,541
Might as well be like me

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,981
Take care of the kidney but not of the heart

96
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,541
Simple and straightforward

97
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,380
If

98
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:39,961
You just because

99
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,221
on someone

100
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:42,781
Some Aspect

101
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:43,940
Then you are attracted to him

102
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,981
That kind of excitement

103
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,680
It will definitely not stand scrutiny

104
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:47,601
But

105
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,401
As the two slowly approached

106
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:50,520
This heart

107
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,060
It can be accumulated over time

108
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,781
The points are then connected into lines

109
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Slowly

110
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,281
Occasionally you

111
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:01,361
You 'll mention him

112
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,961
Remember him

113
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
That should be

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,661
You really like it

115
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,801
I can probably understand

116
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:10,661
What you mean

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,961
It is quantitative change to qualitative change

118
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,601
This is how I am

119
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,921
If I like him , I will miss him

120
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:17,961
I told you

121
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,281
It 's not a kind of concern .

122
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:21,041
Have you ever had that time

123
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,981
That is to a person

124
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:24,520
You will feel sorry for him

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,301
Then he wanted to protect him

126
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:27,101
Even

127
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,101
You still have a little bit of compassion

128
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:31,500
Compared to his perfect look

129
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,801
You seem to like him better

130
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:33,721
The vulnerable side

131
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:36,541
I can 't cry

132
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,020
I am a sunny and cheerful boy

133
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,680
Sometimes I want to tease him

134
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,461
Because of his embarrassed look

135
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,880
Pretty cute

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,801
Hate

137
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:53,461
I 'm just using an analogy

138
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,341
You have a situation

139
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,241
I 'm 24 hours

140
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:57,580
Is personal escort okay ?

141
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,361
I don 't have time to do anything

142
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,221
OK

143
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,060
OK

144
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,120
Where did you meet ?

145
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,841
What ?

146
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:11,661
What is it ?

147
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:12,180
None

148
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,901
Where has it developed ?

149
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:14,041
Nothing I said

150
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:14,940
Holding hands

151
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,380
Hook your fingers

152
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:17,861
What are you talking about

153
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:21,921
Have some coffee

154
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:25,060
Or

155
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:26,041
Practice

156
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,741
is the only criterion for testing truth

157
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,520
Give a kiss

158
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:31,140
Your body will tell you the answer

159
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,080
My mother is looking for me

160
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:32,940
It 's been out for too long

161
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,041
The employer should be angry

162
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:36,200
You leave again

163
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,301
Who made you late today

164
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,020
You haven 't said who it is yet

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,841
Who

166
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,620
I didn 't say

167
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,741
You have a lot of mosquitoes here

168
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:43,140
Couldn 't be from the hospital ?

169
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:45,380
Why now

170
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,820
Look , no man is tall .

171
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:51,221
The man is only 1.85 meters tall

172
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,481
Cai

173
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,120
Dr. Xu

174
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,601
Can I sit here

175
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:10,101
Thank you

176
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,041
My sister said she would listen to you

177
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,041
Moderate taboo

178
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:15,041
We do a lot at home

179
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,541
Highly nutritious meals

180
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:18,180
Dr. Xu

181
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:19,981
Let 's eat some together

182
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,060
No need

183
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:24,101
Have a little

184
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:25,640
Think of it as helping me overcome it .

185
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:26,161
Are you okay

186
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,260
No No No No

187
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,221
Get over it

188
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:29,080
I don 't need it , I don 't need it , okay

189
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,421
I can help you overcome it together

190
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:33,680
I just have two more dishes here

191
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,041
I still have soup . It 's delicious .

192
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,700
Aunt Wu has a good appetite today

193
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,140
My real father didn 't come today

194
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,301
How did Aunt Wu react ?

195
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,541
Said he was the same

196
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,180
What are you doing

197
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,260
Three minutes of heat

198
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,401
Shrimp I 'm so cute to eat shrimp

199
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:50,901
No No No No

200
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:51,901
You eat you eat

201
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,320
Can I have a shrimp

202
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,301
Is there any sauce

203
00:07:59,421 --> 00:07:59,880
None

204
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,541
I can get some sauce next time

205
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,301
Better tasting

206
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:03,680
Next time you make shrimp

207
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,301
Tell me about it

208
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,221
I 'll prepare the sauce here

209
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,361
So tender

210
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:13,461
I 'll check it out

211
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,981
There 's a little sauce over there

212
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:16,041
I just ordered more food .

213
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,241
I have a good appetite today

214
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,101
Enough

215
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:25,180
I also like tomatoes and eggs

216
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,580
Not bad

217
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:28,580
This long time

218
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,020
You finally have an appetite .

219
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,080
That means you cooked delicious .

220
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,820
Today

221
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,820
Eat well

222
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,700
I 'm happy

223
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:37,140
Done eating

224
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,820
I 'm coming I 'm coming

225
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:38,940
How about

226
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,941
I didn 't eat a bite .

227
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,461
Went to fetch water

228
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,120
Go well

229
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,040
What you did today

230
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,120
What are they all ?

231
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,741
What about this soup

232
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:52,461
It 's Black Chicken Matsutake Mushroom Soup

233
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:54,341
The dish is scrambled egg with leeks

234
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,300
A nourishing yin

235
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,341
An aphrodisiac

236
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,361
Dry wood fire

237
00:08:58,361 --> 00:08:59,461
Good things are coming

238
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,681
Finished Eating

239
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,341
I appreciate Dr. Xu .

240
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:06,101
This is a pleasure .

241
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:07,540
There are different reward methods

242
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,160
Some are just diligence

243
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:11,160
Then some light is pity

244
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,181
Wen Wen

245
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,861
You always have to weigh yourself

246
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:15,861
You need to know yourself

247
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,321
Which light is worthy of

248
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:19,581
There is also a lot of light next door

249
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,380
There 's a green light right now

250
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,221
What do they say about green light

251
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:23,961
Leave it alone

252
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,481
You said there were some people here

253
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,461
Big belly

254
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:28,581
I still want to enjoy the blessing of Qi people

255
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,900
How do you say that ?

256
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,581
A moment of proud satisfaction

257
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:32,721
I can 't be proud of myself forever

258
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:34,420
Look at our ward

259
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,961
That time management guru

260
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,361
After my husband comes , my ex - husband comes

261
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:39,461
How about it in the end

262
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:40,701
No , it 's better to survive one

263
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,280
I think this is now

264
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,000
Also soon

265
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,400
Open low and move high

266
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,380
It 's better than driving high and moving low

267
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,981
At least it won 't be a joke

268
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,800
Who are they talking about ?

269
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:51,821
She

270
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,201
Go wash the dishes .

271
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:58,020
Good

272
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,380
Are you still awake

273
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,241
Did your family come ?

274
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,061
Dad

275
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,040
Isn 't this my father ?

276
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:10,481
Dad Dad

277
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,581
Are you his family ?

278
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:12,741
I am his family

279
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:13,660
What 's wrong ? What 's wrong with you

280
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,640
Why are you lying here ?

281
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,321
Where is it uncomfortable

282
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:17,040
Doctor He

283
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,681
Is he serious ?

284
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:19,520
What 's wrong ?

285
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,581
What 's wrong with you

286
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,780
Where do you hurt ?

287
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
Gallstones

288
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,660
Minor surgery

289
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,321
Cut once and for all

290
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,040
Key

291
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,181
There is no one at home to take care of it

292
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,461
Why is there no one to take care of me ?

293
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,341
What about Aunt Liu ?

294
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:37,701
That 's already separated

295
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:38,941
What about Xiao Zhang and Xiao Li

296
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,780
What is Xiao Zhang and Xiao Li ?

297
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:42,620
I don 't even remember what it looks like .

298
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:45,780
This young woman is unreliable

299
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,441
Yes

300
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:48,120
We young girls are unreliable

301
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,520
But an unreliable man

302
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,640
He doesn 't distinguish between old and young

303
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,181
You are teenagers to death

304
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:52,620
Right

305
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:54,681
I asked you how you are

306
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,500
I didn 't order food for Ms. Wu .

307
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,061
My body is out of order .

308
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:59,120
I can 't order food anymore

309
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,900
What did she say ?

310
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,500
Don 't care what she says

311
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,380
Don 't waste your effort

312
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:06,280
If it 's broken , it 's broken .

313
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,300
Which is that ?

314
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:09,500
This is the last step .

315
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,020
This is an excellent time

316
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,380
Isn 't it right ?

317
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:13,540
This is exactly

318
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:15,061
We 're getting back together

319
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,880
We are really suitable

320
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,341
This feeling is always there .

321
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:19,620
You have a good starting point

322
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,461
Let 's do it

323
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:21,581
You 're all lying here anyway

324
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,660
I called my mom over .

325
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,620
let you experience it

326
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,101
The feeling of wearing a couple outfit with her

327
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:25,660
How about

328
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:28,300
I think you understand .

329
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:30,800
Which line is this ?

330
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,461
Let me tell you

331
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:32,900
You must not tell your mother .

332
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:34,280
This makes your mother worry .

333
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,540
Haven 't you heard of it ?

334
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,561
Women to Love

335
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:38,221
A lot of it comes from pity

336
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:39,420
How did she ever see you like this ?

337
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,300
So weak

338
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Unable to take care of yourself

339
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,701
A delicate appearance

340
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,260
When she looked at her , her heart softened .

341
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,900
Did you know

342
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,140
It 's not that it can 't be said

343
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,361
I have idol baggage

344
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,081
You can 't let your mom

345
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:52,120
Seeing me like this

346
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,721
All right , then

347
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:56,181
Then I respect you

348
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:57,341
Then I won 't say anything .

349
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,061
I won 't tell her

350
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,821
Don 't say anything , okay

351
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:02,701
That 's right .

352
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:04,981
Don 't say it .

353
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,721
I won 't say anything .

354
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,481
I don 't want to talk about it .

355
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,581
Row Row

356
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,380
Just don 't say it .

357
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,181
Row Row

358
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:14,981
I 'll go look for it first

359
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:15,701
Your doctor

360
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,241
Look at you

361
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:16,961
What should I pay attention to

362
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,120
No , what do you mean you 're sitting ?

363
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,321
You sit you sit you sit

364
00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:20,061
I didn 't ask

365
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:21,280
How long will you stay in hospital

366
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
It 's not what you are

367
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,920
Are you questioning my condition ?

368
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,441
I

369
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:25,701
I still pretend to be sick

370
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:26,221
What happened

371
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:27,461
Are you guilty ?

372
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,660
What am I guilty of ?

373
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,821
My gallbladder is deficient

374
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:31,721
Dad

375
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,481
You 're not that crazy , are you ?

376
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:34,140
You 're not sick

377
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,160
Then you want to

378
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,561
In the same hospital with my mom , you

379
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,300
You give your good courage to

380
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,221
Do I

381
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:40,400
I 'm telling you I

382
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,461
The matter of holding hands

383
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,701
Am I like this ?

384
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,821
You wouldn 't

385
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:45,020
Let me show you the wound

386
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,400
I don 't look I don 't look

387
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,561
I 'll tell you if I 'm scaring you

388
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,620
Did anyone say you

389
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,020
It 's getting better and better now

390
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,201
Yes .

391
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,500
Aunt

392
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,380
Your skin is in good condition recently

393
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,500
It 's really pink and tender

394
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,300
Really

395
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,101
Looking at the nurse Susu

396
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:01,500
I took good care of you

397
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:03,140
Filial piety is filial piety

398
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:04,780
Sometimes .

399
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,260
Suddenly I can 't figure it out .

400
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,920
At that time

401
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,841
I really hate it

402
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:10,000
I think Su Su

403
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,581
She 's acting weird lately

404
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:13,420
Are you fancy to someone ?

405
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:15,420
What does that mean ?

406
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,000
She came over a few days ago

407
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:18,260
told me something

408
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,481
If there is no beginning or end

409
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:21,341
And he always giggles .

410
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:22,741
There is a situation at first glance

411
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,420
Who do you think this person is

412
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,441
Could this be Dr. Xu ?

413
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:29,961
Who is it ?

414
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:31,361
My attending doctor

415
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:33,420
As you say

416
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:34,821
It seems interesting

417
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,741
Really ? Come on , come on .

418
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,140
But our family is susu .

419
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,920
Stupid

420
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:39,800
She 's not like that

421
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,821
Smart little girl

422
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,581
What does she know

423
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:42,620
Whatever she chases

424
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,280
You know that

425
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,221
Susu Ne

426
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:45,040
She was a

427
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,821
Passive Person

428
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:47,101
And I didn 't figure it out

429
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:48,181
When the other person 's intentions are expressed

430
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:49,540
She won 't take the initiative either .

431
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:50,581
But

432
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,361
If the other party has any feelings for her

433
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,620
We can fuel the flames

434
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:55,701
Do you have a good idea

435
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,620
Let me listen

436
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:58,660
Great idea

437
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,221
Homecoming

438
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:09,620
Thank you Doctor Thank you Doctor

439
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,221
Thank you for your hard work . Goodbye

440
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,681
Hat

441
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,780
Pretty unique

442
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,721
Feel safe

443
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,321
Usually pay more attention

444
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:04,341
OK , Dr. Xu

445
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:22,861
So tired

446
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,640
Let me tell you

447
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,741
The next door said something

448
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:39,561
Said to cut off your sum

449
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,821
He also said that he would pry away Dr. Xu .

450
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:45,540
When it 's time to make a move

451
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,461
You have to take action .

452
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,380
Give me a little bit of excitement

453
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:48,660
Mom

454
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:49,581
Can you just take me

455
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:50,101
As a

456
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:51,500
You 're a simple nurse .

457
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,260
Give me some decency

458
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:52,900
Show me some respect

459
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Give me some privacy .

460
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:56,221
Caregiver

461
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,061
Put that flower basket

462
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:59,620
Take it to the doctor 's office

463
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:01,660
Pregnant women are allergic to pollen

464
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:03,500
Why are you going ?

465
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:04,441
Take action

466
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,721
Come on

467
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,400
Please enter

468
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,461
Why are you here

469
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:15,941
Here you go

470
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:17,941
It wasn 't from me

471
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,140
My friend gave it to my mom

472
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,181
Then I think about it

473
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:22,341
This is placed in pregnant women 's room

474
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:24,000
It seems a little out of place

475
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,481
Right

476
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,081
Beautiful

477
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:32,780
Dr. Xu

478
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,120
Are you on duty tonight

479
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:35,120
Not on duty

480
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:36,481
I 'll get off work soon

481
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:37,020
What 's wrong

482
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,620
Good

483
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,040
Come on

484
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,121
Have you drunk it ? Let me check it

485
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:23,181
Did you drink ? Did you drink ?

486
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,100
You didn 't drink

487
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:25,500
Lady , please come in and I have a drink .

488
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,621
I drank half of it

489
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:29,381
The fog in the sky comes carelessly

490
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,701
Sorry I 'm late

491
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,141
Why are you here ? Who are you ?

492
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,540
Who are you ?

493
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,221
Walk , walk , walk

494
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:38,921
What 's going on

495
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:39,921
Who Walks

496
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:40,820
Who told you to come

497
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,141
Walk , walk , walk

498
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:43,080
Wait a minute , wait a minute

499
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:43,701
Wait a minute

500
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,201
Why are you alone ?

501
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:45,701
What about him

502
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,241
Who ? Are you sick ?

503
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:52,000
Dissolve Dissolve Dissolve

504
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,860
What 's going on ?

505
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,040
I still want to play a scene .

506
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:55,300
Why didn 't you bring anyone here ?

507
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:03,681
Mei Mei

508
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,800
The doctor 's advice is to stay in bed

509
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,721
Come over here

510
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:07,820
How many times did it take ?

511
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
Let 's go back and lie down .

512
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,040
I 'm quiet

513
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,441
I just want to take a walk

514
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,600
It 's so stuffy there

515
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:15,721
Dr. Xiao Xu

516
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,401
Uncle and Aunt

517
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:18,520
Why are you still here

518
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,621
You did not participate

519
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,020
Will Susu 's classmates meet ?

520
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,381
I don 't know Su Su either

521
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:24,260
What am I going to do

522
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:25,040
That 's right

523
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:27,441
She told me that someone would go with her

524
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,840
That 's why I let her go .

525
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,461
I wouldn 't have let her go if I had known .

526
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:31,881
Save yourself from asking for trouble

527
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,241
Uncle Li happened to be here today

528
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,040
She went out to relax

529
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,881
It 's nice to play

530
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:37,461
That 's right

531
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,121
You don 't know

532
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,320
Her classmates

533
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,760
All of them are snobs

534
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,600
You 're doing well

535
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,800
Long live his friendship

536
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:44,820
Bad mix

537
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:46,520
Then all that 's left is being bullied .

538
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:47,721
Susu told me

539
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:48,741
She 'll find one

540
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:49,741
The guy she likes

541
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:50,540
Go with her

542
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,580
Help her block

543
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,520
That 's why I let her go

544
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,921
She didn 't come to you .

545
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,100
No

546
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,820
It 's possible that Susu said it

547
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:01,461
Not Dr. Xu

548
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,320
Susu told me

549
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:06,800
She said that this guy

550
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,641
She feels sorry for him .

551
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:10,000
Then she wanted to protect him

552
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,340
Sensitive and vulnerable

553
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,320
It doesn 't seem perfect

554
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:16,280
Dr. Xiao Xu

555
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,121
In our minds

556
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:18,161
It 's perfect .

557
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:18,701
Of course

558
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:19,540
That must have been said

559
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,481
It 's not Dr. Xu anymore

560
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:22,280
Dr. Xiao Xu is the perfect

561
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,141
It would be best if Xiao Xu went .

562
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:25,500
That 's right . If he goes

563
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,901
Then our family has a long face

564
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:28,000
Then why don 't you go

565
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,961
They didn 't invite him to go .

566
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:31,481
What the hell ?

567
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:34,141
And Dr. Xu is so busy

568
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:35,500
It doesn 't mean that Su Su Yi invited .

569
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,760
People will have time to go .

570
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,580
Yes , yes , yes , uncle

571
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,121
Uncle and Aunt

572
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,560
Hurry back and rest first

573
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,760
Dr. Xiao Xu

574
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,941
Just pretend I didn 't say anything .

575
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:42,961
Don 't take it personally

576
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,320
Come on , let 's keep going

577
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,580
Walk Go Go Go Go Go Go

578
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,121
Meimei , what you just said

579
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,461
Which one is true

580
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,600
All true

581
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,201
You 're doing well

582
00:19:58,201 --> 00:19:58,881
Why are you unemployed ?

583
00:19:58,881 --> 00:19:59,221
Why are you unemployed ?

584
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,860
You are unemployed

585
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,941
You are unemployed

586
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,941
She 's unemployed

587
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,340
You are unemployed

588
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,300
You need to

589
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,540
Is this a fuss ?

590
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,201
What happened to unemployment

591
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:11,901
Are you all doing well now

592
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:12,481
Is it

593
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,760
What 's wrong

594
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,320
My sisters are still being rappers

595
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,881
Did you know

596
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:22,941
I know the competition is intense

597
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:24,540
I 'm her manager

598
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:25,500
You have worked hard

599
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,340
It 's really hard .

600
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:27,520
And brokerage owner

601
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,020
I am a partner

602
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:29,901
There are still  in the company

603
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,100
Hundreds of artists are waiting .

604
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,060
You Always

605
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,461
She 's the first sister of our company .

606
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:34,580
Cool

607
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:36,461
Cool Come Walk

608
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:41,020
Avir

609
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:41,941
Your night

610
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,060
It looks weak

611
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,080
Are you okay

612
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:45,441
Your dream of directing

613
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:46,441
Are you still holding on

614
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:48,360
I gave up long ago

615
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,441
I gave up

616
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,060
Not what I meant

617
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:52,661
Giving up is the norm of life

618
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:53,421
Don 't be too upset

619
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:57,921
I am

620
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,121
This is the only one left

621
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:02,600
Stop it

622
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,661
Isn 't this from Luo Jingjing 's family ?

623
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,820
Isn 't this your family ?

624
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,401
This karaoke room

625
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:08,381
He said this building

626
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:11,961
His

627
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:13,441
My

628
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,540
OK

629
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,661
Xiao Xue

630
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:17,820
They all mix so well

631
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,560
You 're not bad either .

632
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:19,360
Let me guess

633
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,520
You 're a rich second generation

634
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:22,461
Then he took over your company

635
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,040
Right

636
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,621
You know this

637
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,020
True or false

638
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:27,280
Really

639
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,560
We have been classmates for so many years

640
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,260
How can I not know

641
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,020
You 're a rich second generation .

642
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:32,181
You never asked me

643
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,681
It 's my turn

644
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,461
I don 't want to hear it

645
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:37,921
Come and sing and drink

646
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,000
Come , come , come , come

647
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,121
Walk one by one

648
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:41,360
I 'm also unemployed

649
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,421
Tell me and listen

650
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,701
He 's unemployed

651
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,020
Really

652
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,100
You know it 's no big deal

653
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,080
Life is like a marathon

654
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:52,661
But in the middle of this run

655
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:54,961
I find it has no end

656
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,401
Yes

657
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:55,901
I don 't know

658
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:56,941
Where is my destination

659
00:21:57,181 --> 00:21:57,741
Yes

660
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,161
So I stopped .

661
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:01,421
I just want to take a break

662
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,580
Take a breath

663
00:22:03,381 --> 00:22:04,280
Is there any problem ?

664
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:05,860
Continue to fight

665
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,201
Cool

666
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:07,961
Cool

667
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,500
To the monitor

668
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,100
Respect Monitor Respect Monitor

669
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:12,840
One vote difference

670
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,661
This monitor is almost me

671
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:17,340
I voted for Monitor Lao Yuan

672
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,161
Not

673
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,121
I 'm afraid of you

674
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:22,401
After becoming the monitor

675
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:23,560
It 's our relationship

676
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,681
It will be a little distant

677
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,621
Baby

678
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:28,320
Being the monitor

679
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,760
Having money with men

680
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:31,141
It means one thing

681
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:31,760
Fuck you

682
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,641
Don 't believe me

683
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,300
I see

684
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:36,760
Lao Yuan

685
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,241
You shouldn 't be a lawyer

686
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,681
You should be like you said

687
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:42,780
You should run a marathon .

688
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:43,840
You 're so right

689
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,401
You don 't catch your breath when you are tired in the middle

690
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:46,860
How did you exert your strength in the second half of the race ?

691
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,141
I especially understand that you come to drink

692
00:22:51,381 --> 00:22:53,040
Uncle is in good health recently , right ?

693
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,881
Very good

694
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,040
Leverage

695
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,461
Let 's open champagne

696
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,941
I drank I drank

697
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,961
Hurry up , drink quickly

698
00:23:06,381 --> 00:23:07,221
Drink drink drink

699
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,800
Can you drink it ?

700
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,500
I finished it

701
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,580
No one drinks with me

702
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,701
Why did you run ?

703
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:13,100
This is good wine .

704
00:23:13,161 --> 00:23:13,840
Dr. Xu

705
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,760
Wait for my eyes

706
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,441
My eyes

707
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:17,360
Why are you here ?

708
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,461
Aunt Wu told me

709
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:20,421
If I don 't come

710
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:20,800
She

711
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,661
I think so

712
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,820
Tonight

713
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,141
Don 't drink Gu Yunsu wine anymore

714
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:28,381
Friends are coming , right ?

715
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:32,040
That gives me some face

716
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Are they drinking you ?

717
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,441
Of course

718
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:37,040
Not only do you drink Gu Yunsu wine

719
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,201
and mocked her

720
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:41,100
Said she couldn 't get on the table as a nurse

721
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:45,621
Who is this

722
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,421
Xu Wenbin and Gu Yunsu 's friend

723
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,860
They are all carers

724
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,320
He is a doctor

725
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:56,981
Amazing

726
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:58,621
Doctor is amazing

727
00:23:58,621 --> 00:23:59,260
I 'll just say it

728
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,481
Although that Gu Yunsu

729
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,461
Life is thinner than paper

730
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:02,540
But the heart is higher than the sky

731
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:03,260
She can 't do it by herself

732
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,901
I found a good man

733
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:07,060
Awesome , awesome , awesome

734
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,721
Lao Yuan , what you said is true

735
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,901
This statement hits the nail on the head

736
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:14,060
Gu Yunsu

737
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:17,080
You are now older and unemployed

738
00:24:17,641 --> 00:24:19,040
Work for your mother at home

739
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,741
Dedicated home care worker

740
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,340
What about in the future

741
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,600
Marry a good one again .

742
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,181
Being a full - time housewife

743
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,661
Your Life

744
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:29,280
Just rely on others

745
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,260
Who can outlive you ?

746
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:32,840
Sorry I didn 't understand

747
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,860
Home care workers and full - time housewives

748
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,981
Don 't you work by yourself ?

749
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,661
Not

750
00:24:37,661 --> 00:24:39,121
This does not contribute to society

751
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:40,760
The book is not wasted , is it

752
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,260
That 's right

753
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,421
You mean family unit

754
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:43,621
Does it not contribute to society

755
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:44,741
The funny thing is

756
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:46,201
She was shouting slogans last year

757
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:47,600
Strive to be an independent woman

758
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,681
I changed my mind this year

759
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,280
Yeah

760
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,441
I really laughed to death

761
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,780
Choose to work hard in the workplace

762
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:54,641
Or be a housewife at home

763
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:56,020
It depends only on one 's own choice

764
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:57,800
No one is superior to anyone else

765
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:00,060
Does it work all year round

766
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,840
Taking care of a home

767
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,100
Is it easier than 996

768
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:02,901
That 's a high probability

769
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:03,961
We have never faced it squarely

770
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,241
A Housewife 's Pay

771
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:06,921
If anyone thinks

772
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:08,421
Gu Yunsu takes care of her mother at home

773
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,540
If you can 't get on the table

774
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,540
Then I think

775
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,681
It 's not Gu Yunsu 's problem

776
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,360
She 's great in my eyes

777
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,401
He said it so well

778
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:21,340
I don 't understand .

779
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,320
Before he came

780
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,661
We had a good time

781
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:24,661
What a fun time .

782
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:25,461
Are you drinking too much ?

783
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:28,580
That 's too much

784
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,520
Wake up

785
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:35,161
Will you come with me

786
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:38,241
Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go

787
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:38,800
Continue

788
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,840
I

789
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:44,681
You go

790
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:46,760
Walk , walk , walk

791
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,020
Go , go , go , go quickly

792
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,681
Walk , walk , walk

793
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:49,580
Take her clothes .

794
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,060
Walk , walk , walk

795
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,381
There 's nothing to do with you .

796
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:53,320
Let 's go , let 's go , bye

797
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,760
And you

798
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,641
You two carers , right ?

799
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:55,401
Walk , walk , walk

800
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:56,760
Bye , go slow

801
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,580
Don 't send it .

802
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:58,260
Don 't ruin the fun

803
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,181
You two should go quickly

804
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:06,260
Card

805
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,421
I 'll call it a day for this article

806
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,381
Old Students

807
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:16,401
We 'll get together again in the future

808
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:16,941
Right

809
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:18,320
Of course

810
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,540
Seven fasts in one body

811
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,000
Seven fasts are one , Seven fasts are one

812
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,421
They

813
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,881
You just went back

814
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:40,981
They didn 't say anything , did they

815
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:41,760
None

816
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,881
They

817
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:47,340
Actually , they 're pretty good

818
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,161
They actually  today

819
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,441
I want to be in front of you

820
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,040
I seem to see it

821
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,540
I 'm talking about their acting skills

822
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,520
It 's really a bit poor

823
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,040
Not so and not

824
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,481
That 's it

825
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,961
It 's just a little strange

826
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:03,600
What did they do ?

827
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,860
A hero saves a beauty

828
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:05,961
I want to

829
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:17,421
What do they do to this hero ?

830
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:18,181
Are you satisfied ?

831
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,421
We are satisfied

832
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,921
He and them are particularly satisfied

833
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,421
They say you 're a good person .

834
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,141
So

835
00:27:35,141 --> 00:27:35,921
You

836
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,481
So late from the hospital

837
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,141
I came here specially

838
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:46,340
Because you 're worried about me

839
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:54,981
Yes

840
00:27:59,121 --> 00:27:59,580
But

841
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,181
But it seems that

842
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,241
Nothing to worry about .

843
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:07,020
It 's just a class reunion .

844
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,580
What 's there to worry about ?

845
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,401
Uncomfortable

846
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,241
Something is in my eye

847
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,681
Yes Yes Yes

848
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,121
It seems true

849
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:47,221
Yes No Yes No

850
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,340
It seems that the hair here is particularly long

851
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:50,760
I haven 't cut my bangs for a long time

852
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,141
Recently , I 'm not taking care of it .

853
00:28:52,641 --> 00:28:53,201
Let me help you see it

854
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:53,901
Let me take a look for you

855
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,141
You look up , look up

856
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,600
Up Up

857
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,681
It seems to be over there

858
00:29:10,721 --> 00:29:12,741
How about we take a closer look

859
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,901
I 'm afraid you won 't see

860
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,661
OK

861
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,580
Did I hit you

862
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,641
Is it a nose hit or a nose hit

863
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,580
I bit my mouth

864
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:58,540
Dr. Xu has gone .

865
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:01,820
Gone

866
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,721
Tell me the details .

867
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:08,641
Someone else is here

868
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:09,681
Not much detail

869
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,181
What 's wrong with your mouth

870
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:17,100
Broken lip

871
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,520
My lips are broken

872
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:26,040
Don 't think I don 't know

873
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,621
What 's in your mind

874
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:28,020
It 's all sort of dirty things

875
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:29,961
Not This This No

876
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:30,921
Lips are fine

877
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:32,201
Why is it broken ?

878
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:34,600
This

879
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:36,100
Tell me the details

880
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,121
This lip

881
00:30:38,721 --> 00:30:39,741
Tell the truth

882
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:41,881
Forget it , I told you too .

883
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,741
You don 't believe it either

884
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,241
Very ridiculous Very ridiculous

885
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:46,241
Tell me about it

886
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:46,621
Nothing

887
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:47,721
Why are you so gossip ?

888
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,441
Let me tell you .

889
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:49,320
Without me

890
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,741
Dr. Xiao Xu

891
00:30:49,741 --> 00:30:50,641
Won 't be there at all

892
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:51,320
Being a person should be grateful

893
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,441
You know how to repay your kindness

894
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:57,360
Go out

895
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,320
Tell me you

896
00:30:58,701 --> 00:30:59,260
Then this point

897
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,161
You 're going to sleep .

898
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:04,840
I won 't go out until you tell me .

899
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:06,760
I 'm gonna shit later

900
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,201
Then I 'll watch

901
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,921
It 's not like I haven 't seen you shit .

902
00:31:10,441 --> 00:31:11,881
When you were young , you pooped and peed

903
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:14,181
You are so annoying

904
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:15,600
This is me

905
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:17,040
When I apply my lipstick

906
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,360
That driver brakes

907
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,481
Then I hit it

908
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:20,520
You fart you

909
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:21,520
I said you wouldn 't believe it

910
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
I 'm waiting at the door

911
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,681
I 'll tell you if you don 't tell you

912
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:25,641
You are not allowed to sleep today

913
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:38,760
I know how to repay my kindness

914
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:40,661
This is my representation for you

915
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,641
Your ex - husband is out of courage

916
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:48,921
My God

917
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Then you can 't cook food .

918
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,241
I called the ambulance by myself

919
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,161
Surgery performed by myself

920
00:31:57,961 --> 00:31:59,600
Nobody takes care of it anyway

921
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,481
It 's quite pitiful .

922
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:03,600
In my fridge

923
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,621
Porridge made by Uncle Li

924
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:07,741
Bring him some .

925
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:08,881
Heat it up

926
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:10,320
OK

927
00:32:10,441 --> 00:32:11,441
Don 't bother .

928
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:12,280
You wait for me here

929
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:33,921
This fucking child

930
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,360
The more you tell her not to say it

931
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:36,840
The more she says

932
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,941
The more you talk to her , don 't say it

933
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:38,661
The more she says

934
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:40,600
Traitor

935
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,241
She told me

936
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:43,701
To give me an explanation

937
00:32:43,741 --> 00:32:44,381
You know that

938
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,701
Don 't worry

939
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:46,701
I 'll sit for a while and leave

940
00:32:47,741 --> 00:32:48,741
You come , you sit here

941
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:49,181
You sit here

942
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:50,080
I 'm sitting here I 'm sitting here

943
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,921
You 're welcome

944
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,921
It 's too far away .

945
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,181
Almost done

946
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:08,241
How did you recover ?

947
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,000
Is the recovery ok ?

948
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,320
Don 't say anything

949
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,080
Everything will be fine when you come .

950
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,881
I 'll get out of bed and give you a walk

951
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:21,941
Xing Gu Kang Qi Gu Kang Qi

952
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:24,520
Stop it .

953
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:27,381
I 'm too old to stand the manufacture

954
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:29,141
Take good care of it

955
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:30,760
This is where to go

956
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:31,941
I still ride a motorcycle

957
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:32,981
Can take you to fly

958
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,280
At that time , I drank too much and vomited

959
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:39,961
Come to the emergency room

960
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,540
This is still living in the upper house

961
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:43,381
What a shame .

962
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:44,181
Do you remember

963
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:45,461
You were on the ground at that moment

964
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,141
Do I drag you around

965
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,681
Really happy

966
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,600
If we were to

967
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,381
Ripped Memories

968
00:33:52,381 --> 00:33:53,280
I can remember a night

969
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:55,201
Nothing good to remember

970
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,020
What good memories are there ?

971
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:02,600
I know you 're alone in the hospital

972
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,381
Not a taste

973
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,621
I 'm you

974
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:06,241
This patient in distress

975
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:06,921
I can

976
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:09,260
I realize how you feel

977
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,221
I think you 're not so lonely .

978
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:13,320
Then I 'll listen to you .

979
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:15,441
What does it feel like

980
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:28,840
Regret

981
00:34:43,601 --> 00:34:44,320
I definitely listen

982
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,440
Just walk around .

983
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,241
You can try it on

984
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,800
I will definitely listen to you

985
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:49,460
You have experience , right ?

986
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:50,420
Yes

987
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,380
Li Mei

988
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,900
What do you think of this one

989
00:34:57,701 --> 00:34:58,721
It 's too expensive

990
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:00,260
I think this

991
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,460
It must look good on you

992
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:03,300
Boss Boss

993
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:04,661
You see

994
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:07,061
In my experience

995
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,101
Anyway , what you 're wearing

996
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:08,960
If you don 't have confidence

997
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,900
That 's really inappropriate

998
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:13,241
Small Capital Trading

999
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,001
Let 's go for small buying and selling

1000
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:15,221
Let 's look somewhere else

1001
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,681
Go

1002
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,760
Wait a minute , wait a minute

1003
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,721
I 'm not confident if I 'm so beautiful

1004
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:31,820
It 's not appropriate

1005
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,081
You 're so stupid . See you tonight

1006
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,181
He is the owner of this clothing store

1007
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,221
He 's afraid of us leaving

1008
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,661
Deliberately saying such nice words

1009
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:41,400
Let 's go

1010
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:42,980
Just trust us

1011
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,621
I think you can wear it

1012
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,960
It should be really nice .

1013
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,101
Besides , you go dance in the ballroom

1014
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:49,501
The place is dark and dark

1015
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:50,621
You just dress as much as you want

1016
00:35:50,621 --> 00:35:51,661
It 's not strange either

1017
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,260
Then you have to wear flowers .

1018
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,920
OK , I 'll try it

1019
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:55,601
Try

1020
00:36:02,681 --> 00:36:04,900
You are college students , right ?

1021
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:06,661
It 's going to dance in the ballroom

1022
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:07,741
It 's still a friendship .

1023
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,840
I 'll help you pick it out

1024
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,181
Our Jiangtang College

1025
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,280
Tonight I talked to Next Door Finance

1026
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,581
There is a co - organized event

1027
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,980
It 's a friendship .

1028
00:36:16,061 --> 00:36:17,760
This is possible

1029
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,741
It 's not so appropriate .

1030
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:22,780
That ballroom like that

1031
00:36:23,241 --> 00:36:23,741
Yes

1032
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:26,141
Everyone wears flowers

1033
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,760
I know that too

1034
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,501
You need to wear this clothes

1035
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:28,081
Definitely looks good

1036
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:28,800
Exceptional

1037
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:30,661
But

1038
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:32,940
It 's because everyone wears flowers

1039
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,221
If you wear this dress

1040
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,260
That definitely doesn 't have any features .

1041
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:36,800
Right

1042
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:39,181
I think the boss is right

1043
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:40,041
It makes sense

1044
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,661
Why don 't you try this

1045
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:46,621
This black shirt

1046
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,601
With these black pants

1047
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,641
Let 's just go for one .

1048
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,201
Indifference Advanced Route

1049
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:53,221
You believe me

1050
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,840
I 'm from Hangzhou

1051
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,521
Returned from business

1052
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:55,840
That little boss in our area

1053
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,420
Not as good as mine

1054
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:00,300
This is too plain .

1055
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,380
Black

1056
00:37:01,581 --> 00:37:03,001
The prime is a little prime

1057
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,360
But I want to be in the ballroom

1058
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,280
Beautiful

1059
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,661
It doesn 't depend on the color of clothing

1060
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,041
That 's what you see

1061
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,201
How many boys are there ?

1062
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:10,880
Number of invites to dance

1063
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,241
A creature like a man

1064
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,820
The higher it is

1065
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,641
The more he is eager to try

1066
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,460
Or Or

1067
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:27,721
That

1068
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,780
Wait a moment

1069
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:36,460
Come on , take it

1070
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,701
You take it first

1071
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:40,320
You can try it tonight

1072
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,420
You don 't have to give me the money first

1073
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,760
What if I 'm right

1074
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,721
Come back and give me the money

1075
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:45,900
If you think I 'm wrong

1076
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,820
Just bring it to me later

1077
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,420
Right

1078
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,001
This is not quite

1079
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:54,021
This is not appropriate

1080
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:55,621
There 's nothing out of place

1081
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,360
Not Jiangtang College

1082
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,960
I can trust college students

1083
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,360
I won 't take off the tag for now

1084
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,860
You can pick it if you want .

1085
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:10,400
It 's beautiful

1086
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,661
You see how happy they are dancing

1087
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,460
Do you know those moves ?

1088
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,820
I 'm not familiar with it

1089
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,001
You 're with them anyway

1090
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:34,480
Just learn from it

1091
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,701
I 'm not very good at it

1092
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,360
Go

1093
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,780
Please dance

1094
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,021
Who wants to dance with you

1095
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:27,340
There must be a lot of people today

1096
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,581
I invite you to dance

1097
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,621
None of them

1098
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:33,300
What clothes did you choose for me

1099
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,061
I 've been here all night

1100
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:36,661
No one can see me .

1101
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:38,741
But I saw you

1102
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:43,780
Did you mean it

1103
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,681
Didn 't you know it ?

1104
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:45,581
This will be the effect

1105
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:46,521
You 're kidding me

1106
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:48,221
I am protecting you

1107
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,061
Where is anyone in the ballroom

1108
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:51,041
Choose a boyfriend

1109
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:52,780
Who wants your protection

1110
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:57,920
Yunxi , I 'm gone

1111
00:39:58,101 --> 00:39:58,860
You can play

1112
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,460
Li Mei

1113
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:00,501
I 'm gone I 'm gone

1114
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:01,760
I 'll send you I 'll send you

1115
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:08,460
That boss is so unreliable

1116
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,280
Blind idea

1117
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:10,601
I won 't go to his store again

1118
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:12,340
Alright , go back quickly .

1119
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,001
It 's cold outside

1120
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:14,001
Let me walk you to the door

1121
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,701
You really don 't have to go .

1122
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:16,501
Have fun

1123
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,241
Then slow down on your way back

1124
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:18,960
Don 't worry

1125
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:20,300
Be safe

1126
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,021
Li Mei

1127
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,561
Let me send it to you

1128
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:27,420
My car is here

1129
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:28,820
Who wants you to send me

1130
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,501
You see you don 't know this place

1131
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:34,081
Out of this door this street

1132
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,900
Notoriously unsettled at night

1133
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,121
I don 't know you

1134
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,121
How can you not know me ?

1135
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,840
Didn 't you go to my clothing store ?

1136
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:43,940
Looking forward to brilliance

1137
00:40:44,161 --> 00:40:45,260
I 'm the boss there

1138
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,440
So I see you

1139
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,501
Not like a good person

1140
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,940
I 'm not a good person

1141
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:03,641
Limei , wait for me

1142
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,621
Soon Soon

1143
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:06,460
One bottle of Coke

1144
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,241
OK

1145
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:08,221
Soon

1146
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,300
Put the money here

1147
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:14,001
This is my business card

1148
00:41:14,001 --> 00:41:15,181
Please help me to witness

1149
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:17,840
I want to take her home

1150
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,501
But she 's worried I 'm a bad guy

1151
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:20,581
She was this evening

1152
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:21,460
There is any danger

1153
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,221
Tell the police to find me there .

1154
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,340
OK

1155
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:25,860
Do you have a driver

1156
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,400
Yes

1157
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:27,880
Thank you

1158
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:33,581
You should believe me this time

1159
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:40,860
I 'm not trying to hurt you

1160
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:42,280
I really want to chase you

1161
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:55,741
