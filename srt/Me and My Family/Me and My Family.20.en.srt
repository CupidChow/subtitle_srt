1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,501
Gu Yunsu , don 't be beautiful

2
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:17,220
Come out for breakfast

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,341
Go to school after dinner

4
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:19,220
Wait a minute

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,460
Don 't dawdle

6
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:21,081
Come out

7
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,061
Talk well but don 't listen , right ?

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,860
Hurry

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,821
Gu Yunsu 32

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:32,920
Sit down

11
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:35,821
On your head

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,661
You ring the bell

13
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,321
What are you stuck with ?

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,981
Don 't mess with me .

15
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:41,741
It depends on you

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,660
Early morning

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,120
What are you doing with me here ?

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Why are you eating these again

19
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,701
Just eat these , no choice .

20
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:47,660
I don 't eat it

21
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,321
Is it just because of that day

22
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,220
I didn 't buy you a school bag

23
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,660
You can 't do it .

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,741
because of a schoolbag

25
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:53,681
Picked me up for days

26
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:54,741
Little temper

27
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:55,781
You are so stingy

28
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,300
Wait a minute , are you sneaking me ?

29
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,021
You

30
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:01,101
What do you mean ?

31
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,061
Gu Yunsu

32
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:03,421
You 're amazing now

33
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,260
Your tiger 's ass

34
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,061
I can 't touch it

35
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:05,940
I don 't

36
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,340
You

37
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:07,501
What are you shouting for ?

38
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,220
Eat quickly

39
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,860
I said I wouldn 't eat it

40
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,580
Why don 't you give me something else ?

41
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,661
I can 't change it

42
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:13,661
Eat quickly

43
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,101
Put your dog leash after dinner

44
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:15,920
Take it off

45
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,581
If you want me to eat or not

46
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,540
Gu Yunsu went to school

47
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,381
Gu Yunsu , sit down .

48
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,060
Gu Yunsu , I 'm leaving

49
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,340
Gu Yunsu , I 'm leaving

50
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:25,340
Gu Yunsu , you 've eaten your meal .

51
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:31,900
Yours looks good

52
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,161
Yes

53
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:33,661
I brought you these sunglasses

54
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,661
I have it too

55
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:40,461
Our bracelet

56
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:41,801
Take a good look , too

57
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,181
I also have them all yellow

58
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,260
Let 's go

59
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,480
Walk

60
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,780
Stop and walk down

61
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:51,161
Stick to five numbers

62
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:52,521
Hold on

63
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:54,340
Straighten your legs and stretch your instep

64
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,920
III

65
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:56,480
Are you okay ?

66
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,441
Wuhao Gets Up

67
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,280
Very good .

68
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,941
I said

69
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:04,661
You 're old now

70
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:06,000
And forcing you to learn to dance

71
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:07,480
Your mother is so hard - hearted

72
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:09,081
Harder than my ligaments

73
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:10,241
I hate her

74
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:11,221
I've been  this week

75
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,681
I quarreled with her twice

76
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:13,760
She said

77
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,120
I 've reached puberty

78
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,821
Rebel

79
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,021
She made me exhaust my strength

80
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,081
Lest she be angry

81
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:19,981
I doubt it .

82
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:21,560
She 's messing with you right now

83
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:23,440
This is disguised corporal punishment

84
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,340
If I don 't accept it , I will spend my time with her

85
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,820
My mother does this every day .

86
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:29,880
In my ear

87
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,241
Nan Nan Nan Nan Nan Nan Nan Nan Nan Nan Nan Nan

88
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,440
Annoying as hell

89
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,741
Think I 'm right about everything

90
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,481
I'm  now

91
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,041
I don 't want to talk to her anymore

92
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:38,840
If you say a few more words , your heart will be angry

93
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,581
You are better than me after all

94
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:42,981
You have your own room

95
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,780
I sleep with my mom every day

96
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,880
I 'm bored to death

97
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,380
Then your mother did this to you

98
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,081
What do you plan to do

99
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,340
I want precision

100
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,961
Combating Wu Limei 's pain point

101
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,100
What are you doing ?

102
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,780
Stretch your legs , stretch them

103
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,961
Stretch the instep well

104
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,060
Knee straight

105
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,620
Outside Out

106
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,060
Pain

107
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,320
Pain is effective

108
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,681
What is her pain point

109
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,320
Puppy Love

110
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:14,720
Pain Point

111
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:16,481
He

112
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,280
So small .

113
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,120
It 's a little small .

114
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,741
I 'll find you another one then

115
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:26,780
Then accompany me to find it .

116
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,581
Line

117
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,661
The baby 's fingers finally spread

118
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,560
All Ten Fingers

119
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
Everything is fine with baby

120
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,880
Congratulations , both of you .

121
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,820
That

122
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,380
It 's so good .

123
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,681
Thank you for your hard work , Director Wu

124
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,500
Have you thought of the baby 's name ?

125
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,101
Let 's go back and think about it

126
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:15,020
His father is a little nervous right now

127
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:16,901
None of the names selected can be used

128
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,580
I 'm so excited , so excited

129
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:23,880
Thank you , beautiful woman .

130
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:24,580
Boss

131
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,620
How much does it cost to try this on me

132
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,000
The little girl has a good eye

133
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,760
Let me tell you

134
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,181
This item is the original foreign trade order

135
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:31,981
This one is eighty .

136
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,341
This material costs eighty .

137
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,481
Thirty

138
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,080
You want my life

139
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,241
I 'm going to lose money at thirty .

140
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,760
You look really pretty in this

141
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,601
Show Your Face

142
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:41,601
White and tender

143
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,500
I 'm going to dance .

144
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,981
This is the focus when dancing

145
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,601
The main reason is that the material is not valuable

146
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,460
Urban management is here .

147
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,820
This forty-five is okay

148
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,320
Forty-five

149
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:49,960
Just thirty

150
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,161
My price is 45 .

151
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,361
I didn 't bring much money today

152
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,080
No , no

153
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,880
I can 't sell thirty

154
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,721
Well , take it off .

155
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,000
Take it off . Don 't pull it .

156
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:57,260
It 's not the urban management .

157
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,700
Just thirty

158
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,601
Take it off

159
00:05:58,801 --> 00:05:59,721
Urban management is here .

160
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:00,520
Just thirty

161
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,500
I didn 't bring much money today

162
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,060
Thirty is thirty

163
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,940
Can you give me the money ?

164
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,320
I kept this one for the bus

165
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,760
Don 't take the bus , okay ?

166
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,681
Thirty is good

167
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:07,841
What are you doing ?

168
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:08,801
You go you go you go

169
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:09,481
Hurry , hurry , hurry

170
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:10,981
Stop for me

171
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,880
Who told you to set up a stall here ?

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,120
I got the car back .

173
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,260
Officer Li

174
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,221
How do you

175
00:06:56,221 --> 00:06:57,620
Got my car back

176
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,020
I paid the fine

177
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,940
How does this work ?

178
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,221
How much do I want to give you

179
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:02,901
What 's on that car ?

180
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,820
You have to wait for that

181
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,041
After the license is issued

182
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,940
to give you

183
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,460
OK OK OK

184
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,901
Then I 'll go first

185
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,541
No , no , no , you sit , you sit

186
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,580
Don 't be welcome to me , me , me

187
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,560
Thank you , Officer Li

188
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,741
That

189
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:16,060
You just said you wanted to do it

190
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,120
Is the business license correct ?

191
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:19,241
I got that certificate

192
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,060
You can legally

193
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,181
Selling things here

194
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:23,301
For legal business

195
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,741
And then I took that card

196
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:25,981
You can get my goods

197
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:26,921
Swap them all back

198
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,481
Yes

199
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,161
OK OK

200
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:31,820
I was really stupid before

201
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:32,781
It 's fine

202
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:35,361
Please tell me about the fine .

203
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,020
I I won 't give it to you

204
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,241
My heart is uneasy

205
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,301
Wait for your business license to be obtained

206
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,281
Give it to me again

207
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:43,841
OK then

208
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,661
Not only did I pay you back

209
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,440
Can I treat you to another meal ?

210
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,801
I see you often go to the dance hall

211
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,841
Is it fun

212
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:54,741
OK

213
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,560
It 's pretty fun . Will you go ?

214
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:58,960
I 've never been there .

215
00:07:59,301 --> 00:07:59,960
Why

216
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
I can 't dance

217
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:05,721
It 's very simple

218
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:06,820
I can teach you

219
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,101
Dancing is very good

220
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:09,221
I have a skill

221
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,200
Many benefits

222
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,401
What are the benefits of dancing

223
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,221
Dancing can relieve stress .

224
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,181
And

225
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,460
You dance well

226
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,320
It will be very popular with girls

227
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,661
OK , I 'll add a bunch of hairy belly

228
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,320
OK OK

229
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:27,161
Officer Li

230
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,041
Who are you waiting for here , girl ?

231
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:30,560
Waiting for our lovely Nobita

232
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:32,041
I 'm so good looking

233
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,241
Don 't be idle and talk nonsense .

234
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:33,741
Hurry up

235
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:34,341
Let 's go now

236
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:35,601
Go eat your meals

237
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:37,060
OK , OK , I 'll wait for you ahead .

238
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:37,981
OK

239
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,700
Leave them alone

240
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,740
You have something to do with me

241
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,681
Didn 't I say that last time ?

242
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,161
Pay back money and invite dinner

243
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,661
Teach you to dance

244
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,021
For you

245
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,141
I put it on

246
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,980
Isn 't it a little strange ?

247
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,541
The ballroom was dark

248
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,720
That will look good on you

249
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,200
Are you free

250
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,320
Yes

251
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,281
Let 's go

252
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,940
You haven 't eaten yet

253
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:12,860
There is a noodle shop in front that is OK

254
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:14,881
OK

255
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:15,440
OK

256
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,820
Mom

257
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,580
I remember

258
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,100
When I was in elementary school

259
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,881
You seem to have a boyfriend .

260
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:25,421
Right

261
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,600
None

262
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:33,860
It 's Uncle Li , right ?

263
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,021
How do you know

264
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,501
That 's Uncle Li

265
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:45,141
You were

266
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,980
Why did we break up ?

267
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:50,301
No Why

268
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,940
It 's just the wrong time

269
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,580
I know why

270
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,261
Because

271
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,661
Let me make a big fight with you that time

272
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:12,740
So tired

273
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,161
Your mother isn 't here today

274
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:14,901
So cool

275
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,641
More

276
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,301
I ask you

277
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,200
Do I look good like this ?

278
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,761
Beautiful

279
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,320
But

280
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,041
Missing a finishing touch

281
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,641
I 'll find you a ring

282
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,521
See if there 's anything you like

283
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,521
Movie Tickets

284
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,740
You

285
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,381
Why do you have movie tickets ?

286
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,141
Who did your mother go to the movies with ?

287
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:48,700
Western food costs 400 yuan

288
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,661
It 's so expensive

289
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:57,121
Jingjing , let me ask you

290
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:58,881
If it were you

291
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:00,401
Who would you want to be with

292
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,100
Go to the movies and eat Western food together

293
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,781
Of course he 's a boyfriend

294
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,740
This guy

295
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:11,301
Male

296
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:12,681
female

297
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:13,641
Male

298
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:14,600
Male

299
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,980
Why are there so many men ?

300
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,001
Yeah , who did you go to the movies with ?

301
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:21,600
You are Xiao Wu 's daughter

302
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,801
How did you and my mother meet ?

303
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:26,621
Your mother and I

304
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:28,781
We met in the dance hall

305
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:30,301
Frequently met in ballroom

306
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:31,340
This is going back and forth

307
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,041
It 's ready

308
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,541
Do you think my mom is beautiful ?

309
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,421
Beautiful

310
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:37,401
The ballroom is famously beautiful

311
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:39,360
Beautiful

312
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,840
Beautiful is dangerous

313
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,401
I know all the light

314
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,200
several uncles

315
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,240
Just chat and dance with my mom

316
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,100
By his wife

317
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,641
Chased and beat several streets

318
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:50,401
Uncle , do you have a family ?

319
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,740
No

320
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:53,720
There is also a risk of being beaten by your wife

321
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:56,141
Actually , your mother and I

322
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:58,041
Not that familiar either

323
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:00,200
I have enough to eat alone and the whole family is not hungry

324
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,801
There is no such thing

325
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:01,860
You can beat my wife

326
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,901
Tell you what a man thinks

327
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,001
Not married

328
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,360
That 's freedom

329
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
Uncle , you 're not married .

330
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,681
That 's great

331
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:10,840
My mother said that

332
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,041
She worked hard

333
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,060
Just to find me a

334
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,121
The stepfather who took over

335
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,921
How about I be your daughter

336
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,261
Buy some snacks

337
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,240
Oh , my mother

338
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:26,041
That 's not makeup , it 's disguise

339
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:28,281
I can 't look after my makeup removed

340
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:29,761
My mom is a bitch

341
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,161
Gentle and kind

342
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,080
That 's all pretend

343
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,240
Buy something delicious

344
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,901
Uncle has left beforehand .

345
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:38,220
My mom 's feet stink and she drinks .

346
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,320
Gu Yunsu

347
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,401
My mom is here

348
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:45,161
Help

349
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:46,921
What are you running for

350
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:47,980
Help

351
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:48,820
Gu Yunsu

352
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,921
Gu Yunsu , don 't run away

353
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:54,740
Go in

354
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,740
Gu Yunsu

355
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:02,501
Are you going to piss me off ?

356
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,480
Do you think this money

357
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,560
These things in this house

358
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,641
It 's all caused by strong winds .

359
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:06,261
Yes No

360
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:07,901
You dropped my client

361
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:08,820
Where can I make money for you

362
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,980
How can I support you ?

363
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,301
You still think I 'm living a good life

364
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,501
I 'm not wronged enough

365
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,460
Not bad enough

366
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,021
Are you trying to make me angry

367
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,521
I 'm so angry

368
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,501
Gu Yunsu

369
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,281
Wu Limei , calm down first

370
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,641
Don 't act pitiful .

371
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,421
If it were our family

372
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,301
If you are really that poor

373
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:23,460
Where did you get the money to go to the cafe ?

374
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,541
Western Restaurant Cinema

375
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,501
Wu Limei

376
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:29,580
Are you in love ?

377
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:31,600
Your child

378
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,700
What do you know ?

379
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,301
I don 't care if you admit it or not

380
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:35,881
Anyway , I 'll make it clear first

381
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:37,181
There is no man in the world

382
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:37,881
Reliable

383
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:38,541
If you want to marry

384
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,700
I strongly disagree

385
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,521
What can I do to satisfy you

386
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,340
I 'm around you every day , okay

387
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,220
I was single until I was old

388
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,681
Can I be single until I die ?

389
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:46,141
Where do you find it

390
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:47,440
Everyday around me

391
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,320
If you don 't want me , just say it

392
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,921
I can walk by myself

393
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:51,200
Gu Yunsu , you say this

394
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,220
You you have no conscience

395
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:53,781
Did I

396
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:54,881
I 'm tired every day

397
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:56,401
I still come back to cook for you every day

398
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,720
Have I done everything I can

399
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,240
Let you live the most comfortable life

400
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,141
Did I

401
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:01,240
Very hard , very hard

402
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,320
I want to give you a home

403
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,100
You 're telling me this now

404
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,261
You 're an asshole

405
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,001
Yes

406
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,440
Do you feel tired

407
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,960
Are you bored ?

408
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,360
Do you think I am

409
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,001
It 's useless and expensive

410
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,060
Anyway , I 'm

411
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,041
No father anymore

412
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,421
There will be no mother soon

413
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:20,021
Just throw me away .

414
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:21,200
Anyway , I 'm just a

415
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,460
Excess garbage

416
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:56,161
Li Mei

417
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,960
Listen on the phone

418
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,840
Something 's wrong with you

419
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,860
What happened

420
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,801
Jianxiong

421
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:07,240
I thought about some words

422
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,541
I still have to tell you in person

423
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:09,580
You said

424
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:13,940
I think we will

425
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,861
Don 't contact us again .

426
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,861
Li Mei , I think we

427
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:23,881
Listen to me .

428
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,421
Let 's go on like this .

429
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,681
It 's not good for each other .

430
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,841
You 're a good man

431
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,240
I don 't want to delay you

432
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:45,641
It 's because of Susu .

433
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:48,901
Jianxiong

434
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,260
I was

435
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:53,401
He insists on divorcing Gu Kangqi

436
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:55,440
She doesn 't agree with it .

437
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:57,780
The Divorce

438
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:59,101
I didn 't talk to Susu

439
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,081
We discussed it carefully

440
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:03,321
Now she follows me

441
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:04,500
Life is so wronged

442
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,700
I should be responsible

443
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,321
We are all adults

444
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,280
Susu is a child

445
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,440
What decisions do adults make

446
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,520
What are the consequences

447
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,081
Actually , I know it very well .

448
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,401
A child

449
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:19,621
Follow the adults in a daze

450
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:20,940
The decisions we made

451
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,800
They can 't bear the consequences

452
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,641
It 's unfair to them

453
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,440
You can 't put Susu

454
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,700
Consider all you have

455
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,421
Your Jianxiong , listen to me

456
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,520
Maybe

457
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,760
Wait for Susu to grow up

458
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:37,841
Maybe until then

459
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,240
We 're old but

460
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,280
We have never forgotten each other

461
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:47,540
It was good to be friends at that time

462
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,641
Be a lover

463
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,161
We can start a paragraph

464
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,641
Real Relationship

465
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,700
But until then

466
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,401
Don 't contact me again

467
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,020
Really

468
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,800
Li Mei

469
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,121
Jianxiong , don 't do this

470
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:06,921
Not worth it

471
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,121
Take care of yourself

472
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:13,661
Li Mei

473
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,000
Li Mei

474
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,440
Are you wronged ?

475
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,821
Just because of a little brat

476
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:35,681
Temper

477
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:37,240
You just listen to it

478
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,321
You 're really divided

479
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:39,921
Thanks .

480
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:41,440
It has been delayed for more than ten years

481
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,280
Now

482
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,561
It 's fine if you don 't .

483
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:47,220
Not good

484
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:49,841
not good enough

485
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:52,581
It can be better

486
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,460
You were the one who said no at first

487
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,280
It 's you who can 't say anything right now .

488
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,520
Why are you so difficult to serve ?

489
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,181
Miss

490
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:17,520
Mom , I have to tell you something

491
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,921
But you have to be prepared

492
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:25,921
My Uncle Li

493
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:26,921
I already know

494
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,440
You know

495
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,401
Uncle Li

496
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:41,760
Exclude the insurance beneficiaries except Li Yan

497
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:45,280
Added both of us

498
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:28,341
I 'll do it

499
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,881
No , no , I 'll do it , I 'll wash it

500
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,760
I have wet hands

501
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,040
I 'll wash it and cut it quickly

502
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:34,800
My mother is in a hurry to eat

503
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,220
OK

504
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:44,280
Come

505
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,300
Susu

506
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:50,581
Thank you

507
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:56,101
Uncle Li knows what you mean today

508
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:01,381
Don 't worry

509
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:07,101
You Li Shu looked forward to today

510
00:22:07,101 --> 00:22:08,260
A day like this

511
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:10,240
I 've been looking forward to it for more than ten years

512
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:15,260
Reluctant

513
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,480
That 's fine

514
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:27,581
If you were Uncle Li

515
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:29,000
It 's really bad luck

516
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,780
I left early

517
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,040
You take care of your mother

518
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,700
I 'm relieved too

519
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,061
Uncle

520
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:44,960
You believe I won 't

521
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:50,520
Good you

522
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,700
Go ahead and do your work

523
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,780
I am here

524
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,000
I can do it alone

525
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:01,980
Li Yan

526
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,581
Come here

527
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,661
Please ask for leave tomorrow

528
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:19,980
Our family is neatly

529
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:22,141
Accompanying Uncle Li to the hospital for biopsy

530
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,300
My dad

531
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,260
Is it serious

532
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,161
It 's fine

533
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:41,381
Tomorrow at eight o'clock for examination

534
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,821
Everything will have to wait for the results

535
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:44,500
I didn 't know

536
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,540
Good people will be blessed

537
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,260
Gu Yunsu

538
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:01,020
Thank you

539
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,101
Call Sister

540
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,440
A man can bear the pain

541
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:09,740
I won 't cry

542
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,401
I 'll count one , two , three and collect

543
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,700
One , Two , Three Receive

544
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,421
Good Son

545
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,181
We 're boys

546
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:30,381
A man does not flick lightly when he has tears

547
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,700
One , Two , Three Receive

548
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,780
Good , great

549
00:26:41,321 --> 00:26:41,861
1

550
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,800
II

551
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,101
III

552
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,240
Receive

553
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,601
All right , hold it down

554
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:31,621
Thank you .

555
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
I need to cooperate with you

556
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:36,641
That 's it

557
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,780
Just relax

558
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
People can 't move .

559
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:43,940
We 're going to do a puncture

560
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,161
It may hurt a little

561
00:27:45,161 --> 00:27:46,601
You will be given a local anesthesia

562
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:47,101
Doctor

563
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,780
Then I have to get two shots

564
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,520
Yes

565
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,321
I used to be a policeman

566
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:53,621
What pain hasn 't you suffered ?

567
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,280
You don 't have to bother to come directly

568
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:03,440
It hurts , hurts , hurts

569
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,401
It hurts too much , it hurts too much

570
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:05,200
It hurts so much

571
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,260
Anesthetic or anesthetic

572
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,280
You 're timid

573
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:20,121
Who was afraid of such a painful puncture

574
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,161
Your father didn 't even say a word

575
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:25,040
I heard them all

576
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:30,601
Uncle

577
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:31,581
I think it 's because

578
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:32,760
There is an echo in this corridor

579
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,361
It seems like your one is loud

580
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:37,240
Does it hurt ?

581
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,621
Mei Mei

582
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,921
This is now

583
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:45,500
The anesthetic power has passed .

584
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:47,361
It 's a little bit

585
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,980
You 're getting old

586
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:50,280
Worthless

587
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:52,161
Li Yan

588
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:53,821
If you can 't speak

589
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:54,760
You don 't have to say anything

590
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,321
Then go in and try

591
00:28:58,341 --> 00:29:00,240
What are we doing next ?

592
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:01,480
There 's more .

593
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:15,341
Does it hurt ?

594
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,061
Today

595
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,841
Needles as thick as enoki mushrooms

596
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:23,740
Put it in

597
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:26,341
I didn 't think it would hurt that much

598
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:28,901
Don 't worry

599
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:32,421
There will be good results .

600
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,381
Mei Mei

601
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:40,200
When I close my eyes these days

602
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,200
See

603
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,000
Those things when I was young

604
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,020
No need

605
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,020
We can go up ourselves

606
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,601
It 's raining

607
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:53,121
It doesn 't rain hard after a few steps .

608
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,000
It 's okay

609
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:55,000
Thank you for your hard work

610
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,161
Thank you uncle police

611
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,121

00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,280
Please help me

614
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,040
Can you set up a case for me ?

615
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,601
If she is in danger

616
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,421
Twenty-four hours

617
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:07,480
It 's too late .

618
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:09,220
I really can 't find it

619
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:09,940
I 'm going nuts

620
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,280
Lao Li , help me keep an eye on it

621
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,921
I 'll go out for a trip

622
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:12,621
Okay , go ahead

623
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,460
I 'll go with you

624
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:14,540
Thank you

625
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:18,760
Come and go Thank you

626
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:25,321
I got the car back .

627
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:27,440
Officer Li

628
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:28,421
How do you

629
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:29,720
Got my car back

630
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:31,141
I paid the fine

631
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,841
What are you laughing at ?

632
00:30:37,341 --> 00:30:39,040
I suddenly thought of a poem

633
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:42,641
We are like at the bottom of a pond

634
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:44,381
From a Moon

635
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:45,980
To Another Moon

636
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:48,020
You can also write poetry

637
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:49,940
OK

638
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,841
Just consider this poem

639
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:51,760
I wrote it

640
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:52,980
It 's not bad , right ?

641
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:54,381
Very good

642
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:01,300
I think

643
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,500
It 's been a while .

644
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:05,581
And no one came .

645
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:07,240
Why don 't we sit across each other

646
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:08,561
This makes it more spacious

647
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,240
I see you often go to the dance hall

648
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,240
Is it fun

649
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:38,681
OK

650
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,381
It 's pretty fun . Will you go ?

651
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,141
I 've never been there .

652
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,240
Why

653
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,181
I can 't dance

654
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:48,280
It 's very simple

655
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,540
I can teach you

656
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:51,780
Jianxiong

657
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:54,881
I want to love you honestly

658
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:57,141
Will you marry me

659
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,181
I put it on my body every day

660
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,421
Just waiting for this day

661
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,361
Do you think this is a merry - go - round ?

662
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,800
I said no

663
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:32,361
I said you were overthinking

664
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:34,040
Even if it 's true

665
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,161
The current cure rate of breast cancer

666
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:37,321
is very high

667
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,520
At worst , we can do surgery .

668
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,681
The most cut is

669
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:44,561
The A side and the b side are unclear

670
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:46,161
We have a belly button

671
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280
Can be separated

672
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,960
Are you afraid of something ?

673
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:54,280
It 's fine

674
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:05,661
Come

675
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,520
I 'm not afraid

676
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,381
I am

677
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:17,881
Is it really afraid of death

678
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,341
I 'm so greedy

679
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:23,440
This world

680
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,800
Then we will do it without hesitation

681
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:28,720
Greedy for life and afraid of death

682
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,480
Li Jianxiong , right ?

683
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:57,960
Yes

684
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,520
He is now being consulted by experts

685
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
It may take a while

686
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:02,421
Okay , then call me

687
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,280
OK OK

688
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,960
Expert Uncle is now consulting

689
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,881
Have to wait

690
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,401
Will you see me ?

691
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:09,200
Yes

692
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:14,421
Consultation

693
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,681
That will alarm many doctors .

694
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,001
Does it mean this problem ?

695
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,481
Li Jianxiong , listen to me .

696
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,720
This hospital is a good hospital

697
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,720
So many doctors are helping you

698
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,320
Even if it is not cured , it will be difficult

699
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,840
Don 't be afraid

700
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:38,141
It may be a little different

701
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:39,800
But not sure yet

702
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:44,920
Mei Mei Sit

703
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:53,220

00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:54,860
What What Results

705
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,420
What about your condition ?

706
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:57,800
I did clinically

707
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,541
Not seen

708
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,420
So

709
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:00,661
I 'll ask our hospital

710
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:01,740
Breast Specialist

711
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,740
Did a consultation

712
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:04,420
The conclusion is now reached

713
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,461
Where is Director Qi

714
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:06,420
It 's our breast side

715
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,541
A very authoritative expert

716
00:35:07,661 --> 00:35:08,601
It 's up to him .

717
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:09,860
Let me tell you more about it

718
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,780

We agree

00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:17,641
Is cancer

721
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:30,360
Cancer Characterization

722
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:33,200
The very similar one

723

Benign inflammation

724
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,260
is benign

725
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:45,780
is benign

726
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,021
This is called pulp

727
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:49,041
Pulp

728
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,561
Plasmacytosis

729
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:53,320
Mastitis

730
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:55,441
Generally we

Let 's just call it

732
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,220

When results are announced

744
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,181
Don 't look for a slow person

745
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:09,860
Tell us if you can

746
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,240

Falling in love

Scary

766
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:11,380
You have announced me good news

767
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,340
What happiness is reported

768
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,461
I was divorced

769
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:14,121
That doesn 't work

770
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:15,121
This divorced

771
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:16,101
How can there be a serious man ?

772
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:17,840
It 's a serious person who divorces ?

773
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,780
Not

774
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:23,961
You can 't say that either .

775
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:25,061
This pole killed me

776
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:25,800
Yes Yes Yes

777
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,581
Who is it ?

778
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:27,300
Who wants it

779
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,420

00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,400
He was divorced .

783
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:35,181
I didn 't see it

784
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,260
Why can 't I see it ?

785
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,760
But I think this

786
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,001
This guy is fine .

787
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:40,141
Which line I

788
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:41,041
He matched my daughter

789
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:41,800
I think it 's enough

790
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,981
Of course it can 't be matched .

791
00:38:42,981 --> 00:38:44,860
Someone wants to take over my daughter

792
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,780
I Amitabha

793
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,260
We haven 't investigated it yet

794
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,541
Is he good or bad

795
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:49,280
Exactly

796
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,900
He failed the girl

797
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,380
The girl dumped him

798
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:53,461
I don 't know anyone else .

799
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:54,941
How many times did it happen

800
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:56,541
Susu is your daughter

801
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:57,300
If you don 't care

802
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,760
Then who will take care of it ?

803
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:00,720
How to do this ?

804
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:03,541
I can 't help it either

805
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,260
I-I

806
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,581
This is a good way

807
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,041
Hello , hello

808
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,280
You are still awake .

809
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:25,661
Is on night shift

810
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,441
You can 't sleep

811
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,720
I just want to find a

812
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,200
Find a friend to chat

813
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,840
Then how do you

814
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,081
Don 't call Luo Jingjing

815
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:40,601
I I hit

816
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,481
I called her .

817
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:43,720
Her phone is turned off

818
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:46,380
So

819
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:50,461
I 'm the second after Luo Jingjing

820
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,481
All right

821
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,481
Actually I

822
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,720
I called you first .

823
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,220
I just wanted to ask you

824
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,501
Are you free tomorrow

825
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:04,941
I will have a rest tomorrow when I am free

826
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,920
Do you want to see you tomorrow ?

827
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,441
Okay , see you tomorrow

828
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:18,981
First

829
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,340
Great

830
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,621
Your Life

831
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:33,561
Have you ever lost control ?

832
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,121
Didn 't you see it before ?

833
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,360
My life anyway

834
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,441
It 's getting out of control after another

835
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,320
Instead of being bored day after day

836
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,740
Out of Control Thrilling

837
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,760
Better

838
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,521
No.

839
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,860
I think it 's good to be bored .

840
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:51,780
Safe

841
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,200
My Life

842
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,621
The most lacking thing is safety

843
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,661
Are you the kind of person who can be bored

844
00:40:57,661 --> 00:40:58,700
The man who turned out the flowers

845
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:00,521
Are you angry with me ?

846
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,141
Think I am unreliable

847
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:03,240
None

848
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,740
I 'm trying to say

849
00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:07,961
You are wonderful

850
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:14,001
Then you like to be steady

851
00:41:14,001 --> 00:41:15,081
Still impulsive ?

852
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,541
Impulsive

853
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,681
Calm or Warm

854
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:20,320
Warm

855
00:41:21,081 --> 00:41:23,081
Cold violence or princess disease

856
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,061
If you have to choose

857
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:28,501
You need to hurry up

858
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,101
Don 't think of hurry , hurry , hurry

859
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:30,700
Princess Disease

860
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:32,101
Dog or Cat

861
00:41:32,101 --> 00:41:32,501
Cat

862
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:33,501
Hedgehog or Turtle

863
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:33,900
Hedgehog

864
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,420
Gu Yunsu or

865
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:34,961
Gu Yunsu
