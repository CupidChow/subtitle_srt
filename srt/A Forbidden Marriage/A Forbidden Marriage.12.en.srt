00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,900
[A Forbidden Marriage]

2
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,910
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,120
Yang Qing.

4
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,810
Are you celebrating my birthday?

5
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,080
Wangyue, I'd like to toast you.

6
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,710
Wangyue.

7
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,880
Happy birthday.

8
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,320
I've decided.

9
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,360
From now on, my birthday will be
May 15.

10
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,210
I can't let Yang Qing feel like
he's been deceived.

11
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,470
What have you decided?

12
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,510
Nothing.

13
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,960
I've decided to celebrate all my birthdays
with you from now on.

14
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,090
You're so nice to me.

15
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,310
Is there anything you want me to do?

16
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,310
No.

17
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,090
There must be.

18
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,710
Just be honest and tell me.

19
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,310
Otherwise, I'd feel guilty.

20
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,920
I'm afraid that if I'm completely honest,

21
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
I might scare you.

22
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,070
You won't.

23
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,020
Just tell me.

24
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,050
Between the Shengyue Sect and me,

25
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,380
which would you choose?

26
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,960
You... Ask something else.

27
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,980
If

28
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,820
Yuan Yingxing and I
both fell into the river,

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,060
who would you save?

30
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,110
No way, Yang Qing.

31
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,020
Are you being serious right now?

32
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,290
Last time I saved you,

33
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,570
I nearly died myself.

34
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,550
If you want me to save you again,

35
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,680
you might as well let me drown instead.

36
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,430
It's just a hypothetical question.

37
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,430
You have to choose one.

38
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,090
Choose, choose, choose.
Why do I have to choose?

39
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,490
A grown man needing me to save him.

40
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,130
I guess I'll choose Yuan Yingxing.

41
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,640
After all, he's my Chief.

42
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,640
No matter who dies, he must not.

43
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,500
No.

44
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,750
I need to stay calm.

45
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,880
Usually when men ask questions like this,

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,810
they just want to hear you say
you'd save them.

47
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,930
It's the same as saying you like them.

48
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,450
I'd save you.

49
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,090
Of course I would save you.

50
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,560
That's a relief.

51
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,020
If you and Junior Yao
fell into the river together,

52
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,150
I would save you too.

53
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,910
I mean I'd save you first.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,590
That was a pretty good answer.

55
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,310
Good girl, so clever.

56
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,060
Let's eat, the food is getting cold.

57
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:17,600
Here.

58
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,890
It's Chief Lu's 50th birthday celebration.

59
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,520
He's invited heroes
from all walks of the martial world,

60
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,100
and now all major sects have sent
their elite disciples

61
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,900
to Biluo Valley
to celebrate Chief Lu's birthday.

62
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,370
How hypocritical.

63
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,040
Yingxing.

64
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,470
In the next few days,
Biluo Valley will be filled with masters.

65
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,930
With your strength alone,

66
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,130
it would be hard to achieve your goal
through direct confrontation.

67
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,460
We need to use strategy.

68
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,240
Are you telling me what to do?

69
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,790
Anyway,

70
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,560
you must stay close to me these days

71
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,760
and don't wander off.

72
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,970
Don't try any tricks on me,

73
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,950
or I don't know what I might

74
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,990
do to you next time.

75
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,980
[Rosy Grace & Moonlit Charm]

76
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,870
Yingxing.

77
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,430
Stay here and behave.

78
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,600
Don't go out unnecessarily,

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,560
and don't wander around.

80
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,420
Did you hear me?

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,730
Where are you going?

82
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,370
I'm going to find out
where the dungeon is.

83
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,470
By yourself?

84
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,190
I have to go alone.

85
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Right now, there are not only guards
in Biluo Valley,

86
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,440
but also leaders of all the major sects.

87
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,640
You'd be easily discovered if you went.

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,520
Then hurry up and go.

89
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,860
I'm tired
and don't want to hear your nonsense.

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,460
Yingxing.

91
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,480
As long as you stay put

92
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,120
and don't cause me any trouble,

93
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,720
I promise,

94
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,830
once I find out where the dungeon is,

95
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,160
I'll come back
and take you to rescue them.

96
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,490
Qing.

97
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,630
Sect Leader.

98
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,000
Senior.

99
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
Fu, you're back.

100
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,010
Some disciples reported earlier,

101
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,800
but I thought
they had mistaken someone else for you.

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,480
You...

103
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,310
Are you hurt?

104
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,630
No, I just...

105
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,340
Good that you're not injured.

106
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,700
I sent people everywhere to look for you,

107
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,580
but there was no news of you.

108
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,500
You've been away from Yunmen for so long.

109
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,160
I've been worried about you.

110
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Your senior Yang has to be blamed

111
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,520
for not taking good care of you.

112
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:10,820
Sect Leader.

113
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
I just remembered

114
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,290
I met a junior sister
from Biluo Valley earlier

115
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,390
and promised to give her some guidance
in swordsmanship.

116
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,650
You've just returned.

117
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,410
You should rest more.

118
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,670
All right, you may go.

119
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,630
Thank you for your concern, Sect Leader.

120
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,430
I'll take my leave now.

121
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,870
Qing.

122
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
Now that Fu has come back,

123
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,390
you two should get married soon.

124
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,890
I thought

125
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,720
it was just a joke
between you and the other elders.

126
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,390
Why would we joke about

127
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,670
your marriage with Fu?

128
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,000
You two grew up together—

129
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,360
it's a perfect match.

130
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,780
We're just helping you make the decision.

131
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm not considering matters of marriage
for the time being.

132
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,270
You...

133
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,680
You think I don't know
what's on your mind?

134
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,160
Fu's family background,
talents, and appearance

135
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,350
all make her a perfect match for you.

136
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,870
A good match depends on the heart,
not family background.

137
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,230
Besides, Junior Yao
has no feelings for me,

138
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,270
and I have no other intentions
toward her either.

139
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,670
Why force something
that isn't meant to be?

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,630
Could it be

141
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,400
you're concerned about
her almost marrying Yuan Yingxing?

142
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,080
Back then,

143
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,720
Fu was solely focused on
destroying the Shengyue Sect,

144
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,790
which is why she endured humiliation
and infiltrated their ranks,

145
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,440
even going so far
as to flatter Yuan Yingxing.

146
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,280
She made that sacrifice
for everyone's sake.

147
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,550
You absolutely must not let this matter

148
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,090
create a rift between you two.

149
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,700
I have no such reservations whatsoever.

150
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,060
It's just that between Junior Yao and me,

151
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,190
there truly are no romantic feelings.

152
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,000
Matters of marriage should be
between families of equal status.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,880
Over these years,

154
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,580
haven't we seen enough conflicts
caused by this obsession

155
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,750
with social status in marriages?

156
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,680
For instance...

157
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,690
Alright, alright.

158
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,670
So be it.

159
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,350
Let's set aside your marriage matters
for now.

160
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,980
The most pressing issue now

161
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,460
is handling tomorrow's birthday banquet.

162
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,590
If we can just hold on for one more day
without letting outsiders know

163
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,510
there's an issue
with our Alliance Leader's Token,

164
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,480
then all will be well.

165
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,120
I understand, Master.

166
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,000
Father。

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,450
I saw with my own eyes

168
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,240
that both the Sun Blade and Moon Blade
are kept in the box.

169
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,120
Is that so?

170
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,080
Mr. Yang has feelings for me,

171
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,540
so he tells me everything.

172
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,950
I just used a small trick,

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,440
and he eagerly brought
the Alliance Leader's Token to me

174
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,300
to win my favor.

175
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,220
He used to be cold to everyone.

176
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,060
But now,

177
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,510
he treats you differently?

178
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,540
After all, our Biluo Valley
is at its peak of power now.

179
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,720
Is this what you meant by
"everything is settled?"

180
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,880
Chief, I swear,

181
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,650
I once saw the Shengyue Token
at the Shengyue Sect with my own eyes.

182
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,770
It was exactly the same as

183
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,760
the Alliance Leader's Token representing
the Moon Blade in that painting.

184
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,820
The Moon Blade is the Shengyue Token,

185
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,700
and the Sun and Moon Blades together
form the Alliance Leader's Token.

186
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,630
Could there possibly be

187
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,960
two Moon Blades in this world?

188
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,110
There can't possibly be
two Moon Blades in this world.

189
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,800
Yunmen Sect has never lost its Moon Blade.

190
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,570
Father, Jin Buhuan is lying.

191
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,700
He harbors evil intentions,

192
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,320
provoking you against Yunmen,

193
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,250
just to humiliate you
in front of everyone.

194
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,450
Chief, I swear!

195
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,700
I really saw the Shengyue Token
at the Shengyue Sect.

196
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,760
Is what you want...

197
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:47,970
Watch out!

198
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,040
This?

199
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,600
Yuan Yingxing?

200
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,750
They all say
Biluo Valley is full of cunning traps

201
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,080
and unfathomable martial skills,

202
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,670
but as it turns out, it's nothing special.

203
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,220
Well, well, well, Yuan Yingxing.

204
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,080
So you're not dead.

205
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,580
What,

206
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,080
disappointed that I'm still alive?

207
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,510
Yes.

208
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,750
I am disappointed.

209
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,920
However,

210
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,760
don't even think about
leaving Biluo Valley!

211
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,510
Don't worry. I'm not leaving.

212
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,860
Old Man.

213
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,710
I'll give you one chance.

214
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,930
Return my disciples

215
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,140
to me unharmed,

216
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,150
and I'll leave your corpse intact.

217
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,600
What if I don't?

218
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,320
Then don't blame me for being ruthless

219
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,520
when I bathe your Biluo Valley in blood!

220
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,480
How arrogant.

221
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,040
Form the Star Formation!

222
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,270
Old Man.

223
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,100
You couldn't beat me,
so you called for help?

224
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,870
Five elements to counter,
deploy the Falling Geese Formation!

225
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,660
Rotate the stars,

226
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,580
and switch the formation to break through!

227
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,340
Father, are you alright?

228
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,980
I'm okay.

229
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,570
This is all your fault, you useless fool.

230
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,390
Didn't you say Yuan Yingxing was dead?

231
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,590
Why is he alive again?

232
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,360
I don't think
you've spoken a single truth.

233
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,570
Father, you can't trust him anymore.

234
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,530
I never expected
Yuan Yingxing to be so resilient

235
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,790
that he's still alive.

236
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,450
Now that Yuan Yingxing
has made his appearance,

237
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,900
we'll have quite a show to watch tomorrow.

238
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,130
Pass on my order

239
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,770
to completely seal off Biluo Valley.

240
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,030
Not a single person is allowed to leave!

241
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,480
Got it!

242
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,270
Yingxing.

243
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,450
Yingxing.

244
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,620
Yingxing, are you listening?

245
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,130
Yingxing, what are you trying to do?

246
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,170
I should be the one asking you that.

247
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,030
Sneaking into my room like this,

248
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,150
what are you trying to do?

249
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,100
What can I possibly do?

250
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,720
If I wanted to harm you,

251
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,080
I wouldn't have to
go through all this trouble.

252
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,360
Unnecessary effort.

253
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,750
Yao Fu.

254
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,510
When will you finally stop

255
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,970
sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong?

256
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,870
I...

257
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,030
You want to help me again?

258
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,860
And you're putting on
that pitiful expression.

259
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Don't you know I'm sick of seeing it?

260
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,410
Yao Fu.

261
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,880
I really want to tear off
that face of yours

262
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,810
and see what's truly hiding underneath.

263
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,390
Yingxing.

264
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,250
Listen to me.

265
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,910
Here's the thing.

266
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,440
You caused such big trouble
in Biluo Valley,

267
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,360
yet they show no intention of
capturing you.

268
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
I think something's off.

269
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,020
There must be a trap involved.

270
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,780
The mere Biluo Valley

271
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,760
is nothing to fear.

272
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,480
But this time,
it's not just the people of Biluo Valley.

273
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,910
Members of the four major sects
are here too.

274
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,480
I know you're desperate to save your men,

275
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,630
but no matter how skilled you are,

276
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,680
you can't possibly fight against so many.

277
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,330
Let's not rush things for now.

278
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,470
Wait until they leave Biluo Valley,

279
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,870
then we'll make our move.

280
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,360
You and I have never been
on the same path,

281
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,490
so what's this "we"?

282
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,150
You don't need to concern yourself
with my matters.

283
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,910
Right now,

284
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,410
who else besides me can?

285
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,510
If you want to save them,

286
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,880
then take my advice.

287
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,190
Yao Fu.

288
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,640
You should know very well

289
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,339
who caused me to fall into

290
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,800
this helpless situation.

291
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,130
Yuan Yingxing!

292
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,550
Constantly bringing up the past like this,

293
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,550
what's the point?

294
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,440
I've told you

295
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,030
I'll do my best to make up for
what happened in the past.

296
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,589
Now,

297
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,640
either you leave Biluo Valley,

298
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,000
or you stay right here

299
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,530
and don't go anywhere.

300
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,960
I'll be guarding outside the door.

301
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,090
If you want to leave,

302
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,940
you'll have to step over my dead body!

303
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,740
Why did someone die on such a joyous day?

304
00:17:59,410 --> 00:17:59,960
Chief Lu,

305
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,780
why did you bring us here?

306
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,260
Chief Lu, these bodies...

307
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,040
Everyone.

308
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,530
Yesterday, Yuan Yingxing

309
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,510
broke into our Biluo Valley dungeon
to rescue someone

310
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,720
and slaughtered many of our disciples.

311
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,540
If I hadn't arrived in time,

312
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,010
the casualties would have been even worse.

313
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,850
Yuan Yingxing is extremely cunning.

314
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,250
I failed to capture him.

315
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,040
However, I've ordered

316
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,410
a complete lockdown of Biluo Valley.

317
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,290
He should still be here.

318
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,640
I hope all of you heroes

319
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,370
can help me catch this villain.

320
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,700
Chief Lu, what do you mean?

321
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,640
Wasn't Yuan Yingxing
imprisoned in the dungeon?

322
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,640
Sect Leader Feng,
you don't know the whole story.

323
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,430
On the way to escort
the Shengyue Sect members,

324
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,350
Yuan Yingxing escaped.

325
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
I originally thought

326
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,970
that with the strength of
Biluo Valley alone,

327
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,250
we could capture him with ease,

328
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,320
so I didn't inform you all, Sect Leaders.

329
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,310
I never expected
such a disaster would occur.

330
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,390
This

331
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,480
is all my fault.

332
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,190
I, Lu Jin, apologize to you all.

333
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,840
It's just that

334
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,600
my disciples were so innocent!

335
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,800
They trained diligently for years
in the valley,

336
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,680
and before they could make a name
for themselves in the martial world,

337
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
they were killed by Yuan Yingxing.

338
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,520
I ask all of you heroes

339
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,160
to avenge these innocent souls
who died unjustly!

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,930
What's going on?

341
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,380
So Yuan Yingxing escaped
right after they captured him?

342
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,300
I knew it.

343
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,750
Chief would surely find a way to escape.

344
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,210
Fan Hao is so unreliable.

345
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,480
When I see him later,

346
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,550
I'll definitely teach him a lesson.

347
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,090
For my past mistakes,

348
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,350
can we settle accounts another day?

349
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,540
Everyone, I'd like to say a few words.

350
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,540
Chief Lu lost several disciples yesterday,

351
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,450
which is the price he paid for
keeping the information of Yuan Yingxing

352
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,540
to himself.

353
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,850
We should now work together

354
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,580
to subdue Yuan Yingxing first.

355
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,160
As for other matters,

356
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,420
shouldn't we discuss them later?

357
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,240
Chief Lu.

358
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,420
Since Yuan Yingxing is still
in Biluo Valley,

359
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,910
do you have any good ideas
to flush him out?

360
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,390
Everyone.

361
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,770
The Shengyue Sect
doesn't value human life,

362
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,110
so let's fight fire with fire.

363
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,550
Although we haven't captured
Yuan Yingxing,

364
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,480
there are still

365
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,440
over 20 Shengyue Sect members
imprisoned in the dungeon,

366
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,260
including some high-ranking hall masters
and Guardians.

367
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,440
Today, let's execute a few of them—

368
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,640
first, to honor the fallen warriors,

369
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,400
and second,

370
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,270
to force Yuan Yingxing to show himself,

371
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,070
so we can cut the evil at its root!

372
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,500
Yuan Yingxing accidentally killed someone,

373
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,550
but what does that have to do
with the Shengyue disciples

374
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,440
who are locked away
in Biluo Valley's dungeon?

375
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,260
Chief Lu, why massacre the innocent?

376
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,320
Massacre the innocent?

377
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,710
What a joke!

378
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,100
These Shengyue Sect people have broken
the rules of the martial world.

379
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,690
We were merciful before,

380
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,460
keeping them in the dungeon

381
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,020
with the hope
they would reform themselves.

382
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,050
But what have those prisoners done?

383
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,350
They've never learnt anything,

384
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,350
spending all day
insulting our righteous sects

385
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,020
by calling us the government's lackeys.

386
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,550
And what about those outside?

387
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,170
They waited for the opportunity
to strike back.

388
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,050
Not to mention Yuan Yingxing killed

389
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,470
some disciples who were still minors.

390
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,780
Don't you think

391
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,750
they deserve to die?

392
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,590
What should we do?

393
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,280
They're going to kill our people.

394
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,630
So where exactly is our Chief now?

395
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,950
I've long heard

396
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,410
that Chief Lu Jin of Biluo Valley
is hypocritical.

397
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,710
Seeing him today, he's indeed
extraordinarily hypocritical.

398
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,970
Don't worry, I'm here.

399
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,510
Nothing will happen to
our Shengyue Sect members.

400
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,510
Support Chief Lu.

401
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,310
Destroy the evil cult,
eliminate the wicked!

402
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,480
Destroy the evil cult,
eliminate the wicked!

403
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,670
Destroy the evil cult,
eliminate the wicked!

404
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,790
Destroy the evil cult,
eliminate the wicked!

405
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,790
Destroy the evil cult,
eliminate the wicked!

406
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,390
Everyone, please calm down.

407
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,660
To resolve this matter,

408
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,530
we still need Sect Leader Feng's help.

409
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,870
Sect Leader Feng.

410
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,620
The dungeon
holding the Shengyue Sect members

411
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,950
can only be opened with the Sun Blade.

412
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,280
Chief Lu.

413
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,550
I believe hastily opening the dungeon now

414
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,310
would be highly inappropriate.

415
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,840
Once the dungeon is opened,

416
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,160
the imprisoned Shengyue Sect disciples

417
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,560
will rush out all at once.

418
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,960
This would lead to another bloodbath,

419
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,140
and who knows how many people

420
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,220
would lose their lives because of it.

421
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,350
The top priority now
is to lure Yuan Yingxing out.

422
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,200
Qing.

423
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,470
Since Chief Lu wants the Sun Blade,

424
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,790
let him have it.

425
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,130
Yes, Sect Leader.

426
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,240
As expected of a divine weapon
owned by the Alliance Leader,

427
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,000
it's truly extraordinary.

428
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,820
Isn't that Chief's flute?

429
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,210
Everyone, sit down and meditate,

430
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,160
regulate your energy channels,

431
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,130
and resist the sound of the flute.

432
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,220
Only those who've practiced

433
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,830
the Shengyue Sect mental techniques
can resist

434
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,840
the sound of Yuan Yingxing's flute.

435
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,300
Don't give yourself away.

436
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,490
Yuan Yingxing.

437
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,060
So you're Yang Qing.

438
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,960
Wangyue!

439
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,830
Are you okay?

440
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,730
Yue.

441
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,920
Yang Wangyue, what are you doing?

442
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,960
I... I...

443
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,220
Is he your lover too?

444
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
Are all men in the world your lovers?

445
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,410
Is every man in the Shengyue Sect

446
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,220
your lover?

447
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,370
He...

448
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,300
He's not my lover.

449
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,820
He...

450
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,130
He's Yuan Yingxing.

451
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,720
What does the fact that he's Yuan Yingxing

452
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,830
have to do with you?

453
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,860
Not much, actually.

454
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,690
Then why did you save him?

455
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,130
I...

456
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,040
I try to do one good deed a day.

457
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,450
Move aside.

458
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,310
I won't.

459
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,120
Move aside!

460
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,020
Yang Qing.

461
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,920
Senior!

462
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,220
Yingxing, go now!

463
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,030
Junior Yao, what are you doing?

464
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,480
Do you know who you're protecting?

465
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,350
And do you know

466
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,200
who you've been protecting time and again?

467
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,100
Let's all die together then.

468
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,970
Yue, come with me.

469
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,440
It's you.

470
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,490
Why are you severely injured again?

471
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,190
I'm okay.

472
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,670
May I stay here for a few days?

473
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,880
Alright.

474
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,980
It's just I need to go
make house calls now,

475
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,800
and I'll be gone for over half a month.

476
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,030
As for your injuries...

477
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,960
I can treat them.

478
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,020
The herbs and tools are all inside.

479
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,620
Please help yourself, Miss.

480
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,880
I have patients waiting.

481
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,010
I'll be leaving now.

482
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,210
Thanks a lot.

483
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,310
Yue...

484
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,640
Yingxing.

485
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,480
Yingxing, are you alright?

486
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,110
Do you have any self-awareness?

487
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,890
You've harmed the Shengyue Sect and Yue,

488
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,660
yet you still dare to put on this act?

489
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,770
Get out of my sight.

490
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,830
Chief.

491
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,530
I've given Chief acupuncture,

492
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
and he's calmed down for now.

493
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,670
Mingyang.

494
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,810
Keep watch here,

495
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,880
and I'll go get some azalea leaves.

496
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,270
Don't let any troublemakers
get near Chief.

497
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,070
It's bad luck.

498
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,160
Got it.

499
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,250
How is Yuan Yingxing doing?

500
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,630
He won't die.

501
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,420
It's just that his internal
and external injuries are too severe.

502
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,040
He regained consciousness briefly
but then fell unconscious again.

503
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,110
Go check on him.

504
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,370
[Noble and Unsullied]

505
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,030
Yingxing needs to rest now.

506
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,940
Don't stir up trouble.

507
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,250
Yuan Yingxing's appearing in Biluo Valley—

508
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,650
does it have something to do
with you again?

509
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,280
I just helped a little.

510
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,580
So it's you again, as expected.

511
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,920
I won't let you off this time!

512
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,480
Are you sure it's you letting me off,

513
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,880
not the other way around?

514
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,500
Yang Qing, you treat our Yue so well.

515
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,940
You'd even go this far for her?

516
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,710
I have my own plans.

517
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,370
Perhaps tomorrow,

518
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,050
Yuan Yingxing will die by my sword.

519
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,290
You won't do that.

520
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,550
Mingyang,

521
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,260
take her away.

522
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,830
Chief.

523
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,380
This woman has injured
both the Saintess and you.

524
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,210
How about I kill her right here?

525
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,730
She's still useful. Take her away.

526
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,960
Yuan Yingxing,
you're still protecting her.

527
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,480
Don't you know she killed me once

528
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
and used dark magic to cloud my mind?

529
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,180
Yue.

530
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,210
The four major sects
are all hunting us down now.

531
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,290
We still need her.

532
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,890
We'll deal with this
after we've escaped the pursuit.

533
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,490
Mingyang,

534
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,650
take her away.

535
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,160
Yes.

536
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,480
Chief.

537
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,030
You should rest and recover properly now.

538
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,960
It's not advisable to move around.

539
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,710
Lingyin, you may leave now.

540
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,040
I want to talk to Yue alone.

541
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,900
Yue, come here.

542
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,430
Yuan Yingxing, are you alright?

543
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,720
Are you crazy?

544
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,110
Yue,

545
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,270
do you know how much I've missed you?

546
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,660
Just let me tease you a little.

547
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,550
Tell me,

548
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,010
what exactly happened?

549
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,510
At Mount Yin,

550
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,310
after Yao Fu stabbed me with her sword,

551
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,440
I fell off the cliff.

552
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,780
Perhaps it wasn't my time to die,

553
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,550
but when I woke up,
my martial skills were gone.

554
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,640
And since I looked
exactly like Yang Wangyue,

555
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,170
I was mistaken for
someone from Yangliu Town.

556
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,750
Thank goodness you're safe.

557
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,440
Otherwise,

558
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,360
I would have made the entire martial world
pay with their lives.

559
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,050
Yuan Yingxing, I've grown up.

560
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,030
You can't just touch a lady's head
like that anymore.

561
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,030
You can't still treat me like you did
when I was little.

562
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,980
Was it that Yang Qing who taught you this?

563
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,850
I remember you weren't like this before.

564
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,000
Yue, you've found another man,

565
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,850
and now you won't even let me touch you.

566
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,980
That's not true.

567
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,160
Then are you blaming me

568
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,330
for neglecting you all these years?

569
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,590
Is that why you wouldn't let me touch you?

570
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,240
Of course not.

571
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,990
You truly don't blame me?

572
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,070
I used to blame you a little,

573
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,070
but not anymore.

574
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,750
Everyone has their own destiny.

575
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,050
I can't keep tying you to me forever.

576
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,220
Besides,

577
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,570
you're Chief now.

578
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,720
I won't go against you anymore,

579
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,670
except for Yao Fu.
You must hand her over to me.

580
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,390
My little Yue has truly grown up.

581
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,930
So what are you planning to do now?

582
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,940
Haven't thought about it.

583
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,070
Haven't thought about it?

584
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,980
You're our Chief.

585
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,210
You need to restore our Shengyue Sect.

586
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,080
You want me to go back?

587
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,179
Of course.

588
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,760
You...

589
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,110
Don't tell me you don't even want
the Shengyue Sect anymore.

590
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,860
Then let's go back together

591
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,230
and restore the Shengyue Sect.

592
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,230
Together?

593
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
I still need to go find the Sun Blade.

594
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,440
Only with the Sun Blade
can I save the Guardians and the others.

595
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,440
You go back first.

596
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,659
I won't be going yet.

597
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,719
In the end, it's still for Yang Qing,
isn't it?

598
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,580
It's for the Sun Blade.

599
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,980
As for the Sun Blade,

600
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,179
I'll help you get it.

601
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,960
But as for Yang Qing,

602
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,580
stay away from him.

603
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,550
You're badly injured.

604
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,870
L-Lie down first.

605
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,230
About the Sun Blade,

606
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,630
we can discuss it later.

607
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,780
Just focus on recovering now.

608
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,590
Don't go.

609
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,920
I won't.

610
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,210
Get some sleep.

611
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,260
Has he

612
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,390
been out here all night?

613
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,030
This won't do. I need to talk to him.

614
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,930
I lied to you.

615
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,570
I'm actually from the Shengyue Sect.

616
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,340
You must have known
who I am all along, right?

617
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,010
Now that I've found Chief,

618
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,040
I must help him escape safely.

619
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,980
I've deceived you for so long.

620
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,970
I'm truly sorry about that.

621
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,010
But will you let me take him away?

622
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,230
Or,

623
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,960
is there a price I must pay?

624
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,510
You're better at martial arts than me.

625
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,110
Punish me however you want,

626
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,780
but I must take Yuan Yingxing with me.

627
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,490
I know you've always insisted
that good and evil cannot coexist,

628
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,590
so we can't walk the same path anymore.

629
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,390
It's best for us to part ways now.

630
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,740
You're thinking the same, aren't you?

631
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,260
After all, I'm just a witch,

632
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,460
acting on every whim.

633
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,370
All those times I teased you,

634
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,300
you could just treat them as jokes.

635
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,240
But the Shengyue Sect you speak of

636
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,040
is the most important part of me.

637
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,670
I will never betray the Shengyue Sect.

638
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,200
Don't try to change my mind.

639
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,490
So let's just end this.

640
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,150
Are you finished?

641
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,880
If you're done, then sit down

642
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,150
and listen to me.

643
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,220
Wangyue.

644
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,080
I don't oppose you returning

645
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,280
to the Shengyue Sect,

646
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,720
but after you go back,

647
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,070
don't cut ties with me completely.

648
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,050
We'll just be in two different places.

649
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,420
If you miss me

650
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,970
and want to contact me,

651
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,840
you still can.

652
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,320
You...

653
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,760
I belong to the Shengyue Sect,

654
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,090
and you're from Yunmen.

655
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,790
Haven't you always insisted
that good and evil cannot coexist?

656
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,190
Wangyue.

657
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,720
You need to understand that

658
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,490
I've never asked you to choose,

659
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,560
and you don't have to make a choice.

660
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,000
The one who needs to make a choice

661
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,650
is me.

662
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,590
They say
the Shengyue Sect is full of villains

663
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,230
with unpredictable
and bizarre personalities.

664
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,360
But I've discovered

665
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,590
that your disciples

666
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,230
mostly joined the Shengyue Sect
because they had nowhere else to go.

667
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,760
I believe

668
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,550
only a place like the Shengyue Sect

669
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,840
can embrace all kinds of people

670
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,920
and shelter those
who have reached the end of their rope.

671
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,450
Without the Shengyue Sect,

672
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,960
those people
would either be harmed by society

673
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
or harm others,

674
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,650
which would be truly terrifying.

675
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,840
The martial world

676
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,880
needs a place like the Shengyue Sect.

677
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,230
The way you talk, I might misunderstand

678
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,030
that you've fallen in love
with our Shengyue Sect.

679
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,810
Well, not at all.

680
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,150
The problem with the Shengyue Sect

681
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,000
is that it imposes no discipline
on its disciples,

682
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,440
allowing the wicked to become
even more evil.

683
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,590
The righteous and evil factions
have been in conflict for ages,

684
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,320
with grudges and mutual hostility
on both sides.

685
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,140
Actually, most of the time,

686
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,150
it's not because
the Shengyue Sect does evil,

687
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,670
but because when the two factions meet,

688
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,620
they recall past grievances

689
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,200
and things just spiral out of control.

690
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,770
I believe

691
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,650
that being in the Shengyue Sect yourself,

692
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,510
you must also feel
the current chaos within, right?

693
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,670
I think

694
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,430
when Yuan Yingxing wanted to marry Yao Fu,

695
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,490
besides following his heart,

696
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,510
he was also trying to find a way out
for the Shengyue Sect.

697
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,170
He wanted to reconcile with
the other factions.

698
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,390
Can you stop mentioning that jinx?

699
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,390
Hearing her name makes me feel sick.

700
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,510
So,

701
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,380
how do you plan to reconcile?

702
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
I want to meet with Yuan Yingxing
in person to discuss

703
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,360
the possibility of reconciliation
between Yunmen and the Shengyue Sect.

704
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,030
I've heard

705
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,990
that when his father was Chief,

706
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,750
he briefly made peace with
the other factions.

707
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,210
Of course,

708
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,020
the circumstances back then

709
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,620
might be different from now.

710
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,010
However,

711
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,730
for the currently chaotic Shengyue Sect,

712
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,500
this could be a way out.

713
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,830
You're right.

714
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,420
The current Shengyue Sect isn't
what it used to be.

715
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,840
But from another perspective,

716
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,170
it's also a good opportunity for renewal.

717
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,860
So,

718
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,070
after you return to the Shengyue Sect,

719
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,670
there's no need for us
to part ways completely.

720
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,630
I'm working on a solution.

721
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,760
I've been thinking about it constantly,

722
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,220
just haven't figured it out yet.

723
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,880
That's why I haven't told you.

724
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,110
But between us,

725
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,100
there's always a possibility,

726
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,840
isn't there?

727
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,280
I...

728
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,450
I thought you were ignoring me

729
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,110
because of the conflict between
good and evil sects, which is troublesome.

730
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,570
It is troublesome indeed,

731
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,370
I have to use all my strength

732
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,010
just to mediate between the Shengyue Sect

733
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,370
and all the other sects.

734
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,280
Isn't that troublesome?

735
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,000
So you were ignoring me

736
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
just because you find me troublesome?

737
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,440
That's too much!

738
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,710
Happy now?

739
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
If you're happy now,

740
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,420
go pack your things

741
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,960
and return to your Shengyue Sect.

742
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,020
I won't see you off.

743
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,520
I'm not leaving.

744
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,080
I want to stay here with you.

745
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,780
I want to love you forever.

746
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,260
You mean torment me forever, right?

747
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,480
Whatever you say.

748
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,680
Haven't we already cleared things up?

749
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,760
Why are you rejecting me?

750
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,420
Look at you,

751
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,670
all dirty.

752
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,990
I was kissing you!

753
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,950
How could you ruin the moment like that?

754
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,760
We escaped all the way here
from Biluo Valley.

755
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,840
Do you think everyone can be

756
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,760
as elegant as you?
