You're being way too nosy!

189
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,840
That's right.

190
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,240
I'm nobody to you.

191
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,400
So please find someone else

192
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,050
to do this kind of thing for you
in the future!

193
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,490
Why is he so angry?

194
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,600
What's with all this rage?

195
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,080
[Deyue Hotel]

196
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,680
Mingyang.

197
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,090
Mingyang.

198
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,740
Hero, please spare me!

199
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,670
Please spare me!

200
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,360
I'll never steal again, I swear!

201
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,910
Get lost!

202
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,950
Why did you drink so much?

203
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,210
You didn't beat him to death, did you?

204
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,200
He's fine.

205
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,450
Didn't he run away?

206
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,690
Let go of me first.

207
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,670
Let's talk properly.

208
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,780
I'm not letting go.

209
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,040
What am I supposed to do?

210
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,520
You...

211
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,230
You're so cruel,

212
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,750
yet I just can't get over you.

213
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,870
Tell me...

214
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,930
Tell me, what should I do?

215
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,500
Alright, alright.

216
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,080
If you can't get over me, then don't.

217
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,750
Come on.

218
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,550
Let me help you back to rest.

219
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
Why can't I...

220
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,670
Why can't I get over you?

221
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,090
Why did you drink so much?

222
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,960
Junior Yang.

223
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,730
Where have you been these past few days?

224
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,380
I had to sign in for you every day.

225
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,610
If the elders find out,

226
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,940
we'll be in big trouble.

227
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,660
Also,

228
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,360
Mr. Yang kept glancing at me

229
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,220
because you didn't show up today.

230
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,840
Senior Su,

231
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,320
I brought you a roast chicken from Fan's.

232
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,010
I specially went down the mountain
to buy it for you.

233
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,640
It's on the table in the back mountain.

234
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,700
It's for you alone.

235
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,910
Thank you, Junior Yang.

236
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,570
No big deal.

237
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,000
Junior Yang, you're smiling so happily.

238
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,660
You must have mastered all the techniques
I taught you these days.

239
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,790
The technique, "Lone Crane in Flight"—

240
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,940
show it to everyone.

241
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,860
Lone...

242
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,340
Lone what?

243
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,570
Lone Crane in Flight.

244
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,260
Why did you

245
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,410
call on me suddenly?

246
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,740
What?

247
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Do I need to invite you, Junior Yang?

248
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,720
Are you jealous because I was talking

249
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,580
to Su Ming?

250
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,870
I'm giving a lesson.

251
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,870
Junior Yang, please show
the Lone Crane in Flight technique

252
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,020
to everyone.

253
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,450
Mr. Yang,

254
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,160
I haven't mastered it yet!

255
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,510
Your mind is distracted.

256
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,910
You never apply yourself.

257
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,570
How can you possibly improve?

258
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,410
Drink of Harmony,

259
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,680
Lone Crane in Flight,

260
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,140
Gentle Breeze, Fleeting Grace,
and In the Garment—

261
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,380
I've taught you the five techniques
for two whole days.

262
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,050
Yang Wangyue,

263
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,050
if you can't master them,

264
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,120
you'll stay behind later

265
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,660
and practice until you do.

266
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,750
[Yunmen]

267
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,490
Alright,

268
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,510
they've all left.

269
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,050
Keep practicing.

270
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,840
Elder Shen has left too.

271
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,690
Now it's just the two of us.

272
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,450
Did you ask me to stay behind

273
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,280
because you wanted to be alone with me?

274
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,120
Or...

275
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,280
is there something you want to tell me?

276
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,620
If you want to go down the mountain
in the future,

277
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,770
you don't need to ask other disciples
to sign in for you.

278
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,030
I'll do it for you.

279
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,010
See?

280
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,520
I knew you are jealous.

281
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,480
Yes.

282
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,840
I suppose I am jealous.

283
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,880
I know I shouldn't be.

284
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,870
But I still

285
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,200
can't stop myself from thinking too much.

286
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,050
Or...

287
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,230
Wangyue,
you don't want to be alone with me?

288
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,050
Mr. Yang!

289
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,320
Mr. Yang!

290
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,620
Are you here?

291
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,350
Go hide.

292
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,470
Hurry.

293
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,770
Mr. Yang, so you are here.

294
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,100
Where's Junior Yang?

295
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,870
I think I just

296
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,120
saw her around.

297
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:01,820
No.

298
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,490
She left a while ago.

299
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,180
You must have imagined it.

300
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,750
Mr. Yang,

301
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,730
whose sword is this then?

302
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,880
Get to the point.

303
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,369
Well, Mr. Yang,

304
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,500
Ms. Yao is back.

305
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,280
The sect leader wants you
to go to Yunxiao Hall.

306
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:17,930
Okay.

307
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,630
Qing.

308
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,090
Come quickly and see your Junior Yao.

309
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,360
Junior Yao, how have you been?

310
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:46,950
Senior.

311
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,730
After you went to Mount Yin,

312
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,850
I was worried every day
that Yuan Yingxing might harm you.

313
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,860
Now I can finally put my mind at ease.

314
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,770
Rest assured, Sect Leader.

315
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,160
Although Yuan Yingxing is eccentric,

316
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,290
he never made things difficult for me.

317
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,770
You've lost weight.

318
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,160
Senior Shen just said I've gained weight,

319
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,060
but here you say I've lost weight.

320
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,880
No wonder people say

321
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,200
elders always worry
about juniors getting too thin.

322
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,190
Look at her.

323
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,310
After one trip to Mount Yin,

324
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,610
she has become much more outgoing.

325
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,400
Speaking of Shengyue Sect,

326
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,600
how were your talks with Yuan Yingxing?

327
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,740
When does he plan to come to Yunmen?

328
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,750
Yuan Yingxing...

329
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,720
Yuan Yingxing doesn't want
to come to Yunmen for peace talks.

330
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,720
He asked me to ask
if we could choose another location.

331
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,750
He wants us to go to Mount Yin.

332
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,160
No way.

333
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,430
Yuan Yingxing is unpredictable.

334
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,640
Who knows what traps
he might set at Mount Yin?

335
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,070
Yes.

336
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,210
But actually, he's also worried

337
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,030
that we might lay ambushes here.

338
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,530
We are open and straightforward.

339
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,830
How could we possibly
resort to such petty tricks?

340
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,240
Shengyue Sect has been treated as outcasts
by the Central Plains martial world.

341
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,640
Yuan Yingxing's caution

342
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,920
is understandable.

343
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,120
Yes.

344
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,710
Please don't be angry, Sect Leader.

345
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,940
After all,

346
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,450
Shengyue Sect was indeed besieged
by us once.

347
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,070
Yao, you're defending him?

348
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,840
I'm just standing on the side of reason.

349
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,400
The world says

350
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,070
Yuan Yingxing's been completely bewitched

351
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,360
by a female disciple from Yunmen,

352
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,490
so he lost Mount Yin.

353
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,570
They say Yuan Yingxing is eccentric

354
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,180
and would never have fallen for her

355
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
if he hadn't gained benefits.

356
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,440
Yao,

357
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,910
let me ask you.

358
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,150
Have you truly fallen for Yuan Yingxing?

359
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,860
You and he...

360
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,500
I have not!

361
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,470
That's good.

362
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,700
Now that you've returned from Mount Yin,

363
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,870
you should forget everything

364
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,360
about Shengyue Sect.

365
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,030
Now,

366
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,700
I'll make the decision

367
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,740
to arrange a marriage
between you and Qing.

368
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,740
What do you think?

369
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,360
Sect Leader, no!

370
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,160
Sect Leader,

371
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,160
Senior and I
only share a sibling-like relationship.

372
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,090
There's absolutely no romance between us!

373
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,690
If you won't marry Yang Qing,

374
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,210
who do you want to marry?

375
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,070
Yuan Yingxing?

376
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,190
And you,

377
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,610
what's with that look?

378
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,650
Don't tell me you're still thinking

379
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,080
about Yang Wangyue, who has joined Yunmen.

380
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,840
Sect Leader,

381
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,190
matters of the heart cannot be forced.

382
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,380
If you two won't get married,

383
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,920
a reconciliation with Shengyue Sect
is out of the question.

384
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,640
Never!

385
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,680
Why?

386
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,850
They are clearly two separate matters!

387
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,380
The world already whispers

388
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,020
Yunmen and Shengyue Sect are entangled,

389
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,450
with unclear relations.

390
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,380
Under the circumstances,

391
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,120
if we rashly propose a reconciliation
in the martial world,

392
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,170
the other sect leaders will never agree.

393
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,310
Instead, they'll suspect
we've joined forces with Shengyue Sect,

394
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,510
plotting something.

395
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,180
Only if you two get married

396
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,260
can we silence the gossip

397
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,250
and cut ties with Shengyue Sect.

398
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,660
Qing,

399
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,590
you're the one who has urged me

400
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,250
to make up with Shengyue Sect all along.

401
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,480
I've thought about it for a long time.

402
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
I was strongly against it before,

403
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:36,980
but now,

404
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,230
I think it might be worth trying.

405
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,120
But the precondition is

406
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,430
that you two do as I say.

407
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,910
Now, the choice is yours

408
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
to make.

409
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,610
Whether to make up with Shengyue Sect

410
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,360
is up to you.

411
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,300
Sect Leader,

412
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,790
it doesn't have to be
me marrying Junior Yao.

413
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,120
There must be other ways

414
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,340
to get the other sects

415
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,190
to support our reconciliation
with Shengyue Sect.

416
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,670
But this is the simplest and quickest way.

417
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,820
You two, think carefully.

418
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,220
I will never agree.

419
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,140
The only person I will marry is Wangyue.

420
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,410
Mentioning Wangyue here—

421
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,750
aren't you worried
the sect leader and the others will hear

422
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,280
and put you in confinement?

423
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Like or dislike—

424
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,170
it is what it is.

425
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,340
I dare to admit my feelings for Wangyue.

426
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,690
Junior Yao, do you dare to admit
your feelings for Yuan Yingxing?

427
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,810
Is that all you want to say?

428
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,760
About the marriage...

429
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,690
I know what to do.

430
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,210
There's nothing between us.

431
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,050
I'll never compromise
just because of a few words

432
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,250
from the sect leader.

433
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,150
I'm glad you think this way,

434
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,280
Junior Yao.

435
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,590
But...

436
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,960
since I've agreed to ally with you
in the marriage issue,

437
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,550
you must promise to help me
plead with the sect leader

438
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,360
and ensure the peace talks
proceed smoothly.

439
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,240
Rest assured.

440
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,010
I want the peace talks to proceed smoothly
more than you do.

441
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,600
Wangyue is now in Yunmen,

442
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,330
and she is my junior nominally.

443
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,770
I hope you won't give her a hard time.

444
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,220
I'd never give juniors a hard time.

445
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,770
Thank you.

446
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,850
Is something troubling you, Sect Leader?

447
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,560
Fu,

448
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,400
it's you.

449
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,510
Whenever something's on your mind,

450
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,510
you always sit alone
in the Falling Flowers Pavilion.

451
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,600
You all have grown up,

452
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,860
and you have your own ideas now.

453
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,980
I'm old.

454
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,230
You're not old at all.

455
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,710
You're the alliance leader,

456
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,460
in control of the Alliance Leader's Token.

457
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,560
No one dares to disobey you in this world.

458
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
If anyone dares to make you worried,

459
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,280
we'll just show them
the Alliance Leader's Token.

460
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,200
Sit down.

461
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,480
Sadly, despite my lifelong efforts,

462
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,670
I could never
retrieve the Moon Blade for Yunmen.

463
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,240
The Moon Blade has been lost
for many years.

464
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,770
And I don't know where it is.

465
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:49,820
Sect Leader,

466
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,770
that was long ago.

467
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,300
You've been working tirelessly for Yunmen,

468
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,860
while also bearing the burden
of the Alliance Leader's Token.

469
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,920
What you've accomplished
is already remarkable.

470
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,580
Let the matter of the Moon Blade
take its course.

471
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,700
Anyway,

472
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,590
we still have the Sun Blade.

473
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,330
That's true.

474
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,750
That's why

475
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,670
Qing must guard the Sun Blade well.

476
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,590
The Sun Blade...
has been entrusted to Senior?

477
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,940
I'm old.

478
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,720
I can't keep holding onto

479
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,400
the position of Sect Leader
or the Alliance Leader's Token forever.

480
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,530
I've passed the Sun Blade to Yang Qing.

481
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,650
From now on, only his handprint

482
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,370
can open the iron box.

483
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,480
Qing has always been reliable
since childhood.

484
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,490
He will surely guard the Sun Blade well.

485
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,000
Of course.

486
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,830
If that's the case,

487
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,310
what are you still worried about?

488
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,020
Fu,

489
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,110
you've been away from Yunmen for too long.

490
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,710
There's much you don't know.

491
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,450
Now,

492
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,330
Biluo Valley
has been plotting something secretly,

493
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,750
but we haven't found any evidence yet.

494
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,490
The smaller sects in the martial world

495
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,230
bicker and quarrel every now and then.

496
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,960
The martial world

497
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,730
is not as peaceful as it appears.

498
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,640
So what if I have
the Alliance Leader's Token?

499
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,330
I'm still alive,

500
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,860
yet someone

501
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,630
still used Shengyue Sect's rove beetles

502
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,980
to frame Yunmen for murder.

503
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,560
Sect Leader!

504
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,220
Senior can handle these matters well.

505
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,180
Trust him.

506
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,520
I know.

507
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,350
Qing has always kept many thoughts inside
since childhood.

508
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,080
When Qing was little,

509
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,080
he'd always share his thoughts with me.

510
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,160
But now,

511
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,440
I find it increasingly hard
to understand his thoughts.

512
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,970
And it makes me uneasy.

513
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,600
Sect Leader, rest assured.

514
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,430
Senior would never do anything
to harm Yunmen.

515
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,350
Of course I know that.

516
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,290
But...

517
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,310
I always wish there could be someone

518
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,580
to share his burdens.

519
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,180
Fu,

520
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,700
are you really unwilling?

521
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,240
Only if you marry Qing

522
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,830
can I feel at ease entrusting Yunmen

523
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,560
and the Sun Blade to both of you.

524
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,910
But

525
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,210
you two...

526
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,650
Sect Leader,

527
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,660
I understand.

528
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,610
For the sake of Yunmen,

529
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,760
I'm willing to marry Senior.

530
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,570
Good.

531
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,530
Good.

532
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,650
Fu, you always act for the greater good.

533
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,270
Then Qing...

534
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,370
I'll talk to Senior about it.

535
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,270
I'm sure for Yunmen's sake,

536
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,430
he will come around to it too.

537
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,230
Yao Fu is back.

538
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,070
Whenever that woman appears,

539
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,530
it's never a good sign.

540
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,030
Her return

541
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,480
isn't necessarily a bad thing though.

542
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,160
She's not at Yuan Yingxing's side now,

543
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,820
so we don't need to be worried.

544
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,550
I heard

545
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,490
she also wants the two sects
to be reconciled.

546
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,520
The time Yang Qing and I agreed on

547
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,720
is getting closer.

548
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,790
If the two sects
are still not reconciled by then,

549
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,650
we'll have to steal the Sun Blade.

550
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,570
Are you confident that you can

551
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,500
successfully steal the Sun Blade?

552
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,590
You're so drunk,

553
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,520
yet you're still mumbling
about sect rules.

554
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,380
You still won't tell me anything.

555
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,510
Luckily, I still have the Compliance Pill
that Lingyin gave me.

556
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,050
Senior Su.

557
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,470
Have some water.

558
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,160
Thank you, Junior Yang.

559
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,070
Senior Su.

560
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,610
Don't fall asleep.

561
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,800
I just want to know

562
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,030
what's needed to open the box
containing the Alliance Leader's Token

563
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,490
in the Langhuan Pavilion.

564
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:19,360
Of course...
the sect leader's handprint is needed

565
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
to open it.

566
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,640
This...

567
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,570
This is Sect Leader Feng's handprint?

568
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,900
You're much faster than I expected.

569
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,020
Getting a handprint

570
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,510
is a piece of cake for me.

571
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,570
In the coming days,

572
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,090
I'll continue to explore
around the Langhuan Pavilion.

573
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,650
You and Mingyang get ready
at the foot of the mountain.

574
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,280
If a reconciliation
between the two sects fails,

575
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,790
we'll steal the Sun Blade directly

576
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,720
and head straight to Biluo Valley
to save our people.

577
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,900
Yes, Saintess.

579
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,160
Last time, in front of Yuan Yingxing,

580
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,200
I didn't kill you.

581
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,830
It was my mistake.

582
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,350
Today,

583
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,540
you're dead for sure.

584
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,040
I advise you to behave yourself.

585
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,310
Our sects are about to have peace talks.

586
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,840
Don't cause trouble
at this critical moment.

587
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,440
I promised Yang Qing
not to give you a hard time.

588
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,370
I won't kill you.

589
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,300
Leave.

590
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,990
You promised Yang Qing not to kill me?

591
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,690
Stop using him as an excuse.

592
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,730
Do you really want to fight with me?

593
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,440
You stabbed me last time.

594
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,130
I haven't returned the favor yet.

595
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,470

596
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,820
You tried to kill me?

597
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,030
You tried to kill her too.

598
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:47,940
Junior Yao,

599
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,070
with your martial skills,

600
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,330
the strike just now
shouldn't have wounded you so gravely.

Guards.

602
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,310
Yao Fu has violated Yunmen's rules

603
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,790
by harming a disciple of Yunmen.

604
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,720
Escort Ms. Yao back to her room
for self-reflection.

605
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,860
-Yes.
-Yes.

606
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,550
Your skills are no match for hers,

607
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,360
yet you still fought her like that.

608
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,690
Do you have a death wish?

609
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,880
Yang Qing,

610
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,040
you actually

611
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,470
fought Yao Fu for my sake.

612
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,140
I thought you would never fight her.

613
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,520
I won't allow anyone to hurt you.

614
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,990

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,490
You're so good to me.

618
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,110
Will you always be this good to me?

619
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,710
Of course.

You think I'm lying?

623
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,750
No.

624
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,270
I believe you.

00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,390
Wangyue,

626
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,200
you said

627
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,870
you'd be open with me.

628
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,270
I want to know what you truly think.

629
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,290
You said you'll always be good to me.

630
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,150
I don't believe it.

631
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,590
In this world,

632
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,280
no one will unconditionally tolerate

633
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,840
or dote on someone forever.

634
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,360
If such a person exists,

635
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,270
there are always conditions attached.

636
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,590
I know men love to tell lies,

637
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,870
but I still love hearing them.

638
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,500
Because those words are from you.

639
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,090
No one will unconditionally

640
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,880
be good to someone forever.

641
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,480
That's what you really think?

642
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,080
You don't believe there's

643
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,940
eternal love in this world?

644
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,080
But throughout history,

645
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,730
there're many couples
who grew old together.

646
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,130
Eternal love—

647
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
perhaps it was just collaboration.

648
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,890
You're right.

649
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,480
In this world,

650
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,210
no one will unconditionally dote on

651
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,290
or tolerate someone forever.

652
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,510
There must be conditions attached.

653
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,370
I can be good to you forever,

654
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,610
but I have conditions too.

655
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,100
What conditions?

656
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,340
I hope... you can understand me.

657
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,360
I hope we can understand each other

658
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,760
and tolerate each other.

00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,320
I hope you can feel my love for you

660
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,050
and love me wholeheartedly too.

661
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,040
That way,

662
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,540
I'll be willing to continue.

663
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,450
On the contrary,

664
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,190
if I feel

665
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,170
that I'm the only one making an effort,

666
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,170
and you give me no response,

667
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,890
I'll get tired.

668
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,740
Once I'm tired,

669

Our evidence is irrefutable.

811
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,840
eliminating Shengyue Sect

812
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,070
is just a matter of time, right?

813
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,320
-Yes.
-Yes.

814
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,910
Yes, we should have...

815
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,060
I wonder why

816
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,590
you all insist
on eliminating Shengyue Sect.

817
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,030
Wouldn't a reconciliation be better?

818
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,160
-Reconciliation?
-Reconciliation?

819
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,260
What did you say, Mr. Yang?

820
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,320
Reconciliation?

821
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,630
Over a decade ago,

822
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,610
Shengyue Sect worked
with the Central Plains martial world

823
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,140
to bring peace to the world.

824
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,070
Today,

825
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,190
I boldly wish to follow in their footsteps

826
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,900
to make up with Shengyue Sect.

827
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,760
On the occasion
of the Yunmen Grand Ceremony,

828
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,290
Sect Leaders,
I wonder what you think of that.

829
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,000
I can't believe Yunmen wants
to make up with Shengyue Sect.

830
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,120
This is outrageous!

831
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,390
Has Yunmen changed its allegiance

832
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,720
and become an evil sect?

833
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Sect Leader Feng,

834
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,180
your good disciple

835
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,280
actually wants
to make up with Shengyue Sect!

836
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,290
Is he serious?

837
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,160
He must be joking.

838
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,690
Everyone, mind your words.

839
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,860
Shengyue Sect
and the Central Plains martial world

840
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,190
are like fire and water.

841
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,400
Shouldn't they be eliminated?

842
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,710
I can't believe
he's talking about a reconciliation!

843
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,670
What's wrong with a reconciliation?

844
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,090
Shengyue Sect hasn't done any evil things.

845
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,820
During the floods in the southwest,

846
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,590
Shengyue Sect opened their granaries

847
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,120
and saved countless lives.

848
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,550
Around Mount Yin,

849
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,550
people live in peace and prosperity.

850
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:30,590
Shengyue Sect
merely stands on a different side from us.

851
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,990
They've never committed
any heinous crimes.

852
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,030
Why must we cling to outdated rules,

853
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,390
causing an irreconcilable situation?

854
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,880
I'm afraid Mr. Yang's proposal
for a reconciliation

855
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,210
stems from selfish desires, not justice.

856
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,490
Miss Lu,

857
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,200
don't talk nonsense.

858
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,860
It's hardly nonsense.

859
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,310
I just find Elder Yang's words

860
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,340
rather amusing.

861
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,020
I don't want all the heroes
to be deceived by Yunmen,

862
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,570
so at the risk of being against the world,

863
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,920
I want to ask Yang Wangyue,
Yunmen's disciple,

864
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,250
to come to the main hall.

865
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,550
I have something important to announce.
