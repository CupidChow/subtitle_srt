[A Forbidden Marriage]

2
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,930
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,840
Miss Yao has two extremely serious wounds,

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,170
one on her shoulder
and one on her abdomen.

5
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
They don't appear to have been inflicted
by the same person.

6
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,410
Both wounds are extremely deep

7
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,320
and weren't treated promptly.

8
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
So, they've begun to worsen.

9
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,590
If they continue to worsen,

10
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,220
her life will be in danger.

11
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,290
She will die?

12
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,710
If the wounds don't heal,

13
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,360
her days are numbered.

14
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,690
How can we heal her wounds?

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,500
The healing depends on her own strength.

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,520
All I can do is clean her wounds daily.

17
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,490
You can't cure her.

18
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,390
Is there anyone else who can?

19
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,790
If my lady can't heal her,

20
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,860
then no one under heaven can.

21
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,110
She's been unconscious for so long.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,190
I fear the worst.

23
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,820
If she dies,

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,310
both of you will join her in death.

25
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,840
You...

26
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,200
Sir, if you

27
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,480
continue with this attitude,

28
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,090
I'll have to ask you to leave.

29
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,120
What are you doing?

30
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,470
Is there really no way to save her?

31
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,910
Sir, if you insist on behaving this way,

32
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,000
I won't help her

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,120
even if you kill me.

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Let go of my lady now!

35
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,700
My lady kindly saved your lives.

36
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,070
If you can't show gratitude,
that's one thing,

37
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,150
but now you want to kill her?

38
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,870
Save her.

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,320
Apologize.

40
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,810
My lady,

41
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,100
don't be so confrontational with him.

42
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,450
Don't we still have another way

43
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,330
to save her?

44
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,190
Don't talk nonsense.

45
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,910
My lady!

46
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,310
I apologize for what I did just now.

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,200
Please save her.

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,530
She can only recover on her own.

49
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,890
Please save her.

50
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,010
You truly want to save her this badly?

51
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,060
At any cost?

52
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,630
I have unfinished business with her.

53
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,590
She cannot die.

54
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,340
Please, I'm begging you.

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Here is a Nine-Eyed Ice Silkworm

56
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,380
that can devour rotting flesh

57
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,710
and heal wounds.

58
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,070
But it has remained dormant
for many years.

59
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,190
To use it, you must awaken it.

60
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,000
The process is extremely painful.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,260
Are you willing to try?

62
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,190
What should I do?

63
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,120
The Nine-Eyed Ice Silkworm feeds on
human blood,

64
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,030
preferably from someone
with deep internal strength cultivation.

65
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,820
But because it has been dormant
for so long,

66
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,420
even with sufficient blood,

67
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,870
there's no guarantee it will awaken.

68
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,100
It all depends on fate.

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:01,950
Okay.

70
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,560
What?

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,130
There's nothing wrong
with the Alliance Leader's Token?

72
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,160
I secretly gathered information
the other night.

73
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,040
Feng Xingyun truly isn't worried about
the token

74
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,510
and has already entrusted it
to Yang Qing for safekeeping.

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,120
Buhuan.

76
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,460
Didn't you tell me

77
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,390
that the Yunmen only has the Sun Blade—
half of the Alliance Leader's Token—

78
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,470
making their leader's position
illegitimate?

79
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,680
What's going on here?

80
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,250
Impossible.

81
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,000
The Moon Blade is the Shengyue Token.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,430
It should be with Yuan Yingxing,

83
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,920
definitely not with Yunmen.

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,630
Father,

85
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,700
the Alliance Leader's Token is
of great importance.

86
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,630
If Yunmen still has the Moon Blade,

87
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,460
and you encourage Feng Xingyun to display
both blades at your birthday banquet,

88
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,100
wouldn't you be giving them

89
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,180
a chance to shine at your expense?

90
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,020
I'm willing to
investigate this matter for you, Father.

91
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,450
You?

92
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,090
You've failed at every task

93
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,650
I've given you.

94
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,140
Father,

95
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,060
I promise there won't be
any problems this time.

96
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,530
Please trust me once more.

97
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,090
Don't disappoint me again this time.

98
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,140
You claimed you were going to
help the Chief look into the token.

99
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,200
I think you just want to see Yang Qing.

100
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,500
So what if I do?

101
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,050
It's none of your business.

102
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,650
You and Yang Qing can never be together.

103
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,860
I can't be with Yang Qing,

104
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,310
but I can be with you?

105
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,770
Just look at yourself.

106
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,060
Xuanxuan.

107
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,600
I really care about you.

108
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,750
I don't need it.

109
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,340
Get lost before I really get angry.

110
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,510
Don't interfere with my mission.

111
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,690
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

112
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,140
I heard from people in Biluo Valley

113
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,040
that every night at 9 PM,

114
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,370
there are fewer guards,

115
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,690
so there shouldn't be as many now.

116
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,030
Who's there?

117
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,020
Wh-Which sect do they belong to?

118
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,090
Behaving so shamelessly in public!

119
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,210
Don't talk nonsense.

120
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,770
There have been many distinguished guests
in the valley lately.

121
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,220
Watch your mouth,
or you might offend someone.

122
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,280
Let's go, let's go.

123
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,180
Let's go.

124
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,010
Go.

125
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,390
That was close.

126
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,260
Let's get out of here now.

127
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,220
What are you doing?

128
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,700
Still savoring that moment?

129
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,140
You...

130
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,580
Wanna attract more guards?

131
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,650
Let's go. Hurry up.

132
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,800
Yang Wangyue?

133
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,660
It's not in Feng Xingyun's room.

134
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,700
Then it must be in Yang Qing's room.

135
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,550
That little tramp, Yang Wangyue,

136
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,980
sneaking into Mr. Yang's room
in the middle of the night.

137
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:23,980
Could she be

138
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,380
trying to seduce Mr. Yang again?

139
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,770
I just needed a reason to search for
the Alliance Leader's Token in his room.

140
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,970
Her sneaking in there

141
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,800
gives me the perfect opportunity.

142
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,950
Looks like

143
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,620
this cabinet is the only place
where the Sun Blade could be kept.

144
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,530
I just saw a thief

145
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,010
breaking into Mr. Yang's room!

146
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,010
Go in and search!

147
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,700
We can't let the thief get away with this!

148
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,360
-Yes!
-Yes!

149
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,980
Check the roof beams, under the bed,
and behind the screen—

150
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,660
search every corner thoroughly.

151
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,160
Go!

152
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,420
-Yes!
-Yes!

153
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,460
Wait.

154
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,980
Miss Lu, you're causing quite a commotion

155
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,290
by searching my room.

156
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,690
Has something happened?

157
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,190
Mr. Yang,

158
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,130
I just saw a thief
sneaking into your room.

159
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,380
Please wait a moment.

160
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,560
Once we find them,

161
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,340
we'll teach them a good lesson.

162
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,660
Someone broke into my room?

163
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,090
Yes.

164
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,260
This is intact,

165
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,070
and there's no one in the closet either.

166
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,470
That's weird.

167
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,090
Not on the ceiling beam,

168
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,530
not under the bed,

169
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,910
and not inside the closet either.

170
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,420
Where else could they possibly hide

171
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,480
as a living person?

172
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,290
Could it really be

173
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,450
some spirit-possessed rat?

174
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,330
But nothing's missing

175
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,670
from my room.

176
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,740
But I really wasn't mistaken.

177
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,830
Mr. Yang,

178
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,100
you need to check carefully.

179
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,880
Are you certain nothing's gone?

180
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,640
The most valuable thing

181
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,900
in my room is
this Alliance Leader's Token.

182
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,890
Now that it's safe and sound
in the room,

183
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,180
how could anything else be missing?

184
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,520
Perhaps I was mistaken.

185
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,200
We're sorry for disturbing you, Mr. Yang.

186
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,950
We haven't been good hosts.

187
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,760
Miss Lu, you were just eager to
catch the thief.

188
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,570
Don't blame yourself.

189
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,320
What are you standing around for?

190
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,000
We've completely embarrassed ourselves.

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,570
Let's go!

192
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,800
-Yes.
-Yes.

193
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,430
Mr. Yang, I'll take my leave now.

194
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:06,770
All right.

195
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,750
Come out.

196
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,860
Wangyue.

197
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,690
They're gone. Come out now.

198
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,920
You could still fall asleep?

199
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,680
What am I going to do with you?

200
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Are they all gone?

201
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,750
Yes, they've left.

202
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,830
Thanks to you,

203
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,890
or else they would've called me a thief.

204
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,150
But aren't you a thief?

205
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,730
Of course not.

206
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,360
Then why are you hiding in my room?

207
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,690
Care to explain?

208
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,380
I...

209
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:22,650
I...

210
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,400
I just missed you, that's all.

211
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,640
You missed me inside my closet?

212
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,010
Yang Qing,

213
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,600
you have to believe me.

214
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,890
The moment I came in,

215
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,420
I heard footsteps outside.

216
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,520
Lu Xuanxuan was calling about a thief.

217
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,040
She already hates me,

218
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,190
so if she could accuse me of stealing,

219
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,320
she'd have a legitimate reason

220
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,890
to kick me out of Biluo Valley.

221
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,380
I...

222
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,740
I was just desperate,

223
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,620
and that's why I hid in the closet.

224
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,910
Is that so?

225
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,340
I just heard you talking about
the Alliance Leader's Token.

226
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,890
Is this... the Alliance Leader's Token?

227
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,840
May I take a look?

228
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,740
Sure.

229
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,600
So, this is the Alliance Leader's Token?

230
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,380
Yes.

231
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,440
Is this the legendary Sun Blade

232
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,010
that can cut through iron like butter
and slice through anything?

233
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,640
Yes and no.

234
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,530
If Chief Lu wants to see
the Alliance Leader's Token,

235
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,380
do we, Yunmen,

236
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,860
really need to present the authentic one?

237
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,280
The Alliance Leader's Token is
of great significance.

238
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,770
If anything were to happen to it,

239
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,230
we couldn't bear the loss.

240
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,340
So naturally,
the real Alliance Leader's Token is

241
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,470
kept safe at Yunmen.

242
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,260
I see.

243
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,810
You Yunmen disciples really know
how to handle important matters.

244
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,690
So cautious.

245
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,680
Impressive.

246
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,470
You look very disappointed.

247
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,740
No, I'm not.

248
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,200
I'm actually happy.

249
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,910
You just casually told me
such an important secret

250
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,390
about the fake items,

251
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,010
which shows how much you truly trust me.

252
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,220
I'm so sleepy.

253
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm going back now.

254
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,750
Do you really think I can't tell?

255
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,530
Are you getting close to me
just for the Sun Blade?

256
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,790
She kissed me...

257
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,760
Mingyang?

258
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,369
Mingyang!

259
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,490
What are you thinking about?
I'm talking to you.

260
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,339
Something bad has happened.

261
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,800
Yue just came to me and said

262
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,099
that Feng Xingyun, that old fox,

263
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,430
is incredibly cunning.

264
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,690
He claimed he'd come
with the Alliance Leader's Token,

265
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,349
but in fact,

266
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,970
he only brought a pair of
fake Sun and Moon Blades.

267
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,030
The real Sun Blade is still in Yunmen.

268
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,720
Not only did Yue make a wasted trip,

269
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,850
but now Yang Qing is suspicious of her.

270
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,120
We need to find a way

271
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,320
to dispel Yang Qing's doubts about her.

272
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,350
If we keep wasting time like this,

273
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,930
when will we ever rescue the Chief,

274
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,790
and when will we restore our sect?

275
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,620
I miss the Chief too.

276
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,860
Haven't you always been afraid of
Yuan Yingxing?

277
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,740
You'd actually miss him?

278
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,410
I didn't realize you were so loyal.

279
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,680
If the Chief were here,

280
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,100
he would've led us
to fight our way in already.

281
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,020
We wouldn't have needed to
make such a fuss.

282
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,020
Mingyang,

283
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,780
are you brainless or what?

284
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,340
That's all in the past.

285
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,820
Our Shengyue Sect used to
dominate one region,

286
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,020
so naturally, we had the strength
to confront them directly.

287
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,780
But now,

288
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,170
there are just a handful of us nobodies.

289
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,350
How can we possibly fight them?

290
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,940
Saying you have no brains
really isn't wrong.

291
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,820
It's been a whole night already.

292
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,820
He'll die if he continues like this.

293
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,660
At this rate, you'll be finished.

294
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,970
Quickly use your internal strength
to force out the Ice Silkworm.

295
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,330
Then you might still have a chance
to survive.

296
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,490
Do you want to die?

297
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,390
Chenxiang,

298
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,990
quickly seal his acupoints.

299
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,290
The Ice Silkworm won't let go
until it's drunk its fill of blood.

300
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,790
We can't take any more risks.

301
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,390
Stay back.

302
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,930
I'm not taking a life
on my conscience for this.

303
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,960
Chenxiang, do it!

304
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,640
Stay back.

305
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,850
The Ice Silkworm is now awakened.

306
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,180
Quickly, take it to her.

307
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,500
Let's go.

308
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,020
I've already placed the Ice Silkworm
on her wound.

309
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,460
But when it feeds on decaying flesh,
the pain is extreme.

310
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,300
Having someone close by
would make it more bearable.

311
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,760
Sir, would you be willing to
stay by her side?

312
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,590
No, I'm not someone close to her.

313
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,990
So they're a pair of lovers
bound by resentment.

314
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,150
Miss.

315
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,220
Bear with it, miss.

316
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,490
Please endure it a little longer.

317
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,490
You go rest first.

318
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,350
I'll take over.

319
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,340
Don't move.

320
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,360
I gave you the chance to live.

321
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,690
Don't you dare die on me.

322
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,910
Yingxing! Yingxing!

323
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,900
Don't move. It'll be over soon.

324
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,100
Stay still. I'm here.

325
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,620
Mr. Yang.

326
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,930
It's so late.

327
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,660
Did you need something from me?

328
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,420
I have something to ask you.

329
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:12,950
Sit down.

330
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,560
After the battle at Mount Yin,
when the Shengyue Sect was destroyed,

331
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,540
I returned to Yunmen
and went into seclusion for several days.

332
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,400
What happened during those days?

333
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,620
I've been wanting to
report these matters to you,

334
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,280
but you seemed uninterested,

335
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,560
so I didn't say much.

336
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,400
Why are you suddenly interested now?

337
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,340
The Sect Leader was
fully in charge of that matter,

338
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,340
so it wasn't my place to inquire too much.

339
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,100
But now,

340
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,830
I need to confirm some things.

341
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,210
At that time, Sect Leader Feng led us,

342
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,690
along with Biluo, Qingcheng, Cangtong,
and other major sects,

343
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,130
to capture
all the remaining Shengyue Sect members.

344
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,330
Except for the two hall masters
of Water and Fire,

345
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,890
whose whereabouts remain unknown,

346
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,210
all other Shengyue Sect members
who were at Mount Yin that day

347
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,010
are now imprisoned
in the dungeon of Biluo Valley.

348
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,120
I heard about that,

349
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,690
but there's one thing I'm curious about.

350
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,060
Given Yuan Yingxing's martial arts skills,

351
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,890
although he couldn't turn the tide
and save his sect,

352
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,020
he could have easily escaped capture.

353
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,410
Why was he caught too?

354
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,620
That was all thanks to Ms. Yao.

355
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,140
After Ms. Yao assassinated
the witch Wang Yue,

356
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,340
Yuan Yingxing was completely devastated

357
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,340
and even seemed mentally unstable.

358
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,140
When Chief Lu captured him,

359
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,560
he didn't even resist.

360
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,110
Wasn't Yuan Yingxing infatuated with
Junior Yao?

361
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,700
Why was he so devastated
by Wang Yue's death?

362
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,960
As far as I know,

363
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,090
the Shengyue Sect had a tradition
of the chief marrying the saintess.

364
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,620
Which means,

365
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,150
if not for Ms. Yao,

366
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,860
Yuan Yingxing and Wang Yue

367
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,540
would have been a couple.

368
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,690
With that,

369
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,830
their feelings for each other
must have been special.

370
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,250
So, Yuan Yingxing is now

371
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,910
in the dungeon here?

372
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,020
Yes.

373
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Mr. Yang,

374
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,060
I know what you're worried about,

375
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,460
but you can rest assured.

376
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,480
Although the valley has been open
to guests these days,

377
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,780
and all sorts of people are here,

378
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,410
no one will be able to
rescue Yuan Yingxing.

379
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,870
He has no chance of escape.

380
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,840
Why are you so certain?

381
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,180
The dungeon
that holds the Shengyue Sect remnants

382
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,890
was built jointly by us
and other major sects.

383
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,100
There are guards watching outside

384
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,940
and all kinds of traps
set by Cangtong inside.

385
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,340
Even the only door to get there

386
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,020
can only be opened
with our sect's Sun Blade.

387
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,710
How come I never heard
that the Sun Blade was involved?

388
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,660
All of this is confidential.

389
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,110
If I hadn't been present

390
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,910
when they were designing
the restricted area,

391
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,570
I wouldn't have known either.

392
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,450
So, Mr. Yang, don't worry.

393
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,120
As long as we protect the Sun Blade,

394
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,600
they

395
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,690
will never escape in this lifetime.

396
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,630
I see.

397
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,440
No wonder she's so forward.

398
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,730
Mr. Yang, what did you say?

399
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,110
Is someone really trying to
rescue Yuan Yingxing?

400
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,450
Nothing.

401
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,950
I'm just worried

402
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,350
that, even though
the Shengyue Sect was destroyed,

403
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,350
there are still many people
who secretly follow them.

404
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,020
They won't give up
on the Shengyue Sect so easily.

405
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Yuan Yingxing...

406
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,280

What?

471
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,790
I called out Yuan Yingxing's name
in my dream yesterday,

472
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,320
and Yang Qing overheard me?

473
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,970
I don't want any.

474
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,370
You have no idea.

475
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,870
When he heard it outside,

476
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,200
his expression turned absolutely awful.

477
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,210
I'm doomed.

478
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,580
Yang Qing definitely misunderstood me.

479
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,690
He doesn't think I like Yuan Yingxing,
does he?

480
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,820
A man's pride...

481
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,820
Hearing something like that...

482
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,350
he's definitely really upset.

483
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,620
What should I do?

484
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,770
I need to explain this to him.

485
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,010
Yang Qing.

486
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,220
Here you are.

487
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,630
Did I say something last night

488
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,030
that made you sad or disappointed?

489
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,340
No.

490
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,890
I... I didn't say anything?

491
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,270
Nothing happened.

492
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,270
I'm not hurt, disappointed, or sad.

493
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,790
You don't need to explain.

494
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,270
How long are you going to
keep pacing back and forth?

495
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,820
You're making me dizzy.

496
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,390
You know,

497
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,610
if he would just get angry with me

498
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,970
or have an argument with me,

499
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,970
I'd feel better.

500
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,450
But he's not saying anything.

501
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,170
It just makes me so anxious!

502
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,620
Do you feel like

503
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,300
you've betrayed him somehow?

504
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,750
Well, calling out another man's name

505
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,990
in your sleep

506
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,680
is pretty much like betrayal.

507
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,410
The more he acts like he doesn't care,

508
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,140
the more heartless I seem.

509
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,180
Forget it. I don't want to
dwell on it anymore.

510
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,210
There's really nothing to dwell on.

511
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,070
If you ask me,

512
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,890
you should figure out

513
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,040
how to swallow your pride and fix this.

514
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,510
So, you think

515
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,250
that if I try to please him

516
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,780
and make him happy,

517
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,450
this whole thing will just blow over?

518
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,610
Yang Qing is such a good person.

519
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,610
Once this passes,

520
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,310
he won't hold it against me anymore.

521
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,230
Do you really think
he can be that forgiving?

522
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,800
Actually, all the slip-ups
I've made before

523
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,540
and the things I owe him explanations for—

524
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,740
even I feel guilty thinking about them.

525
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,140
But he never showed

526
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,420
any intention of settling scores later.

527
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,550
Since he could do that before,

528
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,500
he can certainly do it now.

529
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,210
Yang Qing,

530
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,880
you've been reading for so long.

531
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
You must be tired.

532
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,270
Let me give you a massage.

533
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:30,790
No need.

534
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,410
Then...

535
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,370
let me get you some water.

536
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,110
No need to be polite with me.

537
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,380
I'm not being polite.

538
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,750
That's great.

539
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,790
Why don't I accompany you
to your room for a rest?

540
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,770
You've been reading for so long.

541
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,410
You must be tired.

542
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,210
I'm not tired.

543
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,090
Then...

544
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,910
I'll go out for a walk with you?

545
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,910
I don't want to go.

546
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,500
Alright, then.

547
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,770
I'll just keep you company here.

548
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,680
Eat up.

549
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,780
Stop doing this.

550
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,350
Normally, I'd find it amusing
when you do things like this,

551
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,160
but right now,

552
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,880
I'm not moved at all.

553
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,060
I'm not just putting on a show.

554
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,620
I'm very serious about you.

555
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,020
But from my perspective,

556
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,480
I don't see any sincerity.

557
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,500
Then, what counts as sincerity?

558
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,910
I'm clearly doing my best
to be good to you.

559
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,520
Have you ever considered

560
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,010
that perhaps I don't need
this kind of flattery?

561
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,020
When you act this way,

562
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,110
it only makes me more uncomfortable.

563
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,430
What's wrong with being passionate?

564
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,570
I have a heart full of passion,

565
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,710
and I haven't given it to anyone else.

566
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,040
I've given it all to you.

567
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,050
Why would you think
that I'm not serious enough?

568
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,880
I can't tell which of your words are true

569
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,380
and which are false.

570
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,540
Maybe I should really think about

571
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,350
what I actually mean

572
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,700
to you.

573
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,380
Why is love so hard?

574
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,290
Yingxing.

575
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,180
Yingxing?

576
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,490
Yingxing.

577
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,060
I know what you're planning to do.

578
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,990
I'll go with you.

579
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,710
Yingxing.

580
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,340
You want to rescue the disciples
of the Shengyue Sect, don't you?

581
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,170
On your own,

582
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,250
you won't even make it through
the gates of Biluo Valley.

583
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,060
I can help you.

584
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,490
Biluo Valley is
hosting a birthday banquet soon,

585
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,170
and our sect has been invited.

586
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,710
I can disguise you as a fellow disciple

587
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,640
and bring you in.

588
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,410
Yao.

589
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,230
First, you saved me,

590
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,720
and now you offer to
take me to Biluo Valley.

591
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,210
Are you sincere this time?

592
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,170
Sir?

593
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,380
What a coincidence. We meet again.

594
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,450
Oh, it's you.

595
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,740
Why are you here?

596
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,630
I'm just here to
freeload at Biluo Valley's banquet.

597
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,489
I see that your brow is tightly furrowed.

598
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,489
Have you encountered some trouble?

599
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,870
Tell me about it,

600
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,980
and I'll give you a fortune reading.

601
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,179
Even if I get it wrong,

602
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,960
at least I can listen to your troubles

603
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,290
and help ease your mind.

604
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,600
It's nothing serious.

605
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,820
I just suddenly realized

606
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,590
that a certain young lady
cares deeply about someone.

607
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,400
That certain young lady

608
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,800
is the one
who was with you last time, right?

609
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,909
And the person she cares about
is a man, right?

610
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,050
Mr. Yang, could it be that you're jealous?

611
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,139
I...

612
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:43,120
I'm just worried
that she'll cause trouble again.

613
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Why don't you just go straight to her

614
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,110
and talk it out?

615
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,850
Even if you end up in an argument,
it's fine.

616
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,290
I don't want to force her
to admit anything,

617
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,790
and I don't want her to lie to me either.

618
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,190
But my heart feels heavy.

619
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,920
Thinking that she might be secretly
plotting something for someone else

620
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,050
makes me feel upset.

621
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,720
You're clearly suffering inside,

622
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,710
yet you don't even dare to ask her?

623
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:09,980
Yes, indeed.

624
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,090
Harboring secret doubts

625
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,050
will only push her further away.

626
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,750
I advise you, sir,

627
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,760
to talk it out with her
sooner rather than later.

628
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,600
I don't want to push her away.

629
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,900
Just give me some more time.

630
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,070
I'll definitely find a solution.

631
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,430
Since you already have your answer,

632
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,660
I won't intrude any further.

633
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,950
Same as last time,

634
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,020
10 coins.

635
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,100
See you.

636
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,330
Fire Hall Master, you've trespassed into
Biluo Valley.

637
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,730
Are you trying to
get Wangyue into trouble?

638
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,450
Do you know how many disciples

639
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
from righteous sects are here right now,

640
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,320
grinding their teeth in hatred
against your sect?

641
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,540
I need to protect them.

642
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,270
You're putting them in danger.

643
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,420
Or are you secretly

644
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,300
plotting something shady again?

645
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,260
If you have something to say,

646
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,520
go say it to the people
who need to hear it.

647
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,240
Mingyang?

648
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:42,300
Saint...

649
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,810
Miss Yang.

650
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,850
Why have you also come to Biluo Valley?

651
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,530
Miss Yang, you're speaking so loudly.

652
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,920
Are you trying to attract everyone

653
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,250
in the valley over here?

654
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,600
I'm not interested in your business.

655
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,380
I just want to know exactly

656
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,450
what you're really plotting.

657
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,490
What could we possibly be plotting?

658
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,750
Then why did you sneak into Biluo Valley?

659
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,040
Still refusing to talk?

660
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,330
About... about what?

661
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,930
I don't even know what you want me to say.

662
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,840
What kind of place is this valley?

663
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,170
Who is imprisoned here?

664
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,550
What is your identity?

665
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,620
What's your relationship with him?

666
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,480
Do you need me to spell it all out?

667
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,080
What are you trying to say?

668
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,780
You can't rescue some people

669
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,530
just because you want to.

670
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,650
Rescue... rescue who?

671
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,530
What are you talking about?

672
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,460
You're making me more and more confused.

673
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,270
Mingyang, didn't you come here

674
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,980
because you're pursuing me?

675
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,900
That's right.

676
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,030
I don't care why he came here.

677
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,020
He must leave immediately.

678
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,960
Why should I listen to you?

679
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,120
Because you're the Fire Hall Master
of the Shengyue Sect.

680
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,360
Everyone in this valley

681
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,470
will be targeting this place
because of you.

682
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,870
The longer you stay here,

683
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,850
the more trouble you'll cause.

684
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,540
I think Yang Qing is right.

685
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:11,530
Mingyang,

686
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,500
you really shouldn't pursue a girl
like this.

687
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,900
You still need to follow
the proper approach when courting a girl.

688
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,870
You just showed up

689
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,530
out of nowhere in this valley.

690
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,500
You'd better leave now.

691
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm coming on too strong here.

692
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,060
I'll leave right away.

693
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,020
The main road has heavy guards. Follow me.

694
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,580
You can leave from here

695
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,560
without encountering
the Biluo Valley disciples.

696
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,690
If you don't want to cause trouble
for Wangyue,

697
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,750
don't ever come back after you leave.

698
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,450
Yang Qing.

699
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,370
He's already gone.

700
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,540
Why are you still angry?

701
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,490
You're trying to rescue

702
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,620
the Shengyue Sect members imprisoned here,
aren't you?

703
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,130
How could you,
an orphan girl from Yangliu Town,

704
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,990
know Yuan Yingxing,
the Chief of the Shengyue Sect?

705
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,010
And how do you know
the Shengyue Sect's mental techniques?

706
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,300
Is it really because of your uncle?

707
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,460
I've told you before.

708
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,210
I don't like it when you keep lying to me.

709
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,540
You're awake.

710
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,940
I asked people from the valley,

711
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,320
and they said there's a shop nearby
with really good jujube cakes.

712
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,650
I wanted you to try some,

713
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,860
so I bought you some.

714
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,330
The nearest market is

715
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,080
over 10 miles away from here.

716
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,030
When did you go buy it?

717
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,090
Last night, at midnight.

718
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,880
I walked a long way in the dark.

719
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,060
The whole way I was thinking—

720
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,100
back in Yangliu Town,

721
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,410
when you stayed up

722
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,090
to buy me lotus cake,

723
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,740
were your feelings

724
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,900
the same as mine?

725
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,100
But then I thought,

726
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,210
your feelings should be different
from mine.

727
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,010
You always think more deeply,

728
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,070
while I think less.

729
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,300
For the same thing,

730
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,450
you can ponder deeply enough
to write a fascinating novel,

731
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,660
while I only see the surface.

732
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,880
So I've decided,

733
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,370
whatever you've experienced,

734
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,900
I want to experience it too.

735
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,740
With enough experience,

736
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,310
I'll naturally come to understand

737
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,710
the tangled, mixed feelings in your heart.

738
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,540

That's just who I am.

740
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,450

♪ At that moment, I fell for you again ♪

742
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,730
I don't care about the past,

00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,960
nor do I care about the future.

744
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,910

♪ Love can't be confessed,

746

♪ Memories return,
afraid it's a fated misstep ♪

749
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,580

♪ Gaze is brighter than the moonlight ♪

761
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,460
You'd wonder

762
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,940
if I came with ulterior motives

763
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,230
and how serious I really am about you.

00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,500
♪ I can't hide my lovesickness ♪

765
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,850

I'm really serious about you.

767
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,880

♪ Let me love you more ♪

769
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,620
acting out just because I can't have you.

770

That's not who I am.

771
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,810
Maybe sometimes
I don't handle things well,

772
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:47,950
♪ Make up for the years to make us even ♪

773
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,580

people change and grow.

775
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,490

that you came with the intention of
eventually leaving me?

786
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:12,730
Of course not.

787
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,920

♪ I meet the future, I dream of the past ♪

793

in your dream.

795
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,500

dreams are different from reality
after all.
