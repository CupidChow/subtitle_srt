[A Forbidden Marriage]

2
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,920
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,700
[Wangyou Pavilion]

4
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,450
Mr. Yang.

5
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,350
You see, your injuries are so severe,

6
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,560
yet that Demonic Healer
barely looked at you

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,640
and claimed it was nothing serious,

8
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,200
that all you needed was some rest

9
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,130
and medication,

10
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,160
and you'd be able to walk in no time.

11
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,010
Why is it that with Mr. Shen,

12
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,280
she's been in there for so long

13
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,340
with no news at all?

14
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,320
Is this Lingyin even competent?

15
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,910
You being allowed to stay here

16
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,750
is already Chief

17
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,840
going easy on you

18
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,070
for Saintess's sake.

19
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,170
Lingyin has no obligation
to save that old man,

20
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,370
so don't push your luck.

21
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,570
If Yang Wangyue hadn't stolen
the Sun Blade,

22
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,770
would we even be here?

23
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,360
If he hadn't been poisoned by Ghost Scent,

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,800
Elder Shen wouldn't have been injured
by Lu Xuanxuan.

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
And let me tell you this,

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,760
you'd better cure the Ghost Scent quickly,

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,820
or this isn't over.

28
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,290
A dying man poisoned by Ghost Scent

29
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,780
still trying to threaten me?

30
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,980
Even if I die, I'll drag you down with me!

31
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,690
Shang Huai,

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,290
stop talking nonsense.

33
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,360
Miss Lingyin's medical skills
are excellent.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,310
If she's been in there for so long
without coming out,

35
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,370
I fear Senior Shen's condition
might be quite serious.

36
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,590
Mr. Yang.

37
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,670
You've seen
how the Shengyue Sect people treat us.

38
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,630
A man can be killed but not humiliated.

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,350
I think we should quickly
retrieve the Sun Blade

40
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,950
and take Mr. Shen
back to Yunmen for treatment.

41
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,930
Quite lively here today.

42
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,220
What's going on?

43
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,240
Aren't Yunmen and the Shengyue Sect

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,840
sworn enemies?

45
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,290
Why are both sects here today?

46
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,240
Aren't you that little kid?

47
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,410
You've grown so much.

48
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,780
What was your name again?

49
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,020
Yang...

50
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,400
Yang Qing?

51
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,690
That's me.

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,370
And senior, you are?

53
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,010
Murong Xuan from Yanmen.

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
Yang Qing.

55
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,990
Let me ask you something.

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,770
How does Mr. Shen's martial skills

57
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,700
measure up against Lu Xuanxuan's?

58
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,780
In theory, Senior Shen's skills

59
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,150
should be more than enough

60
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,410
to handle Lu Xuanxuan.

61
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,120
Could it be because
he was poisoned by Ghost Scent

62
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,250
and forcibly used his inner strength?

63
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,520
Elder Shen's exposure to Ghost Scent
shouldn't be severe.

64
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,290
Plus, with his profound inner strength,

65
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,079
he shouldn't have been affected.

66
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,440
What's strange is that

67
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,180
Lu Xuanxuan merely brushed him
with her palm strike,

68
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,630
yet your senior was injured so severely.

69
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,260
Though there are no visible wounds,

70
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,430
his internal organs are all damaged,

71
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,440
and his condition is critical.

72
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,360
I've prescribed some medicine
to keep him alive for now.

73
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,890
Whether he'll make it or not

74
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
is in the hands of fate.

75
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,710
What did you just say?

76
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,680
You quack!

77
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,170
Shang Huai!

78
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,920
Shang Huai.

79
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,050
Stop making a scene.

80
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,210
Miss Lingyin wouldn't joke with
someone's life.

81
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,930
Shang Huai.

82
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,560
If you think you've lived too long,

83
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,690
I don't mind making the Ghost Scent
take effect sooner.

84
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,630
I apologize, Miss Lingyin.

85
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,720
Are you certain that Senior Shen

86
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,680
was injured like this
by Lu Xuanxuan's palm strike?

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,480
That's right.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,920
Back at Yunmen,

89
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,220
I once sparred with Miss Lu.

90
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,880
But with her skills,

91
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,980
she couldn't possibly
have injured Mr. Shen this badly.

92
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,909
It's the Six Harmonies Divine Art.

93
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,730
I've examined Elder Shen's wounds.

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,830
So it's indeed
the Six Harmonies Divine Art.

95
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,800
Legend has it that those
who practice this evil technique

96
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,040
gradually develop bloodlust, eventually
turning against their own family,

97
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,500
becoming brutal killers.

98
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,700
But why would Lu Xuanxuan know
how to use

99
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,220
this long-lost evil technique
from the martial world?

100
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,280
Now that you mention it,

101
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,840
it does make some sense.

102
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,070
According to records,

103
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,670
the Six Harmonies Divine Art
kills invisibly,

104
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,550
often leaving only a palm print.

105
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,650
The injured may appear to
have only external wounds, but in fact,

106
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,800
their inner strength is damaged
and their meridians are in chaos,

107
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,950
leading to death shortly after.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,730
Impossible.

109
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,230
This absolutely cannot be.

110
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,070
Lu Xuanxuan is the daughter of
the Chief of Biluo Valley.

111
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,330
How could she practice evil techniques?

112
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,720
This Biluo Valley

113
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,450
has never been anything good.

114
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,950
Master Murong,

115
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,220
can Senior Shen still be saved?

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,480
I've only heard about this technique.

117
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,250
As for the specific treatment method,

118
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,050
I have no idea.

119
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,830
It's just the Six Harmonies Divine Art,
isn't it?

120
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,159
Let me study it further.

121
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,470
Don't worry.

122
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,700
I won't let this old man

123
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,100
die in our Shengyue Sect.

124
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,260
This is the Shengyue Sect.

125
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm warning you all,

126
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,170
behave yourselves.

127
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,270
If anything else goes wrong,

128
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,930
none of you will get out alive!

129
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,310
Master Murong.

130
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,000
Regarding the Six Harmonies Divine Art,

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,660
what else do you know about it?

132
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,850
This technique must be practiced
by young children.

133
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,830
Once mastered,

134
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,740
the palm strikes are merciless,

135
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,120
leaving nothing unscathed.

136
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,190
Actually,

137
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,370
this technique

138
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,510
was invented by the former Chief
of the Shengyue Sect,

139
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,590
causing catastrophe
throughout the martial world.

140
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,510
It had been unraveled and suppressed
after much effort,

141
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,920
yet the people of Biluo Valley

142
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,370
somehow recovered its manual

143
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,390
and actually brought it back
to the martial world.

144
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,360
In that case,

145
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,200
all our previous doubts,

146
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,950
including the missing children case,

147
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,150
can now be explained.

148
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,340
Our top priority now

149
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,140
is to find a way

150
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,100
to counter this technique.

151
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,340
When this evil technique ran rampant
years ago,

152
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,540
it was the Yunmen founder
who saved the situation from collapse,

153
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,810
turning the tide when all seemed lost.

154
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,800
As for how he countered the evil technique

155
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,090
and saved the victims,

156
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,150
it was so long ago

157
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,610
that outsiders know nothing about it.

158
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,310
Mr. Yang, since you're a Yunmen elder,

159
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,610
you could easily access

160
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,070
the records of that conflict
between the two sects back then.

161
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,470
Before things get worse,

162
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,890
quickly report this to your Sect Leader.

163
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,580
That old man Feng Xingyun

164
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,750
surely knows how formidable this is.

165
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,180
Thank you for your advice, senior.

166
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,390
[Tianyu Palace]

167
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,490
Yuan Yingxing.

168
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,840
How are Yang Qing and the others?

169
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,030
Going around
talking about Yang Qing nonstop.

170
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,230
How are the sect affairs being handled?

171
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,950
Everything's been taken care of.

172
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,810
I'm exhausted.

173
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:58,870
Someone.

174
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,570
Yes.

175
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,380
Have the Saintess review

176
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,680
today's branch reports.

177
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,160
Yes.

178
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,090
Are you serious, Yuan Yingxing?

179
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,720
I've taken care of everything
you asked me to,

180
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,920
and now there's more?

181
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,270
This is what you promised me yourself.

182
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,600
You should at least give me some time
to rest.

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,070
Rest?

184
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,630
You think I don't know

185
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,310
you want to rest
just so you can go find Yang Qing?

186
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,870
Yue.

187
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,310
The entire martial world
is in turmoil now.

188
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,090
Biluo Valley claims Yang Qing
and Elder Shen have betrayed Yunmen,

189
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,310
and they've temporarily taken over
the position of alliance leader.

190
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,270
Today's Yunmen

191
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,880
is not what it used to be.

192
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,690
And today's Yang Qing

193
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,750
is no longer the celebrated Yang Qing
he once was.

194
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,809
Yang Qing has been my man for a long time.

195
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,320
What happens between him and Yunmen

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
is none of my concern.

197
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,930
Besides,

198
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,250
it's better if Yunmen falls apart.

199
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,270
That way, Yang Qing can come over

200
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,690
to help me handle
the Shengyue Sect affairs,

201
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,390
and I get to be a hands-off Saintess.

202
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,120
How comfortable would that be?

203
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,790
With Yunmen fallen to such a state,

204
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,360
Yang Qing definitely won't
stand by and do nothing.

205
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,340
I can help him.

206
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,840
I've never liked

207
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,440
that insignificant Biluo Valley,

208
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,240
and I've been meaning to handle them
for quite a while.

209
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,300
You and whose army?

210
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,580
Let me make this clear:

211
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,660
I won't give you any backing,

212
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,500
not even Lingyin and Mingyang.

213
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,160
Yuan Yingxing.

214
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,320
Didn't you already agree

215
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,980
that I could be with Yang Qing?

216
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,660
You even promised me a dowry.

217
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,090
But was it you he wed?

218
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,510
The one he married
with a grand wedding procession

219
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,240
was Yao Fu.

220
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,600
How do you explain that?

221
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,880
I've already told you,

222
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,260
and he's explained everything to me.

223
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,410
Besides, he nearly died for me.

224
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,050
Well, he's not dead, is he?

225
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,100
His supposed devotion to you

226
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,360
was just a ploy to get

227
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,030
the Sun Blade.

228
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,160
So what?

229
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,480
I trust him anyway.

230
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,610
Yuan Yingxing.

231
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,820
Chief.

232
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,040
Let's just help him.

233
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you think I don't know

234
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,500
you're still secretly hiding Yao Fu?

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,390
I heard you were poisoned by Ghost Scent,

236
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,720
so I came to check on you.

237
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,770
Mr. Yang.

238
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,360
Once Mr. Shen recovers,

239
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,100
we must take revenge on the Shengyue Sect.

240
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,030
They're responsible for all this.

241
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,840
Right now, the top priority is
to overcome the Six Harmonies Divine Art.

242
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,830
It's not wise for us to
keep opposing the Shengyue Sect.

243
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,090
I've already informed Sect Leader Feng
about this matter.

244
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Is this really that serious?

245
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,600
Don't cause any trouble while you're here.

246
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,330
The less conflict, the better.

247
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,320
As for the Ghost Scent
you've been exposed to,

248
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,710
your pulse is stable,

249
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,920
so it shouldn't flare up anytime soon.

250
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,130
Let Miss Lingyin focus

251
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,640
on treating Senior Shen.

252
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,530
-Yes, Mr. Yang.
-Yes, Mr. Yang.

253
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,780
When you have time,

254
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,580
help Miss Lingyin with her work.

255
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,020
She might cure your Ghost Scent
while she's at it.

256
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,880
Chief.

257
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,500
Mr. Yang has something

258
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,630
to discuss with you.

259
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,110
Let him in.

260
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:26,960
Yes.

261
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,720
Yang Qing, you're here.

262
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,050
Are you feeling better?

263
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,400
What about Elder Shen?

264
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,250
I'm fine now.

265
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,570
Miss Lingyin

266
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,040
is making every effort
to treat Senior Shen.

267
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,390
What brings you here, Elder Yang?

268
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,420
Thank you, Chief Yuan,

269
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,560
for allowing us to stay
at Shengyue Sect temporarily.

270
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,360
Stop it.

271
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,240
Skip the pleasantries

272
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,640
and just get to the point.

273
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,390
Biluo Valley has seized the position of
alliance leader during the chaos,

274
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,200
and now they're rallying all major sects

275
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
to unite against the Shengyue Sect.

276
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,020
If it really comes to a fight,

277
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,340
all sides will suffer heavy casualties.

278
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,770
Meanwhile, Lu Jin has sinister ambitions

279
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,980
and is currently practicing
the Six Harmonies Divine Art.

280
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,510
I believe the Shengyue Sect

281
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,300
should quickly join forces with Yunmen

282
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,900
to find a way to stop this.

283
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,000
Fifty years ago,

284
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,510
countless people in the martial world died
due to the Six Harmonies Divine Art,

285
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,370
and our Shengyue Sect

286
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,550
has long forbidden
the practice of this evil technique.

287
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,390
Why would Biluo Valley practice
this evil technique?

288
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,750
Senior Shen was injured by
the Six Harmonies Divine Art,

289
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,870
and he still hasn't regained
consciousness.

290
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,920
If Lu Xuanxuan already possesses
such destructive power,

291
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,050
who knows what level

292
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,150
Chief Lu has reached in his training.

293
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,840
If we don't stop this now,

294
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,390
not only the entire martial world

295
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,340
but even innocent civilians
will suffer as a result.

296
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,860
So, will the Shengyue Sect

297
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,110
join forces with us
to restore peace to the martial world?

298
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,900
Our Shengyue Sect

299
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,060
certainly won't stand by and do nothing.

300
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,860
Right, Chief?

301
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,500
What do you mean "right"?

302
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,100
You simply believe everything
Yang Qing says.

303
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,460
What if he's making all this up?

304
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,640
I, Yang Qing, would never joke about

305
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,270
the safety of the martial world.

306
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,230
If we join forces,

307
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,000
we can command the world
with the Sun and Moon Blades,

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
convince the other sects together,

309
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,460
and leave Biluo Valley nowhere to hide.

310
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,060
You sure know how to talk.

311
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,810
But I still don't trust you.

312
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,130
You promised me before

313
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,790
that you would take good care of Yue,

314
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,070
but what happened after that?

315
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,670
You went and married Yao Fu instead.

316
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,200
Why exactly did you do that?

317
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,060
There are many misunderstandings
about my marriage to Junior Yao.

318
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,870
Given your relationship with her,
Chief Yuan,

319
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,000
you could easily ask her privately

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,260
what really happened.

321
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,780
In any case,

322
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,440
I will certainly give Wangyue
an explanation.

323
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,370
It's just right now, this alliance

324
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,140
cannot be delayed any longer.

325
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,190
Once Biluo Valley gains control over
the other sects,

326
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,270
the consequences would be unimaginable.

327
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:57,790
So what?

328
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,750
Isn't it just fighting and killing?

329
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,690
Isn't that
what the martial world is all about?

330
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,350
Chief Yuan,

331
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
what will it take for you to trust me?

332
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,970
Yuan Yingxing,

333
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,680
let's help him.

334
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
This might actually be a good thing.

335
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,030
By joining forces with Yunmen,

336
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,830
we can also clear
our Shengyue Sect's reputation.

337
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,250
How about this?

338
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,960
Yang Qing, if you

339
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,670
kowtow to me three times right here,

340
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,070
I'll trust you this once.

341
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,130
Yuan Yingxing, have you lost your mind?

342
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,630
Yue.

343
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,150
This Tianyu Palace

344
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,610
is the sacred heritage site
of our Shengyue Sect.

345
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,710
If Yang Qing is willing to kneel
and kowtow,

346
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,240
then I'll believe
he sincerely wants to cooperate with us.

347
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,980
But...

348
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,990
This matter concerns the safety
of the entire martial world.

349
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,850
I hope the Shengyue Sect
will lend us a helping hand.

350
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,320
We've been waiting for so long.

351
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,270
Didn't Yue say

352
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,750
she'd find someone to help us?

353
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,460
Where is that person?

354
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,460
We've been waiting forever.

355
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,350
Saintess always keeps her word.

356
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,480
Let's just wait a bit longer.

357
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,210
Wait longer?

358
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,820
If we wait any longer,
Elder Shen will be dead.

359
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,940
W-Why are you here?

360
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,380
Mr. Yang said

361
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,860
you'd need my help to save Mr. Shen,

362
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,140
and he asked me to come tonight.

363
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,180
How could you possibly help?

364
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,630
I...

365
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,680
Alright.

366
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,920
We don't have time to waste.

367
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,440
He'll have to do,

368
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,640
better than nothing.

369
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,880
You're here.

370
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,510
The money.

371
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,850
Wait for me here.

372
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,650
I'll go check.

373
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,070
This one is in excellent condition,

374
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:14,800
very intact.

375
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,390
Mingyang, Jiang Yan.

376
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,450
Both of you, come here and get to work.

377
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,450
Don't examine it here.

378
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,620
Take it back to examine.

379
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,550
Or it's bad luck.

380
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,760
Got it. Got it.

381
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,030
Hurry up, you two.

382
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,510
Mingyang, you see,

383
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,550
this one is really good.

384
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,950
Look,

385
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,530
it's perfectly intact,

386
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,330
and the condition is quite good.

387
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,390
Hey, Jiang Yan,

388
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,720
why are you still standing there
after I've called you so many times?

389
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,980
What's with that "ah"?

390
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,680
What's that expression on your face?

391
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
You've been in the martial world
for so many years.

392
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,260
Haven't you ever seen a dead body before?

393
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,360
Didn't you come to help?

394
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,560
Get in there quickly.

395
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,790
Hurry up.

396
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,230
Stop dawdling.

397
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,480
Listen,

398
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,290
if you find any more in this condition,

399
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,810
remember to contact me.

400
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,550
If you need these things so badly,

401
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,130
you might want to check
around Biluo Valley.

402
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,440
I don't know what happened there recently,

403
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,099
but they say

404
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,460
many people have died.

405
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,130
What happened?

406
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,290
I don't know the details,

407
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,720
just heard that Biluo Valley was sealed
for collective cultivation,

408
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,180
and something went wrong.

409
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,020
Kid,

410
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,260
put that sack here.

411
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,610
Is this how you respect the deceased?

412
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,480
Is this how your Shengyue Sect

413
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,330
treats the bodies of the deceased?

414
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,160
Not always.

415
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,020
It depends on what Lingyin needs.

416
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,710
Such behavior

417
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,140
shows no respect for the dead.

418
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,960
She's only doing this
to save your Yunmen people, okay?

419
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,430
Otherwise, why would a young woman
like her

420
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,980
have to get in contact with
this kind of thing

421
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,240
and get herself all bloody and stinking?

422
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,690
I'm sorry.

423
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,720
I spoke out of turn.

424
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,380
I was just asking out of curiosity.

425
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,350
It's exactly because of people like you

426
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,680
that Lingyin has such a bad reputation
in the martial world,

427
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,280
surrounded by all those ridiculous rumors.

428
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,610
But how would you gossips know

429
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,120
that she deals with the dead so often

430
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,600
only to save

431
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,720
more patients?

432
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,520
Forget it.

433
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,070
There's no point talking to

434
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,510
hypocrites like you.

435
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,110
Fire Hall Master.

436
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,880
I'm sorry.

437
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,750
I misspoke.

438
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,650
I'll go help too.

439
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,440
I'm going to start now.

440
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,700
You may leave the room.

441
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,980
How about we stay and help?

442
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,280
Trust the doctor.

443
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,810
Let's go.

444
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,460
Thank you in advance.

445
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,560
How much longer will it take?

446
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,490
Go check.

447
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,140
Go.

448
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,450
Mr. Yang.

449
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,200
In there...

450
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,790
I'll go in and check.

451
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,920
Don't get in the way.

452
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,400
It's been a whole day already.

453
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,880
If there's even the slightest hope,

454
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,540
Lingyin won't let Old Man die.

455
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:32,900
How did it go?

456
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,640
Elder Shen is mostly out of danger now.

457
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,330
But for a complete recovery,

458
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,950
it might take a few more days.

459
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,400
You may go in and check on him now.

460
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,920
Okay.

461
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,560
Thanks a lot.

462
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,880
What about you?

463
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,550
Are you alright?

464
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,110
I'm fine.

465
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,210
Lingyin!

466
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,440
I just want to ask you,

467
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,260
why exactly did you marry Yang Qing?

468
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,110
Yang Qing only has Yue in his heart.

469
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,910
He doesn't care about you at all.

470
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,120
Why did you marry him?

471
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,460
What exactly do you want?

472
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,880
What do I want?

473
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,360
What's the point of talking about it now?

474
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
It's all too late.

475
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,880
Both Murong Xuan

476
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,640
and Yue say you like me.

477
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,240
But if it's true,

478
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,210
why did you marry Yang Qing?

479
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,550
Yao Fu.

480
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,440
Do you really not want to talk to me?

481
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,260
[Wangyou Pavilion]

482
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,640
Here, Mr. Shen.

483
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,570
Please sit down.

484
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,930
Take it easy.

485
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,530
This place is quite nicely arranged.

486
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,320
All these plants were grown
by Master Murong.

487
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,460
He really has settled down

488
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,280
in the Shengyue Sect territory.

489
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,690
Mr. Yang.

490
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,170
Senior Shen, are you feeling better?

491
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,240
Help me up.

492
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:34,790
Alright.

493
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,040
I'm out of danger now

494
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
and can leave when the time is right.

495
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,550
Junior,

496
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,540
did you get the Sun Blade?

497
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,920
Getting the Sun Blade isn't difficult;

498
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,880
the problem is what we do next.

499
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,830
We'll return to Yunmen first, of course.

500
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,200
It would be disgraceful for us

501
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,930
to linger in the Shengyue Sect.

502
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,720
With Biluo Valley involved in
the shameful matter

503
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,560
of practicing
the Six Harmonies Divine Art,

504
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,110
we'd better rush back to investigate.

505
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,570
Going back to Yunmen
may not be appropriate.

506
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,450
Mr. Yang,

507
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,110
didn't you specifically write

508
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,350
to Sect Leader Feng
about the situation here?

509
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,750
What did Sect Leader say?

510
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
That's exactly what I find strange.

511
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,030
Sect Leader still hasn't responded,

512
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,030
which worries me.

513
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,110
News about us in the Shengyue Sect

514
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,920
has spread throughout the martial world.

515
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,120
Going back rashly now

516
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,000
would be risky with the unclear situation.

517
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,660
It's better

518
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,340
to stay here

519
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,070
to be safe.

520
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,920
No, that's not right.

521
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,110
Given Sect Leader Feng's temperament,

522
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,000
there's no way he wouldn’t respond to

523
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,130
such a major matter.

524
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,440
Unless...

525
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,610
Something has happened to him.

526
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,510
I need to return to Yunmen.

527
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,000
You haven't fully recovered yet

528
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,460
and shouldn't act rashly.

529
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,920
I've made up my mind.

530
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,610
You stay here and continue healing,

531
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,560
and I'll

532
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,210
make a trip back to Yunmen.

533
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,140
I won't be at ease

534
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,670
if you return on your own.

535
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,560
Take all the disciples with you.

536
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,930
In case something happens,

537
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,550
you can look after each other.

538
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,080
Alright.

539
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,920
[Saintess Hall]

540
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,030
Yang Qing!

541
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,510
Yang Qing!

542
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,500
Your wounds haven't healed yet,

543
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,100
and you're already leaving?

544
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:18,920
Yes,

545
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,590
this is my responsibility.

546
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,390
I don't agree.

547
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
The situation at Yunmen is unclear,

548
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,750
and whether it's been taken over
by Biluo Valley or not

549
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,750
is still unknown.

550
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,440
I won't let you go no matter what.

551
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,310
Wangyue,

552
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,630
I won't let anything happen to me.

553
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,030
Yunmen is in trouble now,

554
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,190
and the martial world is in danger.

555
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,480
As a disciple of Yunmen,

556
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,680
how can I ignore this?

557
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,000
How has Yunmen treated you?

558
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,200
Just for the sake of reputation,

559
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,840
they forced you to marry Yao Fu.

560
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,880
Now that something this serious
has happened,

561
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,540
they still expect you to fix it.

562
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,400
What if something happens to you—

563
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,810
do you want me to live as a widow
for the rest of my life?

564
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,730
In your eyes,

565
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,480
am I really that useless?

566
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,430
It's not that.

567
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,990
I know you're very capable.

568
00:25:59,250 --> 00:25:59,820
But

569
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,310
I don't want you to sacrifice yourself
for Yunmen.

570
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,000
Yang Qing.

571
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,580
We've already performed
our wedding ceremony.

572
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,880
You're already part of our Shengyue Sect.

573
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,080
In our Shengyue Sect,

574
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,120
since you've married me,

575
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,750
you can't go against your wife.

576
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,070
You must follow your wife's lead

577
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,810
and be a dutiful husband,

578
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,540
understand?

579
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,870
Wangyue.

580
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,880
I can yield to you on everything else,

581
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,250
but not on this matter.

582
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,110
No,

583
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,100
I simply don't want you to go.

584
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,440
Is it only when you truly become mine

585
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,930
that you'll be completely devoted to me?

586
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,750
Let's go to our wedding chamber right now.

587
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,280
Wangyue,

588
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,780
how about this?

589
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,300
Let's have a contest.

590
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,440
If I win,

591
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,680
you'll return the Sun Blade to me.

592
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,610
If you win,

593
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,070
I'll...

594
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,000
Go to the wedding chamber with you.

595
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,440
Great!

596
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,280
Wait a minute.

597
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,760
Why do I feel like whether I win or lose,

598
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,530
you're the one who benefits?

599
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,890
Best two out of three.

600
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,380
Agreed.

601
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:13,850
I've won.

602
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,310
Yang Qing,

603
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,480
aren't you a man? You...

604
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,110
Can't you let me win one round?

605
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,510
But we're in the Shengyue Sect,

606
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,440
your territory,

607
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
so you should be the one letting me win.

608
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,320
J-Just for the sake of

609
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,080
me liking you for so many years,

610
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,550
just let me win one round.

611
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,220
Do you think saying that

612
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,280
will make me pretend I didn't see

613
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,510
you drawing an extra card just now?

614
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,550
It's just a game, isn't it?

615
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,790
Do you have to be so serious?

616
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,920
What's the harm in letting me win once?

617
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,110
You're right.

618
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,110
It's just a game.

619
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,880
So why are you taking it so seriously?

620
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,950
Why can't you just let me win?

621
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,570
Let's continue.

622
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,840
Wangyue,

623
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:24,680
look.

624
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,630
I'm not falling for
that trick of yours anymore.

625
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,370
Since you're here,

626
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,750
don't think about leaving.

627
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,240
If Yuan Yingxing can keep Yao Fu locked
in Tianyu Palace,

628
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,130
I can lock you up here
in the Saintess Hall,

629
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,730
so I can be with you every day.

630
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,120
Wangyue.

631
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,320
I've wanted to be with you

632
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,320
all along, from then until now,

633
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,390
to be together forever and ever,

634
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,110
never to be apart.

635
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,740
But in this world,

636
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,790
there're still many things I must do

637
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,450
and responsibilities I have to bear.

638
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,180
I can't run away from my duties.

639
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,860
You wouldn't like a deserter, either,

640
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,460
would you?

641
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,200
I'm worried about you.

642
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,870
I know you're worried about me,

643
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,600
afraid I might never come back.

644
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,610
I understand all these concerns.

645
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,920
Don't worry.

646
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,790
I'll definitely take good care of myself

647
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,590
and return to you safe and sound.

648
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,130
Something unexpected might happen
along the way,

649
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,480
but trust me,

650
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,490
no matter what happens,

651
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,090
I will overcome all obstacles

652
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,150
to come back to you.

653
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,880
I...

654
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,570
When I come back,

655
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,360
I'll agree to

656
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,980
anything you wish.

657
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,820
Alright?

658
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,170
Do you mean it?

659
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,210
I promise you with my life.

660
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,800
If you don't say anything,

661
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,930
I'll take it as a yes.

662
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,570
You can go,

663
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,710
but you must take me with you.

664
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,760
And then what?

665
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,480
We'll become a pair of fugitive lovers?

666
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,460
What fugitive lovers?

667
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,300
How could Yunmen possibly be unable to
defeat Biluo Valley?

668
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,210
Besides, our Shengyue Sect will help you.

669
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,100
The situation is unclear now.

670
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,700
If you come with me to Yunmen,

671
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,570
and something goes wrong,

672
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,450
we'll have to fend for ourselves.

673
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,100
It's somewhat dangerous.

674
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,130
But if you stay at the Shengyue Sect,

675
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,930
things would be very different.

676
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,560
If something happens to me,

677
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,640
I can still count on your support,

678
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,180
right, Saintess?

679
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,440
You do have a point.

680
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,080
But...

681
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,550
But without you,

682
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,000
Yuan Yingxing

683
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,960
probably wouldn't agree so readily

684
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,420
to cooperate with Yunmen.

685
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,230
Right.

686
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,110
That stingy Yuan Yingxing, honestly.

687
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,350
So,

688
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,110
Wangyue, just stay put
at the Shengyue Sect

689
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,200
and wait for me to return,

690
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,550
okay?

691
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,240
Alright then.

692
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,960
I'll send people to follow you.

693
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,280
If anything happens,

694
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,730
I'll immediately lead people
to storm Biluo Valley.

695
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:42,140
Take the Sun Blade with you.

696
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,610
♪ At that moment, I fell for you again ♪

697
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,410

♪ Love can't be confessed,

699
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,450
I've thought about it.

700
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,660
The Sun Blade would be safer with you.

701
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,550
♪ Memories return,
afraid it's a fated misstep ♪

702
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,110
But

703
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,390
what if they demand the Sun Blade
from you?

704
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,620
♪ Why does fate always keep us apart? ♪

705
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,440
♪ A restless heart, an iceberg melting ♪

706
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,240
It's alright.

707
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,870
Don't worry.

708
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,020
I'll find a way to handle it.

709
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,570
♪ Rewrite the stories in this world ♪

710
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,170
Yang Qing,

711
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,290
remember,

712
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,790
♪ Gaze is brighter than the moonlight ♪

no matter what happens,

714
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,680
I'll be here waiting for you to return.

715
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,850
You can't get hurt.

716
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:36,100

717
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,110

Elder Shen.

725
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,130
Miss Lingyin.

726
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,790
How are you feeling lately?

727
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,030
Much better,

728
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,160
no major issues now.

729
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,020
That's good.

730
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,310
At your age,

731
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,990
recovery will be slower.

732
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,080
You should be extra careful

733
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,300
not to let the wounds split open again.

734
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,680
If there's anything that needs handling,

735
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,280
let your subordinates do it.

736
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,470
I see your wounds are
at risk of reopening.

737
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,120
Have you been moving around a lot lately?

738
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,720
I occasionally go out for walks.

739
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,650
Try to move less.

740
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,080
If the wounds reopen,
it will be difficult to heal properly.

741
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,880
I understand.

742
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,610
If there's nothing else,

743
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,870
I'll take my leave now.

744
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,450
Miss Lingyin,

745
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,970
thank you.

746
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,000
I jumped to conclusions before

747
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,190
and misunderstood you.

748
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,060
Jiang Yan?

749
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,480
[Wangyou Pavilion]

750
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,280
Miss Lingyin.

751
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,690
I-I have something I want to tell you.

752
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,080
Go ahead.

753
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,389
Miss Lingyin.

754
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,710
I had many misunderstandings
about you before.

755
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,750
I'm sorry.

756
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,030
That's it?

757
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:44,550
It's okay.

758
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,760
People don't know much about
our Shengyue Sect,

759
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
so misunderstandings are quite normal.

760
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,370
I've heard it all before,

761
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,330
so I don't mind.

762
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,489
And about the Ghost Scent,

763
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,960
thank you for showing mercy.

764
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,920
I know you didn't actually
use Ghost Scent on us.

765
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,260
You were just trying to scare us.

766
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,190
As for Shang Huai

767
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,010
and my juniors,
I'll explain everything to them.

768
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:10,840
Don't worry.

769
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
Not bad.

770
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,880
You've grown quite a bit
since you came here,

771
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,840
and gotten smarter too.

772
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,460
You...

773
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,110
Please hear me out first.

774
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,320
Lingyin.

775
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,200
I'm not a kid.

776
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,650
I'm about to leave.

777
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,080
If we ever meet again,

778
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,440
could you give me a chance?

779
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,680
I like you.

780
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,840
Whenever you're around,

781
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,630
I can't help but look at you.

782
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,360
Jiang Yan.

783
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,470
I'm sorry.

784
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,550
I...

785
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,440
I understand.

786
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,320
Your heart belongs to someone else.

787
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,070
I shouldn't have teased you
from the beginning.

788
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,710
I don't know what's wrong with me.

789
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,360
I just love teasing people for no reason.

790
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
It's all my fault.

791
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,040
I just wanted to try my luck.

792
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,270
I didn't expect you to reject me
so directly.

793
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,360
Well, Mr. Yang needs me for something.

794
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,510
I'll be going now.

795
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,660
Until we meet again!

796
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,510
Take care.

797
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:51,960
Yue.

798
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
If you feel upset,

799
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,820
just speak out.

800
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,050
Why should I be uoset?

801
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,640
It's not like Yang Qing's gone forever.

802
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,280
Alright, alright.

803
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,190
Now, Saintess,

804
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,900
can you go back to handle
the sect affairs?

805
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,500
You're rushing me again.

806
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,900
Are you planning to dump

807
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,580
all the sect affairs on me now?

808
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,370
It can't be helped. You're the one
who let Yang Qing enter Mount Yin

809
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,960
and used our sect's resources

810
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,090
to save some old man.

811
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,670
Fine, fine.

812
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,670
I'll take full responsibility
for the sect affairs,

813
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,440
but you

814
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,180
can't be fooled
by that woman Yao Fu again.

815
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,610
I've heard from several people

816
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,160
that you've been
in a constant stand-off with her lately.

817
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,400
You know very well
that she's a calculating woman

818
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,730
who won't reveal anything.

819
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,330
So what exactly are you trying to
get out of her?

820
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,530
Yue.

821
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:42,040
I've already accepted your relationship
with Yang Qing,

822
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,100
and I've also agreed

823
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,560
to reconcile with Yunmen.

824
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,610
As for the matter between Yao Fu and me,

825
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,380
I want to handle it myself.

826
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,440
I'm just worried

827
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,440
you'll go irrational again
with her by your side.

828
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,150
Yue.

829
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,490
I respect your relationship
with Yang Qing,

830
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,210
and I hope you can understand
mine with Yao Fu.

831
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,610
I just want to figure out

832
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,860
why she treated me this way

833
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,420
and what she really wants.

834
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,070
So,

835
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,460
is Yao Fu to you

836
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,760
the same as Yang Qing is to me?

837
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,950
Alright.

838
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,030
I don't want to be like some
wicked mother-in-law between you two.

839
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,920
But honestly,

840
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,280
if she dares to harm
our Shengyue Sect again,

841
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,730
I won't let her off—

842
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,790
and I won't let you off, either.

843
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,190
Yue,

844
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,500
don't worry.

845
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,430
Even if something happens to me,

846
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,240
I won't let anything happen to
the Shengyue Sect.

847
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,430
I got it, I got it.

848
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,920
Just hurry up and go see
your precious Yao.

849
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,580
You're being a nuisance here.

850
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,350
She seems fine,

851
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,760
yet she barely eats,

852
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,560
and keeps falling unconscious.

853
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,920
What's really going on?

854
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,280
Chief.

855
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,710
Apart from her physical injuries,

856
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,480
her pulse shows no abnormalities.

857
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,290
So it's another deceptive trick.

858
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,530
But her life

859
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,040
is indeed slowly slipping away.

860
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,330
What do you mean?

861
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
Explain clearly.

862
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
To put it bluntly,

863
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,800
she's dying.

864
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,670
How can her pulse be normal

865
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,440
when she's dying?

866
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,840
That doesn't make sense.

867
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,070
There have been more and more
strange pulse readings lately,

868
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,630
but

869
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,030
unreasonable as it is,

870
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,000
that's the fact.

871
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,760
Is there any way to save her?

872
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,880
I don't understand her pulse,

873
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,290
so I can't save her.

874
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,940
Maybe this is karma coming back around.

875
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,110
Wake up!

876
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,800
Yao Fu,

877
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,810
what the hell is going on here?

878
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,030
I already told you before.

879
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,460
How did you know you were going to die?

880
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,010
I don't know either.

881
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,320
No,

882
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,490
you need to explain this to me.

883
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,150
Tell me now!

884
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,100
What kind of nonsense is this?

885
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,400
Chief,

886
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,480
if you really want to know the truth,

887
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,540
there's no need for all this trouble.

888
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,310
One Compliance Pill
will reveal everything.

889
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,350
Lingyin,

890
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:54,970
you may leave now.

891
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,440
Make sure no one knows about this matter.

892
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,400
Yes, Chief.

893
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,150
Speak.

894
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,280
I'm not lying to you.

895
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,250
I really am dying,

896
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,250
due to practicing the Fusheng Spell.

897
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
That's a secret technique

898
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,360
my father personally taught me.

899
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,300

What are you talking about?

906
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,270

No way.

912
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,350
How could you possibly die?

913
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,490
My father died
because of the Fusheng Spell,

914
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,200

Qing, you're back.

967
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,410
That's wonderful.

968
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,460
Everyone at Yunmen
has been looking forward to your return.

969
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,470
I heard Biluo Valley declared war
on Yunmen

970
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,640
and has been slaughtering innocent people
in the martial world.

971
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,440
On my way back,

972
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,790
I saw many disciples from Biluo Valley

973
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,110
who had gone mad with their cultivation.

974
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,440
What exactly happened?

975
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,630
It's nothing to worry about.

976
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,400
People in the martial world
get into conflicts all the time.

977
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,460
Isn't that normal?

978
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,740
It's nothing to worry about.

979
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,230
But, Sect Leader,

980
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,920
Senior Shen nearly sacrificed himself

981
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,380
to save the common people.

982
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,130
Now that Biluo Valley is running rampant,

983
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:01,670
I beg Yunmen and Shengyue Sect
to join forces against them.

984
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,480
Yang Qing!

985
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,270
Who taught you to speak such nonsense?

986
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,720
Was it that witch Wangyue
from the Shengyue Sect?

987
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,880
-Someone!
-Sect Leader!

988
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,280
Yes!

989
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:15,220
Yang Qing has been bewitched
by the Shengyue Sect.

990
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,640
Lock him up in the Seclusion Valley!

991
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,360
Yes!
