[Yunmen]

4
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,640
Yang Qing, you're back.

5
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,030
I heard last night you tried to enter
Langhuan Pavilion

6
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,830
and got thrown out by Elder Wang.

7
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,360
I... I heard there are a lot of treasures
in there

8
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,800
that I've never seen before,

9
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
so I wanted to take a look.

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,240
What did you want to see?

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,370
I can take you there.

12
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,570
The Alliance Leader's Token,

13
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,770
or the Sun Blade?

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,620
Aren't those the greatest treasures
of Yunmen?

15
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,100
Is it really okay for you to show me?

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,990
No.

17
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,030
But if you really want to take a look,

18
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,160
I can make it happen.

19
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,100
But you must promise me

20
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,220
you won't do anything to them.

21
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,560
How could I possibly do anything
to the Alliance Leader's Token?

22
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,150
Langhuan Pavilion is so heavily guarded.

23
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,960
Good.

24
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,680
Since Langhuan Pavilion was built,

25
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,000
the only person who ever snuck in

26
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,750
didn't come out alive.

27
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,460
So you'd better not do anything foolish.

28
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,720
Whatever you want to do,

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,650
talk to me first,

30
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,770
understood?

31
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,470
Yang Qing, you're worried about me.

32
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,070
Does this mean
you're not angry with me anymore?

33
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,930
Don't touch me.

34
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,740
I'm just warning you not to enter

35
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,010
Langhuan Pavilion without permission.

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,180
By the way,
why was Lu Xuanxuan there yesterday?

37
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:22,840
Yes.

38
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,010
It seemed like

39
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,400
she wanted to get into
Langhuan Pavilion too.

40
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,030
Langhuan Pavilion, Lu Xuanxuan,
Biluo Valley?

41
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,680
What are you thinking about?

42
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,870
Is Biluo Valley plotting something again?

43
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,400
You seem really concerned
about this lately.

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,910
You're not so stupid after all,

45
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,970
figuring this out.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,130
Didn't you say I never cared about you?

47
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,360
I've been

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,960
quietly paying attention to you
all this time.

How did you get up here?

55
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,090
You think that trivial formation
can stop me?

56
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,600
Don't come any closer!

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,150
What other tricks do you have?

58
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,279
Hurry up and show me.

59
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,040
Alright.

60
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,579
Don't move.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,600
Get ready.

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,610
Form the formation!

65
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,590
Don't go there. It could be an ambush.

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,650
Master Murong, long time no see.

68
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,600
Aren't you Yao Fu, that girl from Yunmen?

69
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,870
Why are you mixing with Shengyue Sect now?

70
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,530
Didn't you help our people take down

71
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,260
Shengyue Sect from the inside?

72
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,200
Master Murong,

73
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,530
I'll get straight to the point.

74
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,600
I was sent by Yunmen to Shengyue Sect

75
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,210
to negotiate with Yuan Yingxing,

76
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,210
and under the guise of making peace,

77
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,560
got him to hand over the Shengyue Token.

78
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,430
So now we must first appease him

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,930
and satisfy him.

80
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,840
So Yunmen is also after
other people's treasures.

81
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,310
And here I thought

82
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,950
that among the four major sects today,

83
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,430
only Yunmen still had some decency.

84
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,240
I'm just a junior.

85
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,450
I can't read the thoughts

86
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,550
of the elders.

87
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,870
I'm only responsible
for carrying out orders.

88
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,870
After all this,

89
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,150
you still haven't told me

90
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,409
what exactly you want.

91
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,070
I hope Yanmen

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,720
can temporarily vacate the Saintess Hall.

93
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,450
You start by asking
for our sect's stronghold.

94
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,870
You have quite the nerve.

95
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,280
I can have Yuan Yingxing

96
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,690
allocate part of the back mountain to you.

97
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,030
There's plenty of plants there,

98
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,890
which should suit your sect's needs
better.

99
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,160
And the houses there are fully equipped,

100
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,420
so you'll have no problems living there.

101
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,160
What if I refuse?

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
Lingyin,
the Water Hall Master of Shengyue Sect,

103
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,300
is highly gifted in poisons and medicine.

104
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,250
She'll soon break through

105
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,650
all the barriers you set.

106
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,750
By then, Yuan Yingxing

107
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,680
will leave you utterly destroyed.

108
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,390
Besides,

109
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,430
beneath Mount Yin

110
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
lies a massive amount of gunpowder,

111
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,159
and the chief of each generation
knows its location.

112
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,020
If you push Yuan Yingxing too far,

113
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,250
he might just destroy everything,
including himself.

114
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,930
Young lady,

115
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,270
you might scare others with such talk,

116
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,510
but we of Yanmen
have already lost our home.

117
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,750
Now at Mount Yin,

118
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,420
we're merely struggling to survive.

119
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,070
Go tell Yuan Yingxing

120
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
to blow the mountain up if he wants.

121
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,800
Master Murong,

122
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,360
why do you have to be so stubborn?

123
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,840
Yunmen's affairs are grand.

124
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,670
Our small Yanmen sect is too weak.

125
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,180
Miss Yao, please go back.

126
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,750
Master,

127
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,850
your cyclamen has withered again.

128
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:34,560
What's going on?

129
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,680
Master Murong,

130
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,360
growing cyclamen is not that difficult.

131
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,800
I remember seeing all kinds of records

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,780
on flower cultivation in Yunmen.

133
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,909
Shall I take a look for you?

134
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,200
Yingxing,

135
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,270
I've secured a chance
for peace talks for you.

136
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,240
Agree to it now.

137
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,240
Now, coexisting peacefully with them

138
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,370
while recuperating

139
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,700
is the best plan.

140
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,760
So you're saying

141
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,600
they've removed those troublesome plants?

142
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,750
They feared you might break your promise,

143
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,480
so they planted some flowers
at the mountain gate.

144
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,010
If you break the agreement,

145
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,640
they'll perish along with Shengyue Sect.

146
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,160
Fine.

147
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,420
I promise you.

148
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,850
I want to rebuild Shengyue Sect
as soon as possible.

149
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,549
Lingyin, spread the word immediately

150
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,820
that in seven days,
I'll reestablish Shengyue Sect.

151
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,260
Whoever comes,

152
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,450
whether to celebrate or cause trouble,

153
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,380
I'll welcome them with open doors.

154
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,390
Have you heard the news
from down the mountain?

155
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,100
Yuan Yingxing actually announced
he's rebuilding Shengyue Sect.

156
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,900
What? Yuan Yingxing isn't dead?

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,270
These past days, Biluo Valley

158
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,670
has been acting arrogantly

159
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,750
just because they killed him.

160
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,480
Turns out they didn't kill him.

161
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,640
You still care about Biluo Valley
at a time like this?

162
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,750
The return of Demon Yuan

163
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,600
is fierce.

164
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm afraid the martial world

165
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,630
will once again
be soaked in blood and chaos.

166
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,910
The Saintess is dead.

167
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,440
How can a chief
with two mediocre hall masters

168
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,720
cause such bloodshed?

169
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,120
Yuan Yingxing is going to revive the sect?

170
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,890
Why is he in such a hurry?

171
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
Eager to get himself killed?

172
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,610
It would be better
to let them think he's dead.

173
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,060
That way I can steal the Sun Blade.

174
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,130
I still need to go to Langhuan Pavilion.

175
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,890
Senior Yang,

176
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,730
have you heard?

177
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,870
Recently, Yunmen has been haunted.

178
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,910
The elders are discussing
how to catch the ghost.

179
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,720
Haunted?

180
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,490
How could there be ghosts
in broad daylight?

181
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,090
Are you talking about Tianyi Pavilion?

182
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,780
Yes. You've heard about it too?

183
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,010
I went there once,

184
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,080
and something did seem off.

185
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,080
Really?

186
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,870
I've never seen a ghost before.

187
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,980
Take me there to take a look.

188
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,510
Alright.

189
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,930
[Tianyi Pavilion]

190
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,550
We're here.

191
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:11,910
Here?

192
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,610
I've heard many seniors say

193
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,360
this ghost is especially cruel
to female disciples.

194
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,060
Many female seniors encountered her
while crossing

195
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
the Cloud Bridge,

196
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,110
and afterward

197
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,150
suffered high fevers and fell unconscious.

198
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,920
Even if it's a ghost, I'm not afraid.

199
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,520
You're not afraid of ghosts?

200
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,600
Ghosts are far less frightening
than humans.

201
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,130
Let's go.

202
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,160
Yang Wangyue.

203
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,960
Look carefully.

204
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,710
That's her.

205
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,600
From now on,
if she approaches Langhuan Pavilion,

206
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,150
it will be considered
a violation of sect rules,

207
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,670
and you should report her directly
to Elder Shen or Sect Leader Feng.

208
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,000
If the offense is serious,

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,060
she can even be expelled from Yunmen.

210
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,360
That's too much.

211
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,440
She isn't even one of us.

212
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,450
Why is she interfering like this?

213
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,860
I can't get in,

214
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,270
so what makes you think you can?

215
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,840
I have my own ways to get in.

216
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,680
My father is the Chief of Biluo Valley.

217
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
You're bragging.

218
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,000
Even if God himself came,

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,460
you still couldn't get in.

220
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,250
Let's go.

221
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,670
You...

222
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,420
Let's go.

223
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,920
Wangyue,

224
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,200
it's this Senior Lu

225
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,240
who keeps talking bad about you
behind your back.

226
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,790
She even said you sleepwalk,

227
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,720
which is a sign of being possessed.

228
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,340
So some people suspect
that you're the female ghost.

229
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,390
This Lu Xuanxuan.

230
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,320
First she slandered me behind my back,

231
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,890
then she tried to use her backing
to bully me.

232
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,410
It's time to teach her a lesson.

233
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,620
[Ximo Hall]

234
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,750
This is motherwort.

235
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,360
When picked during the seedling stage
in spring

236
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,510
up to just before flowering
in early summer,

237
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,870
and then dried, cut into sections,

238
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,790
and stored,

239
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,070
it helps clear heat and toxins,
promote urination, reduce swelling,

240
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,980
and invigorate blood circulation
while removing stasis.

241
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,860
I see.

242
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,240
Let's take a look at this.

243
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,320
Open it.

244
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,200
Come on, open it.

245
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,600
Lu Xuanxuan,

246
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,300
this is a gift I prepared for you.

247
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,810
Just open it,

248
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,310
and you'll get a free pie in the face.

249
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,510
Sect Leader Feng, Mr. Yang?

250
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,240
Why are you here?

251
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,060
I'm here to check on the disciples.

252
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,550
Greetings, Sect Leader.

253
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,600
Greetings, Elders.

254
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,790
There have been some rumors lately,

255
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,710
but you shouldn't believe them.

256
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,330
Focusing on your studies

257
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,630
is what really matters.

258
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,510
With us around,

259
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,550
no disciple will ever be mistreated.

260
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,730
Yes.

261
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,350
Identifying herbs

262
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,930
is also an important lesson.

263
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,330
After all,

264
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,800
by the time you leave...

265
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,210
Outrageous!

266
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,630
Who did this?

267
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,880
Sect Leader,

268
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,700
it wasn't me. Really.

269
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,480
Who did this?

270
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,370
Yang Wangyue.

271
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,610
What are you doing here sneaking around?

272
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,670
I'm not sneaking around.

273
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,150
I'm just sitting here properly.

274
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,150
That's exactly

275
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,440
what's suspicious.

276
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,890
Yang Wangyue,

277
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,430
you've never been
this well-behaved before.

278
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,790
Elder Shen, you're being so unfair to me.

279
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,770
Does being well-behaved
mean being scolded?

280
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,550
Yang Wangyue, this must be your doing.

281
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,520
Sect Leader,

282
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,150
I saw Yang Wangyue sneaking off

283
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,750
to Langhuan Pavilion this morning.

284
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,670
She must be involved in this.

285
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,550
Elder,

286
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,520
we should
investigate this matter thoroughly

287
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,910
before drawing conclusions.

288
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,770
Is there any need to investigate?

289
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,910
Who else could be

290
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,320
so mischievous besides this girl?

291
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,570
Sect Leader,

292
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,320
I heard Yang Wangyue
isn't afraid of ghosts.

293
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,120
And...

294
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,600
And she even said

295
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,480
Yunmen disciples are scarier than ghosts.

296
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,150
What does that mean?

297
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,410
Fine.

298
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,560
I'll punish Yang Wangyue
with a night watch in the bamboo grove.

299
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,930
It's just a night watch.

300
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,900
I'll treat it as an opportunity
to enjoy the moonlight.

301
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,400
Fox demon? Female ghost?

302
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,390
I'm not afraid of anything,

303
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,740
except...

304
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,290
except Yang Qing ignoring me.

305
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,800
Yang Qing, oh, Yang Qing,

306
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,400
if you keep treating me like this,

307
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,060
I'm really going to get angry.

308
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,760
Who's there?

309
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,890
[Tianyi Pavilion]

310
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,800
Yang Wangyue!

311
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,440
Yang Qing?

312
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,900
Why are you here?

313
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,630
Why are you here?

314
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,360
I...

315
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,940
I was just passing by.

316
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,260
Just passing by?

317
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,240
Did you follow me here

318
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,670
because you were worried about me?

319
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,730
You think too much.

320
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,480
Don't flatter yourself.

321
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,090
You say one thing but mean another.

322
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,390
You men...

323
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,360
even when you're dying of worry inside,

324
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,760
you act cold and distant,

325
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,370
making the girls sad.

326
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,700
Yang Wangyue,
do you really understand men?

327
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,680
Lingyin said

328
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,470
this is called "playing hard to get."

329
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,540
Are you afraid that
if you give your heart too easily,

330
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,570
I'll abandon you?

331
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,660
Don't worry.

332
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,320
If you give me your heart,

333
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,410
I'll take good care of it.

334
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,160
I wouldn't easily...

335
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,770
Aren't you here to catch the ghost?

336
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,660
Oh, right.

337
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,630
It's all your fault.

338
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,150
I almost forgot about my mission.

339
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,160
My fault?

340
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,810
Keep talking nonsense

341
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,070
and I'll throw you out.

342
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,579
Elder Wang.

343
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,349
Elder Wang, what are you doing here?

344
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,819
You... you...

345
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,119
You're not that female ghost, are you?

346
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,640
It's a long story.

347
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,510
Please follow me.

348
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,660
You are that female ghost?

349
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,160
Elder Yang, do you remember her?

350
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,970
This is...

351
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,940
Yes, it's her.

352
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,620
Elder Yang, long time no see.

353
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,860
What's going on here?

354
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,200
He is my Master.

355
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,590
But I fell in love with him.

356
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,310
He liked me too,

357
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,240
but he thought

358
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,810
a teacher-student romance
was against moral principles.

359
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,560
So he refused to accept me

360
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,350
and expelled me from Yunmen.

361
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,790
I see.

362
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,680
You couldn't accept it,

363
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,990
so you've been hiding in Yunmen,

364
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,360
pretending to be a ghost
to scare everyone.

365
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,290
That's not true.

366
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,340
I didn't mean to scare anyone.

367
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,930
I just wanted to see him every day.

368
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,940
But I didn't expect

369
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,690
he would be about
to take on a new disciple.

370
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,140
So you are deliberately trying
to get everyone's attention?

371
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,110
Why didn't you go straight
to Sect Leader Feng?

372
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,310
If this reaches the Sect Leader,

373
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,020
he will certainly be implicated.

374
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,100
I don't want to harm him.

375
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,860
Then why did you put on such a show?

376
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,400
I just wanted to lure my master here

377
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,880
to talk to me.

378
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,440
As long as he promises
not to take on a new disciple,

379
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,170
I won't cause any more trouble.

380
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,090
Just being able to watch him
from afar in Tianyi Pavilion

381
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,400
is enough for me.

382
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,030
Senior Wang, you must have known long ago

383
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,470
that Yun was hiding in Tianyi Pavilion

384
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,800
and have been secretly taking care of her.

385
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,010
I was too soft-hearted

386
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,640
and couldn't bear to drive her away again.

387
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,730
You already know about this?

388
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,290
I saw that she hadn't done anything
to harm Yunmen,

389
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,330
so I kept it from you.

390
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,510
Elder Yang, thank you

391
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,160
for considering it so thoroughly.

392
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,110
Please keep this secret.

393
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
I will definitely send her
down the mountain

394
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,410
and make sure she

395
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,410
never returns to Yunmen again.

396
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,910
Master,

397
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,940
are you really going to be this cruel?

398
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,290
Say no more.

399
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,800
You and I are master and disciple.

400
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,860
Talking about this

401
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,590
isn't proper.

402
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,270
When you like someone, you just do,

403
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,850
and when you don't, you don't.

404
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,070
It has nothing to do with whether you're

405
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,240
master and disciple
or with moral principles.

406
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,220
Clearly, you two have feelings

407
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,590
for each other.

408
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
If there weren't,

409
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,750
would she pretend to be a ghost for you?

410
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,440
And would you hide this
from the Sect Leader for her?

411
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,640
This matter needs no further discussion.

412
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,200
Yun...

413
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,620
will go down the mountain tomorrow.

414
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,450
Why don't we

415
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,410
hand Yun over to Sect Leader Feng?

416
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,310
No.

417
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:15,880
See?

418
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,200
You still have feelings for her.

419
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,580
Actually, this isn't difficult.

420
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,710
What's difficult
is having the heart to do it.

421
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,880
Elder Yang, what do you mean?

422
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,020
I can give you a new identity.

423
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,150
From now on,

424
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,260
you'll no longer be his disciple.

425
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,640
As for whether you want to be together,

426
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,620
that's entirely up to you.

427
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,740
People in Yunmen are all blockheads.

428
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,840
In that case,

429
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,460
I'll thank you in advance.

430
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,200
Elder Wang,

431
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,630
I'll be waiting to attend your wedding.

432
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,450
Let's go.

433
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,830
Yang Qing,

434
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,540
you've been giving me the cold shoulder
these past few days.

435
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,400
Is it really because I joined Yunmen

436
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,730
and became your junior?

437
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,240
What do you think?

438
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
I think...

439
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,800
your dissatisfaction with me
has been building up,

440
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,100
and you refused to say anything.

441
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,600
Once I joined Yunmen,

442
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,440
it all exploded at once.

443
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,120
So?

444
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,220
You think I don't care enough about you,

445
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,640
so...

446
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,280
this is how you punish me.

447
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,840
The reason you treat me this way

448
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,290
is to make me the person
you want me to be.

449
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,160
If I want you to change,

450
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,790
will you really change for me?

451
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,480
Of course.

452
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
I like you, after all.

453
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,000
Isn't it just putting on a show?

454
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,330
Anyone can do that.

455
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,610
Telling people what they want to hear
has always been my specialty.

456
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,330
Pretending

457
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,810
is no challenge for me.

458
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,040
You'll do whatever I want?

459
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,670
What if I asked you to cut ties
with Yuan Yingxing?

460
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,980
What if I asked you to be with me,

461
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,880
sever all ties with Shengyue Sect,

462
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
and never go back?

463
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,440
I...

464
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,270
Would you do all that?

465
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,130
Do you...

466
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,400
really mean it?

467
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,980
You don't understand me

468
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,020
as well as I understand you.

469
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,510
Fine.

470
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,030
If these really are what you want,

471
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,050
I wouldn't agree to any of it.

472
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,030
And if you're trying to threaten me
with these,

473
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,270
then we're done.

474
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,790
I thought

475
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,020
you were completely blinded by love.

476
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,160
Turns out you're not.

477
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,660
So,

478
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,650
you don't like me as much as you say.

479
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,830
So,

480
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,040
the one who can truly let go of all this

481
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,790
is me.

482
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,000
Come with me.

483
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,010
Elder Yang.

484
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,800
[Langhuan Pavilion]

485
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,480
Isn't the Sun Blade what you want?

486
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,150
I...

487
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,940
You come close to me

488
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,170
and say you like me—

489
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,990
isn't it for it?

490
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,000
I...

491
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:41,920
I...

492
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:42,950
Or...

493
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,050
Yuan Yingxing forced you to do all this?

494
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,000
No.

495
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,410
It has nothing to do with Yuan Yingxing.

496
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,480
I am the saintess of Shengyue Sect
after all.

497
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,530
I can't just stand by

498
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,920
and watch everyone in the sect

499
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,220
be imprisoned for life.

500
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,960
Is that all?

501
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,770
That's all.

502
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,510
I admit

503
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,370
I want the Sun Blade.

504
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,320
But...

505
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,980
But my feelings for you are also real.

506
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,110
You've been by my side for so long.

507
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,500
How could I not know

508
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,060
what you want to do?

509
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,750
Wangyue, from the beginning,

510
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I've been willing

511
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,130
to help you achieve whatever you want.

512
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,280
But you never gave me the chance.

513
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,430
Wangyue, are you willing to trust me?

514
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,400
I am.

515
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,710
I trust you.

516
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,960
Good.

517
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,020
Then give me some time.

518
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,070
I will convince the Sect Leader

519
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,720
to reconcile with Shengyue Sect

520
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,300
and openly bring out the Sun Blade

521
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,430
to rescue the people of Shengyue Sect.

522
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,770
But before that,

523
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,960
don't do anything dangerous,

524
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,490
alright?

525
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,280
Alright.

526
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,860
Then it's settled.

527
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,640
You stay in Yunmen for now without worry.

528
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,040
Weren't you the one who didn't want me
in Yunmen,

529
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,150
Mr. Yang?

530
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,010
It's all your fault

531
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,690
for rashly joining Yunmen.

532
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,310
Now,

533
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,780
I have no choice but to play along.

534
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,720
Instead of letting you stay outside,

535
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,390
I'd feel

536
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,690
more at ease having you by my side.

537
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,620
[Tianyu Palace]

538
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,060
Shengyue Sect has been restored.

539
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,350
Chief,

540
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,960
without the Saintess's blessing,

541
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,520
if we restore the sect rashly,

542
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,810
it may bring disaster.

543
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,000
Today is an auspicious day.

544
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,830
I don't want to resort to violence.

545
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,160
I invited you here today

546
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,070
not to ask your opinion,

547
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,920
but to inform you

548
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,560
that Shengyue Sect has been restored.

549
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,920
Chief Yuan, you've led the sect for years,

550
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,220
acting recklessly

551
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,120
and causing suffering to your followers.

552
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,560
It seems that even after
the sect's downfall,

553
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,290
you have no intention
of changing your ways.

554
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,810
Since that's the case,

555
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,350
I am leaving Shengyue Sect voluntarily.

556
00:28:59,130 --> 00:28:59,840
Leave?

557
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,580
If you dare talk back to me again,

558
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,990
you won't even make it out this door.

559
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,780
Everyone, see?

560
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,050
With such a chief,

561
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,200
even if we restore the sect today,

562
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,710
it won't last long.

563
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Li is right.

564
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,030
Without the Saintess,
the restoration ceremony

565
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,100
is just a joke

566
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,350
and doesn't count!

567
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,790
Right!

568
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,250
It doesn't count!

569
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,160
Who says the Saintess isn't here?

570
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,430
The Saintess?

571
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,310
Is this the Saintess?

572
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,550
The Saintess!

573
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,610
Since the Saintess has come...

574
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,810
The Saintess is here!

575
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,760
The Saintess is here.
This is indeed the Saintess.

576
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,880
Recently, I've been busy with sect affairs

577
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,750
and haven't paid much attention
to the restoration ceremony.

578
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,830
Please forgive me.

579
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,430
Can we begin the restoration ceremony now?

580
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,140
It's...

581
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,030
Isn't this a bit too rushed?

582
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,140
The Chief and the Saintess are both here.

583
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,690
There's no reason not to restore the sect.

584
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,030
Or do you want to start your own sect,

585
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,510
or replace the Chief?

586
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,070
I wouldn't dare.

587
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,120
Congratulations on restoring the sect,
Chief.

588
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,310
May Shengyue Sect be remembered
for ages to come.

589
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,480
Remembered for ages to come!

590
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,480
Remembered for ages to come!

591
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,550
Remembered for ages to come!

592
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,790
Remembered for ages to come!

593
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,020
[Yunxiao Hall]

594
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,630
Sect Leader, there's news.

595
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,640
Yuan Yingxing not only isn't dead,

596
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,550
but he's also held a restoration ceremony
at Mount Yin.

597
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,270
He even proclaimed
he would revive Shengyue Sect

598
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,870
and unify the martial world.

599
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,030
Outrageous!

600
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,440
Most people in Shengyue Sect
are dead or imprisoned,

601
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,770
and their strength
is far from what it used to be.

602
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,860
Yuan Yingxing is now acting alone,

603
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,300
yet he still dared
to make such bold claims.

604
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,960
Shang Huai,

605
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,920
write to the leaders
of all major sects immediately

606
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,450
and ask for their opinions.

607
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,790
Yes, Sect Leader.

608
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,680
Sect Leader,

609
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,270
we didn't hear this ourselves.

610
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
It's likely a rumor in the martial world.

611
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,510
When we were chasing Yuan Yingxing,

612
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,310
I clashed with him several times.

613
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,770
Though he can be arrogant,

614
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,110
he only wants to revive Shengyue Sect

615
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,740
and has no ambition to dominate
the entire martial world.

616
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,300
Qing,

617
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,830
are you still thinking about
reconciliation

618
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,680
between the martial world
and Shengyue Sect?

619
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,210
Shengyue Sect is developing rapidly now.

620
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,240
It will soon recover

621
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,310
to its state
before the Battle of Mount Yin.

622
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,180
A head-on clash

623
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,960
would only be a brutal fight,

624
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,620
leaving both sides to suffer.

625
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,110
It's rare that Yuan Yingxing
is willing to negotiate peace.

626
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,240
Sect Leader, please think carefully.

627
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,210
[Saintess Hall]

628
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,640
What?

629
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,780
Are you reluctant to take off
that Saintess outfit?

630
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,820
Don't think that
living in the Saintess Hall

631
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,420
makes you the true Saintess.

632
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,640
Let me tell you,

633
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,550
you're nowhere near Wangyue.

634
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,080
Why would I compare myself to her?

635
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,030
Water Hall Master,

636
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,560
I advise you not to mess with me.

637
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,070
Today, Yingxing just asked me
to change my clothes,

638
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,930
which proves what I did was right.

639
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,450
I helped him.

640
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,780
You're really bold to brag like that.

641
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,350
The Chief is gentle with you,

642
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,600
but I'm not.

643
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,240
What?

644
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,770
Trying to poison me again?

645
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,510
When did you poison me?

646
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,750
You're asking too many questions.

647
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,470
Don't worry, it's just a sedative.

648
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,680
You won't die.

649
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,830
I'll carve you up piece by piece

650
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,450
to avenge Yue.

651
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,550
Since you're about to die,

652
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,180
I'll give you some advice.

653
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,810
In your next life,

654
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,450
behave yourself

655
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,840
and don't provoke just anyone.

656
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:36,770
Lingyin!

657
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,640
Chief?

658
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,450
You've gone too far.

659
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,530
Chief,

660
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,450
this woman harmed Yue

661
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
and betrayed you.

662
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,600
She used to be useful to you,

663
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:52,970
but now she isn't,

664
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,500
and now she's just a burden.

665
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,910
What poison did you give her?

666
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,200
Just a sedative; it won't kill her.

667
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
At most,
she'll sleep for half a day or a day.

668
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,460
Get out.

669
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,750
Chief.

670
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Are you waiting for me to punish you?

671
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,960
The Wenshui Technique
we're practicing today

672
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,110
is different
from the Yuenv Sword Technique.

673
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,110
Yuenv Sword Technique is free and agile,

674
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,670
while Wenshui Technique is slow but sharp,

675
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,000
with each move aimed at the heart,
continuous without pause.

676
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,920
The first move:

677
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,480
slash, turn!

678
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,440
Slash!

679
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,270
Martial arts requires calm

680
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,090
and solid fundamentals.

681
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,260
Mr. Yang,

682
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,760
did I do the first move wrong?

683
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,440
You drew your sword too fast

684
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,750
and with too much force.

685
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,660
It may look fierce,

686
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,120
but it actually harms you.

687
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,950
Everyone, watch carefully.

688
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,810
I'll only demonstrate this once.

689
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,240
Yang Wangyue, come out

690
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,620
and practice it with me.

691
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,960
The highest good is like water.

692
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,620
Water benefits
all things without contending.

693
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,220
So the Wenshui Technique
should have the qualities

694
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,110
of "choosing the right place to dwell,

695
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,090
keeping a heart that is calm
and unfathomably deep,

696
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,130
treating others with sincerity, kindness,
and selflessness, speaking with honesty,

697
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,230
governing with order,
handling affairs with ability,

698
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,160
and acting with a sense of timing."

699
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,230
Yang Qing,

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,710
are you trying to harass me?

702
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,970
When practicing swordsmanship,
never be distracted

703
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,300
or let your mind wander.

704
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,630
Slash, thrust, lift, and point—
catch the opponent off guard.

705
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,920
Did everyone see that clearly?

706
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,440
Yes.

707
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,360
Keep practicing.

708
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,880

Grilled fish.

773
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,900
We cooked it ourselves—it's delicious.

774
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
Come and try some.

775
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,020
Please have a seat, Mr. Yang.

776
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,880
Come, sit down.

777
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,650
Let me fill your cup, Mr. Yang.

778
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,170
Please sit, Mr. Yang.

779
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,230
Try this, Mr. Yang.

780
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,120
You all should sit down too.

781
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,790
Don't be so formal.

782
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,480
Okay.

783
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,600
Who says having Mr. Yang here

784
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,220
means having another elder?

785
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,730
These fence-sitters

786
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,420
seem to really like Yang Qing.

787
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,250
In our Yunmen sect,

788
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,340
ever since Senior Su
joined the inner sect this year,

789
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,520
we've had the "two gems of Yunmen."

790
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,840
What are the "two gems of Yunmen"?

791
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,280
I've never heard of that before.

792
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,710
It's something we disciples
talk about privately,

793
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,190
and outsiders know too.

794
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,000
But

795
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,950
the Sect Leader and elders don't.

796
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,980
After all, we've been

797
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,230
keeping it secret from them.

798
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,800
Before Senior Su joined,

799
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,120
Mr. Yang was Yunmen's sole gem.

800
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,530
Mr. Yang, I toast to you.

801
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,100
Let me fill your cup.

802
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,110
I think

803
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,400
no matter how great this Su is,

804
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,110
he can't compare to Mr. Yang.

805
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,190
In my heart,

806
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,920
Mr. Yang is the most handsome.

807
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,480
But

808
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,630
although Mr. Yang seems good-tempered,

809
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,890
he never jokes with us female disciples.

810
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,510
He's sharper than a sword,

811
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,840
cold and intimidating.

812
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,630
Meanwhile,

813
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,030
Senior Su is gentle

814
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,900
and kind with us—

815
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,510
I like that.

816
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,880
But Mr. Yang remains calm
in favor or disgrace,

817
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,760
graceful as flowing water.

818
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,560
I still think Mr. Yang is better,

819
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,300
don't you agree?

820
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,630
I also think Mr. Yang
is the most handsome.

821
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,510
Mr. Yang is so attractive.

822
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,230
I think so.

823
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,270
You're so noisy.

824
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,610
How inappropriate!

825
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,170
Some people are truly delusional.

826
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,110
Let me tell you straight, Yang Wangyue,

827
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,970
stop dreaming.

828
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,070
You're of a different generation
from Mr. Yang at Yunmen.

829
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,440
In this lifetime,

830
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
the two of you can never be together.

831
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,340
Whether I can be with Yang Qing or not

832
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,840
is not for you to decide.

833
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,790
Why won't you admit it?

834
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,510
Some people call the grapes sour

835
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,110
just because they can't have them.

836
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,960
But how could grapes ever be sour?

837
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,760
A nagging woman can say
a whole basket of bitter words,

838
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,680
but grapes are still sweet.

839
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:55,760
You...

840
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,160
People who like each other,

841
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,710
no matter their status,

842
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,960
will eventually be together.

843
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,250
Do you know what this is called?

844
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,440
It's mutual love,
unforgettable and profound,

845
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,150
through life and death,
and loyal until the end.

846
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,700
Don't get smug.

847
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,940
The exams are coming soon.

848
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,360
Before long, someone

849
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,960
will be leaving Yunmen in shame.

850
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,160
What a coincidence.

851
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,750
Mr. Yang just offered to tutor me.

852
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,970
With his guidance,

853
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,800
passing the exams will be a piece of cake.

854
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,440
Don't think I don't know
your capabilities.

855
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,360
If you pass the exams,

856
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,800
I, Lu Xuanxuan,

857
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,670
will walk backward from now on.

858
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,070
That won't be necessary.

859
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,190
Just...

860
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,440
stay away from me in the future.

861
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,030
Hearing all this sour talk

862
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,160
gives me a toothache.

863
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,090
You...

864
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,070
Yang Wangyue!

865
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,840
Mr. Yang,

866
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,910
we've been talking for so long.

867
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,170
There's a question
we're not sure we should ask you.

868
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,370
If I say you can't ask,

869
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,760
will you really not ask?

870
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,920
Nothing escapes Mr. Yang.

871
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,480
We're just too curious.

872
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,620
Mr. Yang, you're so self-disciplined—

873
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,880
do you have someone you like?

874
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,320
Yes.

875
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,760
You're so mysterious.

876
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
Just tell us.

877
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,920
Could it be that Saintess?

878
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,850
-The Saintess?
-A man as outstanding as Mr. Yang

879
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,750
would surely choose
someone beautiful, right?

880
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,150
But the Saintess always covers her face.

881
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,580
We don't even know if she's pretty.

882
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,840
The girl Mr. Yang likes

883
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,080
must be like Ms. Yao—

884
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,920
extraordinary, graceful, and elegant.

885
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,070
Right.

886
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,720
Isn't that right, Mr. Yang?

887
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,480
Mr. Yang, didn't you say

888
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,110
my Wenshui Technique isn't good?

889
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,170
Could you teach me?

890
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,110
Follow me.

891
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,070
-Mr. Yang?
-Mr. Yang?

892
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:49,880
Why did he leave?

893
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,740
Aren't you going to eat, Mr. Yang?

894
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,220
Well...

895
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,330
