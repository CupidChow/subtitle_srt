[A Forbidden Marriage]

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,870
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,970
Mr. Yang,

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,789
I thought you didn't like Yue.

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,580
Why are you here for her again?

6
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,310
I thought you knew how I feel for her.

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,950
I can't read your mind.

8
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,590
Besides,

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,510
Yue is no longer the same girl she was.

10
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,440
If you can't choose her firmly,

11
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
you'd better be honest with her now.

12
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,770
She's got more important things to do.

13
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,750
Forget it.

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,030
I'm an outsider. It's not my place

15
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,280
to comment on your relationship.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,970
Also, about what happened today,

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,600
I need to give you a reminder.

18
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,930
Ordinary poisons aren't contagious.

19
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,470
If it's contagious
through festering wounds,

20
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,520
it must be strong poison.

21
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,560
Those children have no enemies.

22
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,470
They've never offended anyone,

23
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,000
yet they've suffered this.

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,400
This isn't some simple matter.

25
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,440
If Yue isn't doing this for you,

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,410
I wouldn't have let her
get involved in this mess.

27
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,400
Thank you for the reminder.

28
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,870
I hate indecisive men like him.

29
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,000
I really don't get what you see in him.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,150
Tell me, what do you like about him?

31
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,630
Besides his looks.

32
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,550
But good-looking men

33
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,960
are everywhere, right?

34
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,300
Listen,

35
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,640
Yang Qing is different
from Shengyue Sect's men.

36
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,080
He's very gentle,

37
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,310
very thoughtful,

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,500
and very tolerant.

39
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,470
And he understands people
who are different from him.

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,400
Seriously, Yue?

41
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,240
You asked why I like him.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,300
Because he has something I don't.

43
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,190
To me, he's like a beam of light,

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,750
so dazzling and beautiful.

45
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,710
Of course I want to chase after him.

46
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,560
I will make him mine, and mine alone.

47
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm not sharing him with anyone.

48
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, I'll help you

49
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,020
make him yours and yours alone.

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,710
Lingyin, you're the best.

51
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,840
Do you have an idea?

52
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,590
Watch this.

53
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,120
This is called the Compliance Pill.

54
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,120
Make Yang Qing take this,

55
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,190
and I promise he'll do whatever you say.

56
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,070
Should I really use this?

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,650
I knew it. You can't bear to do it.

58
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,800
No wonder he's still not yours.

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
Who said I can't bear to?

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
I'm going to make him take it now.

61
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,560
Wait a minute!

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,870
Why do you have Tipsy Lotus Cakes?

63
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,510
Who bought them for you?

64
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,070
Someone treats you that well?

65
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,800
Well...

66
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,950
Yang Qing said
he bought them for me on the way.

67
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,110
On the way?

68
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,310
Yang Qing really does care about you.

69
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,190
Don't you know?

70
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,560
These

71
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,680
are the most famous Tipsy Lotus Cakes
from Jade Restaurant.

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,810
People line up for it

73
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,680
from morning till night.

74
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,360
And

75
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,760
this restaurant isn't in Yangliu Town.

76
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,440
It's only available in nearby Yun City.

77
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,390
I used to love it.

78
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,920
But whenever I asked someone
to buy it for me,

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,750
they either brought back something stale,

80
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,750
or nothing at all.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,310
So eventually, I just gave up.

82
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,950
Besides,

83
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,240
Yun City is about

84
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,240
3.3 miles from Yangliu Town.

85
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,870
If he went all that way
just to get this for you,

86
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,730
he definitely put in some effort.

87
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,560
It's weird though.

88
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,160
Yang Qing clearly cares about you.

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,100
So why is he being so indirect?

90
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,580
Why won't he just say it?

91
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,680
I don't get it.

92
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,950
Could it be...

93
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,310
he's grateful because I

94
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,370
helped him?

95
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,560
But Mingyang and I didn't get anything.

96
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,520
Could it be...

97
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,630
he likes me?

98
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,240
But yesterday, he sent me away

99
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,190
and even defended Yao Fu.

100
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,750
Alright, enough.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,390
Just make Yang Qing
take the Compliance Pill soon.

102
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,790
Chief is waiting for us
to bring back the Sun Blade to save him.

103
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,990
Let me think about it further.

104
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,510
See?

105
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,430
I knew you couldn't bear to do it.

106
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,030
If you're not going to use it,

107
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,070
give it back to me now.

108
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,160
It takes three years

109
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,480
just to make one Compliance Pill.

110
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,210
Give it to me.

111
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,510
What's the rush?

112
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,530
I still need it.

113
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,630
You...

114
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,240
Try it. Come on.

115
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,810
Have some more.

116
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,050
You say one thing but mean another.

117
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,480
[Tianlin Garden]

118
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,390
Mr. Yang.

119
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,830
How's the investigation going?

120
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,360
Mr. Yang,

121
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,720
after they were released,

122
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,850
we searched the carriage and luggage,

123
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,110
but found nothing suspicious.

124
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,970
On the way back,

125
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,190
the children ate and drank the same things

126
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,310
as we did.

127
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:36,750
But we weren't poisoned.

128
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,880
They came prepared.

129
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,930
They won't let us
find out the truth that easily.

130
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,940
Don't let your guard down.

131
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,450
Leave more people in town to protect them.

132
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,070
Okay, Mr. Yang.

133
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,750
Everything's been arranged. Don't worry.

134
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,270
Once the children fully recover,

135
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,800
we can try to get them talking.

136
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,260
See if we can find any clues

137
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,070
about who's behind all this.

138
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,870
Right now, we've hit a dead end.

139
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,270
Though I suspect Biluo Valley,

140
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,870
without concrete evidence,

141
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,750
we can't openly accuse them.

142
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,360
Stay vigilant.

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,060
Keep a close eye
on anyone from Biluo Valley.

144
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,160
Mr. Yang,

145
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,970
when will we return to Yunmen?

146
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,870
Everyone's been working hard
these past few days.

147
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,950
We'll rest one more day

148
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,680
and return to Yunmen tomorrow.

149
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,570
Prepare extra rations—

150
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,740
enough for two people.

151
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,430
Mr. Yang,

152
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,360
are those two portions

153
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,270
for Miss Lin and Miss Yang?

154
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,990
They’ve helped us a great deal.

155
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,690
We should invite them back to Yunmen
to thank them properly.

156
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,500
Now that sounds right, Mr. Yang.

157
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,770
I'll get everything ready right away.

158
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,300
They're heading back to Yunmen today.

159
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,630
If you don't do it now,

160
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,130
it's hard to say if you'll ever

161
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,260
see Yang Qing again.

162
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,390
I know.

163
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,300
Today is the Flower King Festival.
It'll be crowded.

164
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,250
Do it today.

165
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,280
They say the Flower Goddess
worshipped here

166
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,840
descended on this very day.

167
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,190
Legend has it the Flower King

168
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,310
loves to dwell upon blooming peach trees
with pink blossoms,

169
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,240
blessing the land with vibrant flowers

170
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,310
and peace.

171
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,800
So at dusk, when the blossoms
are at their brightest,

172
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,000
people would follow the old tradition:

173
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,600
they toss embroidered balls
into the high branches of the tree,

174
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,800
hoping to earn the blessing
of the flower fairies.

175
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,600
And young girls throw their
embroidered balls to the ones they love.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,150
If the man accepts it,

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,120
it means their hearts are united.

178
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,240
And the Flower King will bless them.

179
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,210
Do you believe that?

180
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,890
I don't believe it at all.

181
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,450
Whether you believe it or not,

182
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,510
it doesn't matter.

183
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,120
Anyway, I'm not the one who wants

184
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,030
to get her sweetheart's attention,

185
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,870
be alone with him,

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
and drug him.

187
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,330
Don't make fun of me.

188
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,090
Do you know what it means
when a girl throws

189
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,240
an embroidered ball to a man?

190
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,030
I don't know.

191
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,320
I accidentally let it slip out of my hand.

192
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Give it back to me.

193
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,150
Really?

194
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,620
You were holding it tightly.

195
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,170
That didn't look like an accident.

196
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,360
It's just an embroidered ball.

197
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,740
I can throw more

198
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,360
to whomever I want.

199
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,390
-It seems my Compliance Pill'll be wasted.
-Mr. Yang!

200
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,050
Mr. Yang, where are you going?

201
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,250
Wangyue.

202
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,100
Let go of me.

203
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,350
I have something to tell you.

204
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,090
Calling me Wangyue now?

205
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,910
It's too late.

206
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,170
I don't want to hear it.

207
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,870
Then I'll call you Wangyue from now on.

208
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,600
Is that okay?

209
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,320
No. Let me go.

210
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,870
I can let you go,

211
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,120
but don't go. Hear me out.

212
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,270
Yang Qing,

213
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,960
what are you doing?

214
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,620
What do you take me for?

215
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,480
Didn't you say you couldn't
respond to my feelings?

216
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,720
Why go out of your way
to buy me lotus cakes?

217
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,450
Why catch my embroidered ball?

218
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Are you deliberately toying with me?

219
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,150
Yes, I like you.

220
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,740
But that doesn't mean

221
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,310
you can make a fool of me!

222
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,850
I've never toyed with your feelings.

223
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,530
But...

224
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,840
But? There's always a but.

225
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,390
Why do you have so many

226
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,840
things you can't say?

227
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,950
Do I have to overthink everything like you

228
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,610
to be worthy of being with you?

229
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,360
Miss.

230
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,760
Since you're a couple,
don't let the sun go down on your anger.

231
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,550
It's better

232
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,490
to say everything clearly.

233
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,150
Who's his wife?

234
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,460
And who are you?

235
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,030
Me?

236
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,500
I'm the best fortune teller.

237
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,340
I can't believe you don't know me.

238
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,120
Miss,

239
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,150
you two have been arguing
for quite a while.

240
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,550
Would you like a reading?

241
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,210
Ten coins a reading,
fair for all, no tricks.

242
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,290
Get out of my way.

243
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,950
Young lady.

244
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,870
Don't be so hot-tempered.

245
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,150
By all accounts,

246
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,480
you shouldn't still exist in this world.

247
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,390
It was a coincidence
that you were granted a second life.

248
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,150
Shouldn't you have
a more peaceful mindset?

249
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

250
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,990
So,

251
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,220
would you like a reading?

252
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,750
I want one.

253
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,050
Sir, please.

254
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,910
Sir, you're extraordinary.

255
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,440
What would you like to know?

256
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,110
My love life.

257
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:58,960
Okay.

258
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,730
Please write on this paper

259
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,150
any character that comes to your mind.

260
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,020
[Moon]

261
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,000
Men have sorrow and joy;
they part or meet again.

262
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,480
The moon waxes and wanes.

263
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,120
Your path in love will be the same.

264
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,050
I'm afraid it won't be smooth sailing.

265
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,250
Even I could say that.

266
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,070
He's nothing but a fraud.

267
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,870
If I'm not mistaken,

268
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,780
you once had feelings for someone.

269
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,440
But unfortunately, despite your deep love,

270
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,320
it ended before she ever knew.

271
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,240
Yes.

272
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,810
Yang Qing actually had someone he liked?

273
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,030
And it was a secret crush.

274
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,250
I have a suggestion.

275
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,720
Would you like to hear it?

276
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,290
Please go ahead.

277
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
True love is hard to find.

278
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,750
Don't let go when you can have it.

279
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,530
Thank you, sir.

280
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,260
Yang Qing actually had someone he loved.

281
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,200
So in his eyes, I was nothing

282
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,670
but a clown.

283
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,000
If I had known,
I should have done anything I could

284
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
to make him mine from the beginning.

285
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
How humiliating.

286
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,030
Fortunately, I have the Compliance Pill.

287
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,270
I can just make him

288
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,310
forget the past and become mine.

289
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,500
What are you thinking about?

290
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,630
Who was the person you loved?

291
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,320
Do you really want to know?

292
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,840
Cut the crap. Just tell me.

293
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,030
The saintess of Shengyue Sect,

294
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,600
Wang Yue.

295
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,550
What... What did you just say?

296
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,790
There are many rumors in the martial world

297
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,990
about me and Shengyue Sect's saintess.

298
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,160

305
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,120
So,

306
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,500

realized that much later.

312

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,910
joke about this.

372
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,270
♪ I vow my life, giving all I have ♪

373
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,070
Why would I lie to you about this?

374
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:42,710
Anyway,

375
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,360
♪ Betting on a timeless promise ♪

376
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,370
you'll find out sooner or later.

377
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,270
♪ Holding you despite tremendous danger ♪

378
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,670
So it makes no difference when I tell you.

379
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,750
Well...

380
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,550
♪ Unraveling the conspiracy of time ♪

381
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,710
Why would you like the saintess?

382
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:55,660
Why would you like her?

383
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,790
♪ I see longing with new clarity ♪

384
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,750
♪ Love can heal all pain ♪

385
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,670
Yeah.

386
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,320
I've never figured it out either.

387
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,030
Perhaps

388
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,030
it was just a case of "not the right time,

389
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,790
but the right heart."

390
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,030
Then...

391
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,160
did you receive the letters
she had someone

392
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,440
deliver to you?

393
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,720
You mean those awful love poems?

394
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,550
Or those lotus cakes half spoiled

395
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,480
by the time they reached Yunmen?

396
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,880
Do you have any idea

397
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,880
how hard she worked to write

398
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,480
those letters?

399
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,480
Also,

400
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,550
it was really difficult
to deliver a letter to someone in Yunmen.

401
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,070
Those blockheads were very stubborn.

402
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,240
Do you know that?

403
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,030
Of course I know.

404
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,960
But even so,

405
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,830
she didn't give up.

406
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,320
She sent me letters
every day and every month.

407
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,270
I couldn't ignore it.

408
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,310
I didn't understand.

409
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,350
I never gave her any hope.

410
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,590
We barely met a few times.

411
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,510
Why was she so fixated on me?

412
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,930
Probably... because you're handsome.

413
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,270
So shallow.

414
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,210
Was she really just

415
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,480
attracted to my appearance?

416
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,450
It's not that complicated.

417
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,200
As a woman,

418
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,680
I think...

419
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,760
she not only found you handsome.

420
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,240
She also...

421
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,680
She was also very affectionate.

422
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,220
She was affectionate,

423
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,430
but I wasn't heartless.

424
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,280
Yang Qing, actually I...

425
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,960
But being affectionate or not

426
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,290
wouldn't make any difference between us.

427
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,390
She was the saintess of Shengyue Sect.

428
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,650
I am an elder of Yunmen.

429
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,160
For that alone,

430
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,960
nothing was possible between us.

431
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,830
I...

432
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,020
There's a line between good and evil.

433
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,430
No matter how much

434
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,540
I liked her,

435
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,590
on the surface,

436
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,110
I couldn't do anything about it.

437
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,680
Between good and evil,

438
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,610
it's better to keep the line clear.

439
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,830
If she committed evil in front of me,

440
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,000
I would not show mercy.

441
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,510
So,

442
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,060
even though I liked her very much,

443
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,460
and I secretly paid attention to her,

444
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,200
I told myself

445
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,140
I should just let it go.

446
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,090
Because in the end,

447
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,410
I could never be
with Shengyue Sect's saintess.

448
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,960
What?

449
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,010
What's with this look?

450
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
What were you about to say just now?

451
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,200
I didn't expect Yang Qing
to be so conservative.

452
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,240
But he looks very open-minded.

453
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,570
Why does everyone hate Shengyue Sect?

454
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,850
So,

455
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,350
I have an uncle and a former lover

456
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,680
from Shengyue Sect—

457
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,760
that's why you can't accept me, right?

458
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,640
Don't you still get it?

459
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,760
I can't bring trouble to Yunmen.

460
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,640
But

461
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,120
I promise I won't cause you any trouble.

462
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,720
With your connections to Shengyue Sect,

463
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,170
how can I trust you?

464
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,310
Yang Qing,

465
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,580
trust me.

466
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,800
I won't let you down.

467
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,460
Let's go.

468
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,830
Early tomorrow morning,

469
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,430
we need to set off for Yunmen.

470
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,880
W-We?

471
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,620
I can go with you to Yunmen too?

472
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,510
You and Miss Lingyin

473
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,480
helped us so much along the way.

474
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,950
It's only right to invite you
back to Yunmen

475
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,410
to properly thank you.

476
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,360
I didn't invite you to Yunmen earlier.

477
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,460
Please forgive me.

478
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,510
But... Fire Hall Master...

479
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,940
Don't worry about him.

480
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,530
He'll have a place to go.

481
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,050
Letting me go to Yunmen with you

482
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,850
already makes me very happy.

483
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Yang Qing,

484
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
you are the best person in the world.

485
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,590
Let's go.

486
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,550
I've arrived.

487
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,560
Take this.

488
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,350
What's this?

489
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,070
Didn't you say you wanted to learn
some skills to escape?

490
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,740
This is Yunmen's supreme flying skill,

491
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,270
the Celestial Cloud Steps.

492
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,080
I did say I wanted to learn martial arts,

493
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,270
but basic moves would be enough.

494
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,110
Isn't Yunmen's Celestial Cloud Steps

495
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,110
one of the top-tier flying skills?

496
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,640
Only Yunmen's senior disciples
can learn it.

497
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,980
Are you sure you want to give this to me?

498
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,030
Seems you know quite a bit.

499
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,880
You taught me the mental technique

500
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,160
of Shengyue Sect to save me back then.

501
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,960
That's not very valuable.

502
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,100
Just take it.

503
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,550
You're really giving this to me?

504
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,080
I don't need to swear an oath?

505
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,490
If I sell it to someone
from Shengyue Sect,

506
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
and they spread it,

507
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,880
your top technique would be worthless.

508
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,200
No need for an oath.

509
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,270
Take it and practice it.

510
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,110
I trust you.

511
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,200
From now on,

512
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,480
consider yourself half my disciple.

513
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,240
I hope you won't let me down.

514
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,170
You've loved me for so long,

515
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,770
yet I didn't dare respond.

516
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,030
Looking back now,

517
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,180
that was cruel of me.

518
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,240
Compared to your love for me,

519
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,000
this technique is nothing.

520
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,950
Yang Qing, don't worry.

521
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,080
I won't let you down.

522
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,920
I'll head back now.

523
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,200
You know what?

524
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,060
Yang Qing told me today

525
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,010
he already liked me before.

526
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,440
When I was the saintess,

527
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,170
he already had feelings for me.

528
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,920
He finally told you.

529
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,000
How... how did you know?

530
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,510
Actually,

531
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,480
there's something
I've been keeping from you.

532
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,090
I didn't tell you before

533
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,640
because I thought it wasn't necessary.

534
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,200
I figured even if you knew,

535
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,310
it would only upset you.

536
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,850
But now it seems

537
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,510
it's time to tell you.

538
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,400
About four years ago,

539
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,370
Yang Qing stayed very close to you

540
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,440
to observe you.

541
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,510
He stayed for about half a year
before leaving.

542
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,970
Yang Qing once stayed by my side?

543
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,070
Yes, he is Shanxiu,

544
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,570
that masked person

545
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,080
who was always by my side.

546
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,010
You've dealt with him before.

547
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,610
When you saved the women of the Lu family,

548
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,790
he looked completely shocked.

549
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,630
The one

550
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,590
whose chin you lifted
with your dagger hilt—

551
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,650
that was Yang Qing.

552
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,530
Why were you
looking at me like that just now?

553
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,170
New recruit of Shengyue Sect?

554
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,640
What?

555
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,860
Surprised that I would save people?

556
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,480
A mute?

557
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,590
Shanxiu?

558
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,320
How could you let Yang Qing
into Shengyue Sect?

559
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,890
It was fun.

560
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,180
You liked Yang Qing so much.

561
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,430
Since he was also interested in you,

562
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,790
I might as well give you two a chance

563
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,210
to see if
you're truly meant for each other.

564
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,750
If Yang Qing is Shanxiu,

565
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,610
he always happened to run into me.

566
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,440
Yes.

567
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,720
That was why he became my subordinate.

568
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,540
You confessed your love

569
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,450
for him so boldly in the martial world.

570
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,990
Everyone knew about it.

571
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,670
Of course a talented young man like him

572
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,260
would want to see

573
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,870
what you were up to.

574
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,070
So Yang Qing talked to me and had

575
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,160
contact with me that early on?

576
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,510
Why didn't he tell me?

577
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,090
I'm going to ask him.

578
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,170
What are you doing?

579
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,030
Sit down.

580
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,280
Ask what?

581
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,440
What's there to ask?

582
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,510
That was all in the past.

583
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,310
If you go now,

584
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,090
your identity will be exposed.

585
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,490
Yang Qing couldn't accept
Shengyue Sect back then.

586
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,850
Can he now?

587
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,030
Besides,

588
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,380
that guy Shang Huai by his side

589
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,000
has been suspicious of our identities.

590
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,750
He thinks we're from Shengyue Sect.

591
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,720
If you go now,

592
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,260
we'll be exposed.

593
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,720
You're right.

594
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,110
We have an important mission.

595
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,370
No matter how good Yang Qing is,

596
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,230
we still have to get the Sun Blade.

597
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,630
[Tianlin Garden]

598
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,880
Yang Qing.

599
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,640
Yang Qing.

600
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,000
When are we leaving?

601
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,590
We'll talk about that later.

602
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,640
Sect Leader sent a letter,

603
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,930
asking us to go to Biluo Valley
to celebrate Chief Lu's birthday.

604
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,130
That's so sudden.

605
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,030
Luckily,

606
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,350
Biluo Valley and Yunmen
are on the same route.

607
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,610
It shouldn't delay us.

608
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,030
Mr. Yang.

609
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,830
Then Miss Yang and the others...

610
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,720
We'll go with you.

611
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,480
Yunmen's disciples are going to
Biluo Valley for a birthday celebration.

612
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,080
What are you going there for?

613
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,440
To be honest,

614
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,270
my birthday happens
to be around these days.

615
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
As you know,

616
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,750
poor kids like us

617
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,000
are lucky enough if we could
have something to eat in childhood.

618
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,200
We didn't have a chance
to celebrate birthdays.

619
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,430
Lingyin and I just want to see

620
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,350
how wealthy families celebrate birthdays.

621
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,160
Okay?

622
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,590
Yang Qing,

623
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,790
just consider it as my birthday gift.

624
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,350
Okay?

625
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,650
Mr. Yang.

626
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,680
Mr. Yang,

627
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,140
Chief Lu holds
a big birthday gathering every year.

628
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,160
Many unknown individuals
in the martial world

629
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,020
have been treated with courtesy.

630
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,750
Um... Bringing the two ladies along

631
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,350
shouldn't be an issue.

632
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,940
When is your birthday?

633
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,450
On May 15.

634
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,200
Once we arrive in Biluo Valley,
you must follow my lead.

635
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,400
Don't cause any trouble.

636
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,070
Got it. I'll listen to you.

637
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,310
By the way, Yang Qing,

638
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,000
that technique you gave me—

639
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
just memorizing it is useless.

640
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
In a few days,

641
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,880
tutor me one-on-one.

642
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,380
I'll find a time in the next few days.

643
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,440
Let's see how your practice
is coming along.

644
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,160
Okay.

645
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,590
I promise I'll surprise you.

646
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,680
Long time no see.

647
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,110
Come in, please.

648
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,390
You've brought such a grand birthday gift.

649
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,960
Sect Leader Lei of Cangtong presents
his gift, the Longquan Sword,

650
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:04,510
wishing Chief Lu good luck and prosperity.

651
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:12,210
[Biluo Valley]

652
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,350
You messed it up?

653
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,790
Why are you just standing there?

654
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,680
Say something!

655
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,000
Chief,

656
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,110
Xuanxuan is inexperienced.

657
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,000
She is

658
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,550
no match for Yunmen.

659
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,070
Though we
didn't succeed entirely this time,

660
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,800
those kids fell seriously ill.

661
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,880
Even if they remember anything,

662
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,080
it will be considered

663
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,800
as delirium from the poison.

664
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,510
Chief, rest assured.

665
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,640
Qingmu Fortress
has been completely wiped out.

666
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,040
And I've destroyed all the other evidence.

667
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,510
Even if Yunmen hears any rumors,

668
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,560
they can't do anything to us.

669
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,590
Has Yuan Yingxing been taken care of?

670
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,080
I personally
made him fall off the Biluo Cliff.

671
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,820
The Biluo Cliff is over 3,000 meters high.

672
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,380
No matter how lucky he was,

673
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,800
he couldn't possibly survive.

674
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,380
Buhuan.

675
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,510
You've made up for your mistake this time.

676
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,480
Keep up the good work.

677
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,950
I'll let you take care of Xuanxuan.

678
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,800
Only then can I rest easy.

679
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,200
Father!

680
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,790
I won't marry him!

681
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,010
Who do you want to marry?

682
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,590
Yang Qing?

683
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,350
No way!

684
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,790
Yunmen has stood in my way repeatedly.

685
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,450
And the four major sects
will fall into discord sooner or later.

686
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,270
Biluo Valley will never allow Yunmen

687
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,340
to keep lording over us!

688
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,820
Anyway, I refuse!

689
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,350
You...

690
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,400
Have the invitations been delivered?

691
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,140
They've been delivered
to the sects at top speed.

692
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,590
[Sun and Moon Blade]

693
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,000
What did Yunmen say?

694
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,570
Sect Leader Feng said

695
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,450
he'll attend the banquet on time

696
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,970
with the Alliance Leader's Token.

697
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,140
The information is reliable, right?

698
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,200
Absolutely.

699
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
I didn't expect

700
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,480
the Moon Blade
from the Alliance Leader's Token

701
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,610
to be Shengyue Sect's Shengyue Token.

702
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,180
I've seen the Shengyue Token a few times.

703
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,050
It's identical
to the Moon Blade in this picture.

704
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,410
The Alliance Leader's Token consists
of the Sun Blade and the Moon Blade.

705
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,840
As the alliance leader, Yunmen

706
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,160
has the responsibility to guard the token.

707
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:49,000
But they lost the Moon Blade.

708
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,550
The Shengyue Token only appeared
when the previous chief took office.

709
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,680
I guess that was when

710
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,880
the blade was lost from Yunmen
and fell into the hands of Shengyue Sect.

711
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,480
Yunmen has kept this tightly under wraps.

712
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,100
They've deceived the entire martial world.

713
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:03,920
Chief,

714
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,240
just wait to see Yunmen's disgrace.

715
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,910
Yuan Yingxing was a hero,

716
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,830
but he could never know

717
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,940
the Shengyue Token of Shengyue Sect

718
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,450
is the Alliance Leader's Token
that can command

719
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,560
many sects.

720
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,230
Yunmen has long used
the Alliance Leader's Token

721
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,400
to lord over Biluo Valley.

722
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,720
Now it's time for the world

723
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,720
to laugh at it.

724
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,720
Biluo Valley looks so magnificent,

725
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,090
but they arranged a shabby room for us.

726
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,890
So stingy.

727
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,310
Come on.

728
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,420
Think about it.

729
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,510
You've offended Lu Xuanxuan so many times.

730
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,960
We're lucky that she didn't ask us

731
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,790
to stay in the woodshed.

732
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,520
Be grateful.

733
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,120
She's just jealous of me.

734
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,720
Forget it.

735
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,390
I'm not here to enjoy myself anyway.

736
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,080
If our people weren't being held here,

737
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,280
I wouldn't have come even if they beg me.

738
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,310
By the way, Yue,

739
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,240
Mingyang already snuck in,
disguised as one of the disciples

740
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,300
from another sect.

741
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,350
I took a look around just now.

742
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,520
This place seems loosely guarded,

743
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,030
but they patrol in pairs.

744
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,720
So actually, security is quite tight.

745
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,640
Now everyone in Biluo Valley is busy
entertaining guests.

746
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,110
It's the perfect time
to search for the dungeon.

747
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,550
Okay.

748
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,600
You go west. I'll go east.

749
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,510
Let's split up.

750
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,400
Be careful.

751
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:53,920
Miss,

752
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,420
this area is restricted.
It's where Chief cultivates.

753
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,350
You can't enter.

754
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,590
Apologies for the disturbance.

755
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,160
There's a mechanism above the door.

756
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,510
Quite tight security.

757
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,389
Wangyue.

758
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,440
Yang Qing,

759
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,590
so you are here.

760
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,850
I've been looking for you.

761
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,380
You came here to look for me?

762
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,840
I finally found you.

763
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,760
Biluo Valley's rule is ridiculous.

764
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,600
Men and women have to stay separately.

765
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
It keeps lovers apart.

766
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,440
You were sneaking around here.

767
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,030
What are you up to?

768
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,550
Nothing.

769
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,510
I just miss you.

770
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,230
Sect Leader.

771
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,580
Qing,

772
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,500
this young lady is...

773
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,070
She is... Miss Yang.

774
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,660
Holding each other in broad daylight—

775
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,030
how improper.

776
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,640
What were you two doing just now?

777
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,510
Never mind, I don't want to know.

778
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,150
Qing,

779
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,330
you've always been cautious.

780
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,450
Why were you being so careless?

781
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,320
I'm sorry.

782
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,030
This young lady's voice

783
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,060
sounds somewhat familiar.

784
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,490
I wonder which sect she's from.

785
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,000
I come from a humble background

786
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,000
and haven't joined any sect.

787
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,150
Mr. Yang,

788
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,670
Sect Leader is here for you,

789
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,000
so I'll take my leave.

790
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,810
What's so precious

791
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,150
that I'm not even allowed to look at it?

792
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,000
You came in

793
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,440
without saying a word.

794
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,090
Did anyone see you come in?

795
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,080
Don't worry.

796
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,030
I followed behind
Qingcheng Sect's disciples.

797
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,560
No one noticed my identity.

798
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,750
I just heard great news.

799
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,440
I heard Yunmen's Sect Leader

800
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,560
brought the Alliance Leader's Token here,

801
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,290
and Biluo Valley is planning
a sacrifice ritual.

802
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,280
So the Sun Blade of Yunmen

803
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,400
is right here now?

804
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,030
Yes.

805
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,760
Is the information reliable?

806
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,760
Seems all the guests here know about this.

807
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,440
And I just ran into

808
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,790
Saintess in the garden.

809
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,690
She also mentioned
Feng Xingyun's attendant

810
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,890
was carrying a box.

811
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,710
He wouldn't let anyone
take a second look at it.

812
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,510
I guess the Alliance Leader's Token
is in that box.

813
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,670
Who was that woman just now?

814
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,000
An orphan from Yangliu Town.

815
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,670
She helped us quite a bit when we

816
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,400
were investigating the missing kids.

817
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Her uncle sold her to a local bully.

818
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,230
With nowhere else to go,

819
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,440
she's been tagging along with us
for the time being.

820
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,480
You two are close?

821
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,480
Miss Yang is outgoing.

822
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,630
She gets along with everyone easily.

823
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,110
She doesn't understand proper etiquette,

824
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,840
but you are an elder of Yunmen.

825
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,030
You should mind your conduct.

826
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,190
But Miss Yang's voice

827
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,190
sounds very familiar.

828
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,230
How would you know a country girl?

829
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,630
You must be mistaken.

830
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,670
I may be old,

831
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,520
but I'm not muddled.

832
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,110
Last year, Jiang Yan wanted to go home

833
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,450
to celebrate his mother's birthday.

834
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,360
But you insisted

835
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,690
he had just celebrated
his mother's birthday a month ago,

836
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,940
causing quite a fuss.

837
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,920
In the end, you realized
you had remembered incorrectly.

838
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,460
It was another disciple who celebrated

839
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,390
his mother's birthday a month ago.

840
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,880
The two of them look so alike.

841
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,060
Forget it.

842
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,640
I believe you. I won't say more about it.

843
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,510
As for the missing children, we traced
the clues to a bandit named Cao Fei

844
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,150
from Qingmu Fortress.

845
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,030
And then the trail went cold.

846
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,390
But all signs point to Biluo Valley.

847
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,150
Do you really believe
Biluo Valley is involved?

848
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,880
I'm sure of it.

849
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,620
Biluo Valley must be involved.

850
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
But I don't have enough evidence

851
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,280
to confront them openly.

852
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
I believe you.

853
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,760
Chief Lu of Biluo Valley

854
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,440
is indeed no easy character.

855
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,670
Since he became the chief,

856
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,360
he's stirred up trouble frequently.

857
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,360
We shouldn't have intentions
of harming others,

858
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,820
but we must stay vigilant.

859
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,320
We must be cautious with Biluo Valley.

860
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,150
Yeah.

861
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,370
Regardless of other matters,

862
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,960
the birthday celebration is suspicious.

863
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:53,920
Qing,

864
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,490
do you know why

865
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,310
I summoned you back so urgently?

866
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,320
Is it about the Alliance Leader's Token?

867
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,730
The Alliance Leader's Token?

868
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,740
Although Shengyue Sect has been destroyed,

869
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,420
the martial world is still in turmoil.

870
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,110
Chief Lu wants to take advantage
of this birthday celebration

871
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:18,310
to call upon heroes across the land
to worship the Alliance Leader's Token,

872
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,760
in a bid to honor those who died

873
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,360
in the battle between good and evil.

874
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,500
More importantly,

875
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,050
he wants to reestablish connections

876
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,530
and trust among the sects.

877
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,280
The martial world's matters
should be settled in the martial world.

878
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,210
Yunmen will give its full support.

879
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,100
No wonder you traveled so far
to deliver the Alliance Leader's Token.

880
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,230
The token is in this box.

881
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,630
I'm entrusting it to you now.

882
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,630
Do not let anything go wrong.

883
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,130
Yes, Sect Leader.

884
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,710
He's gone.

885
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,090
Does Chief Lu really intend
to worship the Alliance Leader's Token?

886
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,890
I think it's highly suspicious.

887
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,110
[Noble and Unsullied]

888
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,480
Put this herb in it.

889
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,590
What is this place?

890
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,510
You're awake.

891
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,230
This is my home.

892
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,230
You are...

893
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,900
You can call me Lady Bingcan.

894
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,700
Why am I here?

895
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,140
My apprentice went
to gather herbs in the valley,

896
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,440
and found you two
badly wounded and unconscious.

897
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,500
So he brought you here for treatment.

898
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,470
Thank you, Lady Bingcan.

899
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,480
By the way,

900
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,840
where is the young lady who was with me?

901
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,830
Her injuries
are far more severe than yours.

902
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,620
I can only keep her breathing.

903
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,420
Whether she can wake up or not—

904
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,290
it's still uncertain.

905
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
Take me to her now.

906
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,310
Now the Moon Blade is missing.

907
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,870
If word of this gets out,

908
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,920
the martial world will inevitably
fall into chaos again.

909
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,810
I was against the ritual in the beginning,

910
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,950
but Chief Lu acted first
and spread the news.

911
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,030
The other sects
all responded enthusiastically.

912
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,630
By the time I tried to stop it,

913
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,190
it was too late.

914
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,980
I could only let it happen.

915
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,510
There has never been such a ritual.

916
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,300
Why does Chief Lu insist on it this year?

917
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,630
Chief Lu has long been displeased with
Yunmen being the martial world's leader.

918
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,280
He must have discovered something

919
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,340
and wants to use this opportunity
to discredit Yunmen.

920
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,250
Whatever he may have learned,

921
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,360
we can't let the news
of the Moon Blade's disappearance spread.

922
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,150
Qing,

923
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,320
you went undercover in Shengyue Sect.

924
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,170
That was a few years ago.

925
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,980
But I still want to ask you,

926
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,840
back then,

927
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,770
did you really find no clue
about the Moon Blade?

928
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,700
The Shengyue Token
that Saintess has been entrusted with

929
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,670
vanished suddenly.

930
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,790
For that reason,

931
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,270
she'll lose her position as Saintess.

932
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,260
She might even lose her life too.

933
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,850
Our opportunity has come.

934
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,080
But I think

935
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,230
Chief Yuan trusts Saintess deeply.

936
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,150
He probably won't punish her easily.

937
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,980
Saintess's duty
is to guard the Shengyue Token.

938
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,990
Now that it's missing,

939
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,860
she must pay with her life.

940
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,700
Otherwise, how can Shengyue Sect

941
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,040
make others convinced?

942
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,960
Back then,

943
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,880
I really didn't find any clue.

944
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,630
Sect Leader, rest assured.

945
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,920
Even without the Moon Blade,

946
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,330
I will see Yunmen through this crisis.

947
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,480
After the fall of Shengyue Sect,

948
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,120
I secretly searched Mount Yin,

949
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,190
but found nothing.

950
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,030
By the way, your Junior Yao

951
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,230
went undercover in Shengyue Sect.

952
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,000
But after completing her mission,

953
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,940
she never returned to Yunmen.

954
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,430
I wonder how she's been.

955
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,640
A few days ago,

956
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,630
I received a letter from her.

957
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,000
After I replied,

958
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,060
there was no further word from her.

959
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,330
She arrived at Biluo Valley before we did.

960
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,340
Who knows what may have happened?

961
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:01,820
Forget it.

962
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,080
She's always been independent.

963
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,430
I'm sure she has her own plans.

964
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,110
As for the birthday celebration,

965
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,230
I've already made foolproof arrangements.

966
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,100
When the time comes,

967
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,550
we...
