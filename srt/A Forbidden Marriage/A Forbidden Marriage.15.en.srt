[A Forbidden Marriage]

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,900
[Episode 15]

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,430
[Yunmen]

4
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,520
[Yunxiao Hall]

5
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,680
I failed to capture Yuan Yingxing

6
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,140
and bring Junior Yao back.

7
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,290
Please punish me, Sect Leader.

8
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,430
Stand up and speak.

9
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,690
This isn't your fault.

10
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,190
Thanks to you,

11
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,500
Jin Buhuan's madness was stopped

12
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,510
and the Liansha Formation was broken,
preventing a great disaster.

13
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,670
Otherwise, not just Chief Lu,

14
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,510
but even I, the Alliance Leader,

15
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,740
would have no way to explain this
to the other sects.

16
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,340
Now that Yuan Yingxing is dead,

17
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,710
everyone can finally rest easy.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,660
Yuan Yingxing is still alive.

19
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:38,870
What?

20
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,030
The reports said

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,560
he died in the flames.

22
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,450
That was wrong.

23
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,020
I feared it would cause more trouble,

24
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,560
so I kept quiet about it.

25
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,130
With the recent turmoil in Biluo Valley,

26
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,960
all sects have returned to their homes,

27
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,290
so it's unlikely to gather them again
for another  suppression.

28
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,490
Indeed, this matter should
remain confidential.

29
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,400
Wait.

30
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,960
Fu hasn't returned yet.

31
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,030
Could Yuan Yingxing have captured her?

32
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,800
Junior Yao will be fine.

33
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,880
Yuan Yingxing won't harm her.

34
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,690
How can you be so certain?

35
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,200
Yuan Yingxing still has feelings
for Junior Yao,

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
and she's not completely indifferent
to him either.

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,230
Impossible!

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,340
Fu would never fall for someone
from the Shengyue Sect.

39
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,310
It must've been Yuan Yingxing

40
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,240
who used some underhanded tricks.

41
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,650
We must rescue Fu as soon as possible.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,310
I'll summon the other sect leaders now

43
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,610
and send people after Yuan Yingxing.

44
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,360
Most likely,

45
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,990
Yuan Yingxing is on his way to Mount Yin,

46
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,500
intending to
rebuild the Shengyue Sect there.

47
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,150
The terrain there is too complicated.

48
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,940
None of our fellow disciples
have been there before.

49
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,000
Going there recklessly

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,329
would be too dangerous.

51
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,120
You have a point.

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,290
With the recent upheaval in Biluo Valley,

53
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,960
all sects are already exhausted
from travel.

54
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,110
Even if we pursue him now,

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,080
we wouldn't have any advantage.

56
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,370
How about this:

57
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,920
if it really comes down to it,

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,190
I'll personally make the trip

59
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,150
to rescue Fu.

60
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,160
You are the leader of our sect

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,510
and the alliance leader of all the sects.

62
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,310
It's not appropriate for you
to risk yourself.

63
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,839
Besides,

64
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,940
with Junior Yao's martial skills,

65
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,850
although she can't defeat Yuan Yingxing,

66
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,850
she can certainly protect herself.

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,060
Moreover,

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,860
Yuan Yingxing really wouldn't harm her.

69
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,750
What do you think we should do?

70
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,930
We can't just let Fu

71
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,240
stay with the Shengyue Sect
for years again, can we?

72
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,520
Actually, it's not that difficult
to solve this.

73
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,050
You often say that peace is precious.

74
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,480
Could the Shengyue Sect and we

75
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,340
resolve this matter peacefully?

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,600
"Resolve this peacefully?"

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,920
For instance,

78
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,520
negotiation.

79
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,050
"Negotiation?"

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,870
Those shameless lowlifes

81
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,510
don't deserve to negotiate with us!

82
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,240
Sect Leader,

83
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,860
not everyone in the Shengyue Sect is
beyond redemption.

84
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,120
They just don't follow the proper rules.

85
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,560
The deep-seated grudge between
the Shengyue Sect

86
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,680
and the entire martial world
cannot be explained

87
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,740
in just a few words!

88
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,160
Qing, you're too young.

89
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,410
Alright, go back and rest now.

90
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,900
As for Fu,

91
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,800
I'll think of something.

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,530
Sect Leader,

93
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,120
I... have one more thing.

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,240
What is it?

95
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,470
I want to get married.

96
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,700
You want to get married?

97
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,170
To whom?

98
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,630
That Miss Yang you brought back?

99
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,480
It is she.

100
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,750
I truly wish to marry her.

101
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,380
I remember her.

102
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,400
She acts inappropriately with men
in public,

103
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,690
showing no sense of decorum.

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,360
You and she are
from completely different worlds.

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,000
Among our major sects,

106
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,840
there are plenty of young women
who admire you.

107
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,510
And it wouldn't be difficult

108
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,830
to select a few well-mannered young women
of suitable status

109
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,480
for you.

110
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,260
Moreover,

111
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,720
you've been betrothed to Fu
since childhood.

112
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,160
Is Fu not good enough compared to her?

113
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,660
Why throw away

114
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,310
all these suitable matches

115
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,480
for some village girl?

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
I suppose it's because she's prettier.

117
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,070
Be serious!

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,090
Sect Leader,

119
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,270
I don't care

120
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,760
how amazing they are

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,470
or how perfect they might seem for me.

122
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,550
I love Wangyue.

123
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,070
I only want to marry her,

124
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,470
and I will marry only her.

125
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,310
Please give us your blessing.

126
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,800
You...

127
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,409
We haven't dealt with
the Shengyue Sect yet.

128
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,360
How can you still have the heart

129
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,090
to fuss over your love affairs?

130
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,630
At a critical time like this,

131
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,630
forget about getting married.

132
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,850
I must marry her.

133
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,480
I've already promised her.

134
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,950
You!

135
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,120
This trip down the mountain

136
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,600
has made you forget all your cultivation.

137
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,920
Do you still care about this sect?

138
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,390
Do you still respect me
as the Sect Leader?

139
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,720
I should never have let you
leave the sect.

140
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,930
Say no more.

141
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
Go to your room and reflect
while confined.

142
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,660
You're not coming out

143
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,170
until you've thought it through!

144
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,000
I won't change my mind.

145
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,490
[Yunmen]

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,630
Mr. Yang,

147
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,750
it's been three days already.

148
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,600
You haven't eaten
or had anything to drink.

149
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Even a man of iron couldn't endure this.

150
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Please eat something, at least.

151
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,560
I'm fine.

152
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,200
You may leave.

153
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,690
Sect Leader.

154
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,710
It's been three days,

155
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,050
and he still refuses to eat anything?

156
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,310
Not even a single bite.

157
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,760
What do you know about Miss Yang,

158
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,580
who returned with you?

159
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,080
Miss Yang is an orphan from Yangliu Town.

160
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,200
She has an uncle
who serves in the Shengyue Sect

161
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,910
and is not very familiar with
proper etiquette.

162
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,640
Sect Leader,

163
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
why are you asking about her?

164
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,270
Just curious.

165
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,890
She has an uncle in the Shengyue Sect...

166
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,730
She isn't a member of
the Shengyue Sect herself, is she?

167
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,630
No, no.

168
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,230
How could Mr. Yang possibly

169
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,910
bring someone from the Shengyue Sect back
to our sect?

170
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,030
According to her,

171
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,890
she has already cut all ties

172
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,200
with her relative in the Shengyue Sect.

173
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,550
It's just that...

174
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,630
It's just that...

175
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,360
Just what? Speak clearly.

176
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,150
It's just that, in my view,

177
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,550
her principles and behavior

178
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,450
are quite similar to those of
the Shengyue Sect members.

179
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,960
On our way back,

180
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,740
she kept clinging to Mr. Yang.

181
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,990
While she did provide us with much help,

182
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,800
she also caused quite a bit of trouble.

183
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,240
How does she compare to Ms. Yao?

184
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,870
Naturally, they're worlds apart.

185
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,240
She's just a small-town girl.

186
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,570
How could she possibly compare to Ms. Yao?

187
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,960
Yang Qing is suffering himself like this
for a village girl.

188
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,960
I'd like to see how long he can hold out.

189
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,040
You may go now.

190
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,670
Yes.

191
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,840
Miss Yang?

192
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,400
What's wrong?

193
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:06,880
Why are you here?

194
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,440
I've been here three days

195
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,230
and haven't seen so much as
a glimpse of Yang Qing.

196
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,300
If he won't come to me,

197
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,760
I'll just have to go to him.

198
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,850
Mr. Yang has been confined
by the Sect Leader.

199
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,580
No one is allowed to see him now.

200
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,200
Miss Yang, you should leave now.

201
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,800
Yang Qing has been confined?

202
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,720
Why?

203
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,770
Well, your sect

204
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,870
is being completely unreasonable.

205
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,790
Yang Qing worked so hard out there
for so long,

206
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,480
and he gets confined
as soon as he returns?

207
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
This won't do. I'm breaking him out.

208
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,000
Yang Qing!

209
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,750
Yang Qing!

210
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,740
Miss Yang, you can't do this!

211
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,650
Without the Sect Leader's permission,

212
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,910
Mr. Yang cannot come out.

213
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,790
That old fool.

214
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,720
You might as well just let him
starve to death!

215
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,250
Wangyue!

216
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,270
Yang Qing.

217
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,890
You're so skilled at martial arts,

218
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,620
so can't you come out yourself?

219
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,870
I could.

220
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,440
Then why don't you?

221
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,150
It's not that I cannot come out,

222
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,350
but that I shouldn't.

223
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,930
The Sect Leader has punished me
by making me reflect in my room.

224
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,450
How could I just brush off what he said?

225
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,340
How long are you going to
lock yourself up in here?

226
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,670
Can't you just apologize and come out?

227
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,330
Who said anything about apologizing?

228
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,150
I'm reflecting in solitude

229
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,010
until the Sect Leader softens up.

230
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,360
The more miserable I look,

231
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,760
the faster he'll give in.

232
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,910
If you don't come out soon,

233
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,440
I'll go find another lover.

234
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,510
I've got plenty of men I like,

235
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,000
and even more chasing after me.

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
You wouldn't even make the list.

237
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:29,960
Indeed,

238
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,820
you like tons of men.

239
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,780
I'm not even in the running.

240
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:34,810
Miss Yang,

241
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,840
this isn't a place for chatting.

242
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,650
You should leave now.

243
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,290
It'll be even more troublesome
if the Sect Leader comes.

244
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:39,840
He'll come...

245
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,360
So, what exactly did you do wrong

246
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,620
that made things so tense
between you and your Sect Leader?

247
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,570
He said that I was out of my mind.

248
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,370
He's the one who's out of his mind!

249
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,920
Because I told him...

250
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,410
I want to marry you.

251
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,910
What?

252
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,580
Yang Qing, you're not lying to me,
are you?

253
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,240
You're not teasing me, right?

254
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,390
Miss Yang, hurry up and go.

255
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,320
Yang Qing, I'll come see you again!

256
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,810
Go!

257
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,490
Wangyue,

258
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,150
if you see the Sect Leader,

259
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,750
you must control your temper

260
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,310
and don't argue with him!

261
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,710
Jiang Yan, Jiang Yan.

262
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,580
Why exactly has Yang Qing been confined?

263
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,210
Well,

264
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,550
he just said a few words
to the Sect Leader and then got locked up?

265
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,510
Could it be...

266
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,150
I don't know the details,

267
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,480
but it seems Mr. Yang failed to
bring Ms. Yao back,

268
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
and the Sect Leader was displeased.

269
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,870
He was just teasing me again.

270
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,490
How dare you say it was because
you wanted to marry me?

271
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,750
Miss Yang? Miss Yang.

272
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,480
Well,

273
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,820
I have something to ask you.

274
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,840
It's about Miss Lin.

275
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,900
When the incident happened
at Biluo Valley,

276
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,820
I hadn't yet settled her somewhere safe

277
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
before the Sect Leader sent me away.

278
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,080
I wonder if Miss Lin is doing well now.

279
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,320
Miss Lin?

280
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,200
You mean Lin Yin, right?

281
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Don't worry, she's doing very well.

282
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,010
Where is she now?

283
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,670
It's dangerous for a woman
to be alone out there.

284
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,200
Perhaps

285
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,370
I should go and bring her back here?

286
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,100
You're worrying for nothing.

287
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,550
Lin Yin is perfectly capable of
taking care of herself.

288
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,610
She's probably somewhere enjoying herself
right now.

289
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,910
Alright then.

290
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,090
I was overthinking.

291
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,940
Why is he acting so weird?

292
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,520
Young Chief!

293
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,240
How is my father?

294
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,670
Young Chief.

295
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,430
Is he feeling better?

296
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,480
The Chief is out of danger now.

297
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,150
He just asked you to go to Yunmen.

298
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,840
Yunmen?

299
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,000
Yuan Yingxing is already dead,

300
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,820
and their investigation into
the missing children has hit a dead end.

301
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
What is Father still worried about?

302
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,220
Here's the thing:

303
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,230
the Chief is very pleased
that Yuan Yingxing is dead,

304
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,910
but we still haven't found
the Shengyue Token,

305
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,030
which is the Moon Blade
that Jin Buhuan spoke of.

306
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,390
So, we don't know if Yunmen still holds
the full Alliance Leader's Token—

307
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,720
the Sun and Moon Blades.

308
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,800
Oh, right,

309
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,960
Jin Buhuan activated the Liansha Formation
without permission,

310
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,360
causing such a huge mess.

311
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,280
Where is he now?

312
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,480
That's also
what the Chief is worried about.

313
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,720
After the battle in Miyun Forest,

314
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,360
Jin Buhuan disappeared without a trace.

315
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,270
The Chief fears that he might have found
the Moon Blade

316
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,790
and wants to keep it for himself.

317
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,450
He's already sent more people
to search for him.

318
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,330
He's disappeared?

319
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,390
That's actually better.

320
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,120
Then he won't pester me anymore.

321
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,380
And my trip to Yunmen will be much easier.

322
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,240
Oh, right.

323
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,220
This is the Yunmen token.
Please keep it safe.

324
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,150
With this token,

325
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,140
except for the forbidden ground,

326
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,470
you can freely access any place in Yunmen.

327
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,510
They're currently recruiting
new disciples.

328
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,030
The Chief has arranged everything

329
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,870
for you to go there as an herbalist

330
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,070
and find out the truth
about the Alliance Leader's Token.

331
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,720
But ever since the missing children case,

332
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,520
they have been suspicious of us.

333
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,320
Previously, when we used Jin Buhuan,

334
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,380
his brutal methods

335
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,930
caused strong opposition from them.

336
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,910
I'm afraid that even if I go there,

337
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,840
it'll be hard to find any openings.

338
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,820
Young Chief, don't worry.

339
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,940
The Chief has already shifted

340
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,940
all the blame onto

341
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,820
Jin Buhuan, the Gold Hall Master,

342
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,650
so we're basically free from suspicion.

343
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,180
Besides,

344
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,360
our Biluo Valley claims the primary credit

345
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,890
for Yuan Yingxing's death.

346
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,690
That's what gave you
this great opportunity

347
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,750
to study at Yunmen.

348
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,550
Your visit this time is
under the pretense of

349
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,270
exchanging martial arts techniques
between our two sects.

350
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,670
But the exchange isn't important,

351
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,800
nor is the studying.

352
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,270
What's important is that you need to

353
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,870
make good use of these few months

354
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,130
to find out
if the Moon Blade has truly been lost,

355
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,390
as Jin Buhuan claimed.

356
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,760
I understand.

357
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,270
I'll do my best to investigate.

358
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,510
Once we confirm
that the Moon Blade is lost,

359
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,030
we can legitimately

360
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,510
strip Yunmen
of their Alliance Leader position.

361
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,960
Yes.

362
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,990
And one more thing:

363
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,680
after much deliberation, the Chief

364
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,829
has decided to give you the scripture
of the Six Harmonies Divine Art.

365
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,720
He hopes

366
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,510
you'll practice diligently

367
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,960
to prepare for any unforeseen danger.

368
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,030
Father should have given this to me
long ago.

369
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,460
With this, my martial skills
will greatly improve,

370
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,920
and Mr. Yang will surely see me
in a new light.

371
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,030
Sect Leader Feng,

372
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,560
I heard you wanted to see me.

373
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,640
When my disciples were training outside,

374
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,800
you helped them a great deal.

375
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,600
I thank you on their behalf.

376
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,290
Sect Leader Feng,

377
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,550
you're being too kind.

378
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,560
People of the martial world
should help those in need.

379
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,670
Besides,

380
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,070
Yang Qing and I have
a special relationship.

381
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,670
His business is my business.

382
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,600
What exactly is your relationship
with Yang Qing?

383
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,080
Whatever Yang Qing says
our relationship is,

384
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,030
that's what it is.

385
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,990
So it really is you
who's been clinging to Yang Qing,

386
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,990
making him forget
the rules and proper conduct.

387
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,960
I was just about to ask you about that.

388
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,760
Why have you confined Yang Qing?

389
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,920
What did he do wrong?

390
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,700
Do you know he hasn't had

391
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,190
any food or water for days?

392
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,960
This is an internal affair of our sect.

393
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,420
It's none of your concern.

394
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,790
You're a girl

395
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,270
and have been away from home for so long.

396
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,870
Your family must be worried.

397
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,770
You should hurry back to Yangliu Town.

398
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
I'll make all the necessary arrangements.

399
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,790
I no longer have any family
remaining in Yangliu Town.

400
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,940
Yang Qing is the closest person
I have now.

401
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,640
He promised to let me stay here.

402
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,240
I'll wait for him to come out.

403
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,970
Sect Leader,

404
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,230
please let me stay.

405
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,200
We have our own rules here.

406
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,810
Those who don't respect
propriety and rules

407
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,690
cannot stay.

408
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,830
You can go ask around in Yangliu Town.

409
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,510
I come from a proper family.

410
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,580
Then tell me, what do you like about Qing?

411
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,710
Who wouldn't like a talented young man

412
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,830
like Yang Qing?

413
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,250
It's that simple?

414
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,790
It's that simple.

415
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,240
No, no, let me rephrase that.

416
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,070
Yang Qing is unworldly,

417
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,720
noble, and upright in character.

418
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,880
I need to learn from him in the future.

419
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,680
Qing is indeed a rare and good young man.

420
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,490
However, Miss Yang,

421
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,620
you're still young.

422
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,480
Matters of the heart

423
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,170
are not that simple.

424
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,260
You haven't known Yang Qing very long.

425
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,930
You only see his surface.

426
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,330
You don't truly understand him.

427
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,830
Matters of the heart

428
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,580
aren't complicated at all.

429
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,570
If you're worried
that I don't know him well enough,

430
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,300
then please let him out quickly

431
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
so that I can spend more time with him

432
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,410
to know him better.

433
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,300
Nonsense!

434
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,000
Your pestering of Yang Qing like this

435
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,210
isn't good for either of you.

436
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,820
What harm could come from
a romantic relationship?

437
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,440
If you're really so worried,

438
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,170
why don't you...

439
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,730
let us get married?

440
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,930
Then everything would be proper.

441
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,480
You're a girl.

442
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,690
How can you speak so carelessly
about marriage?

443
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,180
Tell me,

444
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,620
what will it take for you
to leave Yang Qing alone?

445
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,720
He's not someone you're worthy of.

446
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,030
Sect Leader Feng, that's rather hurtful.

447
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,480
May I ask
who would be worthy of Yang Qing then?

448
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,140
Qing has a fiancée.

449
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,800
They've been childhood sweethearts.

450
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,620
Whether in personality, interests,
or virtue,

451
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,830
they are perfectly matched.

452
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,670
When Fu returns,

453
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,810
they will be married.

454
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,310
That shameless, vicious woman

455
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,000
could never be worthy of Yang Qing.

456
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,550
Yang Qing couldn't possibly like her.

457
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,210
They have no future together!

458
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,040
Please watch your words.

459
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,420
Fu is clever, beautiful, and virtuous.

460
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,120
She has never caused
any trouble for our sect.

461
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,080
She even risked her life,

462
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,890
leading all other sects
in eliminating the Shengyue Sect.

463
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,420
She is the pride of our sect,

464
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,440
more than worthy to be Qing's wife.

465
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,970
Seducing the Chief of the Shengyue Sect—

466
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,770
you call that virtuous and proper?

467
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,030
Ruthless and merciless are more like it.

468
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,680
When dealing with aberrations
like the Shengyue Sect,

469
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,540
we can't always play by the rules.

470
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,950
As they say, all's fair in war.

471
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,480
May I ask, Sect Leader Feng,

472
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,880
if someone were to use

473
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,980
the same dirty tricks
against your sect in the future,

474
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,780
would that also be considered
"all's fair in war"?

475
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,590
What utter drivel!

476
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,480
What would a village girl like you
understand?

477
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,270
Miss Yang,

478
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,400
you and Yang Qing will never be together.

479
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,900
You'd better leave quietly

480
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,270
before I have to force you out.

481
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,720
I'll leave if you want,

482
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,150
but shouldn't you offer me something
in return?

483
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,950
Fine. Name it.

484
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,900
1,000 taels.

485
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,030
What?

486
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,250
We will not be blackmailed!

487
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,480
Is your sect really this poor?

488
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,070
Such a small amount of money

489
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,960
can shock someone as mighty as you,
the Sect Leader?

490
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,430
How pathetic.

491
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,640
You...

492
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,630
[Yunmen]

493
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,130
Young Chief,

494
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
this is Yunmen's training ground.

495
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
After they've chosen their new disciples,

496
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,780
we won't be able to stay here anymore.

497
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,370
Later,

498
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,020
you'll need to familiarize yourself with
the terrain here

499
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,110
and memorize the guard positions...

500
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,040
Enough already.

501
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,080
You've been talking forever,

502
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,230
and my ears are numb.

503
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,380
Those are all the Chief's orders.

504
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,050
He's afraid that you'll be

505
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,790
thinking only of Elder Yang from Yunmen

506
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,190
and forget your mission.

507
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,940
This time, no matter what,

508
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,640
I will definitely succeed.

509
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,310
I didn't even catch a glimpse of
the Sun Blade,

510
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,970
and I was kicked out of Yunmen.

511
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,950
And Yang Qing has been confined.

512
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,110
What should I do?

513
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,160
Miss Yang!

514
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,750
Miss Yang!

515
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,130
How could you leave
without saying anything?

516
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,000
Your Sect Leader personally ordered me
to leave.

517
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,060
Should I have shamelessly stayed
and refused to leave?

518
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,680
The Sect Leader just...

519
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,310
He just thinks I'm a pretty village girl
with nothing to offer,

520
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,970
not worthy of your Elder Yang.

521
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,160
Miss Yang, don't think like that.

522
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,100
The Sect Leader just needs some time
to accept it.

523
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,690
Besides,

524
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,780
Mr. Yang and Ms. Yao have been engaged
for a long time.

525
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,080
Then tell me,

526
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,540
who's better, me or your Ms. Yao?

527
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,680
Well...

528
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,480
Jiang Yan,

529
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,350
I'm so disappointed in you.

530
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,750
I've been so good to you,

531
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,590
yet you can't even answer

532
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,920
such a simple question?

533
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,820
Don't you forget,

534
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,510
who was it
that found someone to cure your poison,

535
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,160
and who was it

536
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,680
that helped you deal with the villagers
from Yangliu Town?

537
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,880
I'm so disappointed.

538
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,520
Miss Yang.

539
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,600
Miss Yang, don't go.

540
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,390
Why are so many people gathered there?

541
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,590
Something happened?

542
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,310
Our sect recruits new disciples
at this time every year.

543
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,880
That's our sect's registration point.

544
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,400
All those who want to join our sect

545
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,350
need to register here

546
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,750
and then participate in the selection.

547
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,350
The new disciple selection?

548
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,740
Are there any special requirements?

549
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,740
Not really.

550
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,270
Anyone can participate.

551
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,530
There's no threshold.

552
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,920
It's just

553
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,160
that the selection isn't easy to pass.

554
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,890
The elders will personally oversee
the process.

555
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,210
So, the newly admitted disciples

556
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,130
can also stay at

557
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,510
your sect permanently like you?

558
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,270
Of course.

559
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,400
We disciples are not permitted

560
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,930
to leave the mountain
without special tasks.

561
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,480
Interesting.

562
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,300
I'll go take a look.

563
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,240
Miss Yang!

564
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,620
Sect Leader.

565
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,480
Miss Yang has already left.

566
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,310
I never thought
she was that kind of woman.

567
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,070
For money,

568
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,700
she betrayed Mr. Yang.

569
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,800
Mr. Yang hasn't eaten for five days
because of her.

570
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,000
This might be for the best.

571
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,810
Let Yang Qing see her true colors

572
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,350
and sever his feelings for her
once and for all.

573
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,030
Shang Huai,

574
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,610
ask him to come out.

575
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,050
He's been refusing food and water.

576
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,480
Even the strongest man can't endure that.

577
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Yes, Sect Leader.

578
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,730
You truly care about Mr. Yang the most.

579
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,440
I hope he understands my good intentions.

580
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,640
Don't worry, Sect Leader.

581
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,920
Mr. Yang understands what's important.

582
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,080
He won't abandon our sect

583
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,340
for the sake of a woman.

584
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,550
Excuse me, excuse me.

585
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:58,920
Miss Yang!

586
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,650
Let me through, let me through.

587
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,130
Miss Yang.

588
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Don't stop me.

589
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,510
I'm going to pass the trials
and join your sect,

590
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,640
fair and square.

591
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,720
Then we'll see who still dares to
look down on me as a village girl.

592
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,320
Miss Yang,

593
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,640
you need to think this through.

594
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,830
If you join our sect,

595
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,640
you'll have to formally address him as
"Mr. Yang."

596
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,370
In our sect,

597
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,360
there's absolutely no other possibility

598
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,790
between an elder and a disciple.

599
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,590
That serious?

600
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,750
It's just a title, isn't it?

601
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,790
If you become my junior,

602
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,790
the Sect Leader will be
even less accepting of

603
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,030
you and Mr. Yang getting together.

604
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,830
He doesn't accept me now anyway.

605
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,590
I don't care.

606
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,070
I'm determined to stay at your sect.

607
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm not only going to pester Yang Qing,

608
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,430
but I'm also going to
have an epic romance with him

609
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,820
just to spite your Sect Leader.

610
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,420
Miss Yang.

611
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,590
Let go of me.

612
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:42,970
Mr. Yang!

613
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,730
What's wrong?

614
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,500
Miss Yang...

615
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,280
in order not to be driven away
by the Sect Leader,

616
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,270
so she's applying to join our sect.

617
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,110
She's already filled in her name

618
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,110
and is about to take part in
the selection.

619
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,640
Mr. Yang, what should we do?

620
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,040
Mr. Yang, where are you going?

621
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,510
I'm going down the mountain.

622
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,290
But the Sect Leader has confined you.

623
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,200
Tell the Sect Leader

624
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,270
that I'm probably out of my mind

625
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,500
to think of marrying her,

626
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,110
and I'll explain to him when I return.

627
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,510
[Name Card]

628
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Miss, you're from Yangliu Town.

629
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,790
And your name is?

630
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,590
Yang Wangyue.

631
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,090
My name is Yang Wangyue.

632
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,960
Yang Wangyue.

633
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,700
That's the same name as
the Saintess of the Shengyue Sect.

634
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,510
Please wait a moment, miss.

635
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,570
Let me check the disciples
registered from Yangliu Town this year.

636
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,300
Sir,

637
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,370
your Elder Yang Qing

638
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,820
is also from our Yangliu Town.

639
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,920
I want to join your sect

640
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,550
because he said
I have an exceptional physique

641
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,480
and I'm a martial arts prodigy.

642
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,850
Don't believe me? Feel for yourself.

643
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,860
Miss, Miss Yang.

644
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,800
I believe you.

645
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,200
Since Mr. Yang praised you,

646
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,600
you must be exceptional.

647
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,070
No need to check. Please go right in.

648
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:02,380
[Yunmen]

649
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,660
It's fine, it's fine.

650
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,400
As a proud Jianchuan heir, I've practiced
martial arts since I was a child.

651
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,680
Although our sect has declined,

652
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
my father always says I'm talented.

653
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,440
Yunmen's requirements aren't that high.

654
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,140
I'm sure I can get in.

655
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,270
Miss,

656
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,880
I believe the one who tested you earlier

657
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
was Elder Wang Yuanhao from Yunmen.

658
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,680
He's known to be strict.

659
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,140
Did he give you a hard time?

660
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,750
Such elementary questions,

661
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,310
and he thought he could trip me up?

662
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,380
That's basic knowledge
to all martial artists.

663
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,660
I'm Jiang Yu. And you?

664
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,240
Yang Wangyue.

665
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,580
Look,

666
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,200
that's Mr. Yang Qing, an elder

667
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,930
from Yunmen.

668
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,340
If we're fortunate enough
to become new disciples of the sect,

669
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,000
we must respectfully address him as
"Mr. Yang."

670
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,960
Him?

671
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,690
That's right.

672
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,490
He's so young.

673
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,020
He doesn't even look as old as I am.

674
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,170
Exactly.

675
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,680
He seems a bit too young.

676
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,630
Elder Yang is exceptionally talented,

677
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,000
and his martial skills far surpass
his peers.

678
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
He's the youngest elder in the sect.

679
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,880
Many juniors are actually
older than him now.

680
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,080
You'll get used to it.

681
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,160
Sir, you seem to know a lot about Yunmen.

682
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,240
My name is Yang Wangyue.

683
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,350
May I ask your name?

684
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,880
Su Ming.

685
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
The elder is here.

686
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,440
The final round of testing is complete.

687
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,300
After our elders' deliberation,

688
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,360
you have all passed the test!

689
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,490
We've all passed!

690
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,660
-Greetings, Sect Leader!
-Greetings, Sect Leader!

691
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,940
These are the new disciples
who just joined this year?

692
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,000
They all appear to have good potential.

693
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
Sect Leader Feng.

694
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,590
We meet again.

695
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:05,730
What?

696
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,960
You...

697
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,050
How did you become a fellow disciple?

698
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,740
Who let you pass?

699
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,530
Sect Leader,

700
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,880
Miss Yang's aptitude, talent,
and character

701
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,940
are all excellent.

702
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,470
What's wrong with accepting her?

703
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,000
Her? Excellent?

704
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,370
Do you know how much it cost me

705
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,600
to get her to leave?

706
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,050
What?

707
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,340
She is the village girl

708
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,100
who has bewitched Junior Yang?

709
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,000
Well...

710
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,920
How about

711
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,270
I expel her right now?

712
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,600
Expelling a disciple who has just joined,

713
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,250
in front of them all—

714
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,230
wouldn't that damage our sect's prestige?

715
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,990
Sect Leader, don't worry.

716
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,330
She definitely won't pass

717
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,560
the entrance examination
in a month from now.

718
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,080
Then we'll have every reason to expel her.

719
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,480
Within this month,

720
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,610
if anything happens,

721
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,530
I'll hold you accountable.

722
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,160
Yang Qing,

723
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,260
when were you released?

724
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,310
I'm now a disciple here,

725
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,810
and I can enter and leave the sect openly.

726
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,870
Yang Wangyue,

727
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,310
do you realize what you've done?

728
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,800
You mean today?

729
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,150
You know what?

730
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,750
I just casually showed a few moves,

731
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,200
and the elders were impressed.

732
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,910
I got admitted to the sect so easily.

733
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,780
Aren't I amazing?

734
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,510
Do you know what it means
to be my junior disciple?

735
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,520
Is that what you're worried about?

736
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,410
Isn't it just a form of address?

737
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,080
Why take it so seriously?

738
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,870
Is it really that important?

739
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,340
I need to go now.

740
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,890
Not important?

741
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,580
Then what is important to you?

742
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,530
Yang Qing, what's wrong?

743
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,880
You... You're scaring me
when you act like this.

744
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,350
Wangyue.

745
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,540
I was wrong.

746
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,210
Why are you suddenly calling me
by my name?

747
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,030
Are... are you angry?

748
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,750
Why do you always

749
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,240
act like you don't know anything?

750
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,610
Since the day we returned
from Biluo Valley,

751
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,280
I've checked your horse myself every day,

752
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,560
only letting you ride
after making sure it was safe.

753
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,160
I didn't know that.

754
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,050
I remember your birthday.

755
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,830
Even though it's the wrong one,

756
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,110
I remember it clearly.

757
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,700
But what about you?

758
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,570
Have you ever asked me about my birthday?

759
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,760
I know exactly what foods you like.

760
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,060
But what about you?

761
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,510
During meals,

762
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,990
you always pick what you like for me,

763
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,390
assuming that I like the same things
you do.

764
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,110
But in reality,

765
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,750
you have no idea what I like

766
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,750
or what I dislike!

767
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,030
You need to give me some time. I'm trying.

768
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,980
When we returned here,

769
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,730
I told you that I wanted to marry you.

770
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,170
But what about you?

771
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,790
Did you think I was joking?

772
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,020
Have you ever seriously asked
how I planned to provide for you

773
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,350
or how I planned to
talk to the Sect Leader?

774
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,510
Because I trust you.

775
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,510
No.

776
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,110
You never tell me
what you're really thinking.

777
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,450
Whenever something happens,

778
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,570
you always beat around the bush.

779
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,590
Do you think I'm just someone
easy to manipulate?

780
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,850
What do you take me for?

781
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,020
It's not like that.

782
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,510
I just wanted to go along with
your wishes.

783
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,440
Go along with me?

784
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
So, you've become my junior disciple
in the sect?

785
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,720
What exactly were you thinking?

786
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,460
Your Sect Leader Feng doesn't want me
to hold you back

787
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,260
or pester you,

788
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,550
so he's tried every way to drive me out.

789
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,350
I couldn't bear to part with you.

790
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,640
That's why I came up with this solution.

791
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,880
Yang Qing,

792
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,230
I have to address you as "Mr. Yang" now.

793
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,870
Don't you think it's funny

794
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,710
when I address you like that?

795
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,350
Funny?

796
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,389
I have countless junior disciples.

797
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,550
I can't even remember any of their names!

798
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,670
I can't even remember their faces!

799
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,150
They're the ones who recognize me!

800
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,940
Do you think I care about
having one more junior disciple?

801
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,389
And are you really
an important junior disciple to me?

802
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,030
Yang Qing, what do you mean by that?

803
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,159
Just say what you want to say.
Don't beat around the bush.

804
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,989
Yang Wangyue,

805
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,000
do you realize

806
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,500
you've undone all my efforts?

807
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:39,480
I was in a tug of war
with the Sect Leader,

808
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,150
standing my ground against him.

809
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,150
I was begging him to let me marry you.

810
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,110
And he was about to give in.

811
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,310
You... you really told him
that you want to marry me?

812
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,639
What else did you think?

813
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,030
In just a few more days,

814
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,710
he would have softened.

815
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,800
I haven't eaten a single bite
in five days.

816
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,790
What do you think I was enduring it for?

817
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,130
For you to become my junior disciple?

818
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,420
Wait... you...

00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:11,220

You're heartless.

823
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,140
You know full well that I love you,

824
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,620

You never told me,

830
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,850
so how was I supposed to know?

831
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:28,810
I didn't tell you?

832
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,770

Yang Qing!

850
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:58,790
Yang Qing,

851
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,550
if you don't cooperate with me

852
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,880
and talk to me properly,

853
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,110
I won't marry you.

854
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,100
You think you're some peerless beauty?

855
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,030
You think I'm so eager to marry you?

856
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,320
Qing,

857
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,520
since you've come out,
you must have realized your mistake.

858
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,040
I was reckless.

859
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,880
I shouldn't have defied you, Sect Leader.

860
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,060
Now that you've seen
Yang Wangyue's true colors,

861
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,070
you should come to your senses
and return to the right path.

862
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,090
Wangyue is just a bit willful,

863
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,680
not the "heretical sort" as you claim.

864
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,380
You're still defending her.

865
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,080
Earlier, I had to give her
a large sum of money

866
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,440
just to make her leave.

867
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,620
It's only been a few days,
and she's back again.

868
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,950
She even became a disciple
of our sect now.

869
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,160
But we cannot tolerate
such a money-grubbing,

870
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,690
smooth-talking person.

871
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,740
Since she's passed Senior Wang's trial,

872
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,540
it proves she has her strengths.

873
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,830
You've often said yourself that
we shouldn't judge the whole by a part.

874
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,290
Enough.

875
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,080
I won't waste time
debating over one woman with you,

876
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,290
nor do I care what virtues she has

877
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,420
or how she joined us.

878
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,400
If she doesn't pass
next month's entrance exam,

879
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,880
she must leave.

880
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,000
Also,

881
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,690
you are now Yang Wangyue's senior.

882
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,280
You should mind your boundaries

883
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,080
and keep your feelings in check.

884
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,510
I don't want to hear any gossip.

885
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,040
Otherwise,

886
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,440
I will severely punish both of you.

887
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,180
Yes, Sect Leader.

888
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,280
Regarding the case of missing children
in Yangliu Town,

889
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,760
you said it's related to Biluo Valley.

890
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,790
This matter is indeed related to
Biluo Valley,

891
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,010
but not entirely so.

892
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,600
What do you mean?

893
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,940
Take a look at this.

894
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,170
This is a wanted notice from Biluo Valley.

895
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,690
[Wanted]

896
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,190
Jin Buhuan?

897
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,590
According to their message,

898
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,920
they were also deceived by Jin Buhuan.

899
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,770
Jin Buhuan didn't truly repent.

900
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,890
He only pretended to side with us.

901
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,480
After joining the Biluo Valley,

902
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,620
he abducted children from Yangliu Town

903
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,770
for personal gain.

904
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,440
He also manipulated Biluo Valley disciples

905
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,900
to hunt down Yuan Yingxing

906
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,630
to seize the position
of Shengyue Sect Chief.

907
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,760
What do you think of this?

908
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,830
It must be Chief Lu's excuse.

909
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,190
All four major sects are ashamed

910
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,250
to associate with the Shengyue Sect.

911
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,610
Jin Buhuan was cunning.

912
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,960
Chief Lu's willingness to trust Jin Buhuan

913
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,760
is, in itself, very suspicious.

914
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,010
To atone for this matter,

915
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,720
Chief Lu even brought generous gifts

916
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,190
and personally apologized to
all the other major sects.

917
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,850
After the battle at Mount Yin,

918
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:45,250
Yuan Yingxing escaped
while being escorted to Biluo Valley.

919
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,550
To save face,

920
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,850
Chief Lu kept it under wraps.

921
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,070
Then Jin Buhuan approached him again,

922
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,570
offering to help capture Yuan Yingxing.

923
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,770
And he believed it.

924
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,980
Now that Jin Buhuan is dead,

925
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,340
there's no way to verify anything.

926
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,230
Are you sure he's dead?

927
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,840
In Miyun Forest,

928
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,150
the body thought to be Yuan Yingxing's

929
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,880
should actually be Jin Buhuan.

930
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,240
Then, we can only trust Biluo Valley.

931
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,590
Besides,

932
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,560
they have no motive to abduct children.

933
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,870
But I still think this case is
full of doubts.

934
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,360
If we investigate this matter,

935
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,710
it'll consume
a lot of manpower and resources.

936
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,770
Moreover,

937
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,950
all the abducted children
have returned home,

938
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,430
and the real culprit, Jin Buhuan,
is already dead.

939
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,440
So let this matter end here.

940
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,960
There are still many suspicious aspects
of this case.

941
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,360
Please let me continue the investigation.

942
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,130
Now that the new disciples have joined

943
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,980
and Yuan Yingxing has fled to Mount Yin,

944
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,280
we should focus on

945
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,700
more important matters.

946
00:39:59,010 --> 00:39:59,540
Alright,

947
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:03,220
let's handle this matter as I said.

948
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,880
Yes, Sect Leader.

949
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,880
Mr. Yang!

950
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,030
Mr. Yang.

951
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Mr. Yang.

952
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,480
Mr. Yang.

953
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,670
Mr. Yang.

954
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,380
Thank you for helping me up, Mr. Yang.

955
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,480
Mr. Yang,

956
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,340
the room I'm staying in

957
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,760
has drafty windows and a leaking roof.

958
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,200
Could you please...

959
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,380
It hasn't rained these past few days.

960
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,960
It's raining right now.

961
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,650
Mr. Yang,

962
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,810
could you really bear to let me shiver
in the wind and get soaked in the rain?

963
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,010
Jiang Yan will handle

964
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,250
dormitory repair.

965
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,030
There's no need for me
to do it personally.

966
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,000
How could Jiang Yan enter my boudoir?

967
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,950
You should be the one to fix it, Mr. Yang.

968
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,750
Yang Wangyue,

969
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,640
since you're so eager to join the sect

970
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,900
as my junior disciple,

971
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,150
you should keep your distance from me.

972
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,960
I don't want others

973
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,360
to misunderstand anything between us.

974
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,800
Why...

975
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,110
why are you calling me by my full name?

976
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,550
Since you formally address me,

977
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,320
you should behave
like a proper junior disciple.

978
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,710
I...

979
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,400
From now on,

980
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,220
don't say inappropriate things

981
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,800
or do inappropriate actions.

982
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,600
Junior Yang, do you understand?

983
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,320
I...

984
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,710
Well, well, who do we have here?

985
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,640
Turns out it's just
a newly admitted outer disciple.

986
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,120
What? Still keeping your wicked ways?

987
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,400
Still acting like a witch,
even after joining our Yunmen Sect?

988
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,330
What's it to you?

989
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,840
To me? Naturally, it's no concern.

990
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,840
I just wanted to give you
a friendly reminder.

991
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,570
There will be a trial in a month,

992
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,260
and I'm afraid some people

993
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,610
will have to leave in disgrace by then.

994
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,250
Listen, Lu Xuanxuan,

995
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,890
you're from Biluo Valley,

996
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,190
so why are you here interfering in
our sect's affairs?

997
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,800
Miss Yang,

998
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,810
you mustn't be disrespectful to Senior Lu.

999
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,960
Senior?

1000
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,450
Mr. Yang,

1001
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,180
I've prepared all the herbs

1002
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,980
that the Sect Leader requested.

1003
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,330
You promised to teach me swordsmanship,

1004
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,930
so don't go back on your word.

1005
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,000
You mustn't teach her.

1006
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,280
And you mustn't learn!

1007
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,090
That's not for you to decide.

1008
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,320
You woman...

1009
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,200
Miss Yang, watch your words.

1010
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,780
Miss Lu here is

1011
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,140
the herbalist invited by the Sect Leader.

1012
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,590
If you offend her,

1013
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,590
the Sect Leader won't let you off.

1014
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,920
Yang Qing...

1015
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,680
Miss Lu, let's go to the training ground.

1016
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,710
Whatever techniques you want to learn,

1017
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,570
I'll teach you.

1018
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:30,360
Okay.

1019
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,310
Jiang Yan,

1020
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,590
say that again.

1021
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,960
Lu Xuanxuan is the herbalist
invited by the sect.

1022
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,650
Would Biluo Valley really be so kind?

1023
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,170
I say she surely has ulterior motives.

1024
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,790
Mr. Yang,

1025
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,820
every time Yang Wangyue is around,

1026
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,400
you promise to teach me swordsmanship,

1027
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,480
but as soon as she leaves,

1028
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,280
you make excuses and hurry away.

1029
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,200
You can't make any more excuses today.

1030
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,440
Miss Lu...

1031
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,430
Mr. Yang, if you brush me off again
this time,

1032
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,360
I'll have no choice but to
speak to the Sect Leader about this.

1033
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,150
After all,

1034
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,700
I came here hoping to learn something.

1035
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,440
Last time I saw you perform
a sword technique,

1036
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,960
smooth and flowing,
like a startled dragon or a soaring swan.

1037
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,890
Would you teach me that technique?

1038
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,310
That's called the Suwen Sword Technique.

1039
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:28,840
Alright.

1040
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,050
This sword technique
focuses on spirit, not form.

1041
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,620
Those moves are "Sunset"
and "Lone Wild Goose."

1042
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,030
When practicing, Miss Lu,

1043
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,030
you must pierce the sunset
and point at the lone wild goose.

1044
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,800
If you can master these two moves,

1045
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,620
I'll teach you the rest of the technique.

1046
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,390
Please give me more guidance, Mr. Yang.

1047
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,160
This sword technique

1048
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,010
requires someone
with profound inner strength to execute.

1049
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:30,650
Don't worry
if you can't master it right away,

1050
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,170
Miss Lu.

1051
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,020
I understand.

1052
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,800
Lu Xuanxuan is young

1053
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,710
and has always been pampered.

1054
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,320
She absolutely cannot

1055
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,910
develop such profound inner strength
in a short time.

1056
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:50,790
Unless...

1057
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,430
How was that, Mr. Yang?

1058
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,730
Did I make any mistakes
in my swordplay just now?

1059
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,590
Miss Lu, one of your moves seemed
a bit too forceful.

1060
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,260
Why don't you try it again?

1061
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,000
Alright.

1062
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,370
Mr. Yang,

1063
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,430
I might have exerted myself too much
just now,

1064
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,870
and I'm feeling unwell.

1065
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,800
Perhaps we could continue another day?
