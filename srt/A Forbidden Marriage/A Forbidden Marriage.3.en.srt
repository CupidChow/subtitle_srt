[A Forbidden Marriage]

2
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,920
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,509
[Tianlin Garden]

4
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,070
But you have no evidence.

5
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,950
How can we trust you?

6
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,039
-That's right.
-That's right.

7
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,789
You're certain Shengyue Sect did it

8
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,050
just because of a mark?

9
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,680
The truth is right in front of us.

10
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,110
Besides,

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,250
except Shengyue Sect,

12
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,940
who else would do such an evil thing

13
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,940
as taking kids?

14
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,240
You have made a conclusion
without evidence!

15
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:04,950
Miss Yang.

16
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,730
Why have you been defending Shengyue Sect?

17
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,880
I...

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,680
Mr. Yang.

19
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,200
Mr. Yang.

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,020
Do you think so too?

21
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,950
Shengyue Sect

22
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,690
has never done such an evil thing before,

23
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,480
but now the sect is in chaos,

24
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,530
and we've found many clues here.

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,010
We don't know

26
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,400
if they've changed.

27
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,180
Don't jump to conclusions

28
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,760
before things become clearer.

29
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,870
You investigate it yourselves.
I'm out of it.

30
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,800
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,120
Wherever Shengyue Sect went,

32
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,320
it looked like a locust plague.

33
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,210
Nothing was left.

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,700
Families were separated.

35
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,470
The devastation

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,490
brings tears to those who hear of it
and heartbreak to those who witness it.

37
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,500
Truly terrifying.

38
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,100
Truly despicable.

39
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,760
Ladies and gentlemen,

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,760
if you want to know what happened next,

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,390
I'd appreciate it if you could tip me.

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,840
Thank you.

43
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,579
-Great!
-Great!

44
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,780
A reward from Miss Lu.

45
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,060
-Great!
-Well said!

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,900
Thank you, Miss Lu.

47
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,120
Thank you.

48
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,210
It's just a small gift. It's nothing.

49
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,030
It was indeed a good story,

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,290
but was the truth really like that?

51
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,070
Shengyue Sect wasn't this crazy

52
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,620
when it was destroyed.

53
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,470
Yeah.

54
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,220
I also find it strange.

55
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,020
Was he really talking about Shengyue Sect?

56
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,280
I've lived under Tianyu Palace for years.

57
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,030
It was always in peace

58
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,910
until

59
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,180
recent days.

60
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,910
That's right.

61
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,370
How can it not be the truth?

62
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,780
Shengyue Sect always does evil things.

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
They're even trafficking kids,

64
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,310
causing panic.

65
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,730
Anybody has the right to kill them.

66
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,970
Miss Lu?

67
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,010
Is she the daughter
of Chief Lu from Biluo Valley?

68
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,970
So today,

69
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,550
there's a noble lady here.

70
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,670
Have you ever seen Shengyue Sect

71
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,579
trafficking children with your own eyes?

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,040
The dragon flies through the abyss
and the phoenix flies in the sky.

73
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,370
Dung beetles always wander in the toilet.

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,740
I don't have to see it with my own eyes.

75
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,710
Who are you calling a dung beetle?

76
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,760
In the martial world, Shengyue Sect

77
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,820
has long been condemned by everyone.

78
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,470
Every righteous sect

79
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,290
sees it as a thorn in their eyes.

80
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,800
You are just

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
a countrywoman.

82
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,800
Why ruin your good mood

83
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,340
for some unrelated despicable people?

84
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,720
What right does Biluo Valley has to be

85
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,210
the representative of the righteous sects?

86
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,950
Have Yunmen, Qingcheng, and Cangtong

87
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,210
agreed?

88
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,950
Or...

89
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,360
does Biluo Valley want to be

90
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,710
the alliance leader of all the sects?

91
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,260
Right.

92
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,000
Who gave Biluo Valley

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,660
the right to make a statement?

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,260
If you've got time to brag in this tavern,

95
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,720
why don't you

96
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,990
show your ability
at the martial arts contest?

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,680
-Yeah.
-That's right.

98
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,560
Who on earth are you?

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,090
It's none of your business.

100
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,070
They're about to fight. This...

101
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,740
Is this really necessary?

102
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,470
You countrywoman, who are you?

103
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,140
How dare you be so rude to me!

104
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,409
Who is it?

105
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,550
Yang Qing.

106
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,330
Mr... Mr. Yang.

107
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,520
Mr. Yang.

108
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,310
Why are you here?

109
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,050
I'm just passing by.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,120
Passing by?

111
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,500
You must be joking.

112
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,830
I'm dealing with

113
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,360
an ignorant countrywoman.

114
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,310
Wait a sec.

115
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,190
Wait.

116
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,960
Did you cause trouble again?

117
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,650
I didn't. She wanted to kill me.

118
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,330
I...

119
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,510
I just wanted to reason with her.

120
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,270
Since it's a misunderstanding,

121
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,240
I'll take her with me.

122
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,600
Hold on.

123
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,010
Mr. Yang.

124
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,560
She spread rumors about Biluo Valley
in public.

125
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,220
I'm afraid it's not appropriate for you

126
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,040
to take her away just like this.

127
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,070
Everybody,

128
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,920
did she insult Biluo Valley?

129
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,270
Although she was rude,

130
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,630
she was quite reasonable.

131
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,680
In that case,

132
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,790
Miss Lu, we should get going.

133
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,890
Goodbye.

134
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,020
Come on, let's continue to drink.

135
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,850
Have a seat.

136
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,460
Come on. Let's continue.

137
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,270
Back to where we were.

138
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,120
Shengyue Sect

139
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,560
was proved to be a cult long ago.

140
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,090
These years,

141
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,870
they've done all the evil things.

142
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,270
Yao Fu finally showed up.

143
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,950
She made a great contribution,

144
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,360
but she's still hiding.

145
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,480
Is it... because of Yuan Yingxing?

146
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,190
Father, I finally avenged you.

147
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,060
Shengyue Sect no longer exists
in the martial world.

148
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,120
I will leave Yunmen forever

149
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,680
and make the Fusheng Spell widely known.

150
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,040
Rest in peace.

151
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,750
It's just that I don't know

152
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,270
when I can come back to see you again.

153
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,100
You won't blame me, will you?

154
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,020
Junior, don't go.

155
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,950
Senior Bai?

156
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,880
I didn't expect you to remember me.

157
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,080
I have something important to tell you.

158
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,560
I don't believe

159
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,680
you would be so kind.

160
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,140
Why didn't you save my father
when he was killed?

161
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,970
Junior,

162
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,720
let me finish.

163
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,680
Just forget about Master,

164
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,900
and stop practicing the Fusheng Spell.

165
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,840
What do you mean? Say it clearly.

166
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,330
The reason for Master's death
is not what you think.

167
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,330
He was seriously ill before he was killed.

168
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,490
No one could cure him.

169
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,610
Practicing the Fusheng Spell

170
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,470
was the real reason for his death.

171
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,510
If you don't stop,

172
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,520
your life will be in danger like Master's.

173
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,610
You could be disabled, paralyzed,

174
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,590
or even dead.

175
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,220
How could you say that?

176
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,370
Though you are my father's only disciple,

177
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,770
you can't talk nonsense.

178
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,710
My father treasured
the Fusheng Spell very much.

179
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,930
If it'll really cause a backlash

180
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,200
on whoever practices it like you said,

181
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,270
why would my father
practice it voluntarily?

182
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,230
I saw Shengyue Sect
go after my father back then.

183
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,820
How do you explain that?

184
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,280
Because Master wanted
to steal the Shengyue Token.

185
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,600
I couldn't stop him.

186
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,770
Junior, anyway...

187
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,630
the only thing I can do now

188
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,250
is to stop you
from practicing the Fusheng Spell

189
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,670
and fulfill Master's last wish

190
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,700
by stealing the Shengyue Token.

191
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,570
Why would my father

192
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,120
want that thing from Shengyue Sect?

193
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,650
You have to explain it to me.

194
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,730
Alright, let me tell you.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,510
Master lost his mind back then because he

196
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,840
was obsessed with the Fusheng Spell.

197
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,870
Evil thoughts were all over his head.

198
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,360
I don't know where he learned

199
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,870
that the Shengyue Token
could expel evil thoughts,

200
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,040
so he tried everything he could to get it.

201
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,490
But unexpectedly, he died because of it.

202
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,570
You also noticed

203
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,670
Master would act weirdly sometimes.

204
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,910
So, I must stop you.

205
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,200
Stop practicing.

206
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,460
You're not lying to me?

207
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,880
Why don't you believe me?

208
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,670
I'm really worried about you.

209
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,000
Just listen to me.

210
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,050
You've been practicing
the Fusheng Spell in secret for years.

211
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,610
Do you feel anything wrong?

212
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,870
It'll be a bit difficult

213
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,150
when I do martial arts.

214
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,150
Is that a problem?

215
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,480
Of course.

216
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,920
This is bad.

217
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,760
Master had the same symptom
before he died.

218
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,210
Go on.

219
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,620
The Fusheng Spell

220
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,440
can easily

221
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,840
control others' minds,

222
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,070
but the pros and cons balance out.

223
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,120
It also causes a backlash on the practicer

224
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,870
until it drains all the internal energy.

225
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,480
When the symptom first appeared on Master,

226
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,840
I tried to stop him.

227
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,080
But he firmly believed
he could overcome the backlash

228
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,940
and even kicked me out of the sect.

229
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,010
Although I had to leave,

230
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,550
I was still worried about you and Master.

231
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,560
I've been looking for you all these years.

232
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,650
Junior, just trust me.

233
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,940
Actually, Master was right.

234
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,030
The power of the Shengyue Token
can indeed help suppress evil thoughts.

235
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,240
Besides, the Sun Blade in Yunmen

236
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,880
is also needed.

237
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,240
The combination of the two
can expel evil thoughts.

238
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,440
I've said everything I need to say.

239
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,360
Let me help you.

240
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,240
Okay?

241
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,260
How can we combine the Shengyue Token
and the Sun Blade?

242
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,080
I don't understand what you said.

243
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,910
How can I believe that you will help me?

244
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,840
Forget it. Mind your own business.

245
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,270
Senior, don't follow me secretly.

246
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,330
Junior, I'll always
be by your side this time.

247
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,020
[Tianlin Garden]

248
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,840
Yang Qing.

249
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,480
Thank you for today.

250
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,750
But how did you know I was there?

251
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,250
Did you...

252
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,510
go there for me?

253
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,550
You saved me so many times.

254
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,550
When will you ask me

255
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,640
to marry you

256
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,870
as a reward of saving my life?

257
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,390
In that case,

258
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,070
I won't save you anymore.

259
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,150
It's fine.

260
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,610
If you don't save me,

261
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,410
next time,

262
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,670
I'll save you.

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,030
Take a sip.

264
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,270
Just one sip.

265
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,960
It's impossible I show up right in time

266
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,890
every time.

267
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,270
Are you... Are you worried about me?

268
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,490
Why are you looking at me like that?

269
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,650
You look like...

270
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,640
an old friend of mine.

271
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,330
An old friend?

272
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,610
In this world,

273
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
who has the nerve to look like me?

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,660
You have a bad temper like her.

275
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,120
Both of you are willful.

276
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,240
Don't think of other women

277
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,150
when you're with me.

278
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,910
Thank you for what you did today.

279
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,870

00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,320
Mr. Yang.

319
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,670
Miss Yang is not here?

320
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,420
You really care about her.

321
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,600
Well, no…

322
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,319
Today, we heard at the door

323
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,109
that Master Chen
brought a bunch of vicious men

324
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,109
and took her away.

325
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,790
We went to her room.

326
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,700
No one was there.

327
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,430
Vicious men?

328
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,720
We went out today.

329
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,780
After we came back,
we heard from the neighbors

330
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,579
that a group of vicious men came.

331
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,520
They asked if they were our friends.

332
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,240
Then we went to Miss Yang's room

333
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,200
and found that she was not there.

334
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,329
Also, there was some blood at the door.

335
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,460
Mr. Yang.

336
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:26,760
Follow him.

337
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,619
Okay. Let's go.

338
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,040
You bitch.

339
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,870
You burned my house.

340
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,100
You ran away after burning my house.

341
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,780
I went out to deliver goods these days.

342
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,830
Do you really think
I can do nothing about you?

343
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,950
Master Chen, why are you so angry?

344
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,310
I'm just a nobody.

345
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,160
Is it worth it?

346
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,240
Bah!

347
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,430
I'm angry just thinking about it.

348
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,320
You guys, beat her to death!

349
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,010
-Yes!
-Yes!

350
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,170
-Master!
-Master!

351
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,740
The blade... isn't sharp?

352
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,730
I'm not dead?

353
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,170
I'm not dead.

354
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,350
Don't move!

355
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,100
Hurry up! Her blade is not sharp.
It can't kill me.

356
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,920
Help me!

357
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,160
I can't kill you?

358
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,520
Don't court death.

359
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,480
Get up!

360
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,440
Okay.

361
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,750
Take it easy.

362
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,950
Take it easy.

363
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,790
Take it easy.

364
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,590
Out of the way!

365
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,960
Step back!

366
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,450
Don't move!

367
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,580
Back off!

368
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,740
Don't come any closer!

369
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,880
You witch!

370
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,520
Let him go!

371
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,690
What are you waiting for?

372
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,340
Kill her!

373
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,990
Kill her!

374
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,590

to deliver it along the official roads

563
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,550
starts conflict with Shengyue Sect first,

564
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,240
we might be

565
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,160
taken advantage of
by those with ulterior motives.

566
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,960
Don't act rashly
and stir up unnecessary trouble.

567
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,460
Mr. Yang, I understand.

568
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,090
Shameless witch.

569
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,400
Yunmen is no place for your insolence.

570
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,550
You old man.

571
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,440
I didn't even step through Yunmen's gate.

572
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,070
What?

573
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,720
Only those of Yunmen

574
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,390
are allowed to linger here?

575
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,920
Shameless!

576
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,240
Ask Yang Qing to come out.

577
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,400
I have something to tell him.

578
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,090
Dream on.

579
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,640
Qing will never see you.

580
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,510
Qing, why are you here?

581
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,290
The gossip about the two of you

582
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,420
is already all over the martial world.

583
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,140
Seeing her now

584
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,350
will only give people
another reason to gossip about Yunmen.

585
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,200
I've been in seclusion for half a year,

586
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,030
but the rumors

587
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,080
seem to have grown even wilder,

588
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,350
as if I've colluded with her,

589
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,440
ready to elope at any moment

590
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,500
and bring Yunmen down in the process.

591
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,680
Avoiding it won't solve anything.

592
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,850
But the people of Shengyue Sect

593
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,600
are always cunning.

594
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,880
If you see her,

595
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,850
who knows what kind of story
they'll make up?

596
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,480
The martial world is in turmoil now.

597
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,730
If Yunmen associates with Shengyue Sect,

598
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,330
what will others think?

599
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,080
This started because of me.

600
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,040
Let me explain everything to her.

601
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:12,990
Yang Qing.

602
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,170
You're finally willing to see me.

603
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,770
Don't come to me again.

604
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,510
There is a line between good and evil.

605
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,350
I can't respond to your feelings.

606
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,120
From now on, I won't entangle myself
with the righteous sects,

607
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,270
and I won't stand against Yunmen.

608
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,440
Is that still not enough?

609
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,840
You can change yourself,

610
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,760
but can you change everyone else?

611
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,110
Will the whole Shengyue Sect

612
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,310
change for your sake?

613
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,550
Miss Wang Yue,

614
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,570
don't come to me again.

615
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,100
Yang Qing!

616
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,410
Maybe I can never have you,

617
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,400
but I'll follow you forever!

618
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,560
You never learn.

619
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,210
You haven't changed at all.

620
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:02,410
[Tianlin Garden]

621
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,510
Mr. Yang.

622
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,400
According to what Master Chen said,

623
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,770
Shang Huai has led the juniors

624
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,300
all the way to Qinglai City.

625
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,160
But...

626
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,660
they didn't find any so-called contact.

627
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,880
If my guess is right,
what happened yesterday

628
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,270
has alerted them.

629
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,430
Even if there were clues,

630
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,390
they've already been wiped clean.

631
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,770
This matter requires careful planning.

632
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,720
Should we tell Miss Yang?

633
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,520
Mr. Yang, Ms. Yao is back.

634
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,800
Ms. Yao, you're finally back.

635
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,020
Ms. Yao, are you going back
to Yunmen with us this time?

636
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,130
-Great.
-Yeah.

637
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,090
That's great.

638
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,750
Ms. Yao, with you going back with us,

639
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,650
we'll have completed most of our mission.

640
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,930
-Yeah.
-Yes, Ms. Yao.

641
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,960
Thank you for coming to look for me.

642
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,560
Miss Yang.

643
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,590
This must be Miss Yao.

644
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,320
Ms. Yao.

645
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,170
This is Miss Yang,

646
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,860
who was almost taken
as a concubine by Master Chen

647
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,110
but saved by us.

648
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,940
Nice to meet you.

649
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,060
What are you doing?

650
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,440
Do you know who she is?

651
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:34,970
She is...

652
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,350
Jiang Yan.

653
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,480
Take Ms. Yao back to her room.

654
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,910
Come with me.

655
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,840
Miss Yang,

656
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,550
you shouldn't have made
that kind of joke with Junior Yao

657
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,060
at your first meeting.

658
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,340
You seem to know her quite well.

659
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,340
You acted without saying anything.

660
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,240
I'm very disappointed in you.

661
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,040
What's your relationship with me?

662
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,100
Do I need to report everything to you?

663
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:13,830
You know

664
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,270
I'm from Yunmen.

665
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,680
She's my junior.

666
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,500
Yes.

667
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,070
She's your junior.

668
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,390
Of course you're on her side.

669
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:20,990
Unlike me,

670
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,550
I'm alone and heartless.

671
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,000
I wouldn't throw myself
into someone's arms crying for pity.

672
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,610
So I deserve to be bullied, is that it?

673
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,410
Yang Wangyue!

674
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,550
You should at least explain to me

675
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,810
why you did that to her!

676
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Just one reason you can say out loud.

677
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,290
She stole my man.

678
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,410
Does that count?

679
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,900
Junior, how have you been lately?

680
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,200
Did you feel anything strange
when you fought just now?

681
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,930
Why are you following me again?

682
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,800
I specially came here to help you.

683
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,960
Do you know how hard it's been
for me to find you?

684
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,450
I will find out the truth.

685
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,160
Senior, don't worry about it.

686
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,880
Junior,

687
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,110
why are you so stubborn?

688
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,440
If we wait any longer, it'll be too late.

689
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,110
You think

690
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,040
what I told you is nonsense, right?

691
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,550
Now I'm telling you—
the Shengyue Token is the Moon Blade.

692
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,719
It took me a lot of effort to find it out.

693
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,480
Yunmen lost the Moon Blade after it took
over the Alliance Leader's Token.

694
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,030
The Moon Blade ended up
in the hands of Shengyue Sect.

695
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,070
Although they had never seen
the Alliance Leader's Token,

696
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,590
they could tell it was something special.

697
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,230
So they started using it as a token.

698
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,920
I've explained everything to you already.

699
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,030
Don't waste your time
on the investigation.

700
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,630
Just go find
the Sun Blade and Moon Blade, okay?

701
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:28,590
Got it.

702
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,080
Give me some time to think about it.

703
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,590
I'll go hide.

704
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,850
Come in.

705
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,610
Ms. Yao?

706
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,460
Ms. Yao, you are finally back.

707
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,110
You disappeared

708
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,250
after the fight with Shengyue Sect.

709
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,179
Where did you go?

710
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,710
We were worried about you.

711
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,960
I... got hurt.

712
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,080
A family
at the foot of the mountain took me in.

713
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,340
I've fully recovered now, so I came back.

714
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
That's good then.

715
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,630
Jiang Yan, go out.

716
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,980
Protect Miss Yang.

717
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,710
Okay.

718
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,840
Back then, I was against your decision

719
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,210
to go undercover in Shengyue Sect.

720
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,370
On the day the four major sects
attacked Shengyue Sect,

721
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,440
what exactly happened in the sect?

722
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,960
And how involved

723
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,490
were you in all of it?

724
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,450
I had an agreement
with Biluo Valley long ago—

725
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,360
to work together
to wipe out Shengyue Sect that day.

726
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,890
That witch suddenly charged in
and fought me.

727
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,260
So naturally, I wouldn't let her go.

728
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,480
As for the rest,

729
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,010
I know nothing.

730
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,250
So,

731
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,630
you killed her?

732
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,400
What's wrong with

733
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,400
killing the evil and upholding justice?

734
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,220
Then why did you

735
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,710
hurt Miss Yang today?

736
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,260
Miss Yang?

737
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,720
Haven't you already guessed it?

738
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,060
She's the Saintess of Shengyue Sect.

739
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,560
Saintess of Shengyue Sect?

740
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,070
Didn't you just say

741
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,520
you already killed her?

742
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,120
She did fall off the cliff that day.

743
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,200
But I was unlucky.

744
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,900
I couldn't finish her off completely.

745
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,360
How can you be sure

746
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,900
she is the Saintess of Shengyue Sect?

747
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
When Saintess went out,

748
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,140
she always wore a veil.

749
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,610
No one has ever seen her face.

750
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,060
I spent a long time

751
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,120
in Shengyue Sect,

752
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,200
living side by side with her.

753
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,430
I have my ways of recognizing her.

754
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,110
So

755
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,190
you have no solid evidence.

756
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:52,840
Besides,

757
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,760
Shengyue Sect has already fallen apart.

758
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,000
Whether she is or isn't,

759
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,300
what difference does it make now?

760
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,660
Why must you kill her?

761
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,320
Senior,

762
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,530
she tried to hurt me first.

763
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,100
I have no intention to kill her now.

764
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,420
Your strike just now

765
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,310
was hardly a defensive move.

766
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,480
If I hadn't arrived in time,

767
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,370
Yang Wangyue would have died.

768
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,020
You overstated it.

769
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,630
Now, I don't want to have anything

770
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,030
to do with Shengyue Sect.

771
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,200
I can promise you this—

772
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,400
as long as she
doesn't come after me again like today,

773
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,260
I will act as if she doesn't exist,

774
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,020
whether she's Wang Yue

775
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,790
or Yang Wangyue.

776
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,030
That'd be great.

777
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,120
Miss Yang!

778
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,080
Miss Yang, where are you going?

779
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,490
It's none of your business.

780
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,190
Miss Yang.

781
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
You're a girl.

782
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,450
It's not safe to go out alone.

783
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:51,990
Where are you going?

784
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,650
Let Mr. Yang go with you, okay?

785
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,260
Don't mention him in front of me.

786
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,590
Miss Yang, I understand why you're upset.

787
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,070
But it's your fault

788
00:37:59,090 --> 00:37:59,970
that you fought Ms. Yao.

789
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:00,930
What do you know?

790
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,790
I do know.

791
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,730
You did that

792
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,500
because Ms. Yao is Mr. Yang's fiancée,

793
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,210
right?

794
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,850
What?

795
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,570
Even without this engagement,

796
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,670
back when we were in Yunmen,

797
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,340
everyone thought Ms. Yao and Mr. Yang

798
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,180
were a perfect match.

799
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,980
Wait a minute.

800
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,080
The perfect girl
Shang Huai mentioned last time

801
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,120
was Yao Fu?

802
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,030
Miss Yang, actually,

803
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,000
it's not what you think between them.

804
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,230
Don't worry about that.

805
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,030
I've decided.

806
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,200
From today onwards,

807
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,290
I'm going to be the wicked woman
who steals Yang Qing from Yao Fu.

808
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,540
This is a lot.
Give me a moment to process.

809
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,600
Stop following me.

810
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,520
Miss Yang,

811
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,630
Mr. Yang asked me to follow you.

812
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,560
I will follow you

813
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,450
wherever you go today.

814
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,650
Who said I'm leaving?

815
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,670
I just want to go out to be alone.

816
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,490
Besides,

817
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,840
if I leave,

818
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,730
wouldn't that be
exactly what Yao Fu wants?

819
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,150
I have something important to do.

820
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,060
Something important?

821
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,730
Jiang Yan.

822
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,760
Mr. Yang.

823
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,020
We're leaving for Shuntian City tomorrow.

824
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,900
Shuntian City?

825
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:57,670
But...

826
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,360
But what?

827
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,520
Tell everyone

828
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,410
to pack their things.

829
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,340
Okay, Mr. Yang.

830
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,480
I swear I will

831
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,190
take revenge.

832
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,680
But if I do it now,

833
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,820
what would Yang Qing think of me?

834
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,340
Yao Fu,

835
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,540
just you wait.

836
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,500
Once I win Yang Qing's heart
and get the Sun Blade,

837
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,320
I will make you pay with your blood.

838
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,880
Jiang Yan?

839
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,030
Miss Yang?

840
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,030
What are you looking at?

841
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,630
Miss Yang, give it back to me.

842
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,940
It's a map of the surrounding area?

843
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,070
Still thinking about the missing kids?

844
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,800
Yes.

845
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,170
Following the road down from Yangliu Town,

846
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,580
there are Qinglai City,

847
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,550
Lancang Town,

848
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,640
Shuntian City, and Qingluan County.

849
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,180
The official roads lead to everywhere.

850
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,060
Who knows

851
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,750
where they took the children?

852
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,500
The most despicable thing in this world

853
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,150
is taking someone's child.

854
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,100
There are levels for sins?

855
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:23,980
Of course.

856
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,630
Those children
are their parents' cherished ones.

857
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,090
They're related by blood.

858
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,290
If the parents can't find their children,

859
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,690
it'd be worse than death.

860
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,650
Stealing a child
is no different from murder.

861
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,170
So,

862
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,770
the greatest hatred

863
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,670
lies in having one's father killed
and taking someone's child.

864
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,070
Then what's the second greatest hatred?

865
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,970
The second?

866
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,870
The second greatest hatred...

867
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,640
is stealing someone's love of course!

868
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,950
Stealing someone's love?

869
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,430
Yes.

870
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,550
For example, I like Yang Qing.

871
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,280
But Yao Fu insists on butting in

872
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,560
and taking him from me.

873
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,410
But...

874
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,920
Ms. Yao

875
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,440
knew Mr. Yang first.

876
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,060
That's not important.

877
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,280
What matters is love.

878
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,760
You're right.

879
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,540
Mr. Yang has never said

880
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,540
he likes Ms. Yao.

881
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,130
But today, he yelled at me for Yao Fu.

882
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,250
So you're angry,

883
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,610
planning to leave today?

884
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,870
That's not important.

885
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,010
What's important is

886
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,630
Yang Qing doesn't care about me at all.

887
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,460
Miss Yang,

888
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,220
you misunderstood him.

889
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,480
After you left,

890
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,830
Mr. Yang went to Ms. Yao with a long face.

891
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,110
He also asked me to take care of you.

892
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:27,670
Besides,

893
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,670
when Master Chen kidnapped you,

894
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,000
I had never seen

895
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,930
Mr. Yang so worried before.

896
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,030
Really?

897
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:36,980
I knew it.

898
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,250
Deep down, he must care about me.

899
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,230
Could it be... he's fallen for me?

900
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,400
Forget it.

901
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,610
Forget what I said.

902
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,950
[Tianlin Garden]

903
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:02,930
Mr. Yang.

904
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,370
Are we really leaving like this?

905
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,300
What about Miss Yang?

906
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,240
I've arranged everything.

907
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,460
The district leader will send someone here

908
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,070
to take care of Miss Yang.

909
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,160
Well, but…

910
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,800
But what?

911
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:20,890
Jiang Yan.

912
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,000
Stop nagging.

913
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,800
Our priority is to complete

914
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,660
the task assigned by Sect Leader.

915
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,400
Let's go.

916
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,080
Let's go.

917
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,160
[Qinglai City]

918
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,280
Give us some food.

919
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,230
Please.

920
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,030
Please give us some food.

921
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,000
Please.

922
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,880
Please give us some food.

923
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,590
We haven't eaten for days.

924
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,590
We're starving.

925
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,070
Please give us some food.

00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,400
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

927
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,540
It was Shengyue Sect who helped us.

928
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,920
Now Saintess is dead,

929
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,070
and Chief is missing.

930
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,330
No one cares about us.

931
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,590
We had relied
on Shengyue Sect all these years.

932
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,930
Otherwise,
we would have starved to death long ago.

933
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,800
Thank you, sir.

934
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Thank you so much.

935
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,440
We're so lucky.

936
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,670
We've met a good man.

937
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,300
Mr. Yang.

938
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:06,920
This is great.

939
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:07,550
Um…

940
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,130
Could we be wrong?

941
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,870
It seems Shengyue Sect is not that evil.

942
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,420
These ordinary people

943
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,970
don't care about the grudges
between us and Shengyue Sect.

944
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,200
They take the side

945
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,300
of whoever gives them food.

946
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,380
Jiang Yan, don't think too much.

947
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,070
Let's go.

948
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:53,570
Yang Qing.
