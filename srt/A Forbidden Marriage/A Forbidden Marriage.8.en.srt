[A Forbidden Marriage]

2
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,880
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,360
Miss Yang?

4
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,750
Miss Yang!

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,460
You fell into the trap too?

6
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,060
Here.

7
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,210
This place is very strange.

8
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,240
It is.

9
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,670
They even set a trap.

10
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,470
A fortress hidden deep in the mountains,

11
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,520
rarely visited—

12
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
yet they placed such a complex

13
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,310
Seven Killings Formation at the entrance.

14
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,190
Plus, Tong said

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,910
in the forest we passed through yesterday—

16
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,840
which is the exit of this fortress—

17
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,280
someone injured a boy and took him away.

18
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,400
I think

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
the missing children

20
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,220
are being held somewhere in this fortress.

21
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,180
Why didn't Tong tell me about that?

22
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,870
She did mention it to you.

23
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,400
But she was too frightened,

24
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,840
and thought that person was a monster.

25
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,570
I thought she was just talking nonsense.

26
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,380
Mr. Yang.

27
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,450
You just said that strange formation

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,650
is called the Seven Killings Formation?

29
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,450
That's right.

30
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,750
The thorny vines you cut through just now—

31
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,430
that was the entrance to the formation.

32
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,140
You could have avoided capture.

33
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,220
Why did you fall into the trap with us?

34
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,190
The Seven Killings Formation
is interconnected.

35
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,560
Since they set a trap

36
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,910
and took us here,

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,420
it shows they don't intend to kill us.

38
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,480
They'll send someone here to investigate.

39
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,520
If we capture that person,

40
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,430
we may uncover the fortress's secrets

41
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,520
without shedding a drop of blood.

42
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,810
I don't care.

43
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,400
I think you fell into the trap
because of me,

44
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
not because of some investigation.

45
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,410
As long as that makes you happy,
Miss Yang.

46
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,360
I'm going to check out
the situation in the fortress.

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,000
Anyone who trespasses into Qingmu Fortress

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,460
should be killed on sight.

49
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,130
We already took them down,

50
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,390
yet the chief spared their lives.

51
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,000
Who are you
to question the chief's decisions?

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,350
We just follow orders.

53
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:55,960
Right?

54
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,070
How's the preparation going?

55
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,870
Miss Lin,

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,660
the medicine is almost ready.

57
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,440
By the way, Miss Lin.

58
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,160
can my juniors

59
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,840
stop taking their medicine?

60
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,060
Today is the last day.

61
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,460
After this dose, even if you beg,

62
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,290
I won't give you any more.

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,270
But honestly,

64
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,040
you people from Yunmen

65
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,700
really do have strong bodies.

66
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,930
All the residual poison is gone.

67
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,270
Of course.

68
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,630
If you're interested, Miss Lin,

69
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,830
I can teach you a couple of techniques.

70
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,990
They can strengthen the body

71
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,990
and calm the mind.

72
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,240
No need.

73
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,640
Senior Jiang.

74
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,460
What's wrong?

75
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,670
Someone saw members of Shengyue Sect

76
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,930
near Qingmu Fortress.

77
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,120
According to the description,

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,900
the ones fighting them

79
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,700
should be Mr. Yang and Miss Yang.

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,120
Gather all the disciples
who weren't poisoned.

81
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
Come with me to the back hills
of the Qinglai River

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,070
to help Mr. Yang eliminate
Shengyue Sect's remnants.

83
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,390
Yes.

84
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,540
Miss Lin, the medicine...

85
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,050
Just go.

86
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,650
I'm leaving then.

87
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,910
Mingyang,

88
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,050
that useless fool who ruins everything.

89
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,160
Si, you stay in the woodshed

90
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,290
and don't alert them.

91
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:28,690
But...

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,140
Miss Yang, take me with you.

93
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,900
I can at least be of some help.

94
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,490
This is the Skylark Whistle.

95
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,980
If we don't come out in four hours,

96
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,970
blow this whistle.

97
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,300
Yunmen's disciples will come to help you.

98
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,700
Do I need Yunmen's disciples to save me?

99
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Be careful.

100
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,510
Don't you find it strange?

101
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,470
What kind of fortress

102
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,360
has six watchtowers
on the four cardinal points?

103
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,070
Each tower is patrolled by three guards,

104
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,070
switching shifts every 15 minutes.

105
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,070
The Zhen position
has drums to relay signals.

106
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,360
The Gen position has swamps—
traps everywhere.

107
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,870
Such a well-organized setup

108
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,730
clearly belongs to
someone from the martial world.

109
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,020
No matter how heavily guarded
a fortress is,

110
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,310
as long as people live in it,

111
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,770
there will always be flaws

112
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,280
in their daily routines.

113
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,330
Come with me.

114
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,550
Madam.

115
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,190
San is sick today,

116
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,970
so I'm here to cover his shift.

117
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,050
I was wondering where he had run off to.

118
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,600
You two, go clean the fish in the kitchen.

119
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,520
Okay.

120
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,560
Thank you.

121
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:09,950
Okay.

122
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,700
Cui, Chunhua,

123
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,170
take these two meals

124
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,920
to the chief and the honored guest.

125
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,010
Don't mix them up.

126
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,920
Yes.

127
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,380
Let's go.

128
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,970
It's rice bran.

129
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,840
The meals cooking in the kitchen
are divided into three classes.

130
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,940
The first-class ones are refined,

131
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,140
like the one outside.

132
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,960
The second-class ones are plain rations,
enough to fill the stomach.

133
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,820
The third-class ones are rice bran
and rotten leaves, barely edible.

134
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,790
Could it be they kept others here before?

135
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,070
Those children who were taken.

136
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,010
Who's inside?

137
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,520
If you don't come out,

138
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,390
I'll shoot arrows!

139
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,000
Chief!

140
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,110
Chief.

141
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,960
The three people we brought back
have all escaped!

142
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,850
The dark-faced one

143
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,090
is fighting outside now.

144
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,540
What?

145
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,060
Go with me to take a look!

146
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,490
Yes!

147
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,150
Let's go.

148
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,370
Let's go.

149
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,590
Let's go.

150
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,560
The Skylark Whistle?

151
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,690
That's Yunmen's signal.

152
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,070
They've lured Yunmen's people here?

153
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,120
Young Chief, let's leave together.

154
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,200
Leave together?

155
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,030
And get caught together?

156
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,960
It's hard to get in
or out of Qingmu Fortress.

157
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,150
If Yunmen's people block us at the gate,

158
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,480
they would immediately know

159
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,740
we are the true owner of Qingmu Fortress.

160
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,440
No.

161
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,000
I must not let them find out

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,460
that I'm involved in this.

163
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,970
Let me think.

164
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,090
What should I do now?

165
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,580
What happened?

166
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,150
Nothing.

167
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,240
Just a few guards.

168
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,570
I've taken care of them.

169
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,260
The figure...

170
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,150
Don't be afraid.

171
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,750
It doesn't look like a child.

172
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,680
Miss Lu?

173
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,430
Mr. Yang.

174
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,030
Miss Lu, why are you here?

175
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,220
It was him.

176
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,060
He's the one who kidnapped me.

177
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,670
And he said if I wanted to live,

178
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,440
my father would have to pay a ransom.

179
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,100
Miss Lu, you must be mistaken.

180
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,240
He's been with us the whole time.

181
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,550
How could he possibly kidnap you?

182
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,880
What exactly happened?

183
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,220
That day,

184
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,070
I heard Miss Yang say

185
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,590
if Fire Hall Master could be lured away,

186
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,320
you'd be able to escape safely.

187
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,910
I thought although

188
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm no match for Shengyue Sect's men,

189
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,580
it wouldn't be hard for me
to lure him away.

190
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,480
So,

191
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,480
I took it upon myself to help you.

192
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,410
Unexpectedly,

193
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,890
I was attacked before I could go far.

194
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,920
When I woke up,

195
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,640
I was locked up here and tortured.

196
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,880
I've never made any enemies in my life.

197
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,960
Except Shengyue Sect,
I can't think of anyone else

198
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,270
who would do this to me.

199
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,510
That's nonsense!

200
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,670
How dare you falsely accuse us?

201
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,070
Then who else could it be?

202
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,120
Never in my life
have I been so humiliated!

203
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,120
Once I find out who did this,

204
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,580
I'll tear him into pieces!

205
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,750
Miss Lu is emotional
and said it out of anger.

206
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,010
Don't take it to heart.

207
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,190
There are still a few rooms outside
we haven't checked.

208
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,520
You and Miss Yang
go see if anyone's there.

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,530
Let's go.

210
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,710
Protect Miss Yang.

211
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,890
Miss Lu,

212
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,570
are you the only one here?

213
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm not sure.

214
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,580
They drugged my food

215
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,580
and water.

216
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,380
Sometimes I was unconscious for hours.

217
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,030
Sometimes for a whole day.

218
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,340
I have no idea what happened outside.

219
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,440
Mr. Yang, I'm so scared.

220
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,720
I want to go home.

221
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,020
Don't be afraid, Miss Lu.

222
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,750
We'll take you home right away.

223
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,910
Yang Qing, come here now.

224
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,050
Rest here for a moment.

225
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,350
I'll be right back.

226
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,220
Don't leave me alone. I'm scared.

227
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,240
Don't be afraid, Miss Lu.

228
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,480
You're safe now.

229
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,130
Mr. Yang, don't go!

230
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,900
I'm scared.

231
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,150
It's alright now.

232
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,690
The goods should have been
sent out safely by now.

233
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,600
Yang Qing, come and take a look!

234
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,030
Mr. Yang, look.

235
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,730
There are wheel tracks here.

236
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,710
They've already gone far.

237
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,570
You stay here. I'll go after them.

238
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,510
I'll go with you.

239
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,510
You stay here and protect Miss Yang.

240
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,630
Mingyang.

241
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,340
Excuse me, sir.

242
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,410
We're lost in this bamboo forest.

243
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,750
Could you help us find our way out?

244
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,880
We're in a hurry.

245
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,020
Help!

246
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,460
Shang Huai, go save them!

247
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,870
Tell me, who sent you?

248
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,830
Qingmu Fortress's men would rather die
than betray our master!

249
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,100
Tell us now!

250
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,650
Why did you kidnap those innocent kids?

251
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,550
Miss Lu.

252
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,020
Why are you here?

253
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,540
You should go back and rest.

254
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,600
We'll handle this.

255
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,690
We'll give you a proper explanation.

256
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm here to help.

257
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
I also want to hear

258
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,480
why he committed such heinous crimes.

259
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,940
Let me ask you.

260
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,300
Are the children we rescued today

261
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,370
the ones who recently went missing
from various places?

262
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,510
Answer honestly.

263
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,750
If you won't talk,

264
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,770
I'll use
Biluo Valley's interrogation methods.

265
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,590
I'll confess. I'll confess.

266
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,730
They are the missing children.

267
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,770
Why did you kidnap them?

268
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,640
I...

269
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,329
Selling them

270
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,819
could fetch a good amount of silver.

271
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,550
Despicable!

272
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,329
Profiting from such vile deeds!

273
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,280
Someone must be behind this.

274
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,880
Tell us, who is it?

275
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:24,829
It's...

276
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,440
Is it the remnants

277
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,250
of Shengyue Sect?

278
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Yes. Yes.

279
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,870
I know nothing.

280
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,280
Shengyue Sect made me do it all.

281
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,700
I have a wife and child.

282
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,790
Please spare my life.

283
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,200
He's confessed everything.

284
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,920
What happens next is up to you.

285
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,640
He was so tight-lipped before.

286
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,340
Why did he suddenly confess?

287
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,420
Maybe he got scared
when he heard me mention

288
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,590
Biluo Valley's interrogation methods.

289
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,070
At least we've got a lead.

290
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,590
Thank you for your help, Miss Lu.

291
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,930
It's the least I can do.

292
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,000
By the way,

293
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,860
what do you plan to do with him?

294
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,540
He'll be handed over
to the authorities tomorrow.

295
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,030
What?

296
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,770
You're handing him over
to the authorities?

297
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,440
That's Mr. Yang's order.

298
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,690
Mr. Yang is indeed thoughtful.

299
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,920
Miss Lu, you've had a few rough nights.

300
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,510
You should go back and get some rest.

301
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
I still have a few questions for him.

302
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,760
Is that alright?

303
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,970
Please go ahead, Miss Lu.

304
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,350
For such little money,

305
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,930
you didn't even spare such young children.

306
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,130
Do you know how terrified they were?

307
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,430
Do you know how worried their parents are?

308
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,900
If your child suffered this,

309
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,440
how would you feel?

310
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,180
How would your wife react?

311
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,690
My wife and child are innocent!

312
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,270
Aren't the children
you kidnapped innocent too?

313
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,800
You did such a vile thing.

314
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,430
Aren't you worried your wife and child
will suffer the consequences?

315
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,550
I beg you.

316
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,630
Don't hurt my wife or child.

317
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,050
I did all this alone.

318
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,680
They know nothing about it!

319
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,480
If someone must die, let it be me.

320
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,270
Young...

321
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,870
Do they really know nothing?

322
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,440
Regarding this matter,

323
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,680
Biluo Valley will not let it go.

324
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,630
We'll get to the bottom of it!

325
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
And if

326
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,350
I find out

327
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,270
they're even slightly involved,

328
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,680
I won't show any mercy.

329
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,640
They truly know nothing.

330
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,930
I know my sins are grave.

331
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,980
I'm willing to pay with my life.

332
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,170
Just please,

333
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,190
don't hurt my family.

334
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,750
[Weihu Hall]

335
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,210
This man's name is Cao Fei.

336
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,040
He said he kidnapped the kids for money

337
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,800
under Shengyue Sect's orders.

338
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,620
But not long after making his confession,

339
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,750
he threw himself onto Miss Lu's sword.

340
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,060
What about your side?

341
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,940
The black-clad men we captured
all took their own lives.

342
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,020
There were nine children in the carriage.

343
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,080
Seven of them are still unconscious.

344
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,640
After we return to the city tomorrow,

345
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,770
they should wake up.

346
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,590
For money?

347
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,500
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

348
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,590
Most likely a cover story.

349
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,880
Let's wait until the children wake up.

350
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,210
Then we'll investigate further.

351
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:39,820
Okay.

352
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,050
Mr. Yang.

353
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,550
I was perhaps reckless.

354
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,070
I searched the entire fortress

355
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,070
and found this.

356
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,700
It bears the Blood Moon mark
of Shengyue Sect.

357
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,680
Such a heinous act as kidnapping children

358
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,130
is indeed something
only Shengyue Sect would do.

359
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,990
They must have done that
to make money for Shengyue Sect.

360
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,180
Shengyue Sect would never bully

361
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,310
the elderly, weak, sick, or disabled!

362
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,000
But someone

363
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,000
first falsely accused me.

364
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,000
Then I heard she tried

365
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,380
to silence someone in a rush.

366
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,160
Now she's trying to frame Shengyue Sect

367
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,260
with its mark.

368
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,400
Of course Shengyue Sect

369
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,600
would never admit it.

370
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,720
Mr. Yang, I want to ask

371
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,210
when Yunmen

372
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,440
became so friendly with Shengyue Sect.

373
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,520
Shouldn't Fire Hall Master
be arrested immediately

374
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,710
and sent to Biluo Valley for imprisonment?

375
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,510
Yes, Mr. Yang.

376
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,000
How can someone from

377
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,930
Shengyue Sect show up here openly?

378
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,610
Fire Hall Master has promised to reform.

379
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,480
He believes the kids' abductions
have nothing to do with Shengyue Sect.

380
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,750
And he insists on uncovering the truth.

381
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,710
If there's solid evidence

382
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,370
proving Shengyue Sect did it,

383
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,470
he's willing to be handed over
to the authorities and face punishment.

384
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,700
Right, Fire Hall Master?

385
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,420
If we did it, we did it.

386
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,210
If we didn't, we didn't.

387
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,680
If it really was Shengyue Sect's member,

388
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,720
no matter who it was,

389
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,950
I'm willing to face death with him!

390
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,970
Isn't this evidence?

391
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,380
You're trying to frame Shengyue Sect
with just a piece of cloth?

392
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,050
If I tear a piece
off a Biluo Valley's robe,

393
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,860
could I say you did it?

394
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,220
A piece of cloth proves nothing.

395
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,170
The children's testimony
will be our best evidence.

396
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,450
After the children wake up,

397
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,230
we'll see if they can
tell us anything useful.

398
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Everyone, get some rest.

399
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,060
We'll return to the city soon.

400
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,240
And on the way,

401
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,920
escort Miss Lu back
to Biluo Valley's branch.

402
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,170
Mr. Yang.

403
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,870
Miss Yang asked you to go there.

404
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,500
She wants to cook for you.

405
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
If you don't go,

406
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,160
the kitchen might get torn apart.

That doesn't sound
like a great deal for me.

449
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,640
Is your cooking better than mine?

450
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,170
Let's find out.

451
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,480
You're this confident
about your cooking skills?

452
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,960
By the way,

453
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,120
Mingyang said you caught someone.

454
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,380
Did he confess?

455
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,510
He said they kidnapped the kids for money.

456
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,680
After just a few questions,

457
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,480
he threw himself
onto Lu Xuanxuan's sword and died.

458
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,410
The lead is gone.

459
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,430
I knew Lu Xuanxuan was up to no good.

460
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,110
I think

461
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,110
she's the biggest suspect.

462
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,680
I also believe Lu Xuanxuan is involved.

463
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,830
As for the mastermind,

464
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,370
it should be Chief Lu.

465
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,410
Isn't Biluo Valley a righteous sect?

466
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,220
How could they
do something so disgraceful?

467
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,750
Actually, the line between good and evil

468
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,110
isn't always so clear.

469
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,130
Yang Qing, I've been thinking—

470
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,660
not knowing martial arts is such a burden.

471
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,920
Today, when you went to catch that person,

472
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,180
I couldn't help at all.

473
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,990
If we had caught him earlier,

474
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,510
maybe we'd have known who's behind this.

475
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,310
You traced the lead on Qingmu Fortress
from the kitchen.

476
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,230
You discovered the kids' abductions
were related to Qingmu Fortress.

477
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,230
You did very well.

478
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,910
No need to blame yourself.

479
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,960
But I want to help you.

480
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,850
I don't know martial arts,

481
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,400
but I should at least know flying skills.

482
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,710
That way, even though I can't fight,
I could at least escape.

483
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,470
So,

484
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,530
can I go back to Yunmen with you
to learn martial arts?

485
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,960
Mingyang, what are you doing?

486
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,440
Didn't you say Mr. Yang was hungry?

487
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,900
I caught a fish.

488
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,660
I thought you'd like it.

489
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,950
Did I... do something wrong?

490
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,610
After we finish eating noodles,

491
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,110
let's head back to the city.

492
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,730
Okay.

493
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,140
Chief, be careful.

494
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,270
Biluo Valley is despicable.

495
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,380
They've set a trap.

496
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,390
Chief,

497
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,590
you go first.

498
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,880
I'll cover the rear.

499
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,270
Chief,

500
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,350
this should be their

501
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,880
so-called Mist Formation.

502
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,560
There's a formation here. Follow me.

503
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,500
After them! Hurry!

504
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,660
Over there! Keep up!

505
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,830
Yingxing, rest here for a while.

506
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,300
Come.

507
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,400
How did you know I'm here?

508
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,620
Why did you come to save me?

509
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,960
Biluo Valley has set a trap to kill you.

510
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,280
If I don't save you, who will?

511
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,930
Come on, Yao.

512
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,240
If I die,

513
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,420
wouldn't you be happy?

514
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,790
Your pretense

515
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,090
makes me sick.

516
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,710
Yingxing!

517
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,880
Yingxing, I know you resent me,

518
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,400
but this is a matter of life and death.

519
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,560
They came prepared.

520
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,620
Please trust me one more time.

521
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,830
Yao Fu, I loved you,

522
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,290
but you betrayed me.

523
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,200
Now I wish I could rip you apart,

524
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,110
yet you're here meddling in my affairs.

525
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,450
Why are you doing this?

526
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,190
Why do I smell blood here?

527
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,640
They must be nearby!

528
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,350
Yingxing.

529
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,150
Stop following me.

530
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,230
[Qinglai Inn]

531
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,100
Waiter.

532
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,810
What is your wine made of?

533
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,040
It smells wonderful.

534
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,270
Did you write all these characters?

535
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,590
Your calligraphy is beautiful.

536
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,990
What's your name?

537
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,650
How about this? I tell you my name,

538
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,540
and you teach me how to write it.

539
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,400
What do you say?

540
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,300
I have something to do. Gotta go.

541
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,210
I'm not done talking.

542
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,960
Look who it is.

543
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,720
It's you, my old flame.

544
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,010
Long time no see.

545
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,500
Lingyin,

546
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,560
you were with Saintess.

547
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,960
Why didn't you protect her?

548
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,020
Instead, you let her fall into a trap!

549
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,890
You big fool,

550
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,070
do you want to speak a little louder?

551
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,200
This place is full of Yunmen's people.

552
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,960
If you keep shouting like that,

553
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,000
everyone in Qinglai Inn will know

554
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,730
Yue and I are from Shengyue Sect.

555
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,560
We haven't settled the score

556
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,120
for your escape earlier.

557
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,510
Didn't I tell you

558
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,190
if you dared escape,

559
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,000
I'd break your legs?

560
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,520
Go ahead.

561
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,050
My legs are right here.

562
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,520
Take them if you want.

563
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,200
Why all this shouting and threatening?

564
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,270
Since Saintess has returned safely,

565
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,100
I'll let this go for now.

566
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,510
Fire Hall Master, you're being shy now.

567
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,590
Alright then.

568
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,070
Thank you for your generosity.

569
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm going to get some rest.

570
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,090
Lingyin!

571
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,180
How dare you poison me!

572
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,480
Imprisoning me

573
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,230
comes with a price.

574
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,810
You...

575
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,590
Miss Lin!

576
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,880
Mr. Jiang, help me!

577
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,700
This man is so fierce.

578
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,800
The moment he saw me,
he started yelling and threatening me.

579
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,590
Fire Hall Master,

580
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,830
Mr. Yang said you have reformed

581
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,310
and wish to join the righteous side.

582
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,200
Why did you do that to Miss Lin,

583
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,640
a defenseless young woman?

584
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,510
Get out of my way, you brat!

585
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
Mr. Jiang, look at him!

586
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,070
He's so fierce.

587
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,790
Isn't Yunmen supposed to uphold justice?

588
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,020
If you don't stop him,

589
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,930
and he kills me,

590
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,440
who's going to cure your people?

591
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,270
Don't worry, Miss Lin.

592
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,240
As long as I am here,

593
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,850
I won't let him lay a finger on you.

594
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,980
Then hold him back.

595
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,170
I'm leaving.

596
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,350
You leave first, Miss Lin!

597
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,310
Don't go! Get out of my way!

598
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,370
Fire Hall Master, restrain yourself!

599
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,140
Will you get out of my way?

600
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,350
One more step and I'll fight back!

601
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,280
Get out of my way!

602
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,230
Will you get out of my way?

603
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,810
No!

604
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,170
Get out of my way!

605
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,680
You big fool.

606
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,880
I didn't poison you.

607
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,720
Your liver heat is too strong.

608
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,350
That was just to cool you down.

609
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,080
-Why are you so angry?
-Go away!

610
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,250
What happened to your eyes?

611
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,000
I didn't sleep well last night.

612
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,240
And your mouth?

613
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,160
I bumped it.

614
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,080
He didn't bump it.

615
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,930
For Miss Lin, he had a fight

616
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,190
with Fire Hall Master.

617
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,890
And he lost.

618
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,000
Mr. Yang,

619
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,830
Miss Lin really is no ordinary person.

620
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,770
Jiang Yan's changed a lot because of her.

621
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,030
Don't say that about Miss Lin.

622
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,920
I didn't have a fight with him

623
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,990
for Miss Lin.

624
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,020
I simply can't stand

625
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,760
someone bullying a young lady.

626
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,250
Besides, I didn't lose.

627
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,110
Fire Hall Master
didn't get the better of me.

628
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,110
Enough. Let's get down to business.

629
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:14,690
Mr. Yang,

630
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,190
the children we rescued

631
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,210
from the carriage yesterday

632
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,210
are all awake now.

633
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,560
Miss Lin checked on them.

634
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,360
They're fine.

635
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,120
Good.

636
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,560
Do we have any new leads?

637
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,239
The children are too young,

638
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:29,070
and the bandits drugged them.

639
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,159
They don't remember anything.

640
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,929
They're all from Yangliu Town.

641
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,000
Take good care of them.

642
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,260
Send them back to Yangliu Town tomorrow.

643
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:40,989
Mr. Yang,

644
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,340
don't you think

645
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,060
we should ask them again?

646
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,139
The children
spent much time with the bandits.

647
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,679
If we ask them again,

648
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,550
we might get some clues.

649
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,750
Send them home first.

650
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,760
They're

651
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,800
more willing to tell their families

652
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,199
what happened than to us.

653
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,080
After that,

654
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,440
we can go ask them again.

655
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,060
And perhaps we can discover something new.

656
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,840
Mr. Yang, what about Miss Yang
and the others?

657
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,330
They're not from Yunmen,

658
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,650
and they're connected to Shengyue Sect.

659
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,880
We should just ignore them, right?

660
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,000
When we were poisoned, Miss Lin

661
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,510
took care of us day and night.

662
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,040
Besides,

663
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:17,890
yesterday,

664
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,540
Miss Yang and Fire Hall Master
helped a lot too.

665
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,710
So what are you suggesting?

666
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,440
Invite them all back to Yunmen?

667
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,000
That's not what I meant.

668
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,250
But shouldn't we at least

669
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,850
say goodbye before we leave?

670
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,630
I agree with that.

671
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,150
You should explain to them clearly—

672
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,080
Yunmen will never

673
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,890
collude with Shengyue Sect.

674
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,980
But Miss Yang and Miss Lin

675
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,480
aren't members of Shengyue Sect.

676
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,860
They're so close to Fire Hall Master.

677
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,920
Are you blind?

678
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:41,940
Enough.

679
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,960
After we send the children back
to Yangliu Town tomorrow,

680
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,000
we'll go back to Yunmen.

681
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,800
Yingxing.

682
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,390
Yingxing! Wait.

683
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,650
Yingxing.

684
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,050
Yao, I get it now.

685
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,230
You want us to be a couple
in the afterlife, don't you?

686
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,840
I came to tell you

687
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,150
Jin Buhuan is a traitor.

688
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,850
Don't trust him.

689
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,390
He's a traitor?

690
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,060
Aren't you a traitor?

691
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,030
Fine.

692
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,560
Yingxing,

693
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,410
I admit it.

694
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,000
I had to betray you before,

695
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,850
but I never wanted you dead.

696
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,820
Think about it, Yingxing.

697
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,230
The trap set by Biluo Valley

698
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,450
was designed to counter your martial arts.

699
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,270
Jin Buhuan was right beside you.

700
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,600
Instead of helping you,

701
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,920
he kept pushing you forward.

702
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,600
Do you know

703
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,360
I hate being betrayed the most?

704
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,110
Yuan Yingxing.

705
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,850
Even if I die,

706
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,130
I'll get you out of here.

707
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:18,950
Yao Fu,

708
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,650
don't think I can still be manipulated

709
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,710
by you like before.

710
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,420
Get lost.

711
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,280
Or you'll die here before I do.

712
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,980
Yingxing,

713
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,290
no matter how much you hate me,

714
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,810
just let it all out!

715
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,360
After that,

716
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,350
leave this place with me.

717
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,570
Yingxing, once Jin Buhuan catches up,

718
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,870
it will be much harder for us to escape.

719
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,610
You don't have to trust me,

720
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,020
but can we please leave this place first?

721
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,190
Yingxing.

722
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,550
So annoying.

723
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,040
Let me tell you,

724
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,460
I worked so hard to treat their illness

725
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,580
and eliminate the poison.

726
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,160
Now Yang Qing and his people
want to return to Yunmen

727
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,830
without us.

728
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,230
Can you believe how quickly
their attitude has changed?

729
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,160
That's not true.

730
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,130
It's not like that.

731
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,150
Fire Hall Master, Miss Lin,

732
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,710
I truly remember and appreciate everything

733
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,710
you've done to help us along the way.

734
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,220
If you ever need anything,

735
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,650
I'll do everything I can.

736
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,070
However,

737
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,640
we've been out

738
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,150
for quite some time on this mission.

739
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,070
After we send the children home tomorrow,

740
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,100
we must hurry back to Yunmen.

741
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,360
It wouldn't be convenient
for us to travel together.

742
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,490
So what are your plans?

743
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,850
So all that talk

744
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,200
was just a fancy way of kicking us out.

745
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:43,980
Then tell me,

746
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,310
what's your reason for sending us away?

747
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,030
Yunmen and Shengyue Sect
have always been at odds.

748
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,980
Fire Hall Master is from Shengyue Sect.

749
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,770
And Miss Lin and Miss Yang

750
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,270
have close ties with Shengyue Sect.

751
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,200
Continuing to travel together
would be inappropriate.

752
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,860
Mr. Jiang, do you think so?

753
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,730
Mr. Yang has always been cautious.

754
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,790
But I believe you have nothing to do
with Shengyue Sect.

755
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,640
Miss Lin, I trust you.

756
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,870
You're a good person.

757
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,070
Why don't you go back to Yunmen with us?

758
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,040
Join our sect

759
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,000
and be my junior.

760
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,770
And then...

761
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,880
Um...

762
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,180
that doesn't sound too bad.

763
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,810
Shut up.

764
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,810
But Mr. Yang,

765
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,670
you should personally

766
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,110
explain to Yue.

767
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,550
I will explain everything
to Miss Yang myself.

768
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,950
That won't be necessary.

769
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,090
I heard everything you just said.

770
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,950
I understand you.

771
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,430
I wish you a safe journey, Mr. Yang.

772
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,420
Have you decided
where you're going next, Miss Yang?

773
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:01,960
No.

774
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,960
Don't you have anything
you want to say to me?

775
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,730
The world is vast, but we'll meet again.

776
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,290
You're going back to Yangliu Town, right?

777
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,290
Yang Qing, don't be so sentimental.

778
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,160
You truly are a free spirit, Miss Yang.

779
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,360
Then until we meet again.

780
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,170
Farewell.

781
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,840
Lingyin,

782
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,960
what did you just say?

783
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,590
You want to join Yunmen?

784
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,920
Have you lost your mind?

785
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,220
If you really join Yunmen,

786
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,660
it would be a complete disgrace!

787
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,590
You don't get it.

788
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,370
It was out of expediency.

789
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,440
We still need to save
our own people, right?

790
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,030
We need to get what we want from Yunmen.

791
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,440
Forget it. You wouldn't understand anyway.

792
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,320
But you, Yue.

793
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,890
What's gotten into you?

794
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,350
You've suddenly changed?

795
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,560
How come you were suddenly willing
to part from Yang Qing?

796
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,060
Didn't he say
he wouldn't take us with him?

797
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,020
I was just playing hard to get.

798
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,710
You're very experienced,

799
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,070
but how come
you don't get something this simple?

800
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,800
I'm leaving.

801
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,210
Why are you standing there?

802
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,490
Come in and let me treat your wound.

803
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,030
Fool.

804
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,760
You can't die now.

805
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,040
Don't expect to die

806
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,400
if I don't want you dead!

807
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,020
Thank you.

808
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,570
Don't thank me.

809
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,570
I will take your life sooner or later.

810
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,560
Then you should live long enough to try.

811
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,020
What do you plan to do about Jin Buhuan?

812
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,150
Say one more word,

813
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,660
and I'll cut out your tongue.

814
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,360
Yingxing.

815
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,570
Yingxing, where are you going?

816
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,130
It's

817
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,670
none of your business.
