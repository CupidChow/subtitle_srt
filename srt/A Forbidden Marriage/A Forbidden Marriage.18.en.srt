00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,930
Those who join my sect
must abide by its rules.

4
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,190
Respect the teacher
who passes on knowledge...

5
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,450
Be mindful of the kindness
that nurtures your growth.

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,180
Speak with respect...

00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,060
What's wrong?

8
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,820
Scoot over a bit

9
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,940
so I can sit down.

10
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,460
Aren't there chairs over there?

11
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,460
Go sit over there.

12
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,680
I want to be closer to you

13
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,810
so I can listen to your lecture better.

14
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,620
One must be firm in one's principles

15
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,740
and honest when handling money.

16
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,400
Cultivate virtue for greater blessings.

17
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,000

Broaden horizons for profound discourse.

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,060
Care for orphans and widows, respect
the elderly, and nurture the young.

20
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,120
Though wise, remain humble.

23
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,450

They appear frequently on exams.

27
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,360
Mr. Yang, this rulebook is too thick.

28
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,210
I can't possibly memorize it all.

29
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,140
Please help me think of a solution.

30
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,800
Just listening definitely isn't enough.

31
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,220
You need to write it down
to deepen your memory.

32
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,670
How long will it take
to write all of this?

33
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,480
Write.

34

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,820
at Yunmen,
we have always valued discipline,

100

which is why we take
our rule examinations seriously.

101

00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,950
Miss Lu, what's wrong?

108
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,320
I suspect that someone brought
a cheat sheet with them.

109
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,920
-A cheat sheet?
-How brazen.

110
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,210
Miss Lu, speak carefully.

111
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,510
Lu Xuanxuan, why are you looking at me?

112
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,500
Elder Shen,

113
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,750
earlier, when I was outside,

114
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,080
I noticed Yang Wangyue kept looking down,

115
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,880
with a suspicious smile on her face.

116
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,210
I suspect that she was using
a cheat sheet.

117
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,010
Lu Xuanxuan,

118
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,000
don't make false accusations.

119
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,200
I spent several nights

120
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,760
memorizing the sect rules.

121
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,840
Whether you did or didn't,

122
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,300
just show us what you have.

123
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,530
Just because you say so, I should comply?

124
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,130
This is Yunmen's examination,

125
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,530
not your Biluo Valley's.

126
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,140
You're meddling too much.

127
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,330
This is indeed Yunmen's examination,

128
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,190
but since the guest herbalist

129
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,030
has raised a suspicion,

130
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,720
Wangyue, you might as well show us
what you have there

131
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,120
to prove your innocence.

132
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,790
Elder Shen, I didn't do anything.

133
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,580
So many eyes are watching me.

134
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,120
Just because she tells me to,
I should take something out?

135
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,790
What if she accused me of murder?

136
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,920
Would I have to prove
how I killed someone?

137
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,450
Why doesn't she prove
how I supposedly did it?

138
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,470
Senior Wangyue is right.

139
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,440
Whoever makes the accusation
should provide evidence.

140
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,120
Why should the accused
have to prove their innocence?

141
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,000
Yang Wangyue,

142
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,940
your word isn't worth much.

143
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
You've done plenty of shady things before.

144
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,510
Enough talk.

145
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,030
Yang Wangyue, hand over what you have.

146
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,990
Miss Lu, are you talking about this?

147
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,650
Not this one.

148
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Let me look again.

149
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,940
Elder Shen, look!

150
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,170
What is this?

151
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
She really has it.

152
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,910
What nerve.

153
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,510
Yeah, to think
she would be this kind of person.

154
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,920
You're lying.

155
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,350
That's not mine.

156
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,750
The evidence is right here.

157
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,480
Are you still trying to deny it?

158
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,310
This is indeed the exam content.

159
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,750
Yang Wangyue, you actually dared to cheat.

160
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,750
I was wondering why you were so certain.

161
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,940
Turns out you've set a trap

162
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,130
for me to fall into.

163
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,390
Lu Xuanxuan,

164
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
looks like you've prepared well this time.

165
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,980
You've even imitated

166
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,660
my handwriting quite well, for instance.

167
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,330
But unfortunately for you,

168
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,350
you still don't know me well enough.

169
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,770
I never use Wujiang ink

170
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,770
because it gives me rashes on my hands.

171
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,680
That's why
I always collect Five-Soul Grass

172
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,500
from the back mountain,
grind it up, and mix it in

173
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,820
so that I don't break out in rashes.

174
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,610
Get to the point.

175
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,580
Elder Shen, please smell this.

176
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,110
Doesn't it have the scent
of Five-Soul Grass?

177
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,300
Indeed, it does smell of Five-Soul Grass.

178
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,460
Elder Shen, look.

179
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,560
There were no rashes before.

180
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,450
If I had smuggled this scroll into

181
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,150
the exam hall from the beginning,

182
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,360
I would've broken out in rashes long ago.

183
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,760
But the rashes have only appeared
just now,

184
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,840
which means...

185
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,900
This scroll was

186
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,660
placed near you just now.

187
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,540
Elder Shen, you're perceptive.

188
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,620
I can also testify!

189
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,510
Everything she said is true.

190
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,220
I was outside monitoring the exam
the entire time.

191
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,150
Yang Wangyue was writing by herself
the entire time,

192
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,170
with no violations whatsoever.

193
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,540
I... I was just expressing my doubts.

194
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,730
It's best that Miss Yang prove herself.

195
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,620
Isn't this...

196
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,260
a satisfactory outcome for everyone?

197
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,060
In that case,

198
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,760
let's end the exam now

199
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,830
and check the results.

200
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,720
Fellow disciples,

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,150
15 of you have passed the exam.

202
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,080
I'll read the names

203
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,780
of those who've passed.

204
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,880
First place:

205
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,000
Su Ming.

206
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,150
Congratulations.

207
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,410
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

208
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,400
Second place:

209
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Yang Wangyue.

210
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,650
Wangyue, you got second place!

211
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:16,740
Third place:

212
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,770
Jiang Yu.

213
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,750
Congratulations, Jiang Yu.

214
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,400
-Well done!
-That's great!

215
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,910
[Tianyu Palace]

216
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,300
Greetings, Chief.

217
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,360
Chief,

218
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,090
I heard that you released Murong Xuan.

219
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

220
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,910
Why?

221
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,630
Why did you let him go?

222
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,350
In the past,
whenever we hall masters were bullied,

223
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,870
you always stepped in
and upheld justice for us.

224
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,150
I released him because I wanted to.

225
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,410
Why so many questions?

226
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,060
Chief, what's gotten into you?

227
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,600
Are you under Yao Fu's spell again?

228
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,940
Have you forgotten
that Yue was almost killed by her?

229
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,360
Have you forgotten
that our sect was defeated

230
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,460
and left in ruins just a few months ago?

231
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,520
If that's the case,

232
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,670
why even bother reviving the sect?

233
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,400
Wouldn't it be better
to just let it be destroyed?

234
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,320
You think I don't know

235
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,260
that you were the one
who picked the fight first?

236
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,260
Everyone in our Shengyue Sect

237
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,350
has always been a troublemaker.

238
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,760
In the past,
you may not have protected us,

239
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,100
but at least you let us do as we pleased.

240
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,320
And now?

241
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,270
Can't you even tell
who your own people are anymore, Chief?

242
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,670
Lingyin, don't go too far.

243
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,480
I'm going too far?

244
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,790
Chief, for Yao Fu's sake,

245
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,440
you've abandoned our sect's rules,

246
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,910
yet you say I'm going too far?

247
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,440
Guards!

248
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,660
Take Lingyin away,

249
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,860
punish her with 30 strokes,

250
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,990
and make sure she learns the proper way
to speak to me.

251
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,510
-Yes, Chief!
-Yes, Chief!

252
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,840
Don't you dare touch me!

253
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,330
I've long had enough of this place.

254
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,150
The Water Hall Master? I don't care!

255
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,000
[Yunmen]

256
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,060
Miss Lu, you've gathered us all here,

257
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,360
saying Chief Lu has matters to discuss.

258
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,580
What are the matters?

259
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,360
News of Yuan Yingxing rebuilding
the Shengyue Sect

260
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
has been spreading like wildfire
throughout the martial world lately.

261
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,200
After hearing this news,
my father has been restless.

262
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,800
He feels guilty
for not killing Yuan Yingxing,

263
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,060
allowing this demon
to threaten the martial world.

264
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,320
On behalf of my father,

265
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,130
I apologize to all of you.

266
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,080
Your sect has already lost many disciples

267
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,210
in the attempt to kill that demon.

268
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,670
No one will blame you for this matter.

269
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,680
Thank you all for your understanding.

270
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
The Shengyue Sect is on its last legs

271
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,710
and hasn't truly harmed the martial world
in recent times.

272
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,040
Perhaps our sect doesn't need to be
sworn enemies with them.

273
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,960
I disagree.

274
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,520
As the saying goes,

275
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,850
"Even a fallen giant casts a long shadow."

276
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,170
Among all the heretical sects
in the martial world,

277
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,000
only the Shengyue Sect has earned

278
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
the title of the "Demonic Sect,"

279
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,580
who could stand alone
against our four major sects

280
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,840
in the Central Plains.

281
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,360
Yuan Yingxing's martial arts skills
are formidable,

282
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,420
and he is ruthless.

283
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,840
We of Biluo Valley believe

284
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,240
that the Shengyue Sect must be eliminated.

285
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,540
If you wish to
eliminate the Shengyue Sect,

286
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,400
why didn't Chief Lu come himself?

287
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,020
Previously, in order to
capture Yuan Yingxing,

288
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,370
we set an extensive trap in the valley,

289
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,840
but Yuan Yingxing destroyed
three of our branch halls,

290
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,570
leaving us severely weakened.

291
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,710
Your sect is severely weakened,

292
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,620
but aren't the other sects
in the same situation?

293
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,350
Our four major sects may have
many disciples,

294
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,840
but we cannot

295
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,500
endlessly sacrifice them
to the Shengyue Sect.

296
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,330
We all need to rest and recover

297
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,670
to prepare for unforeseen dangers.

298
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,550
The Shengyue Sect is the greatest danger!

299
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,950
Compared to that danger,

300
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,030
our four major sects have lost disciples
in battles,

301
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,960
our strength has been depleted,
and our legacy is at risk.

302
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,890
Each of those concerns
outweighs one Yuan Yingxing.

303
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,090
Are we just going to

304
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,180
let the Shengyue Sect rise again?

305
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,000
Respected elders,

306
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
what do you think?

307
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,060
Qing.

308
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
That's enough.

309
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,750
Miss Lu,

310
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,030
regarding the matter
of hunting down Yuan Yingxing,

311
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,109
we need to consider it carefully.

312
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:19,920
I believe,

313
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,829
Miss Lu, you should pay more attention to

314
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,240
your own sect's affairs.

315
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,440
You've been with our sect
for quite some time now.

316
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,310
It's time for you
to return to Biluo Valley.

317
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,150
You can't stay here forever,

318
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,450
attempting to interfere in
our internal affairs.

319
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:35,970
Like

320
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,100
today's examination.

321
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,490
I was just about to
report this matter to you, Sect Leader.

322
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,480
Today, Miss Lu

323
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,180
accused one of our disciples of cheating,

324
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,730
but that wasn't the case.

325
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,190
After my investigation,

326
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,590
it was actually Miss Lu
who orchestrated the whole affair,

327
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,920
framing our disciple.

328
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
The evidence is conclusive.

329
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:58,920
Well...

330
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,320
Is this how you treat your guests?

331
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,240
Several of you elders are ganging up

332
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,690
to bully a young girl like me.

333
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,300
We always address issues, not people.

334
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,170
Miss Lu, if you're

335
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,640
dissatisfied with my investigation,

336
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,730
we can verify each point one by one.

337
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,590
No need.

338
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,790
Here in Yunmen,

339
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,980
you hold sway over everything anyway.

340
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,160
In our sect,

341
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,360
of course, we have the final say.

342
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,510
Miss Lu, you'd better understand

343
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,350
your place here.

344
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,640
Miss Lu,

345
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,510
please tell Chief Lu for me

346
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,440
that regarding the hunt for Yuan Yingxing,

347
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,930
we'll discuss it some other time.

348
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
We won't keep you any longer.

349
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,480
Yes.

350
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,160
Yue, you have to stand up for me.

351
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,390
[Deyue Hotel]

352
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,440
The Chief is completely bewitched
by that woman,

353
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,640
putting her before his hall master.

354
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,310
Really?

355
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,120
Indeed.

356
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,200
Miss Lin?

357
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,660
Miss Lin, it really is you!

358
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,920
I heard your voice as soon as I came in.

359
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,030
How have you been lately, Miss Lin?

360
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,170
I'm so glad to see an old friend.

361
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,570
I've come to seek refuge with you all.

362
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,280
Miss Lin,

363
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,240
did you receive

364
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,610
the letters I wrote to you?

365
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,310
I've been waiting for your reply
all this time.

366
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,040
It's just...

367
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,250
Enough, enough.

368
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,350
Don't bring that up.

369
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,680
Some letters you wrote.

370
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,870
Yue, let me tell you

371
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,240
what he wrote in his letters.

372
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,270
In his letters, he wrote about things like

373
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,550
what color mushrooms he saw today,

374
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,400
about

375
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,620
how big the fish he saw in the river were,

376
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,840
or about

377
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,110
seeing a group of snakes
or something like that.

378
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,160
Well, Jiang Yan,

379
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,450
is this how you write letters to girls?

380
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,560
We girls aren't interested in
the color of mushrooms,

381
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,490
the size of fish,

382
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,610
or whether snakes travel in groups.

383
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,110
So, you aren't interested in these things.

384
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,920
I thought these things were interesting

385
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,520
and that you would like them.

386
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,710
How could any girl
be interested in such...

387
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,990
Other girls

388
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,010
might not like such things,

389
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,890
but I'm different.

390
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,310
I'm very interested in

391
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,430
what you wrote.

392
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,920
So interested

393
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,750
that I wanted to come see for myself.

394
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,640
Could you take me to see

395
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,040
all the things you wrote about
in your letters?

396
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,920
Of course, of course!

397
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,900
As long as you're interested,

398
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,810
I'm happy to show you anytime!

399
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,270
Really?

400
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:35,740
Really.

401
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,880
That's wonderful.

402
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,290
Alright, alright.

403
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:39,890
Jiang Yan,

404
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,390
what brings you here?

405
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,130
Look at me, I got so excited

406
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,280
that I forgot the important matter.

407
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,880
Junior Yang,

408
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,770
Mr. Yang is looking for you.

409
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,570
You should go see him right away.

410
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,220
[Yunmen]

411
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,040
Yang Qing, what's so urgent?

412
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,400
You don't seem like yourself today.

413
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,200
What's wrong?

414
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,590
Maybe...

415
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,360
maybe I didn't sleep well.

416
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,070
I've been thinking about
stealing the Sun Blade,

417
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,670
but I can't tell you about it.

418
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,280
Really?

419
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,400
Or is there something

420
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,400
you don't want to tell me again?

421
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,550
There is.

422
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,950
How's that matter you promised me going?

423
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,070
I've brought it up
with the Sect Leader many times.

424
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,200
He's about to agree.

425
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,340
Just give me a little more time.

426
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,440
I'll facilitate the reconciliation
as soon as possible.

427
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
Why is Sect Leader Feng so stubborn?

428
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,760
I don't know what he's holding onto.

429
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,820
Yuan Yingxing is getting impatient.

430
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,280
I know Yuan Yingxing is anxious,

431
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,260
but the Sect Leader must consider
not only our sect

432
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,720
but also the entire martial world,

433
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,650
so naturally, he's more cautious.

434
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,980
Wangyue, give me a little more time,

435
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:48,690
okay?

436
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,850
I can wait,

437
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,540
but can others?

438
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,080
Fine, I'll wait for you.

439
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,270
Okay,

440
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,260
I'll walk you back first.

441
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,390
I'd better do it myself.

442
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,220
No, no, no.

443
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,470
I can't betray Yang Qing's trust.

444
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,260
But if I don't do it,

445
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,710
what if Yao Fu bewitches
Yuan Yingxing again?

446
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,680
There are still so many members
in that dungeon.

447
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,790
I am the Saintess.

448
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,350
I must protect them.

449
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,600
Yang Qing, you can understand me, right?

450
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:54,530
[Langhuan Pavilion]

451
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:58,730
Senior Su!

452
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,590
Junior Yang, what brings you here?

453
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
I heard it's your first day on duty,

454
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,570
so I came to see you.

455
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,130
That's so nice of you.

456
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,510
The senior who was supposed to be
on duty with me called in sick,

457
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,690
so I'm here all alone.

458
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,010
I'm still getting used to it.

459
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:12,920
Thankfully, you're here now.

460
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,250
So, it's just you today?

461
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah.

462
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,410
That's perfect.

463
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,750
I mean,

464
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,720
since you're alone,

465
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,620
I can keep you company.

466
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,450
Junior Yang,

467
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,200
you're being a bit too forward.

468
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,070
Senior, I have a wish.

469
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,710
Could you help me with it?

470
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,910
Junior Yang, just say it.

471
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,260
If it's within my power,

472
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,500
I'll definitely help you fulfill it.

473
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,450
Senior,

474
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:44,790
I...

475
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,000
I want to go inside the Langhuan Pavilion

476
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,330
to broaden my horizons.

477
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,800
Junior Yang, that might not be possible.

478
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,550
Elder Wang specifically instructed me

479
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,200
that if I fail in my guard duty,

480
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,930
I'll be expelled from the sect.

481
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,540
Senior Su, you know

482
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,440
I come from a humble background,

483
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,640
and everyone always mocks me
for being unsophisticated.

484
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
I just want to see

485
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,960
what is inside the Langhuan Pavilion.

486
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,200
Just one glance.

487
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,690
I won't cause any trouble.

488
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,030
Please let me in.

489
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,150
But...

490
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,550
How about this?

491
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,750
Your martial arts skills are better
than mine,

492
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,950
so you take me inside.

493
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,690
Junior Yang,

494
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,460
if the Elders or the Sect Leader find out,

495
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,530
we're done for.

496
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,010
If you don't tell and I don't tell,

497
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,160
no one will know.

498
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,010
But...

499
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,070
No more buts. Let's go.

500
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,590
Hold on!

501
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,830
Mr. Yang, what a coincidence.

502
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,320
Why are you here?

503
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,410
I heard it's Senior Su's first day
on duty,

504
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,770
so I came to check on him.

505
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,710
Is that so?

506
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,610
Of course, it's true.

507
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,410
If you don't believe me, ask him.

508
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:01,690
Mr. Yang,

509
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,930
Junior Yang did come to check on me.

510
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,480
Senior Su,

511
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,240
since Mr. Yang is here to check on you,

512
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,500
I'll take my leave now.

513
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,450
Why are you in such a good mood today

514
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,080
to play chess with me here?

515
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,540
I'll speak plainly

516
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,520
and not beat around the bush.

517
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,020
Senior Wang, today I'd like to
talk with you

518
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,070
about negotiating peace
with the Shengyue Sect.

519
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,510
I have more contact with the Sect Leader,

520
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,370
and as you know,

521
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,810
he's not someone who enjoys bloodshed.

522
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,920
The repeated conflicts
with the Shengyue Sect

523
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,120
have weakened us all.

524
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,560
Peace talks would benefit everyone.

525
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,640
I've discussed it with him several times,

526
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,100
and he's not opposed to it.

527
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,280
He's just constrained by...

528
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,000
Senior, I hope you'll prioritize
the greater good.

529
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,200
I, Yang Qing, would be deeply grateful.

530
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,960
You're overestimating me, Junior Yang.

531
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,760
My support is of little weight.

532
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,090
Thank you.

533
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,640
Junior Wang,

534
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,430
you also believe that the Shengyue Sect
still has a conscience,

535
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,000
and we can negotiate peace with them?

536
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,670
Indeed.

537
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,340
I had contact with Yuan Yingxing's father
in my early years.

538
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,970
The former Chief Yuan was actually

539
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,140
a noble visionary.

540
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,870
He just wasn't good at raising his son

541
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,230
and, unfortunately, died too early,

542
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,740
which caused chaos
within the Shengyue Sect.

543
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,200
Yuan Yingxing quelled internal strife
at such a young age,

544
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,920
so naturally, he's no ordinary soul,

545
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,270
but he became increasingly extreme,

546
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,160
which led to a deadlock
in our relationship.

547
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,790
I object.

548
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,240
After peace is made,

549
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,030
our martial world and the Shengyue Sect
would no longer be divided,

550
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,360
and we could share in an era
of prosperity?

551
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,310
Foolishness.

552
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,190
Actually, Yuan Yingxing also wishes to
make peace.

553
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,360
After reconciliation,

554
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,980
if we establish a treaty to bind them,

555
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,640
the martial world will see
far fewer conflicts.

556
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,010
Qing, we understand what you're saying,

557
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,310
but it's useless for just our sect
to understand.

558
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,880
This path to reconciliation

559
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,550
can be initiated by Biluo Valley,
the Cangtong Sect,

560
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,080
or even the Qingcheng Sect,

561
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,180
but absolutely not by our sect.

562
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:28,740
Exactly.

563
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,660
Don't forget, the Moon Blade has become
the Shengyue Sect's token,

564
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,130
and we still don't know its whereabouts.

565
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,260
We have too many grievances with them.

566
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,840
It's precisely because of the Moon Blade

567
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,420
that we should reconcile
with the Shengyue Sect.

568
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,790
This way, we can
find the Moon Blade faster,

569
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,560
reunite the Sun and Moon Blades,

570
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,960
and finally resolve the issue of
the Alliance Leader's Token

571
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
being incomplete for so many years.

572
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,440
If someone

573
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,340
demands to see the token again,

574
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,870
like Chief Lu did last time,

575
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,550
we may not be fortunate enough

576
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,480
to get away with it again.

577
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,900
I think
Junior Yang's proposal makes sense.

578
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,760
Until we find the Moon Blade,

579
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,160
the Alliance Leader's Token will remain
incomplete,

580
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,280
and we'll never have peace.

581
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
This matter is of great importance.

582
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,250
Qing,

583
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,780
no matter how highly I regard you,

584
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,280
I cannot make a decision
based solely on just a few words from you

585
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,990
without careful consideration.

586
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,650
The matter of peace negotiations

587
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,310
needs thorough deliberation

588
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,370
to find a better opportunity.

589
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,780
Yes, Sect Leader.

590
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,550
By the way,

591
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,680
the new disciples have been here
for quite some time now.

592
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,570
They should go down the mountain
for training.

593
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,020
Okay.

594
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,320
Right, they should gain some experience.

595
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,500
Then...

596
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,750
which one of you will lead
the team this time?

597
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,260
It should be my turn to lead this time.

598
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,980
As it happens, villagers
from Yunyin Village came seeking help,

599
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,880
saying their village has been haunted
these past few days.

600
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,030
I believe it's just someone
pretending to be a ghost.

601
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,490
I'll take the disciples there
for training.

602
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,050
Good.

603
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,430
Let's do that,

604
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,420
but you must ensure our disciples' safety.

605
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
Yes, Sect Leader.

606
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,100
[Ximo Hall]

607
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,160
Have you guys heard

608
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,720
that training outside the sect is
scheduled for three days from now?

609
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,180
What? Three days from now?

610
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,020
This time,

611
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,550
Elder Shen will lead us.

612
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,480
Then...

613
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,960
I thought that after dealing with Su Ming,

614
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,820
I could enter Langhuan Pavilion.

615
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,620
Why do I have to leave again now?

616
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,440
The elders shook their heads
when they saw you.

617
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,630
You want to join the training this time?

618
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,890
You'll need another six months
on the plum blossom stakes!

619
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,020
Senior Su!

620
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,180
Junior Yang.

621
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,810
Senior Su, are you going on

622
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,960
this training trip?

623
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,400
Mr. Yang has assigned me another task,

624
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,750
so I won't be going this time.

625
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,410
What task did he assign to you?

626
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,390
I don't know either.

627
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,630
Let's go.

628
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,030
We should go practice martial arts now.

629
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,920
-Okay.
-Okay.

630
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,560
Let's go.

631
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,000
Why do you keep avoiding me?

632
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,410
Junior Yang,
please conduct yourself properly.

633
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,920
Why all this talk about training?

634
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,850
Do you just not want me to stay here?

635
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,270
I wasn't aware

636
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,320
that you'd suddenly become

637
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,060
so fond of Yunmen,

638
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,730
wanting to stay here
as my junior disciple forever

639
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,000
and refusing to even leave the mountain.

640
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,170
You know that's not what I meant.

641
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,250
I just...

642
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,370
don't want to be apart from you.

643
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,030
I finally passed the test

644
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,430
and could have a few peaceful days.

645
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,860
W-Why are you sending me away again?

646
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,390
Is it really me you can't part with,

647
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,830
or is there something else here

648
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,750
that you're eager to obtain?

649
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,200
I...

650
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,210
How could that be? Of course not.

651
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,760
Listen,

652
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,390
you need to prepare quickly.

653
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,320
You also need to be quick.

654
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,700
Okay.

655
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,080
Alright.

656
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,480
Training outside the sect is
Yunmen's tradition.

657
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,210
It'll only be a few days anyway.

658
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,040
Why aren't you leading us?

659
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,400
I led the team last year.

660
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,740
This year, it's Elder Shen's turn.

661
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,200
I'll miss you.

662
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,530
Can't you come with us?

663
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,240
I need to go to Biluo Valley.

664
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,480
Why do you need to go to

665
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,830
such a cursed place as Biluo Valley?

666
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,490
To investigate some matters.

667
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,240
Anyway,

668
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,690
during your training outside,

669
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
behave yourself.

670
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,510
Be good

671
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,510
and wait for me to return.

672
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,410
Got it.

673
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,570
[If not for this arrangement,

674
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,800
I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to
resist stealing the Sun Blade.]

675
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,110
[And when that happens,
how will we face the consequences?]

676
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,340
[Wangyue, don't let me down.]

677
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,530
[Yunyin Village]

678
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,160
Mr. Shen,

679
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,880
this is Yunyin Village.

680
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,800
That's right.

681
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,260
The villagers here have sought our help.

682
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,220
Mr. Shen,

683
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,480
how long has it been
since anyone lived here?

684
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,290
There's dust everywhere,
and no one's been cleaning.

685
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,430
Since they're asking for help,

686
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,160
something unjust must have happened here.

687
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,290
Jiang Yan, Jiang Yu,

688
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,280
take all the disciples
and knock on every door.

689
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,130
-Yes!
-Yes!

690
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,300
Is anyone home?

691
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,340
Hello? Anyone?

692
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,640
What's going on?

693
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,180
I don't know.

694
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,440
There's nobody here, Senior.

695
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,270
What's happening here?

696
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,270
Let's keep looking.

697
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,270
Alright, Senior.

698
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,310
How is there not a single person here?

699
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,110
Anyone there?

700
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,320
No one.

701
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,200
Is anybody home?

702
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,310
Weird.

703
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,590
Did you find anyone over there?

704
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,590
Not a single person.

705
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,510
Same here.

706
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,310
Where could everyone have gone?

707
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,580
Mr. Shen,

708
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,380
we've searched the whole way

709
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,440
and found nothing.

710
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,370
This place was never bustling,

711
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,620
but whenever we passed by before,

712
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,240
there was always smoke
rising from the chimneys.

713
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,720
How come there's not a single person now?

714
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,990
The village shows no signs of fighting,

715
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,920
yet there's no sign of life either.

716
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,100
Yes, it is strange indeed.

717
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,880
Wangyue.

718
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,180
The sect rules stipulate

719
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,340
that we, fellow disciples,
must not bully others when outside.

720
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,640
Besides, there's nobody in this courtyard.

721
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,450
What are you doing?

722
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,290
If this were truly an abandoned village,

723
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,160
the houses wouldn't have their doors
and windows tightly shut,

724
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,480
but rather broken windows
and missing doors—

725
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,280
nothing left.

726
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,000
The villagers are still here.

727
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,960
They've asked for our help,

728
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,180
yet they won't receive us.

729
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,030
Where's the sense in such deception?

730
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,290
-Yeah.
-That's right.

731
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,000
You...

732
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,720
You...

733
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,320
You...

734
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,070
You...

735
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,150
what do you want?

736
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,489
Mr. Shen.

737
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,179
There really is someone here.

738
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,290
Ma'am, we're disciples of Yunmen.

739
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:17,710
We heard that in the village...

740
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,040
I don't care who you are.

741
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:21,540
You need to leave...

742
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,219
leave right now.

743
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,239
Ma'am, please don't be afraid.

744
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,699
We're here to help you.

745
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,429
We heard that someone from the village
asked us for help.

746
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,989
No, no,

747
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,520
I've never heard of Yunmen before.

748
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,290
I've never heard of it before.

749
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,790
How could you not have heard of it?

750
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,190
Your village sits right at the foot
of the mountain, beneath our sect.

751
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,960
Ma'am,

752
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,739
has someone threatened you?

753
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,949
We can help you.

754
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,400
Our village isn't what it used to be.

755
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,670
There is nothing left here.

756
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,230
Please leave now.

757
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,280
Wait, what's going on here?

758
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,960
Are they possessed or something?

759
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,360
Yue!

760
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,920
No wonder Granny wouldn't take you in.

761
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,440
See?

762
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,730
You're still as reckless as before.

763
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,360
Unlike our Mr. Jiang,
who's refined and courteous

764
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,560
with his sweet words.

765
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,430
Lin Yin, why are you here?

766
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,120
Granny, they're all my friends.

767
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,210
Don't worry.

768
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,890
The curse won't harm them.

769
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,730
Please let them stay.

770
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,320
Miss Lin.

771
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,730
Miss Lin, since you've spoken,

772
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,730
I can rest easy.

773
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,460
Mr. Jiang, it's been a long time.

774
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,320
Who are you?

775
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,450
Mr. Shen, this is Miss Lin.

776
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,740
She's not a bad person.

777
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,330
Elder Shen.

778
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,650
Miss Lin is not a bad person.

779
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,690
You are...

780
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,280
What? You know me?

781
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,150
Come to think of it,

782
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,110
whether you know me or not,

783
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,340
you've been staring at me so intently

784
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,660
since we first met.

785
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,280
You're making me nervous.

786
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,090
Mr. Jiang,

787
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,270
look at your elder!

788
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,460
Well, Mr. Shen,

789
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,330
when we were in Qinglai City,

790
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,260
we were poisoned
by the Shengyue Sect's Ghost Scent.

791
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,630
It was all thanks to Miss Lin,
who saved us with the antidote.

792
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,110
Miss Lin and Miss Yang are
old acquaintances.

793
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,480
She may seem... straightforward,

794
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,690
but she has a kind heart.

795
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,880
Elder Shen, Lin...

796
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,800
Yin seems to have some connection
with Yunyin Village.

797
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,130
Perhaps she can help us with our training.

798
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,780
Since you're an old acquaintance
of Junior Yang

799
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,030
and have taken such good care of
our fellow disciples,

800
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,960
not to mention being a savior
to the people of Yunyin Village,

801
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,190
I must apologize to you, young lady,

802
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,210
and hope for your forgiveness.

803
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,630
It's fine.

804
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,510
Yin,

805
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,390
have you noticed anything unusual lately?

806
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,330
If I told you that this village is cursed,

807
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,000
would you believe me?

808
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,110
Cursed?

809
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,110
I've been here for several days now.

810
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,310
From my observation,

811
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,980
this village is very strange,

812
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,770
making one stay vigilant.

813
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,150
I heard

814
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,230
that just over half a month ago,
this village

815
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,960
was thriving with men farming
and women weaving—

816
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,420
nothing like the ghostly state
it's in now.

817
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,970
In just half a month,

818
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,160
this once-flourishing village

819
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,920
has turned into this?

820
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,920
Yes, just half a month.

821
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,670
Miss Lin,

822
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,630
this is a serious matter.

823
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,150
Please tell us in detail

824
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,840
what exactly happened.

825
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,920
Granny said

826
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,590
that the village chief's son, Qiang,
went hunting in the mountains,

827
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,320
hunted a mountain fiend,
and provoked a mountain ghost.

828
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,250
That was more than half a month ago.

829
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,080
How could there be some mountain ghost?

830
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,630
-Qiang, I just…
-Out all day and found nothing!

831
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,110
Qiang.

832
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,720
Did something just pass by?

833
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,400
I think I saw a shadow over there.

834
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,460
Maybe we should...

835
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
we should go back.

836
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,470
Coward.

837
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,550
We agreed to
catch the mountain fiend together.

838
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,560
If you're scared,

839
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,710
go back by yourself.

840
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,320
No. I really saw a shadow.

841
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,540
Why is there nothing?

842
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,940
There's something.

843
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,530
Mountain ghost! Mountain ghost!

844
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,770
Yunmen?

845
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,250
Why did that mountain ghost
tell them to find our sect?

846
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,340
At that time, no one

847
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,960
took the mountain ghost's words seriously.

848
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,840
The young people in the village refused to
bow to superstition

849
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,100
and went up the mountain to investigate.

850
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,750
Five days later,

851
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,270
some of them died, while others went mad.

852
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,170
They even went to your sect for help
at that time.

853
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,440
Who would've thought

854
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,630
that half a month passed,

855
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,030
and none of you showed up?

856
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,770
So the so-called curse

857
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,510
had already spread unchecked.

858
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,910
Many young people in the village
have died.

859
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,760
The villagers hate us because of that,

860
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,130
so they kept driving us away this morning?

861
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,590
It's like
the house has already burned down

862
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,280
by the time the firefighters get there.

863
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
Understandably,

864
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,890
they should be quite angry.

865
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,210
If you ask me,

866
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,720
this has nothing to do with your sect.

867
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,060
Saving people is a kindness,

868
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,070
not an obligation.

869
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,780
Besides, the villagers

870
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,440
aren't unreasonable people.

871
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,000
The key is
that this village is just too strange.

872
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,230
Not only the young people
who went up the mountain,

873
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,180
but also the elderly, the weak,
and the disabled who didn't go

874
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,710
have fallen seriously ill.

875
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,460
The villagers went mad

876
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,820
upon hearing some flute music...

877
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,200
Could this flute music be similar

878
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,400
to the one played by Yuan Ying...
the Demon Yuan,

879
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,260
which can injure people's internal organs?

880
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,980
That's impossible.

881
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,110
Others heard it too.

882
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,650
Miss Lin, do you really believe
there's a curse?

883
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,450
Well...

884
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,970
I have no choice but to believe it,

885
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,500
given how many people
have fallen ill here.

886
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,880
Except for me, of course.

887
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,630
Then I must ask, Miss Lin,

888
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,550
why do the people of Yunyin Village think

889
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,610
we will surely die?

890
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,540
Isn't it obvious?

891
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,450
Naturally, the mountain ghost appeared
in their dreams and told them.

892
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,570
They all say

893
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,370
that at the foot of Yunmen's mountain
lies Yunyin Village,

894
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:10,430
hated by men and despised by spirits,

895
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,580
and that no one who enters ever returns.

896
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,260
Nonsense!

897
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,440
What mountain ghost and no return?

898
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,070
It's nothing more than someone

899
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,330
playing the ghost to rob and kill people.

900
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,400
Every scheme is targeting our sect.

901
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,550
Those who know would say
we're being framed,

902
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,280
but those who don't

903
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
would say our sect

904
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,920
doesn't deserve its position
as the Alliance Leader,

905
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,710
unable even to protect the people
living at the foot of our mountain.

906
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,420
Elder Shen, don't be angry.

907
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,110
Leave this small matter to us
to investigate.

908
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,110
Investigate. We must investigate.

909
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,440
Using these fabricated supernatural tales

910
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,150
to slander our sect.

911
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,360
This is outrageous!

912
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,190
I don't believe

913
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,320
a single word about this curse.

914
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,250
Mr. Shen!

915
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:49,780
Jiang Yu?

916
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,360
Senior Qin was fetching water
in the mountains,

917
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,190
and when he returned,
he was foaming at the mouth

918
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,190
and unconscious.

919
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,230
What?

920
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,350
Junior Jiang!

921
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,000
Quickly find a room to lay her down.

922
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,710
I'll examine her.

923
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,110
Hurry.

924
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:01,840
Okay.

925
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,980
Miss Lin, can Junior Jiang and Junior Qin

926
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,860
still be saved?

927
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,900
It really is a curse?

928
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,490
Miss Lin,

929
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,900
have you found anything?

930
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,520
Let me put it this way.

931
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,690
In the southwest,
there's a strange kind of insect.

932
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,480
If accidentally ingested,

933
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,810
it can cause confusion,

934
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,120
madness, and stupor.

935
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,320
At worst,

936
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,580
mere contact can be fatal.

937
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,440
Your disciples weren't so lucky.

938
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,200
They've run into those poisonous insects.

939
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,340
What kind of insect could be so deadly?

940
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,090
Why have I never seen it before?

941
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,990
This kind of harmful, poisonous insect

942
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,240
lives in colonies and is extremely tiny,

943
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,370
resembling powder,

944
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,230
and is called the rove beetle.

945
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,390
Elder Shen, since you haven't seen them,

946
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,300
you can count yourself lucky.

947
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,070
However...

948
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,730
I cannot cure this insect's poison.

949
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,000
Aren't you skilled at treating poisons?

950
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,150
If it were just poison,

951
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,610
I might be able to treat it,

952
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,520
but these rove beetles...

953
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,320
First, you need to find out

954
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,840
where you encountered them.

955
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,280
Only then can we find the queen beetle.

956
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,320
Because the queen will constantly produce
male beetles,

957
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,780
usually near
where the rove beetles gather.

958
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,150
Only by finding the queen

959
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,040
can we make an antidote.

960
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
But now,

961
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,730
you don't even know

962
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,860
where you encountered these beetles,

963
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,320
so how can you possibly find the queen?

964
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,000
That's true.

965
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,390
So my advice to you:

966
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,930
just give up

967
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,230
and forget about it.

968
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,510
No wonder

969
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,890
Mingyang and I recently searched
the entire village

970
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,230
but found nothing.

971
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,240
Turns out it was these

972
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,860
small poisonous beetles
that pick on the weak.

973
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,030
I wonder who your sect has offended

974
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,020
that someone would use rove beetles

975
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,800
against you.

976
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,410
It's quite a ruthless move.

977
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,940
Excuse me, I'll be going now.

978
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,600
She's just leaving like that?

979
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,710
Miss Lin. Miss Lin.

980
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,310
Miss Lin, thank you.

981
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,350
Elder Shen, what are you doing?

982
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:32,800
Elder Shen,

983
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,560
why are you doing this?

984
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,360
I was kindly helping you.

985
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,380
Instead of thanking me,

986
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,360
why are you sealing my acupoints?

987
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,640
Mr. Shen, is there some misunderstanding?

988
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,950
Kindly helping us?

989
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:42,890
Bah.

990
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,440
Lingyin, the Demonic Healer.

991
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,210
Your Shengyue Sect is truly ruthless.

992
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,440
Jiang Yan may be ignorant,

993
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,920
but do you think I'm equally clueless?

994
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,580
The rove beetles are from
your sect's Mount Yin.

995
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,750
How did they end up at the foot
of Yunmen's mountain?

996
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,760
Not only do you harm our fellow disciples,

997
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,960
but you also try to ruin our reputation.

998
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:01,970
And all that talk about

999
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:05,000
your Shengyue Sect seeking peace
with the Central Plains' martial world

1000
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,210
was just a facade.

1001
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,390
Tell me,

1002
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,870
what sinister scheme are you plotting?

1003
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,080
Jiang Yan!

1004
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,760
Stay away from her.

1005
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,110
Be careful not to fall for
this demoness's tricks.

1006
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,910
Mr. Shen, could you be mistaken?

1007
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,630
The Demonic Healer Lingyin is
supposed to be an old woman,

1008
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,650
yet Miss Lin is so young and beautiful.

1009
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,960
And she doesn't look like some old woman
who would devour children

1010
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,040
to preserve her youth
and prolong her life.

1011
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,810
Lin Yin, Mr. Shen is wrong,

1012
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,440
isn't he?

1013
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,820
Elder Shen, this is
all a misunderstanding.

1014
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,390
A misunderstanding?

1015
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,880
Let go of Lingyin!
