[Episode 9]

3
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,560
Buhuan,

4
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,229
you're the one I chose.

5
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:49,150
You're decisive and calculating.

6
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,350
I planned to entrust you

7
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,060
with Biluo Valley and Xuanxuan
after I'm gone.

8
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,510
But look,

9
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,920
what have you done?

10
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,750
I overestimated myself.

11
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,110
I didn't expect

12
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,360
there would still be people
helping Yuan Yingxing

13
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,160
after the fall of Shengyue Sect.

14
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,190
His escape

15
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,210
caught me completely off guard.

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,870
Chief,

17
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,640
please give me another chance.

18
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,560
Another chance?

19
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,400
I've given you

20
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,430
chance after chance.

21
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,840
All I wanted was Yuan Yingxing's head.

22
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,240
Was that so hard?

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,590
Now Yuan Yingxing has escaped.

24
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,360
The world is vast.

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,660
We can't even find him.

26
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,440
How are we supposed to kill him?

27
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,730
Yuan Yingxing is here.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,520
Chief,

29
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,280
lend me another team of elite archers.

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,910
Yuan Yingxing is injured.

31
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,570
If we surround and attack him,

32
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,870
no matter how capable he is,

33
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,030
we'll bring him down.

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Good.

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,560
Bring his head to me.

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,630
Yes, Chief.

37
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,550
You are all elite warriors
of Biluo Valley.

38
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,310
Taking down a wounded Yuan Yingxing

39
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,800
shouldn't be a problem.

40
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,360
He's directly south of here.

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,970
Once I locate him with my flute,

42
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,340
wait for my signal,

43
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,079
then we'll take him together!

44
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes!

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,310
Chief,

46
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,710
I've finally found you.

47
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,320
Gold Hall Master,
I heard you wanted to kill me?

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,430
Chief,

49
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,580
I swear I've always been loyal to you!

50
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,280
Since you're so loyal to me,

51
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,760
I'll just take out your heart
and see if it's true.

52
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,399
Release the arrows!

53
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,420
Spare me, Chief!

54
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm more useful than a dog, Chief.

55
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,680
Chief!

56
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,160
Jin Buhuan.

57
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,680
If you weren't a disciple
of the Shengyue Sect,

58
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,070
you'd be just like them.

59
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,690
You received Shengyue Sect's grace

60
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,950
but dared to betray me.

61
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,870
Tell me,

62
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,180
what should I do with you?

63
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,830
Have mercy, Chief.

64
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,240
I dare not...

65
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,120
I dare not...

66
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,710
A stray dog abandoned by its master—

67
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,610
who would want you now?

68
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,070
You said you needed manpower,

69
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,180
so I didn't hesitate

70
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,500
to send you archers.

71
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,040
You said you could kill Yuan Yingxing,

72
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,800
so I set a trap across all of Biluo Valley

73
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860
to help you!

74
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,360
But now, we've suffered heavy losses,

75
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,310
and all the archers have fallen.

76
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,040
Oh, Jin Buhuan.

77
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,970
What about your promises?

78
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,640
What about your guarantees?

79
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,409
Someone must have leaked our plan.

80
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,240
Otherwise, how could Yuan Yingxing
have escaped?

81
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,920
Chief,

82
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,310
give me another chance.

83
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,070
Chance?

84
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,400
I've already given you a chance.

85
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,960
Not only did you fail
to kill Yuan Yingxing—

86
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,600
look at yourself—

87
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,120
you lost an arm

88
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,440
and became a cripple.

89
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,950
Do you expect me to marry Xuanxuan

90
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,020
off to a cripple?

91
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,870
Young Chief is back.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,510
Father.

93
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,590
Where're the offerings?

94
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,000
Father, somehow

95
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,590
people from Yunmen found Qingmu Fortress.

96
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,000
They rescued

97
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,670
all nine children.

98
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,960
Luckily, everyone in Qingmu Fortress
is dead.

99
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,800
They won't find any clues.

100
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,870
You can't even watch over a few children.

101
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,930
Do you even deserve your family name?

102
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,040
Can you guarantee

103
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,730
those kids they took

104
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,040
won't say anything?

105
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,920
If they say anything,

106
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,610
then we

107
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,150
will be despised by everyone!

108
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,160
You,

109
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,680
go to Qinglai City immediately.

110
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,040
No matter what excuse you use,

111
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,950
wipe them out.

112
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,070
Kill those children!

113
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,070
We can't let them reveal our secret!

114
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,800
It's...

115
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,720
Go now!

116
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,910
Yes.

117
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,770
Xuanxuan.

118
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:24,920
Jin Buhuan!

119
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,600
Chief.

120
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,310
I'll give you one last chance.

121
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,240
Yuan Yingxing has been abandoned by all.

122
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,669
He's at the end of his rope.

123
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,530
As long as you kill Yuan Yingxing,

124
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,510
I'll personally officiate
your wedding with Xuanxuan.

125
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,960
But if you fail,

126
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,630
your engagement with her will be void.

127
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,790
Yes, Chief.

128
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,030
I will use all my strength

129
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,720
to make sure Yuan Yingxing dies
with no grave to be buried in.

130
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,910
Trust—

131
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,450
it's the most fragile thing in this world.

132
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,720
Everyone I trusted

133
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,550
has betrayed me.

134
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,600
Like you.

135
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,600
Like Jin Buhuan.

136
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,070
Yingxing?

137
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,610
You're back?

138
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,440
Why do you smell of blood?

139
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,260
What did Jin Buhuan do to you?

140
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,140
Get lost!

141
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,090
Yingxing,

142
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,270
what is this?

143
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
If you hadn't betrayed me,

144
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,800
this would've been your wedding token
from me—

145
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,570
the Shengyue Token of our sect.

146
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,030
Yingxing,

147
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,940
I never intended to betray you.

148
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Stay away from me.

149
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,120
Mr. Yang.

150
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,500
We're just leaving like this?

151
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,720
We're not even going to
tell Miss Yang and the others?

152
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,390
Didn't we say everything
that needed to be said yesterday?

153
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,220
But...

154
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:03,930
No buts.

155
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,390
If we keep stalling,
we'll delay reporting back again.

156
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,120
Enough talk.

157
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,670
Get the children on the carriage.

158
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,130
Let's leave immediately.

159
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,750
Mr. Yang.

160
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,840
We meet again.

161
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,460
Miss Lu? Why are you back?

162
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,360
Qinglai City isn't exactly close
to Yangliu Town.

163
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,750
My father was worried there
might be another incident,

164
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,670
so he sent me with people to assist
Yunmen in the escort.

165
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,800
What does that mean?

166
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,910
Are you saying you don't trust Yunmen?

167
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,820
Chief Lu means well.

168
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,360
Since it's his goodwill,

169
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,140
I'll respectfully accept it.

170
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,710
You two,
help the children into the carriage.

171
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,440
-Yes.
-Yes.

172
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,200
Mr. Yang,

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,940
it's raining so heavily.

174
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,100
There are so many kids here.

175
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,430
What if they catch cold?

176
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,360
Hurry and light a fire for them.

177
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,270
Mr. Yang,

178
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,290
the temple is leaking.

179
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,910
All the firewood is damp.
We can't light a fire.

180
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,360
Then figure something out.

181
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,020

Everyone, please calm down.

Don't push, don't panic.

218
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,860
Lu Xuanxuan has stolen
the spotlight again.

219
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,030
So annoying.

220
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,770
She's from a righteous sect.

221
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,660
Yang Qing wouldn't really embarrass
Biluo Valley, would he?

222
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,520
What so-called righteous sects?

223
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,210
Just a bunch of hypocrites.

224
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,920
Saintess,

225
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,330
just give the order,

226
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,910
and I'll kill whoever's
made you angry right now.

227
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,150
That's enough, Si.

228
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,660
Stop making trouble here.

229
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,640
Why did Yang Qing drive us away?

230
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,020
Yue didn't spell it out,

231
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,390
but don't you have a clue?

232
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,590
What... what did I do?

233
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,120
What did you do?

234
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,120
You're the Fire Hall Master
of Shengyue Sect.

235
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,310
Maybe Yang Qing is keeping his distance

236
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,810
from Yue because of you.

237
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,280
If it weren't for you,

238
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,310
maybe they'd have happily taken me

239
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,120
and Yue to Yunmen already.

240
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,440
Lingyin,

241
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,900
don't make such baseless accusations!

242
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,380
But ever since Si showed up,

243
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,670
Yang Qing hasn't treated me the same.

244
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,500
Right?

245
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,270
I even told him Si was my lover.

246
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,510
Why did you say that to him?

247
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,160
I just made it up
in the heat of the moment.

248
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,470
He wouldn't be jealous
over that, would he?

249
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,870
Not necessarily.

250
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,220
I think Yang Qing just simply

251
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,500
doesn't like people from Shengyue Sect.

252
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,870
But...

253
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,930
we can just let Si go alone, right?

254
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,630
He looks so fierce.

255
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,390
Just let him go alone.

256
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,000
You...

257
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,480
Saintess,

258
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,360
please let me stay by your side.

259
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,910
Fine, you can stay,

260
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,220
but don't cause any trouble.

261
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,420
Thank you, Saintess.

262
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,740
Does Yang Qing really not know
you're the Saintess?

263
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,750
Actually...

264
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,720
I think he's long guessed who I am.

265
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,460
But...

266
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,350
he doesn't seem to care that much.

267
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,450
Those lies you told him were so obvious.

268
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,940
You told him

269
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,610
your uncle has amazing skills

270
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,550
and that you met me through him.

271
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,260
I don't think anyone like that exists
in Shengyue Sect.

272
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,000
He'd be a fool not to be suspicious.

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,840
I don't care.

274
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,810
Since he hasn't said anything,
I'll just pretend he doesn't know.

275
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,360
Since he doesn't know,

276
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,060
I'll act like he has no doubts about me.

277
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,030
So what do we do next?

278
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,390
We can't just

279
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,590
keep secretly following him like this.

280
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,000
Tonight,

281
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,370
I'll take him down.

282
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,260
No matter what,
I'll make sure he takes us to Yunmen.

283
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,270
[Tianlin Garden]

284
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,590
You're awake?

285
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,140
Did you drug me?

286
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,270
I had no choice.

287
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,900
You wanted to part ways with me,

288
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,760
so I had to take drastic measures.

289
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,140
Today, I'm making things irreversible.

290
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,480
Let's see how you'll drive me away.

291
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,940
Yang Wangyue!

292
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,240
Call me Wangyue.

293
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,880
If you keep this up,

294
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,900
I might not let you off so easily.

295
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,450
I'll stop if you want,

296
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,040
but you have to promise me

297
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,930
to take me to Yunmen.

298
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,960
I know your worries.

299
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,440
I won't cause trouble for you.

300
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,750
Just take me with you.

301
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,780
I want to be by your side.

302
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,380
Yunmen isn't a place for fun.

303
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,490
I can't just take anyone there I want.

304
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,700
You're an elder of Yunmen.

305
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,430
If you say so,

306
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,100
how would they dare to refuse?

307
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,270
If you don't agree,

308
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,560
I'll just keep going.

309
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,550
I've given you a chance.

310
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,100
Are you going out on your own

311
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,430
or am I throwing you out?

312
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,010
You didn't get affected
by my sleeping powder?

313
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,000
Tomorrow,

314
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,990
I'll return to Yunmen.

315
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,110
You and your old lover

316
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,310
better keep a low profile.

317
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,990
Now that Shengyue Sect has fallen apart

318
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,680
and various factions
are rising in the martial world,

319
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,160
everyone wants Shengyue Sect

320
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,600
wiped out.

321
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,700
Did you suddenly drive me away
because of Mingyang?

322
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,200
No.

323
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,460
If you don't like Mingyang,

324
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,780
I can drive him away.

325
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,910
It has nothing to do with Mingyang.

326
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,400
Mingyang is good for you.

327
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,680
What are you talking about?

328
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,510
You clearly know that I was just joking
with you about Mingyang.

329
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,640
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

330
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,750
Talk to me.

331
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,210
Weren't we fine before?

332
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,350
There's a time for coming together
and parting.

333
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,480
We're simply not suited to continue
this journey together.

334
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,320
Not suited?

335
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,550
What do you mean by not suited?

336
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,750
Why aren't we suited?

337
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,880
Let's talk this through.

338
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,400
I've already said everything
that needs to be said.

339
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,420
Give me back the letter.

340
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,750
What letter? Is it more important than me?

341
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Give it back to me!

342
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,760
Did you suddenly drive me away
because of Yao Fu?

343
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,970
She's been gone for so long,

344
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,290
yet you're still thinking about her.

345
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,020
Are you afraid I might harm her?

346
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,290
This has nothing to do with Junior Yao.

347
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,160
Junior Yao?

348
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,610
You call me Yang Wangyue
but call her Junior Yao?

349
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,670
Is she close to you?

350
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,170
Closer than you are to me?

351
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,850
In terms of closeness,

352
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,400
I grew up with Junior Yao

353
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,550
and we will share the responsibilities
of Yunmen in the future.

354
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,750
Naturally, we're closer than you and I.

355
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,500
As for you,

356
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,070
we're just strangers who met by chance.

357
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,110
You have secrets you want to keep hidden,

358
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,040
which makes me have to be cautious.

359
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,590
Do you

360
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,480
understand now?

361
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,110
How could I not?

362
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,260
You mean

363
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,030
you and Yao Fu of Yunmen
are a perfect match,

364
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,640
while I'm just an unwanted village girl

365
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,170
who doesn't deserve
the esteemed Elder Yang!

366
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,480
Many things

367
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,240
aren't as simple as you think.

368
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,570
Then what are they like?

369
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,970
Haven't I been good enough to you?

370
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,790
Have you ever thought

371
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,610
I don't need your kindness?

372
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,440
I understand your feelings,

373
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,390
but other than gratitude,

374
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,390
I can't give you any other response.

375
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,300
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,550
Yang Qing,

377
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,270
you'll regret

378
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,440
treating me this way.

379
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,310
Young lady,

380
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,400
why are you so drunk?

381
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,110
Yue.

382
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,830
Lingyin,

383
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,350
come here.

384
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,150
What's wrong?

385
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,640
Come, sit here.

386
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,110
Come and drink with me.

387
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,830
Be careful.

388
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,190
Yue, what's wrong?

389
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,940
Did Yang Qing reject you again?

390
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,660
Just look at yourself.

391
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,510
Bah!

392
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,110
That bastard Yang Qing!

393
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,510
What right does he have
to treat me like this?

394
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,550
What right does he have to reject me?

395
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,750
I am the honorable Saintess.

396
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,790
I am the honorable Saintess!

397
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,110
Am I really not as good as Yao Fu?

398
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,590
That clingy, annoying woman Yao Fu again.

399
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,440
It was my fault for being unskilled

400
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,200
and getting caught by her
when I was trying to poison her.

401
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,640
So I couldn't avenge you.

402
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,140
Next time I get a chance,

403
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,440
I'll beat her up good.

404
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,360
There, there.

405
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,710
Stop crying, alright?

406
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,310
Lingyin.

407
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,790
I'm here.

408
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,830
Why am I so miserable?

409
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,290
Don't be sad, Yue.

410
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,440
I should have just died.

411
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,750
I should have just died.

412
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,280
Somehow I survived,

413
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,120
but when I woke up,
my martial skills were gone,

414
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,090
and Shengyue Sect was gone too.

415
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,660
Luckily you're here.

416
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,340
I'm here.

417
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,790
I'll always be here.

418
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,160
I'll always stay by your side.

419
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,610
In my current state,

420
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,830
how can I save the people
of Shengyue Sect?

421
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,400
I don't even know how to save them.

422
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,160
And Yang Qing,

423
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,350
I almost gave him my heart.

424
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,970
How could he treat me like that?

425
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,480
Exactly.

426
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,440
He even called me Miss Yang.

427
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,240
Alright.

428
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,000
Just don't like him anymore, okay?

429
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,790
I won't like him anymore.

430
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,240
Okay, don't like him.

431
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,500
Don't like him, alright?

432
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,450
Whoever you like,

433
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,310
wherever he is,

434
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,840
I'll find him for you, okay?

435
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,350
No.

436
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,110
Others are not as good-looking
as Yang Qing,

437
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,770
nor do they have the Sun Blade.

438
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,510
So, what do you want?

439
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,810
Tell me and I'll do it.

440
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,640
I... I...

441
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,480
I want him to never be able to leave me!

442
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,940
Never be able to leave you?

443
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,310
Alright.

444
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,400
Does it mean any method is allowed?

445
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,920
He treats me like this.

446
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,350
Why should I care about the methods?

447
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,350
You've finally come to your senses.

448
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,790
Before when I suggested drugging him,

449
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,250
you couldn't bear to do it.

450
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,110
Yue,

451
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,730
give me a little more time.

452
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,640
Wait for me.

453
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,900
Once I finish refining
the Compliance Pill,

454
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,720
-everything will be fine.
-Yang Qing.

455
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,000
You won't have to worry anymore.

456
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,310
Silly girl.

457
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,130
[Tianlin Garden]

458
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,110
Shang Huai,

459
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,950
did you hear
any strange sounds last night?

460
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,030
It was hard not to hear.

461
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,330
It went on all night.

462
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,720
That crying—

463
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,680
I really wanted to go out and check,

464
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,610
but I was afraid it'd be too abrupt.

465
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,440
Guys!

466
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,460
Surround them all.

467
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,120
Don't let a single one escape!

468
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,430
District Leader,

469
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,210
what are you doing?

470
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,270
Why are you blocking us?

471
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,030
Your words mean nothing.

472
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,750
Where is Yang Qing?

473
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,400
Yang Qing must give us
an explanation today!

474
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,350
Yes, we demand an explanation!

475
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,680
What's going on here?

476
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,890
How did you save those kids?

477
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,350
The kids you brought back
were covered in sores and pus,

478
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,900
and they infected their families.

479
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,470
Take responsibility!

480
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,420
They must be held accountable!

481
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,150
They must be held accountable!

482
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,370
Gentlemen,

483
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,640
could you let us go out

484
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,550
and see what's wrong with the children?

485
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,800
No way!

486
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
They can't go out!

487
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,890
Yes, exactly!

488
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,000
They can't go out.

489
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,530
Mr. Yang,

490
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,900
when we brought
the children back yesterday,

491
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,830
they were all fine, not sick at all.

492
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,030
Gentlemen,

493
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,880
have you called a doctor for the children?

494
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,740
No matter what,

495
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,050
you brought them back.

496
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,340
Clearly, you were trying to harm us!

497
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,070
Right, you have to take responsibility!

498
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,000
That's slander!

499
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,510
Why would Yunmen

500
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,720
use such dirty tricks

501
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,590
to harm you?

502
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,830
Who knows what you were thinking!

503
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,460
All we know is we got the children
from you.

504
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,960
-You have to take responsibility!
-Yes!

505
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,990
You must take responsibility!

506
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,450
Take responsibility!

507
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,180
You must take responsibility!

508
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,160
They deserved it.

509
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,690
Let them have a taste of what it feels
like to be falsely accused.

510
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,000
This plague is far too strange.

511
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,350
Someone must be behind it.

512
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,740
You're really not going to help them?

513
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,960
I couldn't care less.

514
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,480
But Mr. Yang...

515
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,400
Stop bringing up Mr. Yang.

516
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,110
I don't care about him at all.

517
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,440
Forget it.

518
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,780
I'll go ask Fan Hao.

519
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,130
You and Mingyang wait here for me.

520
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,750
Didn't you just say you weren't
going to help him?

521
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,400
If we don't help them,
we won't get the Sun Blade.

522
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,600
I think you just can't let go of someone.

523
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,380
Yunmen's such a hassle.

524
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,440
We should just listen to me

525
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,350
and barge in there to take it.

526
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,960
You know how weak I am.

527
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,680
Do you really think

528
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
you could steal it

529
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,160
from Yunmen on your own?

530
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,600
Besides,

531
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,410
the Saintess told us to wait.

532
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,960
So just wait quietly

533
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,660
and stop causing trouble.

534
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,920
It's sweet. Want some?

535
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,590
No.

536
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,600
Fine, suit yourself.

537
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,830
How long has the Saintess been gone?

538
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,030
She's still not back.

539
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,590
Fan Hao's so slow.

540
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
I'll go check on them.

541
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Masters,

542
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,270
are you talking behind my back again?

543
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Why are you alone?

544
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,240
Where is the Saintess?

545
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,520
-She went to...
-What's going on with this plague anyway?

546
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,040
She...

547
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,240
Well,

548
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,850
whose question should I answer first?

549
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,070
Alright.

550
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,600
I'll explain one by one.

551
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,550
The local doctors

552
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,790
believe the children have caught a plague.

553
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,750
If it spreads,

554
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,940
the consequences will be unimaginable.

555
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,180
They've locked all the infected people

556
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,650
in a courtyard

557
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,960
and said

558
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,270
to just let them die on their own.

559
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,590
The district leader was hesitant,

560
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,680
but the doctors told him

561
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,940
if they didn't do this,

562
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,960
the entire town could be infected.

563
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,310
So he agreed.

564
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,110
But if you ask me,

565
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,160
it's likely someone deliberately
poisoned them

566
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,480
to frame Yunmen.

567
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,160
Where is the Saintess now?

568
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,110
She went to the courtyard
where the infected are held.

569
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,550
She told me to bring
Water Hall Master there immediately.

570
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,270
Water Hall Master, come with me.

571
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,800
Let's go.

572
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,650
Fire Hall Master, have some chicken.

573
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,680
Let's go.

574
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,210
Let's go.

575
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,900
We're here.

576
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,400
Um, Fire Hall Master,

577
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,310
chicken.

578
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:24,930
Who are you?

579
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,400
Thanks for your hard work.

580
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,200
Could you do me a favor?

581
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,440
Um, I have two friends
who want to go in and take a look.

582
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,630
Here's a little something—

583
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,110
some of the best roast chicken.

584
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,160
Here, please accept it.

585
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,240
No, we can't accept it.

586
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,960
It's not that we don't want
to help you, Mr. Fan.

587
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,440
We only let one in before

588
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,400
out of respect for you.

589
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,440
The doctor found out

590
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,240
and gave us both a good scolding.

591
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,310
Mr. Fan,

592
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,970
please don't put us
in a difficult position.

593
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,880
You...

594
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,720
Sir.

595
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,400
I'm a doctor.

596
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,000
I enjoy treating difficult
and unusual cases.

597
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,790
Listen,

598
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,720
there's crying all over the courtyard.

599
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,450
Just let me go in and take a look.

600
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,720
Miss,

601
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,020
everyone is sick inside.

602
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,510
Are you really going in?

603
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,950
Listen to yourself.

604
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,590
What haven't doctors seen before?

605
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,760
Sir,

606
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,270
please be kind

607
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,230
and let us in, will you?

608
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,110
Alright, alright.

609
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,640
Go ahead.

610
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:19,960
Mingyang.

611
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,160
Well,

612
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,880
both of you will go in,

613
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,200
but there's no one outside
to back you up, right?

614
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,030
How about this?

615
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,480
I'll wait outside for you,

616
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,070
okay?

617
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,420
I won't leave.

618
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,550
Coward.

619
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,750
Mingyang, let's go.

620
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,400
I...

621
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,730
Sir.

622
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,920
Here's a little something—
some delicious roast chicken.

623
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,830
No, we can't accept it.

624
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,880
Come on, take it.

625
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,640
Take it, bro.

626
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,550
It's the best.

627
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,440
I've got more chicken stewing in the pot.

628
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,050
Can it be cured, doctor?

629
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,200
How is it?

630
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
Someone definitely poisoned them.

631
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,440
Can you cure this poison?

632
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,070
Yes.

633
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,550
But I have to first bleed them

634
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,320
and use silver needles
to draw out the poison.

635
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,920
Mr. Yang.

636
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,560
They've sealed the ward now

637
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,770
and said they'll burn it

638
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,440
as a sacrifice to the heavens.

639
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,700
These troublemakers!

640
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,270
Why don't we just break out

641
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,830
and see what's really happening?

642
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,240
We can't force our way out.

643
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,750
And we must avoid conflict
with the villagers.

644
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,310
Mr. Yang,

645
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,340
we can't just stay here waiting, can we?

646
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:37,980
How about this?

647
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,000
I'll sneak out and see what's happening.

648
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,880
Absolutely not.

649
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,790
Forget it.

650
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,690
There are guards everywhere.

651
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,220
Besides, your lightness skill is terrible.

652
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,420
You'd be caught before you even got out.

653
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,330
Jiang Yan, come with me
to investigate what's happening.

654
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,730
The rest of you stay here.

655
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,560
Remember,

656
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,160
do not engage in any conflict with them.

657
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,640
Yes.

658
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,280
Mr. Yang, look.

659
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,330
Miss Yang and Miss Lin
are taking care of the patients.

660
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,240
Everyone else is staying far away
from the patients.

661
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,030
These two are quite bold.

662
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,830
Miss Yang and Miss Lin

663
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,580
are both kindhearted people.

664
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,720
They're nothing like what Shang Huai said—

665
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,250
how anyone tied to Shengyue Sect
must be evil.

666
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,830
Shang Huai's words were a bit extreme.

667
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,460
Mr. Yang,

668
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,440
do you think the Shengyue Sect
isn't as bad as they say?

669
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,040
Throughout our journey,

670
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,080
we've seen they're not pure evil.

671
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,260
Maybe it's just a matter

672
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,520
of different positions and approaches.

673
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,000
There's no absolute good or bad.

674
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:50,970
Mr. Yang,

675
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,920
I think we should

676
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,270
take Miss Lin and Miss Yang
back to Yunmen.

677
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,850
With you watching them,

678
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,750
they wouldn't dare to do anything.

679
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,750
It's just that...

680
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,430
Miss Yang and Ms. Yao
always fight when they meet.

681
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,530
That's not ideal.

682
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,550
Your Ms. Yao has been on a separate route
from us for days.

683
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,680
I got a carrier pigeon from her yesterday,

684
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,480
but something about it felt off.

685
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,350
Enough talk.

686
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,780
Let's go help them.

687
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:32,940
Here.

688
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,170
You like it?

689
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,820
It's yours now.

690
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,680
Really?

691
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,030
I'll burn this as an offering

692
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,630
when you're dead.

693
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,400
Jin Buhuan,

694
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,370
I know you're there.

695
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,590
Come out.

696
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,320
Chief.

697
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,710
I was blinded before.

698
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,409
I listened to Biluo Valley's lies.

699
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,110
I thought if I killed you,

700
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
they'd release

701
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,630
the brothers locked in the dungeon.

702
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,760
Now I understand.

703
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,650
There's only one person

704
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,929
in this world who can save Shengyue Sect.

705
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,199
Punish me however you want.

706
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,530
Just trust me one more time.

707
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,760
From now on, no matter the danger,

708
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,960
I won't hesitate to do anything for you.

709
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,290
So you're saying

710
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,560
you tried to kill me
to help Shengyue Sect?

711
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,630
I should thank you
on behalf of Shengyue Sect.

712
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,670
I dare not.

713
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,960
I only wanted

714
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,370
to find a way out for Shengyue Sect,

715
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,920
so I took this desperate measure.

716
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,650
If you don't believe me—

717
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,210
here's the map of Biluo Valley.

718
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,490
I've marked the location of the dungeon.

719
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,650
Since the day the Shengyue Sect
was wiped out,

720
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,180
I've never stopped wanting

721
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,640
to rescue our brothers

722
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,590
and revive the sect.

723
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,960
Yingxing,

724
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,070
watch out. It might be a trap.

725
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,990
The affairs of Shengyue Sect aren't
for you to meddle with.

726
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,110
You, open the map.

727
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,320
Yes, Chief.

728
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,510
Chief, look.

729
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,090
The brothers are locked up in the lower
right corner of the map.

730
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,230
Chief.

731
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,220
[Map of Biluo Valley]

732
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,370
Yuan Yingxing,

733
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,800
today is your death day!

734
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,490
Yingxing!

735
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,810
-Yingxing
-I'll kill you!

736
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,570
You're looking for death!

737
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,930
For the sake of our years together,

738
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,320
I'll leave your body intact.

739
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,250
You actually think you can kill me?

740
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,840
You crippled this arm of mine.

741
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,760
How will you pay for that?

742
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,450
You can't save me. Get out of here!

743
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,790
Trust me!

744
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,890
You go rest. I'll take over.

745
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,560
Here.

746
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,510
Thank you.

747
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,030
Child, come.

748
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,920
Here.

749
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,540
Thank you.

750
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,670
Thank you.

751
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,670
Here, girl.

752
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,300
Are they really cured now?

753
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,070
District Leader, if you're worried,

754
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,470
we can stay a few more days

755
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,970
until they fully recover.

756
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,110
Thank you so much, Mr. Yang.

757
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,230
Thank you.

758
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,870
I'll go check on them.

759
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,590
Okay.

760
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,080
Why are you avoiding me?

761
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,630
You heartless man.

762
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,550
I'm just worried about you,
and you don't even understand.

763
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,950
So heartless.

764
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,590
Wasting my kindness.

765
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,340
Are you talking badly about me?

766
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,960
No, I'm not.

767
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,330
Looks like I need to find a teacher
who speaks the dialect

768
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,460
and learn properly.

769
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,010
At least next time,

770
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,640
when someone talks badly about me,

771
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,640
I can understand.

772
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,780
That's not necessary.

773
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,710
It is necessary.

774
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,230
When you talk badly about me,
I don't even understand what you're saying.

775
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,230
You must be so lonely and miserable.

776
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,670
Fine.

777
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,410
I'll say it again in words
you can understand.

778
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,450
You're fickle,

779
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,420
a scoundrel in fancy clothes, a hypocrite

780
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,650
playing both sides,

781
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,170
showing two faces when it suits you.

782
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,760
Now I don't want to deal with you,
is that okay?

783
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,710
Are you done?

784
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,040
You know so many idioms now?

785
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,850
Not an illiterate village girl anymore?

786
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,710
Who says village girls can't read?

787
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,880
You never said anything
when I was reading novels before.

788
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,540
That's discrimination
against village girls.

789
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,120
As an elder of Yunmen,
you barged into my room—

790
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,480
who do you think you are?

791
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,560
Who was the one

792
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,230
who used to beg to marry me?

793
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,230
Now I don't want it.

794
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,700
Get out of here right now.

795
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,090
Wangyue,

796
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,970
I came in by my own strength.

797
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,130
What right do you have to throw me out?

798
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,960
What did you just say?

799
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,700
You're not calling me Miss Yang anymore?

800
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,360
Think about it yourself.

801
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,670
You finally changed how you call me

802
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,470
and started calling me Wangyue?

803
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,400
Yes, Wangyue.

804
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,190
Now that you're calling me Wangyue,

805
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,960
does that mean

806
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,030
you've agreed to marry me?

807
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,060
Didn't you just refuse to marry me?

808
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,670
That's not right.

809
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,510
Even if you agreed,

810
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,020
there's still something ambiguous

811
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,300
between you and Yao Fu.

812
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,360
So, why are you here?

813
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,150
Wangyue,

814
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,590
thank you for helping
Yunmen out of trouble.

815
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,840
On my way here,
I saw someone selling lotus cakes.

816
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,350
I heard girls love them,

817
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,200
so I bought some for you.

818
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I don't like them.

819
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,190
Take your stuff and go.

820
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,400
You've worked hard these days.

821
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,320
Get some rest.

822
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,150
I won't disturb you anymore.

823
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,510
I'll leave the lotus cakes here.

824
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,710
Eat them if you want,

825
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,440
throw them away if you don't.

826
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,440
I'm leaving.

827
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,940
He finally called me Wangyue.
