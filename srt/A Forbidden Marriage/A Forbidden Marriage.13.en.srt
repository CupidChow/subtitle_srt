[A Forbidden Marriage]

2
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,950
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,860
Chief Yuan, I want to talk with you

4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,440
about a collaboration
between Yunmen and Shengyue Sect.

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
A collaboration?

6
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,509
No.

7
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
You haven't even heard me out.

8
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,759
Why reject me outright?

9
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,000
In fact, if our two sects work together,

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,640
the benefits would be split evenly
between us.

11
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,310
Still no.

12
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,710
Why?

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,960
Matters of Shengyue Sect

14
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,940
are not for me alone to decide.

15
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,400
Chief Yuan,

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,130
you don't need
to use such a clumsy excuse.

17
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,520
Shengyue Sect
has always revered its chief above all.

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,850
Your words carry unquestionable weight.

19
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,650
Is there some difficulty
you can't speak of?

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,590
If so,

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,650
I am willing to help.

22
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,090
So even the lofty Elder Yang of Yunmen

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,329
has a time when he must ask for help?

24
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,960
Aren't you so-called righteous sects
supposed to be formidable?

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,800
Fighting and killing—
that's how it's always been.

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,130
Why would I work with you

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,530
to bring trouble upon myself?

28
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,190
Indeed, there were grudges
between our sects in the past.

29
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,680
So you harbor resentment.

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,310
I understand.

31
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,240
But this matter is of great importance.

32
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,079
I hope you'll consider it

33
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,360
from a long-term perspective.

34
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,010
I can agree—

35
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,260
on one condition:

36
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,070
make me the alliance leader.

37
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,329
How could Chief be with Yao Fu?

38
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,610
I think
Chief and Saintess are a better match.

39
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,400
Chief's thoughts aren't something
we can guess.

40
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,050
From my many years of experience,

41
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,290
Chief still hasn't completely cut ties
with Yao Fu.

42
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,890
He has feelings for Saintess too,

43
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,930
but I think it's a different kind.

44
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,070
All this love and romance—so complicated.

45
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,340
I think
if Chief and Saintess were together,

46
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,870
the world would be at peace.

47
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,280
Who do you think Saintess will choose?

48
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,820
According to the rules of our sect,

49
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,470
Saintess should be with Chief.

50
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,080
And now,

51
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,190
we need them to work together
to restore our sect to its former glory.

52
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,750
But Saintess is so fond of Yang Qing.

53
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,120
And Yang Qing is from Yunmen.

54
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,290
They're from completely different worlds.

55
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,160
It's a tough call.

56
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,140
Tell me, who should Saintess choose?

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
If you don't understand

58
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,140
matters of love, stop meddling.

59
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,280
Just keep your eyes open, all right?

60
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,880
Who says I don't understand?

61
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,710
I heard everything you just said.

62
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,740
Yuan Yingxing, you've gone too far.

63
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,800
You didn't even ask
what kind of collaboration it was

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,720
and just refused outright.

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,510
The first thing you opened your mouth
was to give him a hard time.

66
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,159
You want to be the alliance leader?

67
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,620
Why didn't you say
you want to be the emperor?

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,430
So you mean

69
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,780
I can't be the alliance leader?

70
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,420
You...

71
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,280
You just dislike Yang Qing.

72
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,700
You don't treat Yao Fu like this.

73
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,910
That's different.

74
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,320
How is it different?

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,000
Isn't it still collaboration?

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,860
Back then, our sect was thriving.

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,800
In the martial world,

78
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,650
we could
stand on equal footing with Yunmen.

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,020
So we had the confidence
to discuss collaboration.

80
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,280
But now, Yunmen is powerful,

81
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,770
and our sect is scattered and in disarray.

82
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,100
What do we have to discuss collaboration?

83
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,240
And how do I know Yang Qing

84
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,900
won't take the chance
to wipe us out completely?

85
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,310
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

86
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,630
Even if he's willing,

87
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,370
Yunmen won't agree.

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
Even if Yunmen agrees,

89
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,020
the other three of the four major sects

90
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,750
won't agree.

91
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,570
When that happens,

92
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,750
he'll be the one in trouble.

93
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,120
You have a point.

94
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,040
But...

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,480
haven't you always wanted

96
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,600
to win Shengyue Sect
a legitimate, honorable name?

97
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,830
That was in the past.

98
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,270
I tried to clear Shengyue Sect's name

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,860
and extend an olive branch for peace,

100
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,890
but what was the result?

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,720
Yao Fu tried to kill you.

102
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
The other martial sects

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,660
took the chance to wipe us out.

104
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,000
Is that what they call
justice and righteousness?

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,060
I have no use for it.

106
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
Yang Qing is different.

107
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,600
Trust me.

108
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,890
Even if Yang Qing is different,

109
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,190
by himself,

110
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,750
can he persuade Yunmen
and the entire martial world?

111
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,680
How would you know if you don't try?

112
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,610
Yuan Yingxing,

113
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,390
Shengyue Sect is not what it once was.

114
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,450
Don't forget

115
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,409
we still have people imprisoned
in Biluo Valley.

116
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,040
If we clash head-on now,

117
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,840
our chances of winning are slim.

118
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,510
As long as you and I are here,

119
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,110
Shengyue Sect won't perish.

120
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,180
Indeed, it won't perish,

121
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,820
but must we keep living like this,

122
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,350
hiding from place to place?

123
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,080
Yue,

124
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,580
I wronged you before.

125
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,360
In the future,

126
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,830
I'll make it up to you properly.

127
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,210
How will you make it up to me?

128
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,900
How about this?

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,120
I can collaborate with Yunmen,

130
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,500
but on one condition:

131
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,950
you must return to Shengyue Sect with me.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,720
Okay.

133
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,680
Listen to me.

134
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,740
Once we return,

135
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,260
I will close off the mountain,

136
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,120
completely isolating Shengyue Sect
from the outside world,

137
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,250
cutting all dealings with outsiders.

138
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,070
I will overhaul Shengyue Sect
from the ground up.

139
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,270
It might take 5 years,

140
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,190
or even 10.

141
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,550
From then on, I will leave Yao Fu,
and you will leave Yang Qing.

142
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,010
We will no longer involve ourselves
in the disputes of the martial world,

143
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,870
and focus solely
on setting Shengyue Sect in order.

144
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,430
Why close off the mountain?

145
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,960
Why can't it be like before?

146
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,580
Shengyue Sect is in chaos right now.

147
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,320
Even with Yunmen's help,

148
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,240
we can't withstand the combined assault
of the other sects.

149
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,840
Am I right?

150
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,590
What?

151
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,110
You don't want to return with me?

152
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,310
I do.

153
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,600
But you can't give up Yang Qing.

154
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,570
Why should I give him up?

155
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,000
Others hate Shengyue Sect

156
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,630
and refuse to reason with us,

157
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,159
but Yang Qing is different.

158
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,450
He thinks,

159
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,539
he strategizes, and he understands.

160
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,559
I don't see the need
to close off the mountain.

161
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,240
Let's discuss it again.

162
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,080
Am I the chief, or is he?

163
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,390
You are.

164
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,270
Shengyue Sect is yours.

165
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,220
I won't fight you for it,

166
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,800
nor try to take it from you.

167
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,160
You're wrong.

168
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,800
Shengyue Sect isn't mine.

169
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,200
It's ours.

170
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,240
If you want Shengyue Sect,

171
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
just say the word.

172
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,420
I won't give it to anyone else,

173
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
but if you want it,

174
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,810
I'll give it to you without hesitation.

175
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:19,870
Okay?

176
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,910
Stop coaxing me like a child.

177
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,450
So you agree to return with me?

178
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,880
I need to think about it.

179
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,150
Yue.

180
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,690
Sometimes I truly feel
there's no meaning in anything.

181
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,670
Everyone in the world fears me,

182
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,440
even the people from Shengyue Sect.

183
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,840
They fear me and avoid me.

184
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,730
At least before, I had you by my side.

185
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,720
Now,

186
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,150
even you want to leave me?

187
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,320
I...

188
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,400
Give me a little more time.

189
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,990
I'll think about
how to explain to Yang Qing.

190
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,360
Here's the last dish.

191
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,630
Yang Qing, have a seat.

192
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:26,790
Okay.

193
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,500
Your cooking is still as good as ever.

194
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,080
Eat.

195
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,790
Eat more.

196
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,670
Here.

197
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,320
Let me try.

198
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,330
Delicious.

199
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,640
Then eat more.

200
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,450
Here, you try some too.

201
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:53,970
Yue,

202
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
I want to eat this.

203
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,050
Isn't it right in front of you?

204
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,510
Can't you get it yourself?

205
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,290
It tastes better when you serve it.

206
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,460
Thanks.

207
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Happy now?

208
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,600
I also want to eat this, this,

209
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,330
and that one.

210
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,060
Am I just here to serve you?

211
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,440
Don't I get to eat?

212
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,200
I saw you were only serving food
to someone else just now,

213
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,660
so I thought you were full.

214
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,620
I just served Yang Qing.

215
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,080
Do you have to make such a fuss,
Yuan Yingxing?

216
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,130
If you're full,

217
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,210
go back and simmer my medicine.

218
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,220
I'll eat. I'll eat.

219
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,150
You eat more too.

220
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,960
Stop talking.

221
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,140
You eat too.

222
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,450
The people from Biluo Valley

223
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,980
haven't caught up to us yet,

224
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,350
but it's still not safe here.

225
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,150
Saintess,

226
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,750
what's our next move?

227
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,340
Stop talking.

228
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,880
No.

229
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,990
Not... Not Saintess.

230
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,270
I... I meant...

231
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,050
I meant... the remaining...

232
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,840
I... I...

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
I already know her identity.

234
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,640
All this pretending

235
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,460
is exhausting even for me just watching.

236
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,750
So,

237
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,810
you knew she is Wang Yue long ago?

238
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,520
When it comes to acting skills,

239
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,690
no one here

240
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,600
can match you, Miss Yao.

241
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,360
Since everyone already knows,

242
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
there's no need to pretend anymore.

243
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,820
Chief, what's your next plan?

244
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,570
Return to Mount Yin.

245
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,770
Will Saintess go back too?

246
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,900
What about Mr. Yang?

247
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,080
Mingyang.

248
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,640
Of course Saintess
will return to Shengyue Sect.

249
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,460
After we return,
we'll close off the mountain.

250
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,340
Maybe for 5 years, maybe for 10.

251
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,630
We'll never set foot beyond it again.

252
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,320
Is that so, Wangyue?

253
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,430
Yang Qing,

254
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,120
try this.

255
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,400
Don't listen to his nonsense.

256
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,960
This dish is very delicious.

257
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,820
You must try it.

258
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,320
Here.

259
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,600
What kinds of dishes are these?

260
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,340
How can they compare
to the food in Shengyue Sect?

261
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:30,740
Yue,

262
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,850
you've suffered these past months.

263
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,290
After we return,

264
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,080
I'll get you some master chefs

265
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,750
to cook something different every day,
so you'll never get tired of it.

266
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,180
I...

267
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,320
I like eating vegetarian food
with Yang Qing.

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,600
Is that so?

269
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:01,840
Chief,

270
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,000
your internal injuries haven't healed,

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,290
and with Biluo Valley after us,

272
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,050
perhaps it's better

273
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,120
to wait until you're fully recovered
before making decisions.

274
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,810
Take your medicine.

275
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,100
Senior, do you need help?

276
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
I'll do it myself.

277
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,610
I'm really curious.

278
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,610
How can you tolerate someone like her?

279
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,080
Junior Yao, if you can't stand her,

280
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,440
you can return to Yunmen.

281
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,640
Sect Leader Feng always asks about you.

282
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,200
Yuan Yingxing is about
to take Yang Wangyue

283
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
back to Mount Yin.

284
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,670
Don't tell me
you still want to maintain ties with her.

285
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,990
I know what I'm doing.

286
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,210
Once Shengyue Sect
closes off the mountain,

287
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,360
you may never see Yang Wangyue again.

288
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,480
Why are you suddenly concerned about this?

289
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,400
Weren't you the one

290
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,860
most against Wangyue and me
being together?

291
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,430
Is this about Yuan Yingxing?

292
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,080
Senior, why deflect this onto me?

293
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,910
I'm just curious

294
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,970
about how you can stand her fickleness—

295
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,410
whispering sweet words to you

296
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,120
and then saying

297
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,650
she'll leave with Yuan Yingxing.

298
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,030
She just hasn't figured it out yet.

299
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,200
When she does,

300
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,270
she'll explain everything to me.

301
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,599
When she figures it out?

302
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,470
And when will that be?

303
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,609
Maybe she can't even after she leaves.

304
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,470
She and Yuan Yingxing

305
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,150
fought their way
through piles of corpses together

306
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,980
to get where they are now.

307
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,030
Are you sure you can match

308
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,170
that kind of life-and-death bond?

309
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,290
I trust her.

310
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,830
Senior,

311
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,990
actually, I can help you.

312
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,510
Come on, let me.

313
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,310
Junior Yao, is your hand okay?

314
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,070
It's fine, just a little burn.

315
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,440
Yuan Yingxing, drink it yourself!

316
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,900
I'll go find you some ointment for burns.

317
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,640
It hurts a bit.

318
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,340
Yao Fu!

319
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,280
Wangyue.

320
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,320
Wangyue!

321
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,380
How long
are you going to keep avoiding me?

322
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,860
I'm not avoiding you.

323
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,000
No?

324
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,820
Then why have you been

325
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,580
secretly watching me lately?

326
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,440
Is there something you want to tell me?

327
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,220
You haven't figured out how to say it?

328
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,790
Is it
you haven't figured out how to say it

329
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,000
or are you planning to be a coward

330
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,070
and leave without saying a word?

331
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,680
No, no.

332
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
I really haven't figured it out yet.

333
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,710
Then let me speak.

334
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,200
Yang Qing.

335
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,600
This...
This is your first time kissing me.

336
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,890
Am I dreaming?

337
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,070
Are you dreaming?

338
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,000

372
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,340
In front of you, I've dropped all my airs.

373
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,500
My pride's been ground down into the dust.

♪ I want to be with you ♪

381
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,890
Since you think this is a dream,

382
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,380
let it last a little longer.

383
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,960
I don't think

384
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,270
our relationship

385
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,530
has reached the point of marriage talks.

386
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,130
When you can explain

387
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,540
the mountain closure matter clearly,

388
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,230
come to me.

389
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,510
Yang Qing,

390
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,880
you're a grown man.

391
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,130
Why are you being so fussy?

392
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,130
You're not straightforward at all.

393
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,030
Even if you beg to marry me in the future,

394
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,880
you'll have to wait in line!

395
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,270
Remember how you treat me today.

396
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,900
In the future,

397
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,430
I'll treat you the same way!

398
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,630
Yingxing,

399
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,130
Lingyin said

400
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,500
the dosage was measured exactly.

401
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,390
One bit more or less won't work.

402
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,120
Why did you spill it all?

403
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,170
So what if I spilt it?

404
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,620
Why are you still here?

405
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,320
In the past, you wouldn't let me leave.

406
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,830
Really?

407
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,350
I forgot.

408
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,450
How are your injuries?

409
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,450
Let me take a look.

410
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,210
This is not
how Lingyin checked my injuries.

411
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,770
Where's the Shengyue Token?

412
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,300
You didn't lose it, did you?

413
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,990
You seem very concerned
about the Shengyue Token these days.

414
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,340
The martial world is in chaos.

415
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,420
The Shengyue Token
represents Shengyue Sect.

416
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,220
If it falls into the wrong hands,

417
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,260
it could cause great trouble.

418
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,660
How fake.

419
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,790
I'm concerned about our betrothal token.

420
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,030
What's wrong with that?

421
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,030
Betrothal token?

422
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,480
Even if it's a betrothal token,

423
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,810
it's a betrothal token between me and Yue!

424
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,710
You want to marry her?

425
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,390
You want to steal Yang Wangyue
from Yang Qing?

426
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,320
You like her?

427
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,880
The marriage
between Shengyue Sect's chief and saintess

428
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,280
is our sect's tradition.

429
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,430
If we're talking about stealing,

430
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,430
it's Yang Qing who stole my Yue.

431
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,450
Yingxing,

432
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,590
you don't love her at all.

433
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:44,550
Love?

434
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,310
That's something too fake and fleeting.

435
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,830
Among people, it's just mutual use.

436
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,160
Entrusting one's life to love

437
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,280
is utterly foolish and laughable.

438
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,010
If one day,

439
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,420
Yang Qing no longer loves Yue,

440
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,960
who can guarantee
Yunmen's people won't hurt her?

441
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,030
I've taken care of Yue for so many years.

442
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,040
Her future

443
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,060
should be guarded by me.

444
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,850
If you marry her,

445
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,230
what about me?

446
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,890
Who do you think you are?

447
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,620
Yingxing.

448
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:47,840
Leave!

449
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,110
You deliberately kissed Yue.

450
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,780
That was a show for me, right?

451
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,920
I never expected
you'd resort to such a trick,

452
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,430
using such a childish method
to compete with me,

453
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,690
like a 3-year-old boy.

454
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,820
So ridiculous.

455
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,040
So what?

456
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,300
People are selfish.

457
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,140
I'm no exception.

458
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,800
Yang Qing,

459
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,970
you should know very well

460
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,080
Yue is infatuated with you

461
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,860
only because she hasn't gotten you yet.

462
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,410
Once she does, she'll lose interest.

463
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,130
That's just how shallow she is.

464
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,790
Her feelings come fast
and fade just as quickly.

465
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,190
Don't expect some deep,
soul-stirring connection from her.

466
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,780
If you get too deep,

467
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,510
be careful you can't get out.

468
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Not necessarily.

469
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,590
From what I know,

470
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,510
she's always held a grudge over the matter

471
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,500
between you and Junior Yao.

472
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,280
That doesn't prove she's shallow.

473
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,550
The bond between Yue and me is deep.

474
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,720
It's not something you can understand.

475
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
And you can't win against me.

476
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,540
All I need is one word,

477
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,120
and she could leave you at any moment.

478
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,810
Why else do you think she's been

479
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,950
so troubled these past few days?

480
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,210
I'm not interested
in playing such childish games with you.

481
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,270
Yue is the saintess of Shengyue Sect.

482
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,920
She always has been.

483
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,400
As long as I'm here,

484
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,640
she always will be.

485
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,750
Yue is not like her predecessors.

486
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,690
She has a sense of belonging
to Shengyue Sect.

487
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,460
That's something you can't give her.

488
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,410
So do what you will.

489
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:23,220
[Jianxin House]

490
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,030
Yao?

491
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,130
Yao.

492
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,910
Are you looking for this?

493
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,780
You're playing me?

494
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,960
Playing you?

495
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,680
And all the things you did to me before—

496
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,770
what do you call them?

497
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,760
Yao,

498
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,110
what trick are you trying to play?

499
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,930
Give me the Shengyue Token,

500
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,470
and I'll never appear before you again.

501
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,720
My little Yao,

502
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,830
what right do you think you have

503
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,160
to negotiate with me?

504
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,170
I can help you take Yang Qing away,

505
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,180
so you can be with Yang Wangyue.

506
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,610
I don't need your help with that.

507
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,640
The one she loves is Yang Qing.

508
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,870
Even if you trap her,

509
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,650
she'll find a way to escape and see him.

510
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,730
What she wants to do is her own business.

511
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,170
You have no say in it.

512
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
But you...

513
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,030
You're so obsessed
with the Shengyue Token.

514
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,560
What are you up to this time?

515
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
You won't tell me?

516
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:30,940
Fine.

517
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,540
Just remember—

518
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,410
from the moment you betrayed me,

519
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,430
you'll never get anything from me again.

520
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,880
What did you want to see me for?

521
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,640
You look really beautiful today.

522
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,750
Did I ever not look beautiful?

523
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,470
Today, you look especially beautiful.

524
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,720
Come with me.

525
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,160
What is it? Why so mysterious?

526
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,770
What's this?

527
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,510
Yue,

528
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,880
today is your birthday.

529
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,110
May 25.

530
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,420
Don't you remember?

531
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,080
It's okay.

532
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,730
I remember.

533
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,200
I've celebrated every one

534
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,000
of your past birthdays with you.

535
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,500
Today, I'll still celebrate it with you.

536
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,350
Okay?

537
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:22,820
Sure.

538
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,240
Where are Lingyin and Mingyang?

539
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,120
They'll be here soon.

540
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,160
These are
what you lacked in your childhood.

541
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,670
I'll give them all to you, one by one.

542
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,990
Yuan Yingxing,

543
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,790
you're so good to me.

544
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,720
I know you like these trinkets most.

545
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,880
Wangyue.

546
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,740
What's with this lantern?

547
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,370
I...

548
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:28,970
I...

549
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,950
Today is May 25.

550
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,460
It's Yue's birthday.

551
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,170
You didn't know?

552
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,480
So today is your birthday.

553
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,650
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

554
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,040
I... I just wanted two gifts.

555
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,180
I wanted you to spoil me a little more.

556
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,440
Tonight is Wangyue's birthday.

557
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,980
It only comes once a year.

558
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,650
I can't ruin it.

559
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,730
Wangyue, happy birthday.

560
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,680
You... You're not angry?

561
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,170
I can't let her remember this birthday

562
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,560
with thoughts of a quarrel between us.

563
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,150
Of course not.

564
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,710
Mr. Yang, you're truly magnanimous.

565
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,570
I'm impressed.

566
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,850
Let her enjoy her birthday happily.

567
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,930
Wangyue, you want two birthday gifts,

568
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,960
but I didn't have time to prepare.

569
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,690
You won't be mad at me, will you?

570
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,130
Why would I blame you?

571
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,680
Just give me something better next year.

572
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,070
Okay.

573
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,110
Is this what Wangyue likes?

574
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,370
Even if you don't understand or know her,

575
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,750
you shouldn't ask me.

576
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,730
After all,
you're not a member of Shengyue Sect.

577
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,030
Yue didn't even tell you

578
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,889
the truth about her own birthday.

579
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,440
It seems that to her,

580
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,550
you're nothing but a plaything

581
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,880
she can summon and dismiss at will.

582
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,420
These lanterns are so exquisite.

583
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,179
Yuan Yingxing,

584
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:56,380
how come they look even better
than those made by you?

585
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,680
I happened to meet a young man in the shop

586
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,330
when I bought these.

587
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,930
If you really like them, marry him.

588
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,800
I promise

589
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,920
I'll prepare a generous dowry.

590
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,800
If I marry Yang Qing,

591
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,400
will you also give me a dowry?

592
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,520
If it's Mr. Yang,

593
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,100
he'd have to marry into Shengyue Sect.

594
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,610
Then I'd gladly give that dowry.

595
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:38,820
Wangyue,

596
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,090
I don't have
a sea of lanterns like Chief Yuan,

597
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,170
nor did I have time
to prepare a birthday gift.

598
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,030
How about this?

599
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,390
You make a wish here,

600
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,390
and I promise I'll make it come true.

601
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,360
Okay.

602
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,320
In the coming year,

603
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,310
let me be with both Yang Qing
and Shengyue Sect,

604
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,480
and may everyone be safe,
harmonious, and happy.

605
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,590
Yang Qing.

606
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,510
Where are you going?

607
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,440
I'll go with you.

608
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,330
Why are you giving me
that cold face again?

609
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,810
Didn't you say you didn't care?

610
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,910
I lied to you.

611
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,130
I care a lot.

612
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,800
Why did you lie and say you didn't care?

613
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,790
I only lied to you once,

614
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,800
and you're already asking me why.

615
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,750
But what about you?

616
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,290
How many times have you lied to me?

617
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,220
I told you before

618
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,230
not to lie to me.

619
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,070
Because I can easily tell

620
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,400
when someone is lying!

621
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,230
Usually, by the time you open your mouth,

622
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,630
I already know what's true and what's not.

623
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,890
I'm already prepared.

624
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,550
So before, no matter how you lied to me,

625
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,350
I could always handle it easily.

626
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,200
But this time,

627
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,960
I never thought

628
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,850
that you even lied

629
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,270
about your own birthday.

630
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:53,960
And I

631
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,490
had to find out through Yuan Yingxing!

632
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,570
Do you have any idea
how embarrassed I was last night?

633
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,840
I didn't mean to lie to you.

634
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,540
At first,

635
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,360
I just wanted to make you happy.

636
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:06,890
Later, I decided

637
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,680
my birthday would be on May 15.

638
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,360
I really didn't expect it
to turn out this way.

639
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,490
You even lied about your own birthday.

640
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,590
How do I know which of your words are true

641
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,720
and which are false?

642
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,540
How am I supposed to trust you?

643
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,590
I...

644
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,460
How many other things
are you hiding from me?

645
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,410
I...

646
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,210
I want to hear the truth.

647
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:42,320
I... might have to go back to Mount Yin
with Yuan Yingxing.

648
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,040
I have no choice.

649
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,670
We grew up together.

650
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,670
He's my only family now.

651
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,400
He asked,

652
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,270
and I couldn't refuse him.

653
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,320
But believe me,

654
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
I will definitely come back for you.

655
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,670
If I

656
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,070
hadn't asked you,

657
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,170
you wouldn't have told me. Is that so?

658
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,920
No.

659
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,630
I would definitely tell you.

660
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,570
It's just that I...

661
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,560
You need to give me time.

662
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,590
I gave you time.

663
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,550
It's been 5 days since the day

664
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,200
you held back your words.

665
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,590
You haven't told me anything,

666
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,590
not even one word.

667
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,690
So is it possible

668
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,850
that by the time you tell me,

669
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,780
you'll have already left
with Yuan Yingxing?

670
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,250
I want to hear the truth.

671
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,320
It's possible.

672
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,980
Yang Wangyue, what are you doing?

673
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,510
I'm not letting go!
We're not done talking yet!

674
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,880
Yang Wangyue, let go!

675
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,630
No!

676
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,970
Let go!

677
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,660
Let go of me!

678
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,870
Yang Wangyue, what are you trying to do?

679
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,960
Since you won't believe anything I say,

680
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,110
I might as well let you feel

681
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,330
my feelings for you!

682
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,160
Yang Wangyue,

683
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,450
you think I won't fight back

684
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,440
because I like you. Right?

685
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,080
You've realized you were wrong?

686
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,320
Mr. Yang!

687
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,880
Mr. Yang, we've finally found you.

688
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,810
Are you alright?

689
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,690
I'm fine.

690
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,880
Mr. Yang.

691
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,250
Why are you here?

692
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,140
Mr. Yang, have you found...

693
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,550
Yuan Yingxing from Shengyue Sect

694
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,550
and saved Ms. Yao?

695
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,500
I'm still searching. What about you?

696
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,210
We haven't found them either.

697
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,670
But don't worry, Mr. Yang.

698
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,130
We won't let Yuan Yingxing

699
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,060
escape justice.

700
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,320
Right now, it's not just us—

701
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,960
the four major sects
have joined forces to set up

702
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,540
an inescapable trap in the valley.

703
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,920
I heard
the one in charge of the formation is

704
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,550
Shengyue Sect's former Gold Hall Master,
Jin Buhuan,

705
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,880
a master of formations.

706
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,230
Jin Buhuan betrayed Shengyue Sect
and submitted to justice.

707
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,160
He's set up the Liansha Formation.

708
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,770
It seems he wants to offer the head
of Yuan Yingxing as a pledge of loyalty.

709
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,920
The Liansha Formation?

710
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,630
That's Shengyue Sect's ultimate technique.
Its power is boundless.

711
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,840
Even if they can't capture him alive,

712
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,700
they can surely kill him
to calm the public's anger.

713
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,030
I just remembered

714
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,460
I left something in the cave
where we rested before.

715
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,580
I'll go back to look for it.

716
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,980
I'll come find you later.

717
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,540
Mr. Yang!

718
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,190
He left again.

719
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,770
Yuan Yingxing,

720
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,360
Jin Buhuan has set up
the Liansha Formation outside.

721
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,760
Take Shengyue Sect's people and leave now.

722
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,300
You think
a mere Liansha Formation can harm me?

723
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,030
It might not be able to hurt you,

724
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,440
but Wangyue
has no internal strength or techniques,

725
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,710
and the others can barely cope.

726
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,010
Yang Qing,

727
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,620
you should know

728
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,490
even if you help us,

729
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,900
I won't be grateful to you,

730
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,840
and I won't let you take Yue away.

731
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,490
I'm not helping you.

732
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,260
I just don't want Wangyue to get hurt.

733
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,660
In a moment,

734
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,860
I'll lure them into the Miyun Forest.

735
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,250
You guys leave quickly.

736
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,230
Protect Wangyue.

737
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,420
I didn't expect Yunmen's lofty Elder Yang

738
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,420
to be such an affectionate man.

739
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,960
Since you're so eager to die,

740
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,990
I'll gladly oblige.
