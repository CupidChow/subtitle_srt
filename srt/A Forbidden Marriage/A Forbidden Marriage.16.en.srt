[Ximo Hall]

4
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,700
Everyone, open your books—
Chapter 1, Page 3.

5
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,900
Since you've joined Yunmen,

6
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,700
you must follow Yunmen's rules.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
I don't care who you were before.

8
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,000
Although a nobody like Lu Xuanxuan

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,710
isn't worth my attention,

10
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,120
Yang Qing actually gave me a cold shoulder
and walked away with her.

11
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,450
Could it be he likes her?

12
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,910
Lu Xuanxuan is such low-class.

13
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,340
So infuriating.

14
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,240
Wangyue.

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,850
Did you review the sect rules
from yesterday?

16
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,280
What's the point of learning

17
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,340
those trite rules?

18
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,160
I'm not wasting my time on that.

19
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,560
Jiang Yu,

20
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,040
what did you say?

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Elder Shen,

22
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,820
I didn't say anything.

23
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,570
Here in Yunmen,

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,290
indulgence in gluttony is forbidden.

25
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,810
So is idle gossip,

26
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,000
stirring trouble, or sowing discord.

27
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,270
No flamboyant dressing.

28
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,630
All must wear
the standard Yunmen training uniform.

29
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,150
Speech must be proper, conduct dignified.

30
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,050
And no rolling up sleeves to bare arms.

31
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,579
I'm talking about you, Yang Wangyue.

32
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,510
Rolling up your sleeves
and exposing half your arms—

33
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,640
how inappropriate.

34
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,710
Elder Shen,

35
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,820
what you said isn't right.

36
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,670
We wear clothes for comfort and style.

37
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,060
I've always wondered

38
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,460
why Yunmen's clothes must always be white.

39
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,970
Is wearing white clothes

40
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,020
the only way to show a kind heart?

41
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,560
Why can't we dress beautifully?

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,370
That's what true vitality looks like.

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,410
Besides,

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,120
we were born with mouths.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,650
It's our nature to use them.

46
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,490
Why suppress our very nature?

47
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,340
A martial artist

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,380
must not indulge in gluttony.

49
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,960
Elder Shen,

50
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,930
don't you like stir-fried pork intestines?

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,850
Don't you like chilled cheese?

52
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,000
Or... don't you want a bowl
of bamboo shoots stewed with quail?

53
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,870
Ridiculous!

54
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,900
I'm not being ridiculous, Elder Shen.

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,300
I'll tell you seriously:

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,710
the tender bamboo shoots
in the back mountain are thriving.

57
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,710
They're

58
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,590
fresh, crisp, and delicious.

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,430
I was even planning to pick some tonight

60
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,430
and bring them back for you to taste.

61
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,520
Senior Yang,

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,030
I... I want some too.

63
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,630
Junior Yang,

64
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,230
may I also have a bowl?

65
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,990
I think Junior Yang makes a good point.

66
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,649
Elder Shen,

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
if we martial artists

68
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,930
can't eat enough,

69
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,240
how will we have strength to train?

70
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,980
Whoever does not wish to join Yunmen

71
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,640
is free to leave immediately.

72
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Yang Wangyue,

73
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,240
it was you who incited Yunmen's disciples

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,640
to defy the elder, right?

75
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,320
Elder Shen,

76
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,290
for defying the sect rules,

77
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,150
what punishment should be given?

78
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,030
According to our rules,

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,480
she'll face 30 strokes of the cane
and 3 days without food.

80
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,710
Thirty strokes?

81
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,630
And 3 days without food?

82
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,409
That's too much.

83
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,210
I'm just a new disciple.

84
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,590
Why so many rules?

85
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,730
In Shengyue Sect,

86
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,720
we just fight it out.

87
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,560
Winner takes all.

88
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,840
The strong rise to the top.

89
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,010
The weak can't blame the strong.

90
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,670
What's the use of so many rules
to scare people?

91
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,830
Yang Wangyue, what did you say?

92
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,190
How do you know so much
about Shengyue Sect's rules?

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,310
Yang Qing...

94
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,390
Elder Yang told me.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,680
Elder Shen.

96
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,690
Elder Yang, you've come just in time.

97
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,670
Was it really you who told Yang Wangyue

98
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,890
about the rules of Shengyue Sect?

99
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,750
Elder Shen, why be so suspicious?

100
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,150
It's Shengyue Sect we're talking about.

101
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,240
Do I need

102
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,060
to report to you the mission

103
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,360
the Sect Leader sent me on 5 years ago?

104
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,290
No need for that.

105
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,450
Elder Yang, you surely have your reasons.

106
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,580
I won't ask further.

107
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,190
Yang Wangyue has defied our sect rules.

108
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,050
Bring the cane.

109
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,810
Why trouble yourself with this,
Elder Shen?

110
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,960
These new disciples—

111
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,750
leave them to me.

112
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,600
Yang Qing,

113
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,750
instead of teaching Lu Xuanxuan swordplay,

114
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,280
you came to rescue me again.

115
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,590
I knew it. You still care about me.

116
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,400
Call me Mr. Yang.

117
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,410
Since you've joined Yunmen,
please conduct yourself properly.

118
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:10,940
Besides,

119
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,970
who said I came to rescue you?

120
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,920
Copy the sect rules 10 times.

121
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,630
I'll check them myself in 3 days.

122
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,690
Really, Yang Qing?

123
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,430
You're serious?

124
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,840
Not a single word can be missed.

125
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,770
Qing.

126
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,000
One more word and I'll add another copy.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Mr. Yang.

128
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,630
I'll check them myself in 3 days.

129
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,560
Fine.

130
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Copying books to ward off disaster.

131
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,159
At least it spared me Elder Shen's cane.

132
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,090
Yang Qing can't bear
to punish me after all.

133
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,500
Yang Wangyue!

134
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,010
Yang Wangyue, you're late.

135
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,040
As punishment,
run 10 laps around the training ground.

136
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,650
Me?

137
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,260
You.

138
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,830
Didn't you ask me to fetch the sect rules?

139
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,560
Eleven laps.

140
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,360
Yang Qing, don't go too far.

141
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,090
Twelve laps.

142
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,430
Fine, I'll run!

143
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,400
Who said you could rest?

144
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,720
I've finished 12 laps.

145
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,770
Physical strength is the foundation
of practicing martial arts.

146
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,570
Horse stance is the basic skill.

147
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,070
You just finished stamina training.

148
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,330
Go do horse stance now.

149
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,560
I still have to do horse stance?

150
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,600
Everyone else is practicing swordplay!

151
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,480
Why do I still have to do horse stance?

152
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,310
Because your foundation is weak.

153
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,560
I have extraordinary talent!

154
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,159
Very well.

155
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,600
Then go practice
on the plum blossom poles.

156
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,120
You...

157
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,820
You chose to join Yunmen yourself,

158
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,530
so you must work harder than others

159
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,590
if you want to stay.

160
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,600
Now get going!

161
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,160
Bend.

162
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,600
Bend.

163
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,610
Senior Yang is really pitiful.

164
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,260
It's bad enough
that she somehow offended Elder Shen.

165
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,110
But even Elder Yang,

166
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,640
the one
said to have the best temper in Yunmen,

167
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,220
treats her so harshly.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,330
Junior Yang is indeed special in our sect.

169
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,380
Why are you staring at me?

170
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,640
What I meant is the nail that sticks out
gets hammered down.

171
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,270
Lower.

172
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,150
Higher.

173
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,920
[Yunmen]

174
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,690
Don't grab. There's plenty for everyone.

175
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,120
Qing.

176
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,600
Here, take it.

177
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,550
I want this one. I wan this one.

178
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,600
You want this one? Here.

179
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,910
Give me one. I want this.

180
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,510
Alright, this one's for you.

181
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,030
Here.

182
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,240
Which one do you want? This one?

183
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,400
Yang Qing knows
how to look after children?

184
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,700
Here, one for each of you.

185
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,230
These are all orphans taken in by Yunmen.

186
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:20,920
This one?

187
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,430
They'll also become
Yunmen's disciples in the future.

188
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,620
Mr. Yang really is capable.

189
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,960
If it were me dealing with such a bunch

190
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,160
of mischievous kids,

191
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,500
I'd probably go crazy.

192
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:29,880
Catch.

193
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,170
Go pick it up.

194
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,180
Why does he keep rubbing his forehead?

195
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,120
Does he have a headache?

196
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,630
I don't think so.

197
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,560
Pass me the ball.

198
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,770
Let me see who to pass to.

199
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,520
I want it too.

200
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,340
Catch.

201
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,260
I see.

202
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,590
He must be sensitive to noise.

203
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,820
Don't let it get in your eyes.

204
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,020
Yang Qing must have had a happy childhood.

205
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,840
What makes you say that?

206
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,670
Catch.

207
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,710
Only someone
who grew up surrounded by love

208
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,360
would know how to care for others.

209
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,440
I grew up in hardship and adversity.

210
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,650
If I were to look after them,

211
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,510
I'd probably scare them to tears.

212
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,090
But Mr. Yang was also an orphan.

213
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,920
He was quite pitiful actually.

214
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,080
The elders said he was abandoned.

215
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,280
When they found him,
he was nearly starved to death.

216
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,340
After they brought him back to Yunmen,

217
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,200
he wouldn't speak for a long time.

218
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,650
Later,

219
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,380
under the care
of the elders and the Sect Leader,

220
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,260
he slowly opened up to others.

221
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,440
So he suffered just like me.

222
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,360
Don't let Mr. Yang know

223
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,690
that I told you all this.

224
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,340
Yang Qing.

225
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,730
Yang Qing.

226
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,510
Junior Yang.

227
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,930
You came at the right time.

228
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,860
Help me look after them for a while.

229
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,150
I don't know how to do this.

230
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,410
If you leave them to me,

231
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,090
I'd only make them cry.

232
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,450
As a disciple of Yunmen,

233
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,480
you want to disobey your elder?

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,970
Who's my el...

235
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,230
Got it, Mr. Yang.

236
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,370
I'm going out for a while.

237
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,630
Take good care of them.

238
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,570
Yang Qing,

239
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,680
that munchkin you asked me to look after—

240
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,090
I managed to soothe him.

241
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,940
He even called me "Sister".

242
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,870
Are you still mad at me?

243
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,480
I really didn't know
you were put in confinement

244
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,210
because you wanted to marry me.

245
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,480
If I had known,

246
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,570
I would never have come to Yunmen
to be a disciple.

247
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,490
Yang Qing,

248
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,450
I was an orphan taken in by Shengyue Sect.

249
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,470
Shengyue Sect isn't as peaceful as Yunmen.

250
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,200
Wherever there are people,

251
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,860
there are schemes and deceit.

252
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,440
No one ever tells the truth.

253
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,530
You're angry because I didn't tell you.

254
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
But I didn't mean to hide it from you.

255
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,660
It's just my habit.

256
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,360
You came today

257
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,040
just to tell me that?

258
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,840
Not really.

259
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,890
I just found out today

260
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,300
that you also suffered a lot
in your childhood.

261
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,050
I came to tell you

262
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,270
that from now on, you have me.

263
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,530
I'll treat you better.

264
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,540
You won't suffer anymore.

265
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Are you finished?

266
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,400
If you're done,

267
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,010
you can leave now.

268
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,530
After everything I just said,

269
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,900
aren't you moved at all?

270
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,120
Forgive my poor judgment.

271
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,870
I can't tell

272
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,650
when you're sincere

273
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,220
and when you're just pretending.

274
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,800
Of course I'm sincere.

275
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,440
Yang Qing,

276
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,660
you've been ignoring me all this time

277
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,260
just because

278
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,270
I became a disciple of Yunmen. Right?

279
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,440
You're a man. Why are you so petty?

280
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,130
Don't be angry, okay?

281
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,100
Yang Qing, I was wrong.

282
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,210
Were you just studying

283
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,150
Shengyue Sect's Six Harmonies Convergence?

284
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,550
If you want to know about it,

285
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,350
I can help you.

286
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,290
Six Harmonies Convergence?

287
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,750
These past few days,

288
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,330
everyone has made progress.

289
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,530
Especially Jiang Yu—you've done well.

290
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,890
But your strikes
still lack inner strength.

291
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,490
You need to practice harder.

292
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,240
Su Ming,
your Cloud Ladder Step has improved,

293
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,840
but your sword techniques
are still a bit weak.

294
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,790
Mr. Yang, what about me?

295
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,030
You?

296
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,120
You still have the nerve to ask?

297
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,320
Keep working harder.

298
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,880
Alright. Everyone, spread out.

299
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,480
Begin today's training.

300
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,140
-Yes!
-Yes!

301
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,300
One!

302
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,220
Two!

303
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,430
[Yunxiao Hall]

304
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,320
Come in.

305
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,150
Yang Qing,

306
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,250
I made this bamboo shoots
stewed with quail for you myself.

307
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:24,940
Try it.

308
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:27,850
Get out.

309
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,840
Mr. Yang,

310
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,030
I worked so hard on this—

311
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,200
I went to the back mountain
to pick the tenderest shoots for you.

312
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,720
Look,

313
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,610
I even hurt my hands.

314
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,950
My meals

315
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,480
are always handled
by the disciples in the kitchen.

316
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,410
You don't need to worry about that.

317
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,790
But I wanted to make it for you myself.

318
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,360
Usually,

319
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,660
only male disciples can enter my room.

320
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,330
Miss Yang,
please observe proper boundaries

321
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,770
and avoid causing any misunderstandings,

322
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,300
lest it damages propriety.

323
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,020
Propriety?

324
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,040
I don't care about propriety.

325
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,890
If I care about propriety,

326
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
would I have come to Yunmen with you?

327
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,500
If I care about propriety,

328
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,650
would I have kept approaching you
despite your cold shoulder?

329
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,500
Besides,

330
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,150
am I just some random person?

331
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,810
Am I just any other female disciple?

332
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,570
Why can't I enter your room?

333
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,110
Yang Qing,
do you even have a conscience?

334
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,170
I did all this for you.

335
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,520
If I'd known you'd be this angry,

336
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,240
I wouldn't have gone to such lengths

337
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,810
just to be closer to you.

338
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
To join Yunmen,

339
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,310
I nearly lost my life.

340
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,930
To get bamboo shoots for you,

341
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,330
I almost fell off a cliff.

342
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,050
To cook a meal for you,

343
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,040
I snuck into the kitchen,

344
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,190
always on edge, worried every moment.

345
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,370
But what did I get in return?

346
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,390
You don't even know
that I never eat bamboo shoots.

347
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,990
Is this what you call caring about me

348
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,790
and loving me?

349
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,430
I... well...

350
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,140
Everyone else loves bamboo...

351
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm not everyone else! I'm me!

352
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,840
Junior Yang,

353
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,460
if you truly cared,

354
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,819
you wouldn't have made this soup for me.

355
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,819
And you wouldn't have joined Yunmen

356
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,750
when I was on hunger strike for you!

357
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:10,619
Get out!

358
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,130
Leave.

359
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,670
Eat it or not.

360
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,530
Junior Yang, so you're here.

361
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,750
He gave this to you.

362
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,400
He wouldn't let me tell you,

363
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
but you know, it's from Mr. Yang.

364
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,520
I'm leaving.

365
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,240
Yang Qing,

366
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,440
I knew it. You were just talking tough.

367
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,580
You still care about me deep down.

368
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,080
Then I'll...

369
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,650
visit you to thank you for this.

370
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,580
You... You're awake.

371
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,850
I wanted to sneak in
and give you a surprise,

372
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,140
but you caught me.

373
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,540
You call that ruckus sneaking?

374
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,570
Um...

375
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,340
I've received the candies you gave me,

376
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,580
and the ointment too.

377
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,680
Who said I gave you candies?

378
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,670
Get out.

379
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,930
I'm sick

380
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
of hearing "get out".

381
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,420
Can't you come up with something new?

382
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,210
Mr. Yang,

383
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,770
these past few days...

384
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,030
have you been thinking about me?

385
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,830
Get out.

386
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,310
Get out!

387
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,810
How disrespectful!

388
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,440
I am being disrespectful.

389
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,320
It's not like
you haven't dealt with this before.

390
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,550
So...

391
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,820
how are you going to punish me?

392
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,610
If you don't leave now,

393
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,180
I'll throw you out.

394
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,270
Don't.

395
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,410
I just finished training.

396
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,100
I haven't even had dinner yet.

397
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,610
I'm starving.

398
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,030
If you throw me out now,

399
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,430
I'll definitely faint.

400
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,790
If I faint,

401
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,730
the Sect Leader and the elders
might notice.

402
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,340
That...

403
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,940
wouldn't look too good, right?

404
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,040
So you are hungry

405
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,210
and want something to eat.

406
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,610
That's why you thought of my kindness.

407
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,260
Please,

408
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,070
take pity on me
for training so hard these days.

409
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,600
Just cook something for me.

410
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,290
It's been so long
since I ate your cooking.

411
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,500
You want something delicious?

412
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,140
I want to eat your cooking.

413
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,800
Then move aside.

414
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,500
Mr. Yang, thank you
for cooking something delicious for me.

415
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,900
Why is it so hard to coax a man?

416
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,640
If only Lingyin were here.

417
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,360
That damn Yuan Yingxing took her away.

418
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,280
I wonder how they're doing now.

419
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,790
Stop!

420
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,010
Who are you people?

421
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,070
How dare you trespass on our grounds!

422
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,870
Take a good look

423
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,610
at who I am.

424
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,810
I don't care who you are.

425
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,970
Anyone entering our sect
must have an invitation!

426
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,040
Your sect?

427
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,690
This is Mount Yin!

428
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,720
Mount Yin has always belonged
to Shengyue Sect!

429
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,460
Yingxing,

430
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,690
don't be rash.

431
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,690
We should think this through.

432
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,020
The affairs of Shengyue Sect

433
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,480
are not yours to meddle in.

434
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,060
We've been trying to reason with you,

435
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,120
but you insist on forcing your way in!

436
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,370
Then don't blame us for being rude!

437
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,030
I'd like to see how rude you can be.

438
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,330
Yingxing!

439
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,960
Don't use your inner strength
to force the poison out.

440
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,590
Or it will spread to your vital organs.

441
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,920
I have the antidote. Let's retreat first.

442
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,520
Let's go.

443
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,220
Fortunately, you weren't poisoned.

444
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,280
Petty tricks with weeds and insects—
you think they can harm me?

445
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,720
Yingxing,

446
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,200
you need to stop being so impulsive.

447
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,540
They occupy the high ground.

448
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,870
You should know better than I do

449
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,080
about Mount Yin's defensive advantages.

450
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,440
If we confront them directly now,

451
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,370
we might not win.

452
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,370
Stay out of my affairs.

453
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,750
There's only one thing I want to know.

454
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,350
You've been around us,

455
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
and you gathered information in advance.

456
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,060
What exactly are you up to?

457
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,980
Don't tell me
you're just being kind-hearted.

458
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,720
Why don't we make a deal?

459
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
No more pretense?

460
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,570
If you keep acting like this,

461
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,770
how can we negotiate?

462
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,870
Let's negotiate properly.

463
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,490
Go ahead.

464
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,280
If you can please me,

465
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,370
perhaps

466
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,110
I'll consider granting your request.

467
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,410
I'll help you reclaim Mount Yin,

468
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,940
reconcile you with Yunmen,

469
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,880
and restore Shengyue Sect
to its former glory,

470
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,610
so that Wangyue and Yang Qing
can be together openly and honorably.

471
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,300
As long as you agree

472
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,550
to lend me the Shengyue Token
once it's done.

473
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,890
Why do you want the Shengyue Token

474
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,620
of our sect?

475
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,580
And how do I know

476
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,040
you won't turn against us again?

477
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,220
Shengyue Sect is already in such ruins.

478
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,960
If I want to destroy it,
why bother with such tricks?

479
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,020
I have no interest in wasting my time.

480
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,190
Could it be
you still have feelings for me?

481
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,710
Think whatever you like.

482
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,890
Consider my offer. Then tell me

483
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,690
if you'll

484
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,720
accept the deal or not.

485
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,930
Chief, what makes you so happy?

486
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,250
Nothing.

487
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,070
By the way,

488
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
I happen to need something from you.

489
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,110
What is it, Chief?

490
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,760
Write a letter to Yue.

491
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,520
Tell her
to return to Shengyue Sect immediately.

492
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,430
Chief,

493
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,630
didn't you already agree
to let her be with Yang Qing?

494
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,430
Why summon her back so suddenly?

495
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,890
Besides, you already
have Yao Fu by your side now.

496
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,810
Why do you...

497
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,650
You think I'm like you,

498
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,920
playing both sides?

499
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,210
Then Yao Fu...

500
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,560
She's still a bit useful to me,

501
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,730
so I reluctantly granted her wish.

502
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,900
Granted her wish?

503
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,420
More like granting your own wish.

504
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,650
What are you mumbling about?

505
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,720
Nothing, Chief.

506
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,190
I just think

507
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,600
they finally managed to be together.

508
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,770
That old fox Feng Xingyun

509
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,250
will never agree to their marriage.

510
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,140
Yue is just wasting her time.

511
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,000
Perhaps Yang Qing
can persuade those elders.

512
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,720
If Yunmen sincerely accepts Yue

513
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,640
and truly wants
a reconciliation with Shengyue Sect,

514
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,370
I won't make a big deal about it.

515
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,660
But if Yunmen dares
to harm Yue in the slightest,

516
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,270
I will make them pay a terrible price.

517
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,990
You write the letter.

518
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,920
Just say

519
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,000
I heard Yue hasn't been doing well

520
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,070
in Yunmen.

521
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,370
Ask her to return
to Shengyue Sect immediately.

522
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,650
We have prepared fine wine and food,

523
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,650
just waiting for her return.

524
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,180
Yue hasn't been doing well?

525
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,550
Chief, you have informants in Yunmen?

526
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,700
If I say she's not doing well,
she's not doing well.

527
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,630
Then that's just making things up.

528
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,520
Chief... you're right.

529
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,200
You're absolutely right.

530
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,200
Well, if there's nothing else, Chief,

531
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,410
I'll take my leave.

532
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,150
Go write that letter now.

533
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,490
Where could the Sun Blade be?

534
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,640
Now that Yang Qing is ignoring me,

535
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,400
I can't get to it through him.

536
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,070
Wangyue!

537
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,940
What are you doing here?

538
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,110
I heard there's a new cook in the kitchen.

539
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,960
He makes amazing scallion rolls.

540
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,490
Let's go try them together.

541
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,790
Everyone is afraid of me.

542
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,720
They avoid me and won't play with me.

543
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,880
Aren't you afraid of me?

544
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,390
What's there to be afraid of?

545
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,580
Whether we can stay in Yunmen

546
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,550
depends on the exam a month from now.

547
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,240
I like you

548
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,590
and want to spend time with you.

549
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,190
I don't care what others say.

550
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,110
You... You like me?

551
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,440
Yes.

552
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,030
You're so pretty,
and you have a great personality.

553
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,290
Who wouldn't like you?

554
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,400
During Yunmen's entrance trial,
you were the calmest of all.

555
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,550
I really admire you.

556
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,560
You're exactly the kind of person
I want to become.

557
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,820
Gosh, I'm flattered.

558
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,310
Jiang Yu.

559
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,090
I heard

560
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,570
you're from a martial family?

561
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,420
That was all in the past.

562
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,450
My family has already fallen.

563
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,050
I came to Yunmen
to learn martial arts well

564
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,690
in a bid to revive my family.

565
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,690
So,

566
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,310
you're indeed from a martial family.

567
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,170
You must have heard
of the Alliance Leader's Token, right?

568
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,960
I heard it is incredibly powerful

569
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,580
and can summon
all the heroes in the martial world.

570
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,100
But I wonder

571
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,190
if I'll ever get to see it in this life.

572
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,370
If the token appears,
the martial world will be in chaos.

573
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,170
My father said

574
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,190
he would rather never see the token

575
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,520
than see it reappear in the martial world.

576
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,910
When it reappears,

577
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,470
it's bound to cause tremendous upheaval.

578
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,170
Seems you know quite a lot.

579
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,920
Any century-old family
in the martial world

580
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,790
knows that ever since Yunmen
got the Alliance Leader's Token,

581
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,760
it's been locked away
in the Langhuan Pavilion.

582
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,570
Though it's so close at hand,

583
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,110
no one has ever wanted to see it.

584
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,510
Let's go have breakfast.

585
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:28,990
Okay.

586
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,050
You want to write a letter to sow discord
between Yang Qing and Wangyue?

587
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:50,710
What?

588
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,190
Already feeling sorry
for your Senior Yang?

589
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,430
You know Yang Qing and I
have never had feelings for each other.

590
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,560
And Yunmen isn't as united as it seems.

591
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,540
He and I do not walk the same path.

592
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,890
Why are you telling me all this now?

593
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
Are you pledging your loyalty to me?

594
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,700
I just want to tell you

595
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,650
you should know

596
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,650
what your top priority is right now.

597
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,710
Is it reviving your sect

598
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,840
or driving a wedge
between Yang Qing and Wangyue?

599
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,090
I've been working so hard
to revive my sect

600
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,830
because you deceived me, you idiot!

601
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,150
Forget it.

602
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,610
What's the use of talking about this now?

603
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,200
From what I know about Yang Qing,

604
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,260
he might get angry.

605
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,440
But he'll soon realize

606
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,640
it's nothing but your words of discord.

607
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,960
That's not good for your reconciliation
with Yunmen in the future.

608
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,490
Ruining your relationship with Yang Qing
won't do you any good.

609
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,090
You righteous sects' people are so funny.

610
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,140
You can just say you're worried about me.

611
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,620
Think what you like.

612
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,080
I'm just being kind.

613
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,440
Kind?

614
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,890
I've never seen you being so kind
to anyone else.

615
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,590
Jiang Yan is really adorable.

616
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,930
These words he wrote

617
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,410
amuse me greatly.

618
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,460
Mingyang,

619
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,100
before I lose my temper,

620
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
give it back to me!

621
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,310
Tell me,

622
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,010
if I tell Chief
you're still emotionally entangled

623
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,240
with Yunmen's disciple Jiang Yan,

624
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,810
what would he do?

625
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,610
What do you mean
by "emotionally entangled"?

626
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,540
I wasn't planning to reply anyway.

627
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,810
I'm peerless in grace and beauty.

628
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,270
I have many admirers and followers.

629
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,400
So what if I receive a few love letters?

630
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,370
Besides,

631
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,860
this isn't the first time.

632
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,860
Haven't you gotten used to it yet?

633
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,470
If you don't like him,

634
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,000
why did you flirt with him

635
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and give him hope?

636
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,280
You're so fickle.

637
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,640
Can't men and women just be friends?

638
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,640
Besides,

639
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,170
do I have to like him

640
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,860
just because he likes me?

641
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,720
You're not worthy.

642
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,530
Mingyang, you're asking for death!

643
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,640
Stop!

644
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,820
Chief.

645
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,020
Chief.

646
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,800
What's going on?

647
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,000
Chief, it's nothing.

648
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,070
Chief, it's nothing.

649
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,140
We were just...

650
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,530
chatting.

651
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,860
Now is not the time for skylarking.

652
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,170
After we return to Mount Yin,

653
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,780
you can do whatever you want.

654
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Do you think
Miss Lin still hasn't received my letter?

655
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,670
That can't be.

656
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,890
Even if it was intercepted,

657
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,960
there must be some sign
from the carrier pigeon.

658
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,740
She must have received it.

659
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,890
What are you muttering about
so early in the morning?

660
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,790
You can't learn from Mr. Yang.

661
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,360
Once a man falls in love,

662
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,190
his brain stops working.

663
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,250
Shang Huai,

664
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,909
let me ask you something.

665
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,440
If a girl

666
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,690
seems quite interested in you,

667
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,190
but whenever you take the initiative,

668
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,650
she gives you no response,

669
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,679
what do you think she means?

670
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,670
Does she actually like you

671
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,480
or not?

672
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,739
Don't look at me.

673
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,429
I'm not talking about me.

674
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,520
I'm talking about a friend of mine.

675
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,210
You just want to ask
about you and Miss Lin, right?

676
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,520
I can give you a clear answer right now.

677
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,650
She's just playing with you.

678
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,199
She never liked you from the beginning.

679
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,480
I told you I'm not talking about me.

680
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,409
I'm talking about a friend of mine.

681
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,960
Jiang Yan,

682
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,920
aside from me,

683
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,440
what other friends do you have?

684
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,940
Listen to me,

685
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,760
don't get too involved with them.

686
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,290
It's already vexing enough

687
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,790
that Yang Wangyue has charmed Mr. Yang

688
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,790
completely.

689
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,100
And now you're getting entangled
with Miss Lin too?

690
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,230
Stop overthinking.

691
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,880
Lately, the Langhuan Pavilion
has been anything but peaceful.

692
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
We all need to stay alert.

693
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,550
Let me see

694
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,720
what's on your mind.

695
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,000
Drink this,

696
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,060
and you'll surely tell the truth.

697
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,320
You're here.

698
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,760
Gods bear witness:

699
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,820
today, I, Mingyang, vow
to take Lingyin as my wife.

700
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,630
From today on, in sickness or in health,
in life or in death,

701
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,330
I will never leave or abandon her.

702
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,700
If I break this vow,
may the heavens strike me down.

703
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,440
What took you so long?

704
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,670
Where's your... your bridal veil?

705
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,170
Bridal veil?

706
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,400
Here.

707
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:23,920
Ming...

708
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,900
It's so dirty.

709
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,450
Mingyang.

710
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,970
You want to marry me?

711
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,590
Anyway, I know

712
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,150
you like me.

713
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,310
I...

714
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,530
Right?

715
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,230
I like you too.

716
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,040
I know you don't like

717
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,880
practicing martial arts.

718
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:49,800
So...

719
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,170
So I must practice even harder.

720
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,920
Then I can protect you

721
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,000
and keep others from bullying you.

722
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,990
Otherwise...

723
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,510
Otherwise, if you only
rely on your bottles and jars of drugs,

724
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,340
that wouldn't be enough.

725
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,470
Do you...

726
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,090
Do you really mean all that?

727
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,150
Oh no.

728
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,630
This time, I've gone too far.

729
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,800
Forget it. I'd better leave.

730
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,480
I... This...

731
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,480
Really?

732
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,980
Does Mingyang... really like me?

733
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,660
That's normal.

734
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,940
I'm dazzlingly beautiful,

735
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,650
charming, and elegant.

736
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,810
Who could possibly resist

737
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,550
my irresistible charm?

738
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,140
He's hidden his feelings pretty well.

739
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,280
Then when did we...

740
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,900
become like this?

741
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,250
You accidentally entered Mount Yin,
got hurt, and were saved by Lingyin.

742
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,410
You may fool Lingyin,
but you can't fool me.

743
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:31,970
Su Mu,

744
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,070
I think you staged this whole thing.

745
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,480
You're trying to infiltrate our sect
with ill intentions.

746
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
I don't care which sect you're from.

747
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,080
I won't let you leave today!

748
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,940
So what if you're right?

749
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,190
You think Lingyin would believe you?

750
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,250
You evil people
threaten the martial world.

751
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,110
Anybody has the right to kill you.

752
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,820
I'm enforcing justice on behalf of Heaven.

753
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,620
Lingyin thinks she's charming.

754
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,270
But I think

755
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,470
she's just a country bumpkin.

756
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,120
Looks like
I'll have to beat you to a pulp today!

757
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,390
Mingyang, stop!

758
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,500
You actually asked me to stop?

759
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,170
Lingyin, stay back!

760
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,720
This is between him and me.

761
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,860
To win you fair and square,

762
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,540
I must defeat him!

763
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,920
Mingyang, let him go.

764
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,400
I promise...

765
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,430
I promise from now on,
I'll never have anything to do with him.

766
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:26,660
No, Lingyin!

767
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,430
I will come back for you!

768
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,840
I'll ask Master to go to Yuan Yingxing
and propose marriage.

769
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,970
You must believe me!

770
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,110
He's a spy!

771
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,770
He flirted with you
to infiltrate and sabotage our sect!

772
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,870
You don't believe me?

773
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,430
I trust my own eyes more.

774
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,850
He didn't.

775
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,850
He's not a spy!

776
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,310
If you don't leave now,

777
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,210
you won't be able to leave
once Chief Yuan returns.

778
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,870
Mingyang.

779
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:56,980
I'm begging you.

780
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,950
You're actually begging me for his sake?

781
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,110
Fine.

782
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,210
Now I see you for what you are.

783
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,080
What?

784
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,320
When did Mingyang learn to say one thing

785
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,250
and do another?

786
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,430
He promised to let him go,

787
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,500
yet he still killed him.

788
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,880
Fine.

789
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,700
Mingyang, now I see you for what you are.

790
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,680
That man was named Su...

791
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:37,900
Su...

792
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,270
I can't remember.

793
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
Looks like

794
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,370
I didn't like him that much after all.

795
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,170
So why was I that angry back then?

796
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,940
Strange.

797
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,310
My Yue isn't here.

798
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,850
I can't ask her.

799
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,530
No one is here to chat with me.

800
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,060
I'm about to go crazy being all alone.

801
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,320
Chief.

802
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,760
Why are you here?

803
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:13,870
Yes, yes. It's time to eat.

804
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,620
The food...

805
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:20,770
What happened?

806
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,050
Someone poisoned the wine?

807
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,570
Don't you think
it's too late to be aware of that now?

808
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,000
If Lingyin wanted to kill you,

809
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,130
you'd have died 10 times over already.

810
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,910
Why bring up that annoying woman again?

811
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,130
I saw you kneeling just now,

812
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,860
swearing and proposing to her.

813
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:39,140
What?

814
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,230
I...

815
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,990
She poisoned the wine, didn't she?

816
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,210
That wretched woman!

817
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,980
I'm going to settle the score with her!

818
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,840
Remember this—

819
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,170
don't delay the revival of the sect!

820
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,250
She actually left a letter
from Shengyue Sect

821
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,850
just lying around like that.

822
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,280
Wangyue is careless.

823
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,100
Yuan Yingxing is just as careless as her.

824
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,060
They're so bold.

825
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:52,870
Yue,

826
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,510
how have you been?

827
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,800
Since I knew you've infiltrated Yunmen,

828
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,000
I've been so worried.

829
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,850
I heard you've suffered humiliation
from Yang Qing.

830
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,250
It truly breaks my heart.

831
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,250
Yang Qing is two-faced.

832
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,440
He can't be trusted.

833
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,830
You're risking your life for our sect.

834
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,720
Shengyue Sect will never let you down.

835
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,170
There's one thing

836
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,290
you must keep firmly in mind.

837
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,120
Whatever you do in Yunmen,

838
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,540
you must proceed with utmost caution.

839
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,400
No wonder
Wangyue would rather call me Mr. Yang

840
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
just to become a disciple of Yunmen.

841
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,070
So she still wants to steal the Sun Blade

842
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:29,440
to save those imprisoned in Biluo Valley.
