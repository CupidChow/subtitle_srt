[A Forbidden Marriage]

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,900
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,680
Yang Qing?

4
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,170
Well, well, Yang Qing.

5
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,430
A disciple from a respectable sect, huh?

6
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,789
You told me
you were going to Shuntian City.

7
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:01,050
Good thing I checked with the innkeeper.

8
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,110
Yang Qing, Yang Qing,

9
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,650
this candied hawthorn is really delicious.

10
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,400
Want a bite?

11
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,820
Miss Yang, please stop following me.

12
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,870
Who says I'm following you?

13
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,730
I...

14
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,280
Qinglai City is huge.

15
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,400
We just happened to run into each other.

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,460
Do you understand?

17
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,630
Miss Yang,

18
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,120
there's no way

19
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,720
we can be together.

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
What do you mean "no way?"

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,210
Is it because of that woman?

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,740
How could a dignified elder of Yunmen

23
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,900
be so blind?

24
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,079
Senior, you went to such lengths

25
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,000
to protect the Saintess of Shengyue Sect.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,930
Too bad she doesn't appreciate it.

27
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,640
Junior, since when did you become so nosy?

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Besides,

29
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,560
who said
she's the Saintess of Shengyue Sect?

30
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,140
She grew up in Yangliu Town.

31
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,970
She has nothing to do with Shengyue Sect.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,330
Your mind is unsettled,

33
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,310
Senior.

34
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,870
Mr. Yang,

35
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,670
why is Miss Yang here?

36
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,890
Didn't we tell her
we were going to Shuntian City?

37
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,710
How did she end up in Qinglai City?

38
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,710
Mr. Yang, how about I drive her away?

39
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,960
Let her be.

40
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,260
Lately, I haven't been able to

41
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,950
use my martial arts properly.

42
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,470
Could Senior Bai have been right?

43
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,450
You want revenge with such a petty trick,

44
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,480
Saintess?

45
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,269
Yao, what are you talking about?

46
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,430
I don't understand at all.

47
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,680
My hand just slipped.

48
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,680
Are you alright?

49
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,480
Is that so?

50
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,640
As it happens,
I've studied traditional medicine.

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,370
Would you like me to take a look?

52
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,070
Everyone, please judge for yourselves.

53
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,510
It was just a slip of the hand,

54
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,970
and yet Yao Fu from Yunmen
wants to strike me.

55
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,280
If you provoke me again,

56
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,830
I'll kill you again!

57
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,430
Waiter,

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,950
are our rooms ready?

59
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,920
They've been ready for a while.

60
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,430
Ms. Yao, the rooms are all arranged.

61
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,710
You'll be staying in the premium suite.

62
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,070
I'm going to rest now.

63
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,650
Alright.

64
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,600
Mr. Yang,

65
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,200
the rooms are arranged.

66
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,590
I'll go assign the rooms to the juniors.

67
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,080
Okay.

68
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,510
Come with me.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,270
How's the investigation going?

70
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,150
Any new leads?

71
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,750
Nothing suspicious so far.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,070
I deliberately made a scene

73
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,530
when I came here this time.

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,370
They'll definitely

75
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,360
take the bait.

76
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,510
What do you mean?

77
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,040
Would you let others

78
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,659
harm your interests?

79
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,950
Luring the snake out of its hole?

80
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,530
Waiter!

81
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:55,770
Coming.

82
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,250
What can I do for you?

83
00:05:59,250 --> 00:05:59,680
Come.

84
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,720
Alright.

85
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,350
-Thank you.
-Go ahead.

86
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,510
Then I won't disturb your discussion.

87
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,660
I'll head upstairs.

88
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,800
Mr. Yang,

89
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,250
this Miss Yang

90
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,430
is a young girl,

91
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,430
and she keeps pestering you.

92
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,630
It's not really appropriate, isn't it?

93
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,430
How about I drive her away?

94
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,850
You won't get the upper hand with her.

95
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,280
Just let her be.

96
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,890
Senior,

97
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,550
is this an attack of evil thoughts?

98
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,050
It wouldn't act up so quickly.

99
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,590
You're sweating heavily and losing fluids.

100
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,600
You probably took a laxative by mistake.

101
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,390
A laxative?

102
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,070
From my experience,

103
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,370
I'd say there's laxative in this teapot.

104
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,140
What should I do?

105
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,040
Don't worry.

106
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
You'll feel better
once the effect wears off.

107
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,560
I figure

108
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,830
if you make one or two
more trips to the toilet,

109
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,690
you'll be fine.

110
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,450
You're so useless!

111
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,600
I...

112
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,510
Haven't I warned you
about the consequences

113
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,860
if you provoke me again?

114
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,070
How dare you slip me a laxative?

115
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,600
Aren't you afraid of dying?

116
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,390
Stop pretending.

117
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,410
The waiter confessed everything.

118
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,240
So what if I did?

119
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,200
Yang Qing is right next door.

120
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,400
Aren't you afraid he'll come to save me?

121
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,270
Stop!

122
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,679
-Yao Fu from Yunmen wants to kill me!
-Stop!

123
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,360
Yao Fu from Yunmen wants to kill me!

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,320
Help!

125
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
-Yao Fu from Yunmen wants to kill me!
-Stop!

126
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,250
Who said I want to kill you?

127
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,630
Ms. Yao,

128
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,310
don't stoop to Miss Yang's level.

129
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,510
She's actually no match for you.

130
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,110
Jiang Yan,

131
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,520
don't forget,

132
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,630
she started it.

133
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,550
Yao,

134
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,590
this is the new lipstick I just bought.

135
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,320
I think it suits you really well.

136
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,430
Would you like to try it?

137
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,160
No, thanks.

138
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,510
I just love how unpretentious you are.

139
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,800
Yao,

140
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,770
I heard the east market is really lively.

141
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,220
Let me take you there for a stroll.

142
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,910
No, thanks.

143
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,200
Yao,

144
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,730
I think the dresses from Tianxiu Workshop
would look great on you.

145
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,790
I'll buy one for you.

146
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,570
No, thanks.

147
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,850
I have enough clothes.

148
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,840
Yao,

149
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,120
I noticed you don't have many accessories
on your head.

150
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,000
The accessories
from Jade Pavilion suit you perfectly.

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,200
I'll take you to buy some.

152
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,850
No, thanks.

153
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,720
Let's go.

154
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,910
-Let's go.
-Let go of me!

155
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,630
Let's go. Come on.

156
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,440
Let's go, let's go.

157
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,570
Come on, my dear Yao.

158
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,480
Let's go!

159
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,830
Why does Miss Yang
seem like a completely different person?

160
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,110
Should I inform Mr. Yang?

161
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,480
Manager.

162
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,810
Bring out all your beautiful clothes.

163
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,470
Right away!

164
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,880
Yao, the clothes here are so beautiful.

165
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,630
Go and try some on.

166
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,150
No need.

167
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,270
Just try them on. Come on.

168
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,670
Let's go.

169
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,870
Hurry, hurry.

170
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,180
Yao, let me see, let me see.

171
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,770
Yao, you look so beautiful.

172
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,290
You're so beautiful!

173
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,980
Since when did
the Saintess and the Chief's wife

174
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,790
become so close?

175
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,100
This outfit suits you perfectly.

176
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,830
Let me see, let me see.

177
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,750
Let me take a look.

178
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,010
Yao, you are so pretty.

179
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,550
This outfit suits you perfectly.

180
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,910
You look like a goddess.

181
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,720
I like you so much, Yao.

182
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,900
Yao,

183
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,660
shall we try on another outfit?

184
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,760
Don't say no, Yao.

185
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,120
How's the preparation going?

186
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,630
Everything is ready for tonight.

187
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,600
It's just that it might be a bit difficult

188
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,120
to lure the people from Yunmen there.

189
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,320
I'll lure them there.

190
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,000
Make sure everything is well arranged.

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,730
Gold Hall Master, don't worry.

192
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,720
This one looks nice too.

193
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,960
I'll send it to Yao.

194
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,390
Fan Hao?

195
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:15,980
Saintess.

196
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,640
Why are you here?

197
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,190
Come in.

198
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,630
I was worried you'd be all alone

199
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,550
and helpless.

200
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,120
Just say what you need to say.

201
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,860
I need to deliver something to Yao.

202
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,600
Yao?

203
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,330
Yao Fu?

204
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,420
Yes, what about it?

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,660
Yang Qing is hard to deal with,

206
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,760
so you went for Yao Fu instead.

207
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,260
Brilliant.

208
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,200
As expected of the Saintess.

209
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,240
You're truly brilliant.

210
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,030
What are you talking about?

211
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,270
Saintess,
you suddenly got so close to Yao Fu.

212
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,240
Isn't it to get the Sun Blade?

213
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,050
Don't you think

214
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,380
Yao is very kind?

215
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,130
Why would I go against her?

216
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,120
Did I hear that right?

217
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,750
Saintess,

218
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,290
that's Yao Fu.

219
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,130
The Yao Fu who almost got you killed!

220
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,720
Yao,

221
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,780
this is the new lipstick I just bought.

222
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,580
I think it suits you really well.

223
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,750
Would you like to try it?

224
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,410
No, thanks.

225
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,510
I just love how unpretentious you are.

226
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,180
Yao,

227
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,120
you look so beautiful.

228
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,910
This outfit suits you perfectly.

229
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,240
You look like a goddess.

230
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,520
I like you so much, Yao.

231
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,790
How did I become good friends with her?

232
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,320
Right.

233
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,610
I even bought her clothes.

234
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,420
Am I dreaming?

235
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,390
Dreaming?

236
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,120
I saw it myself that day.

237
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,870
You really did treat Yao Fu differently.

238
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,200
You had her try on clothes

239
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,530
and praised her beauty.

240
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,550
Others would think

241
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,880
you two have been close friends for years.

242
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,430
I was wondering

243
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,840
why I felt kind of off today.

244
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,280
This matter is indeed strange.

245
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,520
Let me investigate.

246
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,100
If she really used
dirty tricks against me,

247
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,900
I'll make her wish she were dead.

248
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,120
Yao Fu,

249
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,670
did you drug me?

250
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,870
How could I do

251
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,640
such a despicable thing?

252
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,560
It must have been you.

253
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,030
You...

254
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,390
You...

255
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,200
Yao,

256
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,320
I think something's wrong with me.

257
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,700
Did you not sleep well last night?

258
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,910
Maybe.

259
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,320
Then go get some rest.

260
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,840
But...

261
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,390
Go on.

262
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,660
I'll be going then.

263
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,420
Saintess, what's going on?

264
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,320
What do you mean?

265
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,610
Didn't you go to teach Yao Fu a lesson?

266
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,220
Did you forget?

267
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,020
Did she drug you?

268
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,870
Yao is beautiful and kind-hearted.

269
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,330
There's no way
she'd do something like that.

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,200
How about I get a doctor for you?

271
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,000
Something's wrong.

272
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:55,910
Saintess,

273
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,250
do you remember

274
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,770
how Yao Fu seduced
the Chief and forced you off the cliff,

275
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,170
which led to the downfall
of Shengyue Sect?

276
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,900
Try to remember it.

277
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,810
That's right.

278
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,200
Yao Fu is my enemy.

279
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,349
She killed my only family member

280
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,550
and even killed me with her own hands.

281
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:15,950
Right.

282
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,829
Yao? Bah!

283
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,020
She's obviously a witch.

284
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,720
Exactly.

285
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,170
No, that's not right.

286
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,400
Yao is a good person.

287
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,350
She's always been kind to me.

288
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,720
Why does my head hurt so much?

289
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,320
You... What happened to you?

290
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,780
Sain... Saintess,

291
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,680
what happened to you?

292
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,440
Sit down, sit down.

293
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,070
What's wrong?

294
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,800
I feel dizzy.

295
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,390
Sir, I just came in to bring some tea,

296
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,240
and this young lady
doesn't seem to be feeling well.

297
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,590
Should I call a doctor?

298
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,670
Miss Yang, are you alright?

299
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,980
My head hurts so much.

300
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,270
My head hurts so much.

301
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,170
What's wrong with you? Tell me.

302
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,040
I don't know what's going on.

303
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,110
I should hate Yao Fu,

304
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,970
but every time I see her,

305
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,070
I can't help but listen to what she says.

306
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,070
Think carefully.

307
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,440
What exactly happened?

308
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,830
I have to go ask her.

309
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,070
Miss Yang? Miss Yang!

310
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,900
Who is it?

311
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,640
It's me.

312
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,770
Senior?

313
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,330
Miss Yang fainted.

314
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,940
Junior, don't you have anything to say?

315
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,830
She fainted?

316
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,480
How come she fainted?

317
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,240
Before she passed out,

318
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,010
she said she wanted to ask you something.

319
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,890
What does Miss Yang's fainting

320
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
have to do with me?

321
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,440
You've always been at odds with her.

322
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,570
Why did her attitude

323
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,370
toward you

324
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,600
change so much today?

325
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
I don't know.

326
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,670
Do you really not know

327
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,460
or did you do something

328
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,850
you shouldn't have?

329
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,120
Senior,
are you going to have a falling out

330
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,060
with me over Wang Yue?

331
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,200
Junior, you've been undercover
in Shengyue Sect for years.

332
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,960
Your martial skills haven't improved,

333
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,090
but you've picked up

334
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,670
quite a few shady tricks.

335
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,140
Senior, make yourself clear.

336
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,830
Do you dare say
there's nothing wrong with this?

337
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,510
Fine.

338
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,560
Since you don't want to answer,

339
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,000
I won't force you.

340
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,160
But tomorrow,

341
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,990
I want to see
Yang Wangyue back to her normal self.

342
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,750
Otherwise,

343
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,750
I'll personally remind you

344
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,610
of Yunmen Sect's rules
on behalf of the Sect Leader.

345
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,200
Junior,

346
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,730
it's been quite a few days.

347
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,790
How long will you
keep acting on your own will?

348
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,610
I'm telling you,

349
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,160
you can't use Fusheng Spell anymore.

350
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,640
Otherwise, your life won't last long.

351
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,480
What happened to Master will be your fate.

352
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,550
Didn't you say that once I got both
the Sun and Moon Blades,

353
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,050
I'd be able to suppress the evil thoughts?

354
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,240
I can't make a move
without getting rid of Wang Yue first.

355
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,180
Your condition is very unstable right now.

356
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,040
Don't use Fusheng Spell anymore.

357
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,200
Oh no, I think it's broken.

358
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,220
Master treasured it the most
when he was alive.

359
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,260
Do you think I don't know that?

360
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,550
But maybe it's not a bad thing.

361
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,150
It's a good thing
that the bracelet has now broken.

362
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,070
You can't use Fusheng Spell for now.

363
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,090
Take this chance to go get the two blades

364
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,640
and stop dwelling on the past.

365
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,510
Can it be fixed?

366
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,110
I'll find a way.

367
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Just wait for me.

368
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,270
Stop pretending.

369
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,350
Stop pretending.

370
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,510
Mr. Yang,

371
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,270
have I been asleep long?

372
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,760
Do you remember what happened before?

373
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,370
Let me think.

374
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,860
That damned Yao Fu.

375
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,440
How dare she control me with dark magic?

376
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,310
This time,
I'm definitely going to kill her.

377
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,640
Can you really beat her?

378
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,700
I have plenty of ways to kill her.

379
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,460
Then go.

380
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
She should be in her room right now.

381
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,320
You're still on her side?

382
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,190
Have you calmed down now?

383
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,680
Can you listen to me now?

384
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,210
This time,
it was indeed Junior Yao's fault.

385
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,510
I've already given her
a good scolding on your behalf.

386
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,470
If she does it again in the future,

387
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,670
I won't go easy on her.

388
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,830

389
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,400

390
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,070
I really don't know
you've been causing her trouble

391
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,530
both openly and secretly?

392
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,160
I... I just can't stand Yao Fu.

393
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,310
But since you said so,

394
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,350
I'll let her go this time.

395
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,200
It's only because I like you.

396
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,600
I'll do whatever you say.

397
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,790

398
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,410
can we have an honest conversation?

399

What exactly do you like about me?

400
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,510
I like that you're skilled
in martial arts.

I still like you.

404
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,590
And?

405
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,100
Besides what you said,

406
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,210
am I worthless in every other way?

407
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,180
Your swordsmanship
looks especially graceful.

408
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,620
That's all?

409
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,380
Miss Yang,

410
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,830
you're unconventional
and do things your own way,

411
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,060
which is the opposite of me.

412
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,720
We're really not a good match.

413
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,960
Besides,

414
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,010
you like good-looking people.

415
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,850
I'm not the best-looking one.

416
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,760

417
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,520

418
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,640
You'd better

419
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,930

420
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,640
From now on, you should...

425
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,660

427

you're exactly my type in every way.

439
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,720
I like men

440
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,590
who are a head taller than me,
so when I lift my head

441
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,390
and wrap my arms
around their neck, I can kiss them.

442
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,310

but act quickly,

448
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,200
and even look good when they're angry.

452
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,960
Should I die just to make you

453
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,000
stop liking me?

454
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,960
If you really want me to give up,

455
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640

A group of people showed up at the tavern.

463

464
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,540

to check it out.

as they went upstairs for drinks.

472
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,200
When we passed by,

473
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,640
we deliberately glanced at the black bags

474
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,750
and heard human voices.

475
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,950
So we called you here.

476

might run away,

Mr. Yang, let me go in with you too.

There was no way you could've noticed.

561
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Mr. Yang must've sensed something.

562
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,790
If we hadn't left first,

563
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,320
we would've been wiped out.

564
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,240
Fortunately,

565
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,950
Shang Huai and the others only suffered
minor injuries.

566
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,070
Shang Huai's fine.

567
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,480
He just needed some simple bandaging.

568
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,040
But Ling Xiao and the others…

569
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,880
the doctors said
they're not seriously hurt,

570
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,680
but they still haven't woken up.

571
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,850
Go change the water.

572
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,890
I'll take a look.

573
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,030
Yes.

574
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,560
Junior.

575
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,750
Yunmen must have offended someone.

576
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,270
They actually used Ghost Scent poison.

577
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,640
Ghost Scent poison?

578
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,420
Is that what's keeping them unconscious?

579
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,660
The Ghost Scent is
the deadliest poison of Shengyue Sect.

580
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,590
In the early stages,

581
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,480
normal doctors can't detect anything.

582
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,810
Those with strong inner strength

583
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,590
simply lose their ability to use it,

584
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,920
while those with weaker cultivation

585
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,830
just fall into a coma.

586
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,880
As the poison reaches the internal organs,

587
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,510
they grow weaker and weaker.

588
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,880
By the time a doctor notices anything,

589
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,330
it'll be too late.

590
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,810
Then how can I save them?

591
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,040
Find Lingyin.

592
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,920
She made the poison,

593
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,580
so she must have the antidote.

594
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,360
Wait.

595
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,450
Junior.

596
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,110
Time is running out.

597
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,640
Why do you care about
these Yunmen disciples?

598
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,960
Are you trying to save them

599
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,550
to leave a good impression on Yunmen

600
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,200
so that you can
get the Sun Blade more easily?

601
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,640
But that doesn't make sense either.

602
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,830
You used Fusheng Spell

603
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,310
to make Yuan Yingxing
fall in love with you,

604
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,770
and that led to the downfall
of the Shengyue Sect.

605
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,180
Lingyin hates you to the bone.

606
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,580
Why would she help you?

607
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,880
Let me think.

608
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,790
Lingyin?

609
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,160
The Ghost Scent?

610
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,680
Lingyin?

611
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,340
Here's some good news for you.

612
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,350
You're really lucky

613
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,490
to have a reliable senior like me.

614
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,400
You? Reliable?

615
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,070
Listen.

616
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,990
I spent a fortune to fix it

617
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,070
for you out of respect for Master.

618
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,750
Thanks.

619
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,110
You can't use that spell
recklessly anymore,

620
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,350
or you'll be done for.

621
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,400
Okay, okay.

622
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,570
Mr. Yang, you're awake?

623
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,840
How did you get poisoned by Ghost Scent?

624
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,970
I got poisoned by Ghost Scent?

625
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
Where are we?

626
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,240
This is downstream of Qinglai River.

627
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,000
We need to leave before dark.

628
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,200
Mr. Yang,

629
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,700
can you still walk?

630
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,600
I was poisoned by Ghost Scent

631
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,690
and need to find the antidote.

632
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,540
If you're okay,

633
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,490
we should split up.

634
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,140
This attack was aimed at me.

635
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,240
It had nothing to do with you.

636
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,920
You don't need to put yourself in danger.

637
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,680
Mr. Yang,

638
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,520
in your condition,

639
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,200
how could I leave you behind?

640
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,480
Besides,

641
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,590
I've finally caught you in trouble.

642
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,510
This is the perfect chance
for a beauty to save her hero.

643
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,310
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

644
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,830
But...

645
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,860
I need to find an antidote.

646
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,290
What use would you be if you came along?

647
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,440
Just be a burden?

648
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,960
Mr. Yang,

649
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,790
that's hurtful.

650
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,520
What do you mean by "burden?"

651
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,440
I...

652
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,480
actually have some connections
in Shengyue Sect.

653
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,980
Aren't you a village girl?

654
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,350
How could you have connections
in Shengyue Sect?

655
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,570
Do you remember my uncle?

656
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,300
He's a member of Shengyue Sect.

657
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,640
I'd like to see

658
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,220
how long you plan to use

659
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,790
your uncle as an excuse.

660
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,070
I'll use my inner energy
to regulate my breath.

661
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,750
Mr. Yang,

662
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,030
with this poison,

663
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,310
you mustn't use your inner energy.

664
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,350
It will harm you.

665
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,590
Mr. Yang,

666
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,550
how are you feeling after your rest?

667
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,480
Feeling better?

668
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,870
Aren't you...

669
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,680
afraid of dying?

670
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,590
Of course I am.

671
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,100
I'm afraid that

672
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,270
after I die, I won't see you anymore.

673
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,940
Someone is hunting me.

674
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,520
I know.

675
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,880
Then why do you still...

676
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Mr. Yang, I've thought about it.

677
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,810
If someone is after you,

678
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,490
I'll definitely protect you.

679
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,720
If both of us can't fight them off,

680
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,470
then we can at least be buried together.

681
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,810
Then everyone in the world

682
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,210
will know we're a couple.

683
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,510
Dream on.

684
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,449
Mr. Yang,

685
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,840
if you're feeling better,

686
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,000
let's keep moving.

687
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,840
I just saw

688
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,360
a house up ahead.

689
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,630
I'll help you get there.

690
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,840
Okay. Let's go.

691
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,620
Be careful.

692
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,360
The Chief ordered us

693
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,690
to kill Yang Qing,
no matter life or death.

694
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:38,469
Yes!

695
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,900
[Chengping Garden]

696
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,370
Who told you to go after Yang Qing?

697
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,560
Young Chief,

698
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,750
Yunmen has been tracking

699
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,280
all the way to Qinglai City.

700
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,590
If we don't get rid of Yang Qing,

701
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm afraid
the Chief's grand cause might...

702
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,880
There are plenty of righteous sects

703
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,280
investigating the missing children cases.

704
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,680
What threat could Yang Qing possibly pose?

705
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,840
You're deliberately targeting him

706
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,590
to oppose me.

707
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,280
We're doing our best

708
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,440
only to help the Chief

709
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,670
achieve his great cause sooner.

710
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,840
The Chief has made an order:

711
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,030
In today's martial world,

712
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,150
Yuan Yingxing and Yang Qing

713
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,350
are strong and young;

714
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,040
they will surely be the Chief's
biggest threats in the future.

715
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,880
Yuan Yingxing,
as the leader of Shengyue Sect,

716
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,010
must be eliminated.

717
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,190
As for Yang Qing,

718
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,610
if he ever conflicts
with our sect's interests,

719
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,550
he can't be spared either.

720
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,360
Nonsense!

721
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,400
Yang Qing has never

722
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,930
truly opposed our sect yet.

723
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,450
Who gave you the right to act on your own?

724
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,190
Could it be

725
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,630
that you don't respect me

726
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,710
as the Young Chief?

727
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,620
We dare not.

728
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,870
Since you don't dare,

729
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,230
then tell me—

730
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,100
where are you heading?

731
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,640
What's wrong?

732
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,820
You're afraid to tell me?

733
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,650
You're leaving the city

734
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,190
just to kill Yang Qing
while he's poisoned.

735
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,630
I,

736
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,930
I, Lu Xuanxuan,

737
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,880
as the Young Chief of Biluo Valley,

738
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,320
order you not to harm Yang Qing.

739
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,320
But if you don't get rid of Yang Qing…

740
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,070
But nothing!

741
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,710
Are you all clueless?

742
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,830
You can't kill Yang Qing,

743
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,510
but there's still Yao Fu,
Shang Huai, Jiang Yan,

744
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,150
and all other disciples in Yunmen.

745
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,630
But they're all…

746
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,400
What?

747
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,070
I'll say it again:

748
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,400
you're not allowed to leave the city

749
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,860
or so much as touch a hair
on Yang Qing's head!

750
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,000
Yes.

751
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,910
Luckily, Yang Qing,

752
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,120
I won't let anything happen to you.

753
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,630
If the Chief finds out you did this,

754
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,290
do you think

755
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,860
he'll let you go?

756
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,680
You're not to tell

757
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,060
my father about my business.

758
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,500
Yang Qing is no good.

759
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,260
Don't fall for his tricks.

760
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,200
Let go of me, you ugly freak!

761
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,230
You're just a traitor to Shengyue Sect,

762
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,590
a rat that everyone wants to get rid of.

763
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,670
Who are you to boss me around?

764
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,120
The Chief has promised that

765
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,130
as long as I kill Yuan Yingxing,

766
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,820
he'll arrange for you to marry me.

767
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,240
Impossible!

768
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,370
My father would never do that.

769
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,930
Why did I betray Shengyue Sect,

770
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,190
endure the torment
of ten thousand poison bugs,

771
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,980
and steal our sect's secret manual
to give it to the Chief?

772
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,730
Was it all

773
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,980
just for myself?

774
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,280
He told you to kill Yuan Yingxing,

775
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,880
then go and kill him properly.

776
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,940
He's the biggest threat to my father.

777
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,150
I'm killing him for you.
Don't you understand?

778
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,030
Power, wealth, fame—

779
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,440
whatever you want,

780
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,020
I can give it all to you.

781
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,290
What did I do wrong?

782
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,090
Why can you only see Yang Qing

783
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,510
but not me?

784
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,120
Let go of me!

785
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,290
What are you doing?

786
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,150
Ugly freak.

787
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,080
Xuanxuan,

788
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,070
you'll regret

789
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,190
treating me like this.

790
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,110
Miss, sir,

791
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,970
what's going on here?

792
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:37,880
Sir,

793
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,070
last night,

794
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,820
we accidentally fell into Qinglai River

795
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,950
and were swept here.

796
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,240
Could we stay here for the night?

797
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,010
Well...

798
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,230
Grandpa,

799
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,800
it's so late already.

800
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,200
Let's let them stay here for the night.

801
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,390
Our place...

802
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,280
Sir,

803
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,960
we're sorry for the trouble my husband
and I have caused you.

804
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,090
Thank you very much.

805
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:01,950
Come in.

806
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,810
Let's go.

807
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,940
My surname is Zhang.

808
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,710
I live here with my granddaughter Tong.

809
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,480
Usually there aren't many people
around here.

810
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,760
There was a snow disaster
at the end of last year.

811
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,110
People suffered, refugees increased.

812
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,750
Before, Shengyue Sect kept the peace here.

813
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,020
Since Shengyue Sect is gone,

814
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,960
chaos has risen.

815
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,190
Mr. Zhang.

816
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,180
So it was Shengyue Sect

817
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,520
who used to protect
the people around here?

818
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,440
Yes.

819
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,210
The Shengyue Sect's Guardians
often led patrols,

820
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,870
so ordinary thieves
didn't dare cause trouble.

821
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,880
You'll have to

822
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,080
make do with staying here for the night.

823
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,280
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

824
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,040
Sir,

825
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,590
you seem to be injured.

826
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,550
I have some medicine for wounds.

827
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,550
If you don't mind,

828
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,760
I can go get it for you

829
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,200
so your wife can apply it.

830
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,330
We're not...

831
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,920
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

832
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,510
Grandpa, what did you just say

833
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,850
that made this lady so happy?

834
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,380
That's not something kids
should be asking.

835
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,420
Mr. Yang,

836
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,320
just now the old man said we're a couple.

837
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,510
We actually do look like a married couple.

838
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,630
Zhang's old.

839
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,070
His eyesight probably isn't great.

840
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,680
Yang Wangyue.

841
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,280
Call me Wangyue.

842
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,880
What are you

843
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,800
trying to do now?

844
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,500
I'm not trying to do anything.

845
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,690
I'm just applying medicine for you.

846
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,960
Applying medicine?

847
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,960
Mr. Yang,

848
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,670
you have no idea.

849
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,310
The wounds on your back are quite serious.

850
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,900
The skin is a completely different color.

851
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,600
Even if I treat it now,

852
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780
it'll definitely

853
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,760
leave scars.

854
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,630
You know,

855
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,620
this is

856
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,400
the mark of our love.

857
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,150
The… mark of our love?

858
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,000
Yes.

859
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,800
After you get married someday,

860
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,640
when your new bride asks you

861
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,970
where the scars on your back came from,

862
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,840
you can't possibly say

863
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,120
you got them for another woman, right?

864
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,960
I'm the one who caused your injury,

865
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,310
so I can offer myself to you.

866
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,880
Marry me.

867
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,530
Miss Yang, please don't worry about it.

868
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,100
If my future wife minds,

869
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,460
then…

870
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,210
I'd rather stay single forever.

871
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,030
What did you say?

872
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,300
You'd rather never marry

873
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,400
than marry me?

874
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,470
Wait a second.

875
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,110
I haven't finished applying the medicine.

876
00:42:59,110 --> 00:42:59,800
Yeah.

877
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,900
You haven't finished applying the medicine,
and you're already putting your hands all over me.

878
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,060
We each saved the other once.

879
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,960
That should be enough
for a lifetime commitment.

880
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,030
I...

881
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,130
Can I kiss you?

882
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:15,810
No.

883
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,230
Why did my kiss make him faint again?

884
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:39,330
[Jishi Clinic]

885
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,180
Your medicine.

886
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:41,800
Thank you.

887
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,440
It's about to rain outside.

888
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,920
Why don't you wait a while before leaving?

889
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,520
It's fine.

890
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,000
My husband is waiting for me at home

891
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,200
to brew medicine and treat his illness.

892
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,220
Take care then.

893
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,150
Yuan Yingxing?

894
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,550
Yuan Yingxing!

895
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,800
Yuan Yingxing!

896
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,800
That can't be right.

897
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,630
He's already been
locked up in the dungeon.

898
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,290
How could he possibly be here?

899
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,770
I need to get the Sun Blade
as soon as possible

900
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,960
to save Yuan Yingxing.
